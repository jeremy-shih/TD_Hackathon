At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mike Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tori. Good morning, and welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in the filings with the SEC.","This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Fran goes through these results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the first quarter of 2016 we reported earnings of $1.06 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pre-tax loss of $165 million for a pension mark-to-market adjustment due to settlement accounting. We expect settlement accounting to impact earnings in each of the remaining quarters in 2016. Additionally, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $142 million on a spectrum license transaction.","On an after-tax basis the loss on settlement accounting amounted to $102 million or $0.02 per share. And the gain on the spectrum transaction amounted to $88 million or $0.02 per share, effectively offsetting each other. Including the effect of these nonoperational items, earnings per share of $1.06 in the first quarter, compared to $1.02 per share a year ago, or a growth rate of 3.9%. There were no special items of a non-operational nature in the first quarter of 2015.","As a reminder, our Wireline results for the first quarter included the operations from the three states that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016. As we have done over the past year, we have recognized a full quarter benefit of approximately $229 million pre-tax or about $0.03 per share due to these assets being classified as held for sale. This compares to $146 million pre-tax benefit or $0.02 per share that we recognized in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, the operations of AOL are not included in prior period results.","With that I will now turn the call over to Fran.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone.","We remain confident in our three-tier strategy for long-term growth, which is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through global platforms in video and Internet of Things, and create incremental revenue opportunities in applications and content.","In terms of progress on this multi-tier strategy we are focused on network leadership and operating efficiency, while we develop new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things, leveraging our capabilities in the United States and scaling our platforms globally. We are also developing a portfolio of unique content targeted at the Millennial Generation so that we can capitalize on the opportunity transforming mobile.","At the network connectivity layer we consistently invest in our 4G LTE network to accommodate growth in data usage and enable customers to experience an unmatched level of connectivity. National studies continue to recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. Having the best network does matter, as reflected in our strong customer retention that we will discuss later.","We are enhancing capacity and coverage by effectively managing our spectrum, further densifying areas of significant usage and implementing a number of optimization techniques, such as carrier aggregation. Approximately 92% of our total data traffic is now on the LTE network. The amount of data on the network increased at a rate of approximately 50% over the prior year.","Over the long term densification of our wireless network, particularly in urban and concentrated usage areas, is required to add capacity to manage these growing consumption trends, as well as to preposition ourselves for the 5G technology of the future.","A key element of this densification strategy is access to fiber. During the quarter we announced our intention to acquire XO Communications, which will provide us the opportunity to deepen and expand our fiber assets nationwide, as well as to lease millimeter wave spectrum for 5G testing purposes with the option to buy.","We are also very excited about the announcement made last week to deploy a new fiber platform within the city of Boston that will support wireless and wireline technologies to consumers and enterprises across the city in a network efficient way. This approach gives us tremendous flexibility to innovate, develop and deliver services with a mix of technologies over the same fiber assets.","In terms of 5G our technical testing is going well. And there is a strong interest and commitment from members of the 5G Forum to prepare for fixed wireless commercial pilots using the technology next year.","Improving our operating cost structure is a priority. We will continue work on our operating model, and are confident that we can improve efficiencies as we have done in the past. We remain focused on cost reductions throughout the entire business, and are making progress in driving efficiencies, reducing overhead costs, and streamlining support. We have several initiatives that have already been taken and others that we plan to implement for 2016 and beyond.","In the fourth quarter 2015 we restructured our Wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. Additionally, we continue to look at opportunities across all lines of business. You are starting to see these benefits in the first quarter.","Overall, consolidated head count since the end of 2015 is down approximately 3%, as we continue to increase the efficiency of our operations. We expect to receive additional savings from a number of initiatives during the second half of 2016. We continue to streamline business support functions utilizing our Lean Six Sigma approach across the business to reduce redundancy, drive consistency, and improve speed of delivery in the market.","Across Wireless we have identified opportunities to gain further efficiencies within the store operations, call center operations, and supply chain processes by simplifying our execution model, while improving the overall customer experience. Network-related opportunities exist for consolidation and elimination of unnecessary facilities to gain synergies and reduce costs.","Always more work to be done here, but we are pleased with the continued progress.","Our networks and operating model also enable us to grow and expand our revenue stream through new ecosystems, platforms, content, and solution layers. We are enhancing our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution, and advertising platforms across all screens.","The video platform continues to expand, as we add more unique content that appeals to Millennial audiences, such as the partnership recently announced with Hearst. Our joint venture with Hearst includes developing two initial channels of video programming, targeting the digital Millennial audience to be distributed across multiple distribution platforms.","Additionally, we signed an agreement to acquire and equity stake in AwesomenessTV, and entered into an agreement to create new premium content service featuring short-form mobile content that will launch initially on go90.","Just over the past few days we announced the acquisition of a 50% ownership in Complex Media with Hearst. The investments in AwesomenessTV and Complex Media position us as partial owners in the number one digital media brands for young Millennials.","On the go90 application we remain encouraged by the viewership of go90. But as we have said before, we are still in the very early stages of gaining traction and engagement. Verizon Wireless subscribers now have greater flexibility when streaming live sports, concerts, and (10:44) series content within go90 on their mobile devices, and can enjoy this content free of data charges with our FreeBee Data service. We look forward to expanding our go90 content to other media through our AOL brand and the Web later this year.","Within the Internet of Things ecosystem we continue to develop platforms and our network to take advantage of the opportunities to innovate and offer solutions that address some of the more pressing social, economic, and business challenges. We have launched our own utility, transportation, and healthcare solutions with products like Networkfleet, Grid Wide, Verizon Share, hum, and one of our newest products, Intelligent Track and Trace.","Our ThingSpace platform is set to accelerate the adoption of Internet of Things products and solutions by making it easier, faster, and more accessible to develop applications. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are growing with revenues of approximately $195 million in the quarter, a year-over-year increase of about 25%.","While we build for the future, fundamental execution and quality financial results are a top priority.","Now let's get into the first quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on slide 5. Our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy in the current market. We delivered strong operating and financial results by growing our quality customer base, expanding earnings, and generating solid free cash flow for the quarter.","Earnings per share grew 3.9%, and free cash flow was $4 billion, which enables us to invest and return value to our shareholders. Total operating revenue in the first quarter was $32.2 billion, an increase of 0.6%.","AOL had its best first quarter revenues in the last 5 years, driven by growth in the platform layer. If we exclude AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line revenue declined by 1.5% for the quarter. This was due to lower wireless phone activations under device installment sales, lower upgrades, and the continued migration of our customer base to unsubsidized pricing.","In Wireline the higher growth of Internet only activations and smaller video bundles also pressured revenue growth. As we manage through the revenue transformation in the Wireless and Wireline segments and develop new products and services, we remain focused on improving our overall cost structure to maintain our strong earnings profile.","Consistent with the prior year consolidated EBITDA totaled about $12 billion. And our EBITDA margin was 37.2% in the quarter, which was driven by our ability to manage costs and expand margin even with the pressure on the top line.","Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide 6. Cash flows from operation totaled $7.4 billion in the first quarter, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015 that was allocated to cash flow from operations.","We continued to sell device installment receivables, and received about $2 billion in gross cash proceeds from new transactions in the first quarter. We believe that the underlying quality of our device installment receivables has been instrumental in helping the securitization program be so successful. Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $4 billion.","We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model, with a priority to invest for the future. Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, which included approximately $150 million related to the markets that were sold to Frontier. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, down about 9.5% from a year ago, which was the result of the timing of investments. We fully anticipate capital spending for the year to be within our guided range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.","Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $109.9 billion of total debt, net debt of $104 billion, and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2 times.","We completed the sale of properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016. The pre-tax proceeds from the sale were used to repay outstanding debt in the current quarter. In early April, we already executed tender offers and early redemptions to repay over $10 billion in debt to reduce our total debt balance.","Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide 7. In Wireless, we posted a balanced quarter of quality connections growth and margin expansion. Postpaid net adds totaled 640,000 in a seasonally low volume quarter, excluding all wholesale connections, including IoT.","Net phone additions were negative 8,000 for the quarter, as compared to a negative 138,000 a year ago, a significant improvement over the prior year, driven by customer retention. Retail postpaid churn was 0.96%, down 7 basis points for the quarter and sequentially consistent. We have taken many actions to improve and simplify our customer experience and provide the best network, which have resulted in improved customer loyalty and satisfaction.","We ended the quarter with 112.6 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base grew 4.4% to 107.2 million. And our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, consistent with the prior year. The majority of gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets.","The composition of our 640,000 postpaid net adds was very strong. Within the postpaid net adds, we added 452,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 284,000 net new smartphones. The remainder of the offset in phone net adds are basic devices.","Tablet net adds totaled 507,000. Other connected devices of 176,000 were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being a large contributor. We are beginning to see traction and increasing demand for the hum product, which we introduced last year. Net prepaid devices declined by 177,000.","Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 9.9 million in the quarter, down about 3.9%. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the quarter with 73.8 million smartphones in total. And our smartphone penetration increased to 85% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 81% of our retail postpaid connections base.","As expected, seasonality and lower customer demand for new devices contributed to the softer volumes of upgrades in the first quarter. About 5.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter, which represents a decline from the prior year of 70 basis points.","Now let's review Wireless profitability and revenue on slide 9. In the Wireless segment, profitability and cash flows were driven by our high quality retail postpaid customer base. In terms of profitability, we generated $10.2 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 1.7%, and had an EBITDA margin of 46.2%, an increase of 140 basis points.","Total Wireless operating revenues declined 1.5% in the quarter, to $22 billion. Service revenue of $16.8 billion declined 6.2% for the quarter, as the result of the continued migration to unsubsidized pricing. Equipment revenue increased to approximately $4 billion, up 17.2% for the first quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.6% in the first quarter.","We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured, as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing, and that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases. Overall, about 48% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing plan. As we discussed previously, we believe service revenue will flatten its decline mid-year, when the base of our customers on the unsubsidized pricing plans exceeds 50%. Over the course of the next year, we expect the decline in service revenue will slow, ultimately turning positive by the end of 2017.","The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to about 68% in the first quarter, compared with about 67% in the fourth quarter. The first quarter take rate fell below our expectation of more than 70%, due to customer preference, especially on upgrades, which contributed to lower equipment revenue growth.","We expect the second quarter take rate for device installment plans to be around 70%. During the quarter, 5.5 million phones were activated on a device installment payment plan. We have about 28.8 million device installment phone connections in total, representing 33% of our postpaid phone base.","Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review on our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on slide 10. In the Consumer business FiOS remains the driver of revenue growth, and now represents about 81% of consumer revenue.","In the first quarter consumer revenue grew 0.8%. Mass markets, which include small business, was consistent with the prior year. During the quarter FiOS total revenue grew 5% with consumer FiOS revenue growing at 4.7%.","The increased penetration of Quantum and the desire for higher data speeds are the primary drivers of the FiOS growth. At the end of the quarter about 78% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. Additionally, the increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds is evident, as about 60% of our consumer FiOS Internet sales are opting for speeds at 100 megabits and above.","FiOS Internet subscriber growth remained strong in the first quarter. In broadband we added 98,000 net FiOS customers for the quarter, which was consistent with the fourth quarter. Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 10,000 in the quarter.","In FiOS Video we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter, which improved from 20,000 net customers in the fourth quarter. The consumer revenue growth trajectory continues to decline, as customers downsize their existing bundles, and core voice services are no longer desired.","We introduced the next generation of our Custom TV offering during the quarter, expanding the content and value provided by the original Custom TV offer to appeal to even wider range of value conscience customers. Customers now have a choice between selecting an Essentials plan and a Sports & More plan, with the option to select up to three additional packs.","The demand for Custom TV remains strong. And during the first quarter Custom TV represented about 38% of our FiOS Video sales. Due to the lower price of the bundle and the lower content costs associated with the Custom TV, a Custom TV customer generates less revenue but contributes more margin than the traditional FiOS Video customer.","Let's turn to slide 11 and cover Enterprise and Wholesale, as well as the Wireline segment in total. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.4% for the quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year due to strong cost control. Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment declined 1.9% in the quarter.","In the Enterprise space secular and economic challenges remain. But we are seeing stabilization in the rate of decline on a constant currency basis. In the first quarter Global Enterprise revenue declined 3.1%. On a constant currency basis it was down about 2.6%. In our Global Wholesale business revenues declined 4% in the first quarter. Trends for both Enterprise and Global Wholesale remain consistent with 2015 results.","Let's move next to slide 12 for an overview of the Wireline segment, post the Frontier transaction. Now that we have completed the sale of our Florida, Texas, and California properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016, the historical results associated with these three markets will be included in Corporate and Other, beginning with the second quarter results.","For illustrative purposes on a preliminary basis we have shown fiscal year 2014 and 2015 and first quarter 2015 and 2016 recast results. We will also provide nine quarters of recast financials for the Wireline segment, excluding the three markets, later in the second quarter.","Recast total revenue for the first quarter 2016, excluding these three markets, was approximately $8 billion, which is comparable to the prior year. As previously stated, we think we have tremendous opportunity to further penetrate the remaining properties from Massachusetts to Virginia with our fiber infrastructure and FiOS products.","Recast Wireline margin excluding these markets decreased, as expected since these properties were more profitable that the properties that remained. Without these properties the Wireline EBITDA margin for the first quarter was approximately 19%.","We have been working on our post-Frontier transaction cost structure as part of our overall cost initiatives outlined earlier. As we have stated before we are committed to offset the financial impact of this transaction, including the stranded costs at the consolidated level. Our efforts in this area can be seen in the fact that the recast Wireline margin expanded by approximately 200 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 to first quarter 2016. We recognize that some of the efficiencies and future savings we need in order to offset the impact this year are dependent on the timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.","Let's move next to slide 13 for an overview of our liability management. Subsequent to the Vodafone transaction and at year-end 2014, total debt was approximately $113 billion. And at the end of the first quarter 2016 our total debt was approximately $110 billion. We have been actively managing our debt portfolio entering into the second quarter of 2016.","In early April 2016 we utilized Frontier proceeds plus cash on hand to complete tender offers and early redemptions of $10.7 billion of face value debt with a cash outlay of $12.5 billion. Our strategy focused on retiring higher cost debt with a range of maturities through 2043, thereby improving our maturity profile and achieving lower borrowing costs for the future.","The Frontier related tax obligations, which are payable in the second half of 2016, and our remaining debt maturity of $2.3 billion in September are both very manageable within our 2016 funding plan. Through our liability management efforts and our future funding plans, we are on track to return to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by 2018 to 2019 timeframe.","At the same time we are continuing to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. Since the Vodafone transaction closed, we have maintained a strong balance sheet, invested in new businesses, improved our debt profile, and returned value to our shareholders, both through an accelerated share repurchase program and through a dividend increase each year.","Let's move next to slide 14 for our summary and 2016 priorities. We are off to a strong start in 2016, as we executed on the fundamentals of the business, growing high value customers, delivering strong financial and operating results, and generating free cash flows. Our results demonstrate that we are well positioned to compete in a competitive environment, while effectively implementing our strategies. We remain focused on enhancing our networks and platforms to position us for future growth and on further developing new ecosystems.","At the operational level we are navigating through the transition to the device installment payment model, stabilizing the trend in Wireline revenues, improving our overall cost structure, and ramping new revenue streams.","At this point in the year we continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted earnings to be a level comparable to our strong full year 2015 adjusted earnings. However, given the status of our labor contract negotiations, there will be pressure on earnings in the second quarter due to the timing of cost reductions. Depending on the progress of the negotiations we may need to update the full year guidance at a later time","With that I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Fran, thank you. Tori, we're ready to open it up for questions. If we can take the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And appreciate the color. I didn't catch it in the release. Are you guys still reporting postpaid ARPA? And if so could you break it out for us?","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. We are going to continue to report postpaid IARPA. But, Brett, we'll get that out to everybody so that you can see that.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just a separate question. You noted that you're going to be making this investment in Boston. I was hoping you could give us some thoughts around the timing of that, so we could think about how that might flow through into CapEx? And then are you thinking that there could be an opportunity to continue to expand your fiber presence, particularly as you think about densifying your wireless network? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure, Brett. Thanks. Well, I mean Boston is a unique situation. So we announced the intent to expand Fios in Boston. Understand that the LFA has to be negotiated with city council. And that is a public process that will take approximately 6 months. We have been in discussions with some broad framework, but we need to go through that process. It's also important to note that the LFA is only for video linear TV services. It is not required for broadband or 5G.","So obviously when we looked at Boston, it was a city that we needed to densify for the LTE network. So as we looked at all of our current COs around the footprint and the fiber that we already had there, it kind of was a no-brainer to us to say, we can do the fiber bill out (31:21) to expand the LTE densification. But we also can use this opportunity with only an increment of about $300 million over the next 5 years to 6 years to expand our Fios footprint.","So the $300 million, you're not even going to see it in the Wireline capital numbers. It's already there. And as far as the capital that was going to be incurred on the Wireless side of the house, that was already going to be spent, regardless of whether we expanded Fios.","So we will get to this. But we are starting to \u2013 we will start this mid-year this year for especially the 5G and 4G LTE densification. We will start the Internet capability with the passing homes. But for the video product we will have to wait to go through the LFA city council process.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Is this the last significant fiber deployment you would expect to make within your remaining footprint? Or do you think that there's an opportunity to keep doing this in the Northeast?","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think what we'll have to do, Brett, is we'll take one city at a time. Obviously we still don't have Alexandria built out or Baltimore. So if we get to a position where we believe we're going to need to invest in densification in those cities, then that's an opportunity for us to take a look at it. But at this time we're concentrating on Boston.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks for taking the question.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tori \u2013 thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. Morning, Fran. Can you just give a \u2013 provide a little bit more clarity about your comments on Q2 and the rest of the year? Is it reasonable to take the Q1 margins, that sort of recast margins in Wireline that you've provided, as a good sort of guidepost here until you get more cost savings coming through?","And maybe you can just reflect on any particular puts and takes from the strike in terms of extra costs from additional labor you might need to hire? Or conversely some cost savings? And what are you seeing so far in terms of impact on the business in terms of broadband adds, trouble reports, et cetera?","And then if you have any update on your data center evaluation sale process. Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks, Simon. All right. So on guidance first and foremost, we are absolutely confident at this point in time, based on everything that we have planned and the timing of the union contract, that we can deliver on the $3.99 compared to last year. And just to set the record here, I mean again we did not give revenue guidance. We gave EBITDA margin percent guidance, and we gave EPS guidance that would be relatively comparable to 2015.","So if you step back a second and look at earnings per share at 2015 coming in at $3.99, we have to keep in mind that $0.13 of that was from our assets held for sale. So really the comparable number is $3.86. And as we said we felt good about growing earnings back to that $3.99 through our normal operations results of the business.","So if you take that fourth quarter and move it forward. For the first quarter $1.06, so that would mean we're $0.04 ahead of the prior year. That $0.04, which is somewhat attributed to the Frontier properties for the full quarter, will reverse in the second quarter. So if you start out your baseline from last year's reported EPS of $1.04, $0.04 is taken right off the top for that.","And then as we talked there is going to be some timing on offsetting the stranded costs. And again I want to reiterate that we've always said that the stranded costs would be offset on a consolidated basis, not within total Wireline segment.","So we do have some timing here. We're looking at business transformation activities. If you look at the Verizon Wireless restructure, that was part of the overall plan to contribute and offset some of the stranded cost. So you can see, we're already looking at operational efficiencies on a consolidated basis.","But other things that we're looking at is around distribution centers and call centers. As you know, call centers are a very high turnover rate for employees. And with our decrease in calls coming in from our Wireless customers because of more online, more chat, more self-service, we will not hire as many customer call centers. And we'll achieve this through our attrition rates just naturally within the call center. So there's opportunity to reduce force just through the attrition rate.","And then if you look at our equipment volumes, since the equipment logistics system in Wireless is mostly a variable cost system, as we look to the future and the upgrade volume, which we assume will be lower, there's going to be some cost efficiencies that we gain there.","So as we look at this, there will be some timing. So Q2 will be lower than just the $0.04. But we're looking at, we will regain that in the back half of the year with some of the other things we're doing.","Now finally, obviously on this, the timing of the union agreement. We have planned for that. And if it goes longer, then we will come back in mid-year. But keep in mind that we're looking at this as a long-term agreement for both providing quality jobs for our employees and returning shareholder value to our shareholders. So that's where we stand with guidance. Hopefully that clears it up a little bit.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the second question \u2013 or the second part of your question around the strike, yeah. At this point, it's too early to tell the impacts. I mean we've deployed thousands of management employees to take on the work. We obviously always, during this period of time, fall a little bit behind on the install work. We still see good momentum coming in from a sales perspective. So there's a little bit of a backlog there, and we'll just have to work through this. But right now, really no financial impact per se in the second quarter that I'm anticipating, unless this drags on for a much longer period of time.","On the data center sale, look. I mean this is still \u2013 I would consider it exploratory. There's a lot of activity going on. But nothing at this point that I'm prepared to announce in a public forum. But we continue to explore that activity.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thanks.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tori, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. I guess two if I could. The first one, Fran, just following up on that guidance question. You highlight that, if you hadn't had the Frontier benefit last year, the earnings would have been more like $3.86.","But if I do the math on the impact that Frontier is having on 2016, if you hadn't sold the Frontier asset, the earnings would be reasonably materially higher. And my math is that the year over year earnings power of Verizon, had the Frontier assets not been part of the mix here, would have been about 10%. And Street estimates are really only looking for about 3% earnings growth next year. I was wondering if you could comment on what you see as the underlying earnings power of the Verizon business as we kind of think about next year's growth, ignoring the strike issues for a second?","And then just the second question, if I could, would be on upgrade rate. I didn't see it in the notes yet for this quarter. But obviously, reports are that it's been lower than normal. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk about how you see the cadence or the shape of the year with the iPhone 7 likely coming out in the back part of the year and the amount of upgrades you'd see by that point in time? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, David. So on earnings, look. I mean we've been pretty open about 2016. And of course we've got a lot of things going in a lot of different directions. I mean obviously, if you look at it, even with Verizon Wireless and the headwind of the revenue here and the transformation of the pricing model, we're still increasing the profitability of that business. And it's really the recurring revenue that we're focused in on, and the quality of our customers.","On the Wireline side of the house, again you see there's pressure on top line because of Custom TV and Internet only now, versus triple play. But again, we're improving the profitability of that business. So for this year, we'll stick with what we talked about on guidance. Mike and I have been pretty open \u2013 and Lowell [McAdam] \u2013 have been pretty open about 2017. We believe we will get back to a normal growth rate in 2017.","But I would not attribute it to anything that we divested or acquired. There's a lot of moving parts here, especially within the strategic portfolio, that's putting pressure on some of the bottom line. So I would not overindulge on the Frontier divestiture. I mean we've got a really good value for that, that we're going to put the cash to work, that really benefits the earnings power of this company. And that's the way I look at it.","On the upgrade rate, look. I mean if you look at year over year, we're down over 400,000 units on an upgrade rate. And obviously that had a lot of impact on the equipment revenue side. But the other thing that we're seeing is, our embedded base customers are selecting the subsidy model on an upgrade basis, which is why the overall device installment plan take rate did not meet our expectation for the quarter of 70%, and fell short to 68%.","So if you look at that, David, and look back to the earnings power, I mean you would think that the stronger uptake in device installment plan would drive more margin. But in fact, we missed that metric. We did lower. And we actually improved our margin overall at Wireless. So there is a lot of moving parts here.","But to your question of, where do I think upgrade rates are going to go. At this point, based on what we know, we think that upgrade rates will be relatively the same as 2015. I can't talk to the fourth quarter yet, because I just don't know what the devices are going to look like in our lineup at this point in time.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, Fran.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tori, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Two quick ones, if I can. One, can you comment on the FCC special access reforms? How are you thinking about that?","And then, two, the potential to borrow against handset receivables. What do you think is the cost in that market, Fran, versus the normal bond market?","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right. Thanks, Phil. So on FCC special access, look. The FCC will take action this month sometime on special access rulemaking, and if tariff investigation at a certain discount that we and other large legacy providers offer for DS1s and 3s. I mean we've reached out \u2013 we reached a deal with a lot of the CLECs in order to resolve a longstanding and contentious regulatory issue here.","Our top priority though is to ensure that our business services are on a level playing field with all the other competitors, including cable companies. We intend to work with the industry and the FCC to develop a framework for that, that applies to all competitors equally and relies on the sound public policy to determine where and when regulation is appropriate. So we'll wait to see what the FCC does here, Phil. And then we'll respond accordingly.","On the bond market and the recent press reports coming out of Bloomberg, look. We've been pretty open and public that we have been looking at an alternative financing arrangement for our installment sale receivables.","The public asset backed market is an alternative that we've explored. We've had a number of discussions. We are having discussions continuing with alternative providers and various parties. But at this point in time these are just discussions. It's something we're looking at. We're still doing a lot of analysis around it. And at this point it's just something that we continue to look at. And nothing to announce here today that we're going to change anything at this point in time.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, Fran.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tori, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Two if I could. First, as you look at the range of possible investment that you can make over the next 12 months or 24 months, is there a balance sheet debt level that investors should be keeping in mind in dollars or ratio terms that \u2013 the upper threshold for what the company is comfortable with?","And then secondly, as you look specifically at the performance of AOL since you purchased the asset, are there some examples that you could provide on ways in which Verizon has made the performance of that asset better in terms of revenue or cash flow? And how some of the recent content investment might further the performance of that asset? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So on investment side, look. I mean we've been pretty open that our main priority is to get our debt level back to an A-minus rated company. And we are on track to do that. And everything we do, that continues to be the top priority. So even with all of the M&A activity you've seen, I mean if you look back, we started this at a pre-Vodafone debt of \u2013 post-Vodafone debt of $113 billion. We've reduced that to $109 billion.","But keep in mind that was with a $10.4 billion spectrum purchase during that period of time. That was with $4 billion of a purchase of AOL and some miscellaneous tuck-ins, capital investment, share repurchase. And now we've just sold the Frontier properties. That helps brings that debt down even to a lower level.","So we are right on course. But that is top of mind at everything that we do. And will continue to be a commitment that Lowell and I made that is forefront that we will commit to.","On the AOL performance, look. I think \u2013 I'm not going to get into a lot of details on AOL. But look, they've had the best quarter in revenue in the last 5 years. If you go back to the fourth quarter, we said they were up $300 million year over year. Now of course that's seasonal. Well, that shows you though, that the investments that we've made in the platforms, a lot of the tuck-in type investments that we made with acquisitions \u2013 and these are small acquisitions. But they're real critical.","I mean if you just look at the most recent acquisition we just did with RYOT, this is a real unique 360-degree video production. It is for really Huff Post [Huffington Post], for them to increase their viability on producing videos for news.","But again this goes to our strategy in attacking a certain population that quite honestly Verizon is underpenetrated in. And if you look at that acquisition it directly goes to Gen Z. 73% of their audience is Millennials. So these are real strategic for us to improve the viability of that platform.","The other thing you're going to see us do this year too is around go90. The go90 product will start to \u2013 across all of the AOL platforms this year. That is going to enhance both the AOL platforms, and it's also going to enhance the go90 platform.","So look, continuing with our strategy we will \u2013 as I said before we will open the box at some point in time to give you more visibility to this. And I continue to say that that will be mid-year to maybe third quarter of this year, where we'll start to produce some numbers around some of these more specific platforms that we talk about.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And, Fran, is there a ratio or set of numbers you could put around how you perceive getting to that A-minus debt level? Are there indications that you've received for that?","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well sure. I mean if you look at each of the rating agencies, each of the rating agencies have a different approach, because some of them include the pension plan unfunded liability. Others include the OPEB unfunded liability. Others don't include any of that. Securitization, some include, some don't.","So each of them is a different metric. But if you look at our overall GAAP ratio, it kind of follows in task with where we would need to be. And based on the GAAP ratio, you should look at a 2.0 to 2.1 (47:42) type area in order to achieve that A-minus rating.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tori, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Good morning. Let me see if I can tie together maybe a question about the FCC and the ongoing discussions about Yahoo!. Given that in the FCC right now you've got the privacy NPRM, and you've got some uncertainty around whether Wireless is or isn't going to be upheld under Title II. How does that inform the way you think about what you might be able to do with AOL directly I guess? And also trying to expand the platform of advertising, as you might do with Yahoo! if you're the acquirer?","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, Craig. Well, look. I mean I'm not going to speak anything to deal with Yahoo!, so let's just talk about what we have on the table today. And under the sponsored data zero rating type issue, I mean the net neutrality already advocates some of this. And we've structured our sponsored data program to comply with all the FCC net neutrality rules.","So for example if any party \u2013 third party \u2013 is interested in that, we will offer that on a non-discriminatory basis. And we've priced it accordingly at a commercially favorable rate that we believe is in direct, really, compliance with the FCC net neutrality rule. We think that sponsored data and other FreeBee Data programs are good for the consumer. And that regulators will recognize that after concluding their review on our product. So based on the zero data, we'll have to wait to see where they come out on that.","As far as Title II goes, look. I mean we agree with all the principles with net neutrality rule. The thing that we disagreed with and opposed was applying Title II to broadband services and particularly wireless broadband. So we'll have to see where this comes out.","But in re-classing broadband under Title II was not necessary to ensure an open Internet. I mean there has been nothing ever that shows that it not has been an open Internet.","So this will obviously have some negative consequences on innovation as a whole. But look. I mean we're a company that has operated under regulation for 100 years. And it has been very successful. So we'll wait to see what the FCC concludes. And then we'll operate accordingly. But it's too early to say what exactly is going to happen here.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","And, Fran, does the specific limitations that might or might not be imposed on the use of customer data under the privacy NPRM that stems from reclassification, does that impact your ability to monetize an asset like Yahoo! or AOL in general to \u2013 as you think about how you would use that for advertising purposes?","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, look. I mean we at Verizon \u2013 I mean privacy and security has always been top of mind. And normally we always use an opt-in with our customers or some type of an opt-out feature.","The issue though that we have right now is under the FCC proposed aggressive rules on privacy and data security, that would apply to broadband providers but not companies like Google and Facebook. So if we're going to have rules, we need to make sure we don't single out certain industry to either benefit or not benefit from those rules. And that's something that our legal department continues to work with the FCC on. And so we'll see where this ultimately comes out. But that's really the crux of the issue for us.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","All right. Thanks, Fran.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tori, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Fran, maybe you could comment on the competitive environment you're seeing in Wireless? You guys were able to cut your postpaid handset losses on a year-over-year basis pretty meaningfully. Do you expect that to continue through the year?","And then secondly, prepaid has always been an area where you guys haven't really focused. You continue to lose subs in that space. Meanwhile I think AT&T and T-Mobile are \u2013 see a lot of growth in that area. Maybe you could compare your views on that market? And why you guys don't see that as a source for growth? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure. Thanks, John. So on the competitive environment of Verizon. I mean, look, coming into 2015 and again in 2016 we said that the top priority would be to maintain the high quality of our base. And you see us doing that. I mean we now have 48% of our base over on the new pricing. And we continue to push for that.","So you saw this 7 basis point increase in churn for the last couple of quarters. What I would say though is, is if you look ahead, last year second quarter, the churn was like a 0.90%. I would not anticipate nor should you anticipate that we will achieve that churn rate again, because things have kind of flattened out now. So I would look at the first quarter as a guide to where we will be for the rest of the year from a churn perspective.","And part of that is, is because we are seeing some increased churn on tablets, which we have talked about before, where we gave a free tablet away. And we saw that the customer base just didn't see the value of that tablet when it was free. And they signed up for the 2-year agreement, because they got a tablet for $10 a month, so $240. And they disconnected it at the end of the agreement.","So we stopped doing that promotion for that reason. But you see some of these tablets now coming up on the 2-year deal. So we anticipate that some of that higher churn, that tablet environment will hit us over the next couple of quarters. So we should be prepared for that.","But as far as the smartphone churn, we are continuing to see improvement in that smartphone churn, which gets us to holding a flat churn rate overall. So I think that's really what's important to us right now is that smartphone churn rate, which is really where we're dedicating all of our concentration and our promos.","On the prepaid side, absolutely. I mean our retail prepaid is above market. We're really not competitive in that environment for a whole host of reasons. And it's because we have to make sure that we don't migrate our high quality postpaid base over to a prepaid product. If you look at the competitive nature, they're doing it with sub-brands. They're not really doing it with their brands.","And quite honestly we use the TracFone brand as our prepaid product. And TracFone has been extremely successful for us. It's not something that we disclose any more on reseller. But it continues to increase on the high quality base of TracFone. So that's really where we use and go after the prepaid market.","More to come on this during the year. But currently that's how we operate under the prepaid model.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Fran.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tori, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, Fran. Thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on what your view is maybe more holistically on the video landscape? What other assets do you think Verizon requires? And I'm thinking about Fios Video long term. Where does that go?","And then I guess on the service revenue stabilization, that 50% benchmark. What kind of factors have you built into that to get to that expectation?","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thanks, Mike. So on the video landscape, look. I mean I think we've set the bar on where we're going on video, both in the home and outside the home. So in the home we were the first to come out with our Custom TV package, which rebundled certain content. And it's been very successful. I mean this quarter, even with the rebundle of Custom TV, we had a 38% take rate on that bundle.","And what I will tell you is, yes, it does give us some top line pressure, because it's a lower bundle from a revenue perspective. But the content cost is considerably lower. Therefore, it generates actually more margin for us. So it's the right thing to do. This is what customers want. They don't want to pay for 300 channels anymore and only watch 17 on average.","So we're trying to give customers what they want. And that's a fight, obviously, with all the content providers. But we're doing it within the legality of our contracts. And of course, we won't breach any of our contracts. But it's the way that the environment is moving. So I don't think we're going to change any approach to our in-home delivery.","The other thing is, is there's confusion out there on the video side, which is, everybody wants to talk about taking in-home video to a mobile handset. And this is something new. This has been done for the last 2 years. Everybody who has an in-home subscriber, most rights give them the ability to view that content as long as they subscribe and authenticate to that subscription, they can watch that on their mobile handset.","We're taking the \u2013 really the strategy in a whole different \u2013 in a different mode. We're going to a mobile-first strategy outside the home. It has nothing to do with in-home content. Now some of the content you could watch at home could be on this for like sports. That has been very popular in the go90 environment. But we're looking at a lot of different mobile first, short clips, news, sports. And if you think about it, original content.","And if you look at the strategy that we have taken in the last couple of quarters, we've added a lot of content that has nothing to do with in-home. So if you look at our Hearst joint venture, we now have joined in with them to create two very exclusive channels for us. One is called RatedRed, one is called Seriously.tv. And the target population is 12 to 24.","We then, as I said in my preambled remarks, AwesomenessTV, we took a 25% ownership stake. Because what we saw was, there was certain original content that we had contracted with them, that they deployed in go90. And we saw viewership really jump when those original contents presented themselves. So this is another one where \u2013 number one digital brand within the female population of ages 12 to 24, 160 million views, up 53% year over year.","And then finally, if you look at what we just did within the last few days, entering into another joint venture with Hearst and buying Complex [Media], a 50% owner. This is another number one digital brand in the male population of 18 to 24, monthly unique viewers of 54 million, and over 300 million views per month.","So this is really where we're taking the video product on mobile, which is very different than what everyone else is talking about. And we believe that's where we are going to be a differentiated brand with go90 and AOL, and everything else that we're doing around that video platform. So that's kind of where we're at on that.","On the service revenue stability, look, Mike, we've done a lot of modeling. We consistently say, as soon as we get to a more than 50% penetration of that base on the \u2013 what I'll call the device installment pricing plans, we start to see service revenue flatten out. And we start to see accretion at the back end of 2017. And we've run a number of models. And we consistently see that model towards that end. So that's really where we're at at this point in time.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great, Fran. Thanks for the color.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tori, we have time for one more question, please. Can you please just queue that up?","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our final question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much and good morning, folks.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Morning, Amir.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was wondering if we could discuss your network plans, Fran. In the near term, as you mentioned, your CapEx was down high single digits during the quarter. But you remain fully committed towards your guidance levels. What initiatives are top of mind for what seems to be an implied improving spending trajectory through the year?","And I guess longer term, I was wondering if you could briefly discuss some of your initiatives on 5G? You folks clearly seem to be pushing a timeline that is well ahead of your domestic peers and most of the global players as well. What is the impetus for this focus? And in order to meet the timeline you expect, what type of assets do you think you need to ensure to be able to get to meet those expectations? Should we expect additional deals like XO? Or some organic investments in fiber? Or anything along those lines? Thank you.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right, thanks, Amir. So first on just the CapEx, look. There's some timing here. And the reason that is, is because, if you look at it, in the fourth quarter of last year, we really accelerated our spend, really in Wireless, to prepare for the Super Bowl. And that was a whole densification project on the West Coast, around San Francisco and Santa Clara.","So really what you're seeing here is a timing issue. We are right on track with our plans on densification. We are still deploying a lot of small cells. So there is nothing that I'm going to say here that should concern you about our plans. And you'll see us catch up on that spend in the second and through the third and the fourth quarter. So, coming in right on guidance.","Now the only thing I will say here is, keep in mind that the first quarter also had $150 million on Frontier that will disappear in the second quarter. So you could assume that second quarter may be a little lighter than in the past. But again, right on track with where we thought we would be.","On the 5G question, look. We are committed to being the first U.S. company to roll out 5G wireless technology. We are currently what I would call doing sandbox \u2013 sandboxes and creating innovation centers. We are working with the 5G Technology Forum, which includes all the major OEMs and handset OEMs. We will evolve this 5G ecosystem rapidly, just like we did with LTE, to ensure an aggressive pace of innovation.","Currently we're testing 5G technologies this year. And we aim to have an initial fixed wireless pilot starting in 2017. And I want to reiterate that. This is a fixed wireless, which is really one of the first cases that we see. It's really not about mobile. It's really around fixed wireless.","We're helping the industry to adopt the rules on 5G deployment, including the opening of the spectrum bands above the 24 gigahertz. And we're working with the FCC. And as you know with XO, we have the ability for an option to buy around the 28 gigahertz, which is currently how we're doing our testing right now.","And then, keep in mind that 5G is not a replacement technology of 4G. So this is not a capital intense overlay to the 4G network. It really is all about high speed video delivery over a wireless network in a very, very efficient way. And you should think about 5G again, like we did with LTE, where you see those four to five incremental cost decreases when delivering that video. That's similar to what we will see in the 5G environment.","So right now that's where we're at. But we continue to plow forward. And we will be ready to go with the 5G technology.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. We'll now turn the call back to Fran for some closing comments.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike. Look, the first quarter provided strong results to the start of this year. And again I want to reiterate we are very confident in our ability to execute on the fundamentals and grow this business profitably amidst the competitive environment and manage through the transition of our business models. We are also positioning our business for future profitable growth through cost and capital efficiency initiatives and all the new revenue streams that we always talk about.","We look forward to a positive 2016 with confidence in our ability to execute our strategy, create value for our customers, our employees, and our shareholders.

[Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. ","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with Hans Vestberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. ","Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. ","The presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. As a reminder, we are in the middle of a millimeter wave spectrum auction, so we will not be able to comment on our current millimeter wave spectrum holdings or spectrum strategy. ","Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.25 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results contain two special items: a net pretax gain from dispositions of assets and businesses of $261 million, and a $291 million pretax pension remeasurement charge. The gain from dispositions includes several transactions during the quarter primarily the sale of our Sunnyvale Yahoo! campus as we look forward to moving to our new Verizon Media Group facility in San Jose. ","The mark-to-market pension charge was related to our management pension plan, which triggered remeasurement earlier in the year as a result of the Voluntary Separation Program. The charge is primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate assumption during the quarter. The net impact of these special items was minimal to net income, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.25, which is up to 2.5% compared to $1.22 a year ago. ","Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our earnings profile for the second quarter. Consistent with previous quarters, we have illustrated the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition and ASC 842 for leases. As we pointed out the past 2 quarters, we have realized a lesser benefit in 2019 than we realized last year from the adoption of ASC 606 primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. This reduction in benefit creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share, which will continue until the end of 2020. The impact was $0.03 for the third quarter and $0.09 on a year-to-date basis. ","Accounting standard ASC 842 for leases resulted in a gross-up on the balance sheet for all operating leases at the beginning of the year. In addition, the lease standard affects our earnings per share primarily due to the expensing of certain lease costs, which results in a headwind of $0.01 in the third quarter and $0.04 year-to-date. We expect the fourth quarter impact to be within the previously provided range of $0.01 to $0.02 per share. ","As you can see on the earnings waterfall slide, adjusted EPS growth of 2.5% reflects the strong underlying performance of the business, partially offset by the impacts of the deferral of commission expense and the adoption of the leasing standard. Matt will take you through the details of the quarterly performance later in the call. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.","Hans Vestberg","Thanks, Brady, and thanks, everyone, for joining the third quarter earnings call. I want to start by saying that I'm very pleased how well the team executed our strategy and operation this quarter. We made a lot of progress on our overall strategy, so I'm very happy with it. Let's start with the network. I think the network team has continued to execute extremely well. I'm confident in our ability to keep winning the third-party awards on the 4G network. We are just continuing to do a really good job there. At the same time, our team is executing on our 5G strategy, and we're now up to 15 markets where we have deployed our 5G Ultra Wideband. Our commitment with 30 markets by year-end is still committed, and we will continue to do so the rest of this year. ","At the same time, we also launched the 5G Home city based on the NR standard. That proves the model now is moving into the standard 5G to really see that we get the full benefit of the deployment and the development on the 5G standard when it comes to 5G Home. We're also doing a lot of things in One Fiber, continue to have a very high pace in that. And that One Fiber is so important for our overall Intelligent Edge Network that we are deploying in the company in order to realize the market-purpose network to gain all the efficiencies and serve our customers even better over time. So in short, a lot of progress in the network. ","At the same time, our strategy execution in the quarter showed a lot around our business model, the flexibility we have in the business model. Just recently, we made an announcement with Disney and our agreement when Disney when it comes to Disney+. I think this proves the model that we have decided to have with a very strong network distribution and a brand that attracts the best brands on the planet to work with us, and we're extremely excited over that. ","At the same time, we continue to deploy also 5G Ultra Wideband in stadiums especially now with NFL, 13 stadiums when the season kicks off having 5G coverage. This is important for us because it's part of the dense urban areas where you have a lot of viewers at the same time when really our 5G is coming to excel. Because of the 5G build that we're doing with our assets is -- we're making a real big difference here. ","At the same time, we're also working, of course, with the -- our 5G mobile edge compute. And as we stated already in the beginning of the year, we're going to launch the first 5G mobile edge compute center in the fourth quarter. And that is in progress, and we're going to announce that later this quarter. So we're excited on that. ","At the same time, you see us engaging much more with large enterprises because with the 5G platform and 8 currencies, we are now a lot of interactions. We announced in this quarter, for example, collaboration with SAP, Corning. All of them are use cases for the 5G mobile edge compute. So we're excited all that opportunity we're creating with the 5G mobile edge compute with the largest companies in the market. ","When it comes to Verizon Media Group, they also had a quarter with a lot of strategy execution and came out with a lot of new products in the portfolio: a new mail service. They also had the enhancement on the Yahoo! Sports and Finance, a lot of traction on it. We saw a great take up on our NFL that we have now with Yahoo! Sports. So all in all, our Verizon Media Group is executing on the strategy we laid out one year ago in a really good way. ","And finally, earlier in the quarter, I think we continued to lead the charge in the wireless and Consumer market with our new mix and match, which is just continuation of how we want to bring our customers to understand how they can move up in the value chain to unlimited. I have to say Ronan Dunne and his team are doing an excellent job to really to move this market forward. ","And as you can see in our operation performance, we had a really good quarter when it comes to wireless additions here, one of the best quarter -- third quarter we had in several years. So really, this paying off what we are doing in the model and actually moving this forward. So all in all, a lot of progress on our strategy. Of course, a lot more to be done, but it's clearly now positioning us where we want to be as a company with our customers and our shareholders. ","Finally, this of course came down to our finance. We had a revenue growth almost 1% in the quarter. More important, we continue to have a wireless service growth in the quarter, we continue on the same level almost we have the previous quarters. And all in all, that converted into continued EPS growth that we had in this quarter as well. And that is, of course, coming with a very strong underlying operational performance with some headwinds coming from accounting. But to go on the very good work from the team, which is based on our commitment of cost efficiencies or voluntary that were done and all of the things we're doing at the same time. ","That also conclude in a very strong free cash flow, continue to take control of our balance sheet and seeing that we're putting ourselves and our Board in a good position going forward. So all in all, the finance performance really sort of resonated with a strategic execution we did in the quarter. ","We had all saw a lot of execution when it comes to responsible business, and this is important to us because it's part of our strategy. We made commitment around our education or 5G to schools. We made commitments around our CO2 emissions. All in all, this is part of our strategy, it's part of our responsible business. Ultimately, it should be good business for all of us, for our customers, for our shareholders and our employees who should be part of that journey. So we continue on that path, and we think it's very important for all our stakeholders. ","All in all, a very good quarter. The team executed well on all the metrics. There's areas that we need to improve. There's areas that we're still working on. But in general, I would say that I'm happy and satisfied how the Verizon team is showing up this quarter. ","By that, I hand it over to Matt.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with a review of our consolidated operating and [Technical Difficulty] On a reported basis, third quarter consolidated revenue was $32.9 billion, up 0.9%. This growth was priority-driven by higher wireless service revenue, partially offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in legacy wireline revenue, predominantly in our Business segment. Year-to-date consolidated revenue is up 0.5%, in line with our full year GAAP consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage growth for 2019. ","In the third quarter, we delivered strong adjusted EBITDA margin while positioning for future wireless revenue growth by updating our unlimited offer and executing effective promotions to drive strong wireless volumes. The headwinds that Brady mentioned earlier from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard lowered EBITDA by $240 million, which is approximately a 70 basis point impact on EBITDA margin in the quarter. As reported, third quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.6%, down from 37.4% in the prior year. Since we initiated our business excellence program in 2018, we have realized cumulative cash savings of $4.6 billion and are on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021. Our Voluntary Separation Program has produced approximately $900 million of expense savings year-to-date, including over $400 million of savings in the third quarter. The last tranche of employees exited the business in late June, so we have now reached our full run rate of expense savings for the VSP. ","As Brady mentioned, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.25, up from $1.22 a year ago. This is the third quarter this year with adjusted EPS growth of 2.5% or higher, highlighting the strength and momentum in the business. The combination of wireless service revenue momentum, solid margin performance and strong customer volumes keeps us on track to achieve our adjusted EPS guidance of low single-digit percentage growth for 2019, excluding the impact of the lease accounting standard. Additionally, we still expect our full year 2019 adjusted effective tax rate to come in at the lower end of the 24% to 26% range. ","Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. As a reminder, our Consumer segment includes both wireless and wireline products and services, targeting retail customers as well as our wireless wholesale operations. In August, we launched new unlimited price plans, which provide more choice to customers and an easier entry point into unlimited on the nation's best network. As a result, phone gross additions were up 10% over the prior year. The popularity of the new mix and match plans and overall value proposition drove postpaid phone net additions of 239,000 for the quarter, more than double the 112,000 last year. Postpaid smartphone net additions were 372,000, up from 285,000 in the prior year. Total postpaid net additions were 193,000, including other connected devices of 130,000, primarily wearables, offset by tablet losses of 176,000. ","Our network leadership, coupled with the personalization of our customer value proposition led to a postpaid phone churn of 0.79%, which was similar to last year even with additional market participants. Total postpaid device activations were flat from prior year at 7.4 million, including 6.2 million phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.9%, down from 5.1% a year ago, reflecting the continued elongation of the handset upgrade cycle. In the third quarter, prepaid net losses were 81,000 compared to a loss of 96,000 last year. Our focus on the high-value prepaid market has resulted in stable prepaid revenue despite declining volumes. ","Fios Internet net additions of 30,000 were relatively flat sequentially and down year-over-year. Fios Video results continued to be impacted by the ongoing shift away from linear video offerings with losses of 67,000. Our customers see value in our high-quality broadband offering paired with multiple choices for video through linear TV bundles or over-the-top options, such as YouTube TV and the recently announced Disney+. ","Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss Consumer financial performance. In the third quarter, total Consumer operating revenues were $22.7 billion, which is up 1.4%. This was primarily driven by continued strong growth in wireless service revenue and Fios service offerings, offset by declines in wireless equipment and legacy wireline services. As we look to add value beyond connectivity, other revenue grew 18.7% primarily driven by recurring services, such as Total Mobile Protection. Consumer wireless service revenue increased by 2.1% over the prior year even as we introduced new unlimited pricing. We increase wireless service revenue and offer by driving customer step-ups to unlimited plans from metered plans and increasing connections per account. We have continued room for further growth as around 50% of our customer account base is currently on unlimited plans. In the third quarter, Consumer wireless equipment revenue decreased 5.6% as lower upgrade rates more than offset an increase in phone gross adds. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 1.7% due primarily to the demand for our broadband offerings. ","Consumer EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 45.3%, which was down 30 basis points from the prior year. This includes headwinds of approximately 80 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard. We are extremely proud of the team's ability to drive significant volume in the quarter while maintaining strong EBITDA margin. ","Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Our Business segment includes wireless and wireline products and services provided across 4 customer groups: global enterprise, small and medium business, wholesale and public sector and other. Business wireless volumes remain strong with a 12% increase in gross adds for the quarter primarily within small and medium business and public sector. Postpaid net adds were 408,000 compared to 364,000 in the prior year. This includes 205,000 phones, 112,000 tablets and 91,000 other connected devices. Our continued strong customer loyalty across the Business segment led to phone churn of 0.98%, which is relatively flat sequentially and up slightly over the prior year. Total postpaid churn of 1.22% was up 5 basis points compared to the prior year. Total postpaid device activations were up 5.7% while our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.5% versus 4.8% in the prior year. ","Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the Business financial performance. Strong wireless service revenue growth and high-quality fiber products were offset by softness in legacy wireline technologies, causing total operating revenues for the Business segment to be approximately flat for the quarter. Revenue from our Business wireless products grew 6.9%, including 6.1% wireless service revenue growth. This performance reflects Verizon's best-in-class network quality, reliability and solutions-based approach with our Business customers. Revenue from our wireline products declined 6.7% in the quarter. ","From a customer group perspective, global enterprise revenues declined 2.4%, driven by legacy pricing pressure and technology shifts. Wholesale revenues declined by 13.7% driven by price compression and volume declines, which we expect to continue in a highly competitive marketplace. Small and medium business revenue increased 6.2% driven by wireless service and Fios growth, partially offset by ongoing declines in traditional data and voice services. Public sector and other revenue increased 1.2% as a result of growth in wireless and wireline products and services. ","Business segment EBITDA margin was 25.2%, which was down 300 basis points primarily driven by the decline in high-margin wholesale revenue. This also includes headwinds of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard. ","Now let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. For the third quarter, Verizon Media Group revenue was $1.8 billion, which was down 2.0% versus the prior year, continuing the improvement in revenue trends. Gains in native and mobile advertising continue to be offset by declines in desktop advertising, though the business is building momentum in key areas. We are migrating customers to our recently integrated native and demand side advertising platforms with double-digit growth year-over-year. For the first time, we are seeing mobile traffic increases outpace desktop traffic declines in our core owned and operated products, including sports, finance, news, entertainment, home and mail. Although it's early in the NFL season, customer engagement has doubled over a year ago in terms of minutes watched as more and more fans are using their mobile devices to watch games on Yahoo! Sports. We are diversifying our monetization streams in Media Group, including additional customer engagement opportunities on Yahoo! Sports and fantasy platforms and the launch of new integrated content-to-commerce capabilities. ","Let's now move to Slide 12, which reconciles Verizon 2.0 results to our legacy Verizon 1.0 results. As we have previously committed to provide transparency through our transition to the new Verizon 2.0 segmentation, Slide 12 contains a reconciliation similar to the one we provided in the second quarter. These waterfall charts reconcile revenue and EBITDA from our Consumer and Business segments back to wireless and wireline. ","The top chart shows Consumer revenue of $22.7 billion in the quarter. After removing Consumer wireline and adding back Business wireless, we report total wireless revenues of $23.6 billion, with EBITDA margin of 46.8%. The bottom chart shows a similar reconciliation from Business to wireline results, starting with Business revenue of $7.9 billion and ultimately arriving at total wireline revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter, with EBITDA margin of 17.4%. Wireline revenues were down 3.8% from prior year, with margins down from the prior period as a result of the ongoing pressures in legacy product volumes and price compression. You can find additional detail in our supplemental information included on our website. ","Let's now move to Slide 13 to discuss the wireless results. Looking at overall wireless, which includes both Consumer and Business, total operating revenues increased 2.6% to $23.6 billion in the third quarter, primarily driven by a 2.7% increase in service revenue. Based on the momentum in the business, which is carried over into October, we expect total wireless service revenue growth for the fourth quarter to be between 3% and 3.5%. Total wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 46.8%. This includes headwinds of approximately 90 basis points primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard. Excluding this impact, EBITDA margin was 47.7%, similar to prior year despite the significant increase in volumes. ","The success of our new mix and match unlimited plans translated into impressive volumes driven by phone gross adds up 10% to 2.7 million, which marks our highest third quarter phone gross add performance in the last 5 years. Postpaid phone net adds for the quarter were 444,000, which were up from 295,000 a year ago. Postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter was 615,000, up 21% from 510,000 in the prior year. Total postpaid net adds was 601,000, consisting of tablet losses of 64,000 and connected device gains of 221,000, mostly driven by wearables. Postpaid phone churn of 0.82% was up slightly from 0.80% last year while total retail postpaid churn of 1.09% was up 5 basis points year-over-year. ","For the quarter, we increased customer net accounts by 25,000 as compared to zero in the third quarter last year. Total postpaid device activations were up 1.1%. This was driven by an increase in postpaid gross additions of 4.3 million, up 7.7% from the prior year, offset by a decrease in our retail postpaid upgrade rate to 4.8% from 5.0% a year ago. ","To recap the wireless quarter across Consumer and Business, we reset unlimited pricing and absorbed the initial impact from optimizes. We were competitive on the promotional front, and we drove strong wireless volumes that set us up for future growth. All of this was accomplished while growing EBITDA on a like-for-like basis and generating one of our strongest free cash flow quarters in several years. We are excited about the trends in our wireless products while pushing forward to extend our 5G leadership. ","Let's now focus on our consolidated cash flow results and the balance sheet on Slide 14. Year-to-date, cash flow from operating activities total $26.7 billion, up from $26.2 billion during the prior year. Benefits from year-over-year operational improvements and lower discretionary employee benefit contributions were partially offset by higher cash tax payments and payments related to the Voluntary Separation Program. Year-to-date capital spending was $12.3 billion, which was up slightly from the prior year. Our capital expenditures continue to support the growth in data and video traffic on our industry-leading 4G LTE network, the launch and continued build-out of our 5G Ultra Wideband network, the upgrade to our Intelligent Edge Network architecture and significant fiber deployment in 60-plus markets outside our ILEC footprint. We maintain our full year 2019 CapEx guidance range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion. ","The net result to cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first 3 quarters of the year of $14.4 billion. We ended the quarter with $109.6 billion of total gross debt, which is $3.3 billion lower than the prior year. The unsecured debt balance was $100.8 billion, which is lower year-over-year by $2.9 billion and lower sequentially by $1.3 billion. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1x versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0x, reflecting the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain focused on reducing our unsecured debt portfolio while continuing to actively manage our near-term maturities, optimize our overall funding footprint and lower our cost of capital. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be in order: investing in the business, continuing our commitment to the dividend and managing our balance sheet to achieve our targeted leverage range. ","In the third quarter, we demonstrated yet another period of focused execution. We were able to maintain strong EBITDA performance and generate solid cash flow while driving significant volumes to set ourselves up for future revenue growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. We continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, and we remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet, all while leading the industry in 5G development. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady so we can get to your questions.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Matt. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","If we look at some of your most recent moves with the unlimited price adjustment and now the partnership with Disney to give away Disney+ for free for a year, it certainly seems like you're assuming a bit more of a growth posture than we've seen from the company recently. And I was hoping you could maybe just sort of frame to us why you see this opportunity as we're sort of late in the 4G cycle, not quite in the 5G cycle yet. How are you hoping this is going to position you as you do get ready to ramp more aggressively in 5G? And then of course, anytime we see an operator become a little more growth-centric, there's always some degree of investment to create that growth. How do we think about the level of spending you're going to have to incur to make sure you can keep this momentum going?","Hans Vestberg","Thank you very much. I think that when we -- this is part of the overall strategy that we outlined in the beginning of the year. We have a great network. We have the distribution and, of course, the brand. We -- when it comes to Disney+, we can partner with the best partners, and it's actually a win-win. I mean actually, they are gaining a lot to be partnering with us as we are gaining a lot as well. And I think this is a differentiation we can provide to our customers and given the flexibility and so on. So I think that first of all, not assuming that this is a heavy investment, it's actually a win-win in all aspects. I think that's very important. ","Then when it comes to our move on mix and match early in the quarter, that has been part of a very rigid planning, very disciplined way of viewing things where we are actually ramping and doing a pathway for our customers to come into unlimited, moving up in unlimited, where ultimately, when 5G comes, we're going to have ubiquitous 5G coverage, they can move up to that higher level. ","So it's all a plan, but we also said all the time, we see opportunities on 4G as well. I mean we know that we outlined a great opportunity on 5G with 4 different business cases. But hey, we can execute on what we have on the assets we have today, and we are very happy that -- with that in this -- and we use our strength right now to really see that we are using the market opportunities that we see. And I think that the whole team has been executing very well this quarter, and that's what you see. ","And we have also done other type of partnership, and that's part of our network-as-a-service strategy that we outlined in the beginning of the year. So I think you see that we see a possibility of continued to grow even in the 4G area, and I think that's important.","Matthew Ellis","Yes. And Brett, if I would just add on a couple of points. You mentioned us having a growth posture. We've really been leaning forward for over a couple of years now. From when we launched unlimited, we've been continuing to update our Consumer offerings, our customer offerings. You see those resonate. It's built on the backbone of having the best network experience. So this is an ongoing process that you've seen from us over the past couple of years. And you should expect us to stay on the front foot going forward. ","In terms of -- you mentioned investment in growth. If you look at the wireless numbers as a whole, so -- as you say, very strong growth. But when you adjust out for the accounting, our EBITDA margin was in line with last year. So it's a great performance from the team that we can focus on growth and continue to report strong margins. So it's well-balanced there as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick","How effective were the new plans in driving more subs to unlimited? I heard you mention you still have 50% or so. And I appreciate the commentary on service revenue on 4Q. What does that tell us about unlimited take rates and moving up or down tiers?","Hans Vestberg","In general as I said, for us, it's a way for seeing that our customer get the best value. They can mix and match. I think that resonates well with the marketplace that you can do it. I think that, as Matt said, we have been on the forefoot since unlimited come out in new ways of both offering, but also giving a wide breadth of opportunities for our wireless customers. So I think that's what we're seeing. ","And as you heard from Matt, that means we come in with a good momentum in the fourth quarter, and our wireless service revenue is now increasing our guidance for the fourth quarter. But remember also, it's both Consumer, and we're doing very well on the Business side as well. I think that Tami and the team are doing great [indiscernible] on wireless. And then if you see the numbers, we continue to do really solid work across the board here.","Matthew Ellis","Yes. Yes. And to follow on from that point, if you think about the 444,000 phone net adds we had in the quarter, we had more than 200,000 in each of the Consumer and Business segments. So that wireless growth is very well balanced across the totality of our customer portfolio, which is very good to see. You mentioned the unlimited percentage. Prior couple of quarters, we were saying we're still less than 50%. This quarter, we had approximately 50%. The new plans give people -- a lot have moved up to unlimited, a great opportunity to do so. We're seeing them do that. There's still plenty of space and more customers to come there, Phil, and as you see the service revenue guide for the quarter. And obviously when you have increase in net adds, that gives us greater confidence around service revenues as we look into the future.","Operator","The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.","David Barden","I guess a couple for Matt on the financials. I think, Matt, we saw a kind of spike in wireless cost of service in the quarter kind of anomaly I think relative to history that it could have -- wireless margins could have been a lot -- even better. If you could kind of address that spike, it will be helpful. And then similarly on the flip side on wireline, kind of almost a 2 percentage point sequential step down in wireline margins. I know you mentioned that we've hit the full run rate from the voluntary departure plan, which I thought would have kind of supported that. So could you kind of walk us through what happened in the wireline margin side, too?","Matthew Ellis","Yes. Thanks, David, for the question. So on the wireless cost of service side, I mentioned that the phone net adds split was fairly even between Consumer and Business. Business had a more than 10% increase in phone gross adds. And as you are aware, our -- a lot of our Business customers are still on a subsidy model rather than device payment model, so I think you see the impact of that. But as I said earlier, we had great growth in the quarter in wireless. And overall margins were in line with a year ago. So we are very happy with the balance of that performance between growth and the margins. ","On the wireline side, obviously, we still have work to do there as you look at wireline. Certainly, we see the continued effect of the revenue declines in legacy products. That's not new. We've had that for a number of quarters, and we expect that's obviously going to continue. ","The key for us in wireline is to develop products and services that will offset those legacy products and services. And by bringing the Business segment together where we're bringing both wireless and wireline products to our Business customers holistically, this puts us in a better position to really be that partner of choice for our Business customers as we move into a 5G world. So as we develop those product and services, we look forward to seeing what comes from those segments as we go forward.","Hans Vestberg","And I can only add on the wireline side there, the whole transformation we're doing with the new segments is, of course, paving the way for actually thinking about the customer. This customer extremely important for the digital transformation when it comes to private 5G networks, to mobile edge compute in the future. So the customer relationship is very important there. ","And secondly, as Matt said, the investment that we're doing in the network right now with mobile edge compute with fiber and all of that, that's of course things that are going to offset that all the time. It's not immediate because we have a secular decline on the product portfolio. It's known, and -- but we constantly work with the front end of it, and I think that putting together what we have done is really, really good. I mean I have, together with Tami and the team, visited, I would say the majority of all the large Fortune 50 companies in this country right now and talking about our offerings and what we can do for them in the future. I think we had a really good a good start there, but it will take some time. ","So I think this is a very, very important asset that we have, that we need to work on it. That's why we're taking out cost to do it all the time. As I said, it will not be an immediate recovery, and we will -- but I think we have plans for the future to really do this well. And I see so much encouraging signs just lately on how we work with this, so yes, that's where we are with wireline.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.","John Hodulik","Two questions. First, anything you guys can tell us about the financial impact to the Disney partnership? And then more specifically, what kind of lift are you guys seeing from an ARPU standpoint as you guys get sort of non-unlimited customers moving up to unlimited? And then second, could we talk about use of cash as you guys get to your leverage targets? It looks like you're going to get below -- at or below 2x sometime early next year. How do you prioritize your returns of cash to shareholders versus sort of other needs, like spectrum for instance? And is there a chance that we could see buybacks come back into the cards next year?","Hans Vestberg","Thank you. If we start with the Disney+ agreement. I think, first of all, we learn to look from our exclusive agreement without the music. Both how we do these as a win-win for both the partner and us. And remember, we are I would say fairly picky who we do this type of partnership. We do with the best brand, with great products. The same go for Disney+. ","Remember, we are offering a lot to these companies as well. I mean we offer a base, solid distribution that no one else has in this country, definitely the best customer base at the same time, the best network. So I think it's a much more win-win than you might believe as I hear your questions coming out. I think that we are offering something fantastic for them. At the same time, as you well pointed out, we have a chance right now to move our customers in our value chain of unlimited again given that we are adding these types of things. ","So I think we have a good metrics. We have a good experience from app and music that we now take to the streaming, and we're going to have a win-win. It's going to be great for Disney. It's going to be good for us. So I think that's what we have. On the capital allocation, I mean as Matt said, first of all, we invest on our business. Our CapEx, whatever tuck-ins we need, that's really #1 priority right now. Secondly, we're putting our Board in a good position to continue to increase the dividend, 13 years in a row all dividend increase. We want to have them in that. ","And then, of course, we continue to do our commitment, which was to get back to pre-Vodafone ratings and pre-Vodafone measurements. So we're doing that. That's what we execute all the day. And yes, we're getting very close, and we will give a lot of opportunities for the Board in the next step to think about what they want to do. And that's what Matt and I are doing and the whole treasury team, which I think is doing an excellent job. So that's where we are with the capital allocation.","Matthew Ellis","Yes. If I will just add a couple of things to that, Hans. And I would say while we're not going to provide any more details about specifically where we'll be next year, you should not expect us to want to aim to go outside the bottom end of that range, below the 1.75, and you should not expect us to build significant cash balance on the balance sheet.","Operator","The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery","Hans, I wanted to talk on 5G a little bit. You rolled out the new standards-based 5G Home in Chicago. Can you just give us a little bit of color about what difference that makes and how aggressively you're going to lean into this in terms of new markets and households until you get the next generation with the new chipsets? And then related to that, you've got a number of 5G Ultra Wideband devices in your handset mix. Obviously, you're waiting for the iPhone. But how do you see that -- those devices penetrating your subscriber base over the last few months? And what does the pipeline look for new devices with that capability over the next few months?","Hans Vestberg","Thank you very much. When it comes to the 5G Home that we launched now with the NR standard, that was an important thing for us because as you remember, we launched in 4 cities with our proprietary software. Now we have it on the global standard software. So that's an important event for us. And the second important event though of these launches, that we are now having the cell set-up. Remember, we had a North Star, how we want to do this so differently. So yes, you are right, we are launching this, and it's a lot of new experience that we're giving to our consumers but also that we are now taking as we have been working since the early launch on the first 4 cities. ","As you rightfully point out and I said several times as well, that there's coming a next-generation chipset in the second half of 2020. That's really when we think we're going to have a more massive deployment of it. And until then, we are deploying in the millimeter wave with the ultra wideband in so many cities. So when we get that more -- the next-generation CPE, then based on the next-generation chipset, we're going to be in a very good position second half to actually come out much wider. So this is just the next step for us to get all the insights, billing, experience for our consumers, so we can really take a big step when it come to the next-generation chipset. ","When it comes to the smartphones, as you rightfully said, we have launched all the iconic 5G phones so far this year. We see an exciting take up on that because many of our customers are taking the phones. And even if you have not launched all cities, they are preparing. So we are paving the way for them because many of these phones are also extremely good 4G phones, and as soon as we come with 5G for that city, they will also have that. So that we see on us Brian Higgins that is leading our device organization has said basically all phones coming out next year will be 5G capable. So we will have a range of phones coming out next year. There's one brand that we don't know, and we haven't talked about them, and again, they need to talk about when they will have a 5G phone. But all others will basically have their phones coming out. ","So I feel good about it, the performance has gone up dramatically. I mean if I look at the Galaxy coming out, the Samsung Galaxy, which is one of the first phones where in the beginning, we tune up to 500, 600 megabits per second, which we thought was great. That's doing 2 gig right now constantly in the ultra wideband. So we see also a clear improvement on the software tuning between the network and the handsets. And as we deploy more and more, we're just getting better and better and giving a better and better experience for our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.","Michael Rollins","How do you see the pricing model evolving with 5G in terms of the opportunity to charge by rate of speed instead of by the current model, which are unlimited per gigabytes or a certain quantum of gigabytes?","Hans Vestberg","Thank you. Of course, as we get into 5G, you get a fair amount of new potential ways of charging. I still think that our model for unlimited is really both helping us and our consumers to go to actually move up in the value chain from getting into the, let's say, the lower tier of unlimited coming up to the sort of the highest. It's a wide range and, of course, the highest is including 5G. Today, we're waiving that, but all time we see that if you're going to get that ubiquitous sort of coverage and capacity, and -- that will give us an opportunity. ","At the same time, we started adding our flexibility in our business model, having Apple Music, having Disney+ and all of that in the same time. So I think that we have a lot of tools in our portfolio to continue to drive this forward. And I think that as I always say, I have a lot of confidence in the Consumer team. And as they have come together today, you see clearly new potentials. I mean remember we have 5G Home coming, we have 5G Mobility at the same time. There's a lot of things that can be done for us to continue to this journey. And I think that one of the proof points of the whole new structure is, of course, also that Disney+ is not only for mobility, it's for our Fios customers, and it's for our 5G Home customers. And suddenly, we think about Consumer as a full segment, which I think it was the whole idea with the new structure we have.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.","Timothy Horan","Hans, can you give us maybe some more thoughts what you think people are going to do with gigabit speeds instead of megabits? When we rolled out 4G, we had a lot of new innovative kind of applications. Just any thoughts on that as you're talking to the Fortune 500 companies. And are there ways for you maybe to participate in some of the revenue from some of these new applications with lower -- also maybe lower latency? Just any more thoughts what you're seeing on use cases.","Hans Vestberg","Yes. I think that is an excellent question. I mean the first, which is a totally new business model, is 5G Home. That's a totally new way how we use the technology, which we have never been able to do before because a stand-alone fixed wireless access can never be sustainable financially. In this case, it is. ","Then of course when you think about the 8 currencies coming out from 5G, I think that our conversation with the large enterprises today is a lot about the latency and the mobile edge compute. Because suddenly, you can transform your factory with robotics by having a low latency. You don't need a wired factory, so the future digital factory will have 5G. We see also much bigger 5G private networks, where you get security much higher because it's going to be your network. You define your network, you have a compute and storage for your enterprise. This is a new way of charging and actually interacting with our customer. And sometimes, there's going to be a software in between that come from a software company, so we need to work with them as well. ","And as I said earlier, I mean this quarter, we're going to launch our first 5G mobile edge compute center. So we are on the path of doing this, which actually will add more opportunity. Then on the Consumer side, which usually question starts with, which are now end with because I see so many other opportunities, is of course AR\/VR. We see now quite a lot of money coming into the ventures side when it comes to 5G innovation. And I think that as we move into 2020, we're going to see much more. We have our 5G challenge, which we announced at CES where we had a lot of companies participate what they're going to do with 5G. It ranged from everything what they can do with 5G. ","I think we're at the moment of 4G, but way bigger. When 4G came, I didn't know what type of application and new service companies would show up. I think this is far bigger that we're standing in front of right now, and we have much more insights to it as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael","Two questions, if I may. Number one, can you talk about the revenue impact of the step-up in the insurance fee on a full year basis and the amount you expect to reinvest in things like promos and marketing and things like Disney+, so we can get a better sense of the net benefit to the company? And then secondly, given the slower deployment for small cells, not fiber, but for small cells that's being seen really across the industry, are you considering shifting more of your investment dollars back to the macro network as we shift into 2020?","Hans Vestberg","I can start with the second question. I'm not sure where you say is slow. The definition what is a small cell is, number one, I mean I'm not sure there is a good definition on that. Of course we deploy a lot of urban cells right now. In my book, that's actually small cell, so I don't think you're referring to us when you talk about less deployment because we are in the midst of our 5G deployment right now, which is very focused on the dense urban places where there's no macros, it's small cells. But it depends on what you define as a small cell. They're everything from micro to medium-sized hybrids to the macros. And -- but in our case, it's not that we're slowing down anything here.","Matthew Ellis","Yes. So Colby, on the question on the revenue impact of the step-up in our insurance products, Total Mobile Protection, from a geography standpoint, that's in the other revenue line, so that the contribution from that step-up is not in the service revenue line. But as you say, it's -- you saw a good increase in that line in the quarter. We continue to add value to our customers. It's an example of how we think about the Consumer offering holistically, whether that be the core service and having it on the best network; whether it be bringing value like we have this year, first with Apple Music and now with Disney+; and how we bring other services, such as Total Mobile Protection, cloud storage, et cetera, et cetera. So we continue to look for those opportunities to add value for our customers. And as we do that, you see the impact on revenue, and you see the impact on volume. So coming out of the third quarter, very strong volumes, great momentum coming out of the quarter, and we've seen that continued strong momentum here in October as we start the fourth quarter and head into the holiday season. ","So all of those things that we're doing around the customer proposition are really driving a lot of positive trajectory for the business right now. We have good line of sight for that continuing as we go forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Douglas Mitchelson","So for Disney+, you're the national partner for Disney, and the impact for both of you is highly dependent upon getting Verizon customers to sign up and use Disney+. What would you consider a good conversion rate for unlimited customers to Disney+ customers? And should we benchmark it to Apple Music usage? And any sort of go-to-market strategy commentary around that would be interesting. But also, you're proving that you could partner with great content, and I do -- I'm interested in your comments on the benefit of owning media and then particularly the Verizon Media Group.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you very much. No, I think that it's a little bit different, of course, Apple Music from Disney+ given that the Disney+ is, of course, a heavy streaming and Apple Music is a fairly light audio. So of course, it also -- when you think about the conversion rate, you need also to understand you need to be on unlimited when you come up to this one and moving up in unlimited. So of course, it might be a little bit lower conversion rate. But I still think that our team knows this very well right now. We do the co-marketing. It's great for our customers. It creates loyalty, but not only that, we give something more for our customers. So I think that we have a good -- we're not giving away the conversion rates right now, and I think that will put more pressure on Disney than us. So I think that that's a -- but I think we have a good grip on it. ","When it comes to our -- my -- or our view on content, I think that first of all, when it comes to streamed content or linear content and then all of that, I think that we are -- we like the model we have. We have a lot of flexibility. We partner with the best. We offer our asset so you're going to see us doing that in the right places. But anyhow, Verizon Media Group fits very well into our because what we see they are doing is of course over-the-top sort of Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Sports, Yahoo Entertainment, Yahoo! News, all of that is over-the-top services. Where we get engagement, we learn how content is working. And of course, then we have our advertising platform then that is getting then owned and operated content that drives the flywheel of our advertising platform. So it all sinks in. ","And then you -- we also need to have that a lot of the content that we now are trialing out for 5G is coming from our Verizon Media Group because one of the first 5G labs we have actually inside Verizon Media Group for them to be innovating on the next-generation content, with animation, and holograms and whatever you can think about. So we have good synergy between Verizon Media Group and our network business, which is extremely crucial for our success going forward.","Operator","Your last question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners.","Michael McCormack","Hans, maybe just a quick comment on the wireless side. Obviously, very strong phone adds in the quarter. Just from a competitive landscape, are you seeing a share-taking opportunity here with, I guess, potentially Sprint and T-Mobile -- I don't want to call it distracted, but obviously quite busy. And how that situation might change as you go through 2020? ","Then secondly, I guess for Hans also, on the wireline side, are there any opportunities to carve out some of those assets? I know we've been talking about this for years. But anything that you can see out there that might make sense? And then maybe just one last one for Matt on the legacy pricing pressure within wireline. What exactly are seeing? Maybe just elaborate on what you're seeing as far as pricing pressures go.","Hans Vestberg","So when it comes to the wireless, and the -- first of all, we think the third quarter was very similar in -- the competitive landscape in the third quarter was very similar to the second quarter. I mean there were some iconic launches there. So first of all, it is a competitive market. We need to remember that. It's just that we are having -- we are on the forefoot right now, as Matt said. We have a good chance to continue to monetize on that, then I think we have a good, compelling network and customer offerings. So I think that's what is important for us. ","Of course, as I've said before, the landscape will change in the future here when it comes to competition. Our strategy will not change. How we are executing right now will be the same. We'll continue to go hard on the network, seeing that the customer-centric organization that we have is really making the right decision for our customer, creating the products they want. So I think that that's what we're going to do, and we're going to have the flexibility to see market opportunities that we saw in the third quarter. We move on them, and we are preparing our structure, our products and our organization for doing that.","Matthew Ellis","Yes, Mike. On the wireline side, the legacy pricing pressures that you questioned about. I mean obviously, we're seeing the pressure, both from volume and a pricing standpoint. It's not really dissimilar to what we've seen in the past few quarters, but that's going to continue as customers continue to transition to fiber-based services. That's why we have been doing -- rolling out more fiber, as you know in our One Fiber initiative that's going to give us more opportunities to sell into those customers as they move off of legacy products. And our fiber build has continued to gain momentum, increased a little bit in third quarter of over 1,500 route miles a month on average in the quarter. So we're getting to a good momentum there, and that will open up additional opportunities for us as we go forward to replace those legacy volumes.","Michael McCormack","Hey, Matt, any comment just on the wireline assets? Anything out there that might be interesting?","Matthew Ellis","No. I think we've done a good job over the years. And when you look at the assets we have now, they fit within the portfolio. Obviously, if anything comes up, we continue to look but nothing major that we see immediately in front of us there.","Brady Connor","Hey, look that's all the time we have for questions today. Before we end the call, I want to hand it back over to Hans for a few closing comments.","Hans Vestberg","So a quick summary. I mean as I said in the beginning, I mean, I'm satisfied how the team have executed on our strategy in this quarter. We continue to execute well on our network, 4G and 5G, and One Fiber, as Matt talked about. Our customer-centric model is starting to pay off big time with the concerted offerings in the market, both for Verizon Business Group, Verizon Media Group and Verizon Consumer Group. You continue to see us hammering on the leadership in 5G, very important for us. A lot of headway or a lot of progress in this quarter especially, and now 50 markets up, 13 NFL stadiums, a couple of arenas that host both hockey and basketball as well. So -- and 5G Home coming out. So continued progress there. We have more to do in the fourth quarter, which is exciting. And then, of course, we continue with the discipline in the financial environment that we're all in and executing very carefully but also taking opportunities when we see them in the marketplace. So all in all, I'm pleased with the quarter, and we are happy with the momentum that we're creating going into the fourth quarter. So thank you very much for being on the call today.","Brady Connor","Yes. Thanks, everyone.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks, David. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I\u2019m here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.","We appreciate you joining us earlier than our usual time this morning. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be made available on our website.","I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.","The quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Fran takes you through the details of our quarterly performance, I would like to cover a special item that is included in our reported results on Slide 3. For the second quarter of 2014, we reported earnings of $1.01 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a pre-tax gain of $707 million related to the sale of 700 megahertz A block spectrum licenses.","On the after tax basis, this gain increased reported net income by $434 million or $0.10 per share. As we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019ve accounted for the gain on the sale of these licenses at the corporate level, so it is not part of our Wireless segment results. Excluding the effect of this non-operational item, adjusted earnings per share was $0.91 for the second quarter compared with $0.73 a year ago or growth of 24.7%. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings per share were $1.76 compared with $1.41 last year up 24.8%.","Keep in mind that the $1.76 per share first half result does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless for the entire first quarter since the transaction closed on February 21st.","As discussed on our first quarter call, full ownership for the quarter represents as an additional $0.07 per share of earnings. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We entered 2014 with the great confidence in our ability to grow the business profitably while making the necessary capital investments to position us for the future.","In the first quarter, we closed the Vodafone transaction and delivered strong financial results. On our last earnings call, I indicated that we exited the first quarter with better momentum and expected that to carry forward.","As you can see from our second quarter results, we delivered on what we said, producing very strong customer growth metrics and Wireless and FiOS, in driving excellent top line growth and profitability.","We are competing effectively in all markets and executing our strategy which is focused on providing network reliability and a great customer experience.","Over the past two and a half years, we have delivered consistent high quality earnings results with double-digit year-over-year growth and reported and adjusted earnings per share in nine of the last 10 quarters.","Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.91 represented another quarter of more than 20% growth. This sustained earnings growth demonstrates our ability to execute effectively in all parts of the business in a highly competitive environment.","Our consolidated revenue performance was strong with growth accelerating to 5.7%, our highest growth rate in the past six quarters. In Wireless, we had a great quarter of both growth and profitability. 4G device activations were exceptionally strong resulting in $2.3 million 4G postpaid net adds. Total postpaid net additions top $1.4 million, total operating revenue grew 7.5% with service revenue growth of 5.9% and our EBITDA service margin was 50.3%.","In Wireline, we also had a good quarter with improved growth and margin expansion. Quarterly operating revenue grew 0.3% which is a milestone led by consumer growth of 5.3% as we continue to drive FiOS penetration and customer adoption of our quantum broadbrand and video products.","Wireline EBITDA increased 4.9% and the EBITDA margin improved to 23.2% up 90 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year.","Our cash generation continues to be very strong enabling us to consistently invest in our networks for future growth and innovation. Free cash flow was $3.3 billion in the quarter and totaled $6.3 billion for the first half.","Now, let\u2019s get into our second quarter performance in more detail starting with consolidated results on Slide 5.","Total operating revenue grew 5.7% in the quarter continuing our consistent and improving top line growth trend. Revenue increases were once again driven by Wireless and FiOS. As we indicated last quarter, new revenue streams from machine-to-machine and Telematics while still relatively small are beginning to emerge and make positive contributions with revenue growth of more than 50% in the quarter.","Our continued focus on driving process improvements and cost-efficiencies is also paying off. In the second quarter, adjusted operating income increased 10.4%. To my earlier point about consistent earnings growth, we have also delivered double-digit growth and adjusted operating income in nine of the 10 quarters.","On an adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA grew 6.4% to $11.1 billion. And our EBITDA margin was up 30 basis points to 35.4%.","Let\u2019s take a look at our cash flow results on Slide 6.","As we previously discussed, it is important to know the lack of comparative ability between the current and prior periods in our statement of cash flows as result of the transaction to require a full ownership of Verizon Wireless.","In 2014, the cash flows from operations line will include higher cash payments for interests and taxes. The cash flows from financing section will have lower cash distributions to Vodafone and higher overall dividend payments to our shareholders due to the increase and shares outstanding.","In the first half of 2014, cash flows from operations worth $14.8 billion which included an incremental $1.2 billion of cash interest payments, $1.5 billion in cash taxes and $800 million of pension funding that we did not have in the first half of 2013. In spite of this additional uses of cash and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $6.3 billion year-to-date.","Again, the key point on cash flows is a simple one. The amount of cash available task will be significantly greater this year than some of the former partnership structure, 45% of any excess cash at Wireless would at some point be distributed to Vodafone. So even after a higher interest payment and greater cash taxes, we will have more cash available at the corporate level than prior to the transaction.","I would also point out that we received $2.4 billion in cash flow in the quarter from the transaction to sell wireless licenses to T-Mobile. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.3 billion and we\u2019re $8.5 billion year-to-date up about $900 million or 11.5%. Wireless capital spending in the second quarter was $2.5 billion. And through the first half totaled $5.3 billion, well ahead of what we spent through the first half of last year.","We are investing to proactively stay ahead of demand. As we\u2019ve said, our capital investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network primarily by increasing network density and the point spectrum. We are actively deploying AWS spectrum across our nationwide footprint and currently have more than 350 markets with AWSF or XLTE as we are branding it. The continued deployment of AWS and the addition of small sales distributed in terms of systems and the in building solutions will fortify our network advantage.","In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter and $2.7 billion year-to-date which we\u2019re down $219 million or 7.4%. Our balance sheet remained strong and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business. Gross stat of just under $110 billion was essentially unchanged from the last quarter. Our Net Debt position improved to about $104 billion and the Net Debt to adjusted EBITDA Ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.4 times.","Now let\u2019s move into review with the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7.","Our consistent investment in Wireless is the foundation of our success and drives our leadership in network quality, reliability and the overall customer experience. Our capital investment strategy is focused on adding capacity to the network to meet increasing 4G device adoption which will drive higher customer usage.","As I highlighted earlier, we have an exceptional quarter of 4G Smartphone and tablet activations with increase in gross addition and upgrades. We also did an excellent job in terms of customer retention. The increase in device volume was driven by a combination of factors starting with the compelling value proposition of our new MORE Everything plans on our high quality 4G LTE network. As you know, we refresh our pricing in framework and value proposition in the first quarter.","Within this plans, we are providing customers a choice between the traditional two years service contracts with subsidize devices of Verizon Edge where customers make monthly installment payments with their devices that receive discounted monthly service pricing. We are also driving 4G device adoption with attractive tablet offers. Our sales strategy in the second quarter dramatically improved customer growth which created strong minimum for us as we entered the second half of the year.","Total Wireless revenues grew to $21.5 billion up 7.5%. Our service revenues grew 5.9% to $18.1 billion. This was the first full quarter of discounted service pricing for customers on Verizon Edge. A portion of the sequential decline in the rate of growth was due to the tradeoff between the lower service revenue and higher monthly equipment billings. The percentage of phone activations by customers choosing Edge increased to about 18% in the quarter up from about 13% in the first quarter.","In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 6.8%. As I highlighted earlier, our service EBITDA margin was 50.3%, 50 basis point higher than a year ago. The estimated benefit to EBITDA in the quarter from Edge was not significantly different than in the first quarter due to the cumulative impact of service price discounts in the program.","Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on Slide 8.","Our service revenue growth was once again driven by 4G smartphone and tablet adoption as well as increased data usage. Retailed postpaid revenue per account or ARPA moved 4.7% which was down from 6.3% in the first quarter. Again, more than half of the decline in the rate of growth resulted from this being the first full quarter of discounted monthly service pricing from Edge.","Since ARPA is calculated using service revenue, it does not capture the monthly equipment billings from customers on the Edge program. In the second quarter, monthly equipment billings totaled about $180 million which was significantly higher than the first quarter. We continued to see good additional device adoption within our customer accounts. We ended the second quarter with an average of 2.8 retail connections per account, an increase of 3.7%. About 55% of our 35.2 million postpaid accounts have subscribed to MORE Everything shared data plans. Increased usage per device and per account continues to drive step ups to higher data tiers.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 9.","We ended the quarter with $104.6 million total retail connections. Our industry leading postpaid connection space reached $98.6 million and prepaid totaled just over $6 million. Postpaid gross additions in the quarter were significantly higher both sequentially and year-over-year. Our 4.2 million postpaid gross add were 18.1% higher than a year ago in terms of the gross add mix, more than half for smartphones at about 40% more internet devices primarily tablets.","Our retail postpaid term rate of that 9.4% was much improved from the first quarter and only one basis point higher than the second quarter of last year. As we previously said, postpaid net additions were very strong and totaled 1.441 million up 900,000 sequentially at about 500,000 from last year.","As I highlighted earlier, our postpaid net additions included 2.3 million new 4G devices. Within that total more than 1 million were 4G smartphones and 1.2 million were 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds totaled a positive 304,000 as the 1 million new 4G smartphones were partially offset by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones.","For the third straight quarter, we had company record setting tablet net adds. While 4G smartphones provide the highest value, tablets provide a very good incremental value through increased data consumption and lower churn at the account level. Tablets also have a lower cost subsidy than smartphones. We see tablet as the highly profitable growth opportunity with significant headroom in terms of further penetration. Our postpaid tablet base is only 5.4 million. So we have a great opportunity with these devices to generate growth in 2014 and beyond.","Turning now to customer upgrades. Our postpaid upgrade rate increased sequentially to 7.1% for the quarter. Once again, these were high quality upgrades. About 90% of all upgrades in the quarter were smartphones. Consistent with our plan to drive 4G smartphone penetration about 1.4 million or 23% of our smartphone upgrades were from basic phones. About half of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G which we monetized through higher data usage and lower cost to serve.","Next, let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 and take a look at device activations and our continued progress in terms of 4G adoption and usage. Postpaid device activations which we include both gross adds and upgrades increased both sequentially and year-over-year. Second quarter activations totaled 11.1 million up 10.2%. Smartphone activations totaled 8.3 million, 92% of which were 4G.","Our smartphone penetration increased to nearly 75% of our total phones. We ended the quarter with 63.5 million smartphones and about 69% of those were 4G. So we still have about 20 million 3G smartphones and almost 22 million basic phones in our base which provides us with a good upgrade opportunity. Our overall 4G device penetration continues to steadily increase. At the end of the second quarter nearly 55% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G, up from 33% a year ago.","Data and video usage on our network continues to rise. Currently about 76% of total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. We carry more traffic on our Wireless network than any of our competitors. This network advantage continues to be acknowledged by national surveys from widely recognized third party organizations. More importantly, our own stringent drive testing shows that we are continuing to improve our network performance.","Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 11.","In the Consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the second quarter, Consumer revenue growth was 5.3% making it eight consecutive quarters of growth in excess of 4%. Mass markets which includes small business grew 4.2%.","FiOS now represents 75% of consumer revenue and we are sustaining strong double-digit revenue growth. In the second quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 13.4% driven by customer additions, pricing actions and Quantum penetration. We continue to see strong adoption of Quantum as 55% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribe to the higher speeds ranging from 50 to 500 megabits per second.","We continue to enrich the customer value proposition and drive investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. We recently introduced FiOS Quantum TV with enhanced features and functionality in terms of storage, recording capabilities and control of content. While still in the early stages, we are pleased with the initial adoption of this differentiated TV viewing experience by existing and new customers.","In our FiOS markets, we continue to focus on adding quality customers and generating profitable growth in a very competitive market environment. In Broadband, we added 139,000 new FiOS Internet customers in the second quarter and now have 6.3 million subscribers representing 40% penetration.","Overall, net broadband subscribers in the quarter were a positive 46,000. In FiOS video, we added 100,000 new subscribers in the quarter. So we now have 5.4 million subscribers representing 35% penetration.","During the quarter, we also converted about 70,000 customers from copper to fiber. This network initiative continues to be important as we systematically upgrade our network and provide higher quality of service.","Aside from maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services which result in additional recurring revenue.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 12 and review our overall Wireline segment revenue and profitability. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the second quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $70 million or 1.9%. Revenue declined in Legacy Transport Services and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications which are smaller in scale.","Strategic Services which include Private IP, Ethernet, Datacenter, Cloud, Security and Managed Services, grew 3%. In our Global Wholesale business, quarterly revenues declined $92 million or 5.5%.","While we continue to see healthy demand for Ethernet services, positive growth continues to be more than offset by price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges.","As I highlighted earlier, total Wireline growth turned positive this quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to see some fluctuation in year-over-year growth rates. We are making progress but are not satisfied, we have much more to do here. We are focused on continuous improvements particularly in driving operating efficiencies.","Wireline EBITDA increased 4.9% and the EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points in the quarter to 23.2%. We continue to target increased Wireline EBITDA and margin expansion in 2014. As Lowell and I have both stated we continually look for opportunities to streamline the business and monetize non-strategic assets. To that end, on July 1st, we closed the transaction for the sale of the unit within our public sector business with revenues of about $600 million in 2013. A majority of which was equipment.","Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. As always, the foundation of our success is the steady and consistent investment in networks and platforms. These networks and platforms form the building blocks for the innovative products and services that will fuel our growth and improve the customer experience.","Our Wireless and Wireline networks continue to be the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we build our competitive advantage. We had a strong first half of 2014, with consolidated revenue growth of 5.2% and 36% adjusted EBITDA margin representing 90 basis points of margin expansion.","We continue to deliver high-quality double-digit earnings growth and we have a much stronger cash position with the full access to Wireless cash flows. We have great confidence heading into the second half of the year and we remain on track to achieve our revenue growth, margin expansion and capital spending targets for the year.","We have strong momentum in Wireless and expect to build on that strength driving further penetration of 4G smartphones and tablets while extending our network leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets, and continue to differentiate ourselves with the superior Quantum broadband and video products.","In the Enterprise space, we will continue to aggressively market key platforms, demonstrating that we have a unique set of capabilities to provide for customer solutions. As always, we will remain extremely focused on profitable revenue growth and will continue to drive network and cost structure improvements, utilizing our Verizon Lean Six-Sigma principles.","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.","Michael Stefanski","Thank you, Fran. David, we\u2019re now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey guys, thanks. So one in Wireless and one the Wireline, if I may. Wireless postpaid account growth reaccelerated on 2Q, what do you think drove that rebound on account growth? And you said you have some strong momentum. Can we expect to continue through the rest of the year? And then on Wireline revenue was positive for the first time in years and margins improved more than we expected. What should we look forward there going forward for both revenue and margins? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Hi. Thanks, Phil, good morning. On the account growth, look, I think it was a number of things. I think the key to us right now is I would center around customer choice. We are giving our customers the choice to select what best fits them whether it\u2019s the EDGE program or it\u2019s the legacy adoption of a subsidy model.","And as you can see from a service revenue growth performance, we are really centered around driving the attachment rate of devices generating more data on the individual network. So we\u2019re attracting customers to our network based on its performance. You can tell from that a customer choice perspective, many of our customers selected to stay with the legacy subsidy model as, I as I said on my prepared remarks, our take rate was only 18% for the quarter.","I know I said in the first quarter, I expected that to accelerate to 30% with the introduction of indirect channels and the competitive environment. But during the holiday season, we really stuck with our game of giving customers the choice of that Edge program, but we ran a lot of promotions around handsets related to Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day. And I think that drove significant traffic to our stores. So from here, you should expect the same thing going into the third quarter that we will continue to address that marketplace.","As far as our base goes, we saw great progress in our base by really reducing the churn. And as I said before, we were going to systematically address our base and take care of the customers who are coming out of contract and we felt that would churn to go somewhere else, we proactively went after those customers and made sure that they were satisfied with their pricing model and with their experience. And I think that proved to be the right model for us.","I think we also addressed our basic to smartphone customer base by having a very good quarter, this quarter, of 1.4 million phones from basic phones up into the 4G smartphone category and also 3G to 4G smartphones.","So when you consolidate all of this with the excellent tablet growth quarter we had \u2013 and again, I think tablets are extremely good for the industry, not just for Verizon. And from an industry perspective, I think everybody will see the same thing that says, these tablets are lower subsidy, they reduce churn in the account level. So we see that when someone has a tablet in the account, their churn is lower than the overall churn of a normal customer base. This device drives incremental revenue from an access standpoint.","But more importantly, I think, and I\u2019ll give you a data point here, these 4G tablets drive more usage on the network than a 3G smartphone. So when you consolidate that into an account level pricing arrangement, customers buy up because they\u2019re using more data. So this is all good.","And then of course, as we mentioned in the beginning from a service revenue perspective and account growth, machine-to-machine is becoming at a more important role there. So I\u2019ll stop there, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have more questions around Wireless.","From a Wireline perspective, I guess I would put it this way. FiOS continues to be the driver of the Wireline revenue growth, continue to center around our pricing actions on the FiOS platform, continue to innovate and move people into our Quantum Broadband which provides an incremental increase to us. We launched our \u2013","Operator","Michael Rollins from Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Thanks, good morning. Fran, if I could just ask a couple of questions. First on the Wireless side, with respect to phone ad, should that a follow some of the historical, I guess, you call it seasonality that you\u2019ve seen in the past where I think last year, you talked about increasing ad performance as you moved through each quarter?","And on the strategic side, could you talk about maybe what else Verizon could consider from an asset optimization perspective and maybe just an update on how things like VDMS and connected car are doing? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Okay. Thanks, Michael. So on the phone and net adds, obviously, again, as I said, we came out strong during the marketing periods of Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day and normally, the second quarter is only better than the first quarter. I think that through this year of obviously for the back half of this year, we\u2019re going to have several dynamic devices come to market that will certainly fuel for the industry, a lot of opportunity for growth here.","So I think from our perspective, we\u2019ll stay to our game plan. I\u2019m not going to predict at this point what net adds will be from our phone net add for the third quarter that has a lot around that the competitive environment and customer base, but I would anticipate that you\u2019ll see strong performance from Verizon Wireless.","As far as our other strategic areas, so Verizon Digital Media Services launched their commercial service this year. We have a number of customers who are under contract and we\u2019re actually starting to generate revenue all from that platform. It\u2019s early stages here. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity within that platform and we will continue to move on that strategy.","As far as Telematics goes, this goes into our machine-to-machine category. And as I said in my prepared remarks here, I will tell you, this was one of the highest connection quarters we had from a machine-to-machine on a companywide basis which would include Verizon Wireless, Hughes Telematics and some of our enterprise customers. And that fueled that 50% year-over-year growth. So machine-to-machine continues to be a critical component.","I would also tell you, if you have a chance to visit one of our destination stores with Verizon Wireless, you immediately walk in a store and you can visually see all of the technology around gaming and music and fitness that can be connected to our network. And these things are being sold quite substantially on a quarterly basis through our Verizon Wireless distribution stores.","So again, this is a very important category, I think, not only for us but for the industry. And as we\u2019ve continually said, we believe that machine-to-machine will be a future growth engine for us for years to come and that is consistent with our strategy.","Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Thank you.","Michael Stefanski","Okay. David, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much, good morning. Fran, you talked about the strong cash flow in the quarter. It looks like there\u2019s an opportunity potentially for bonus depreciation to be extended again. You had $6 billion of cash on a balance sheet here. It looks like you\u2019re doing some refis on your balance sheet. Can you just talk about your overall financial strategy? It looked an opportunity here to delever a little bit more to refi, but there\u2019s also spectrum auctions coming in. And how that all place into dividend and policy given the 20% plus EPS growth? Is there an opportunity here despite the leverage to maybe see faster dividend growth? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, Simon. So in a cash flow, yes. I mean, obviously, we have a significant strong cash flow here. And obviously, we said that at the onset of acquiring Verizon Wireless that we will get 100% ownership of those cash flows.","As I said at the beginning of this year, look, the strategy right now for us is to build cash on the balance sheet to prepare for the AWS-3 auction that\u2019s coming in November and that\u2019s the strategic initiative we had moving into this year.","So we have gross debt at about the same level. Now, that\u2019s been came down from a high of $114 billion when we closed the Vodafone transaction, that\u2019s at $110 billion. But you see us accumulating that cash on the balance sheet to prepare for the auction.","As far as the overall refinancing of long-term debt here, you\u2019ve seen us to be very proactive in a marketplace taking the opportunity of the low interest rate market, repositioning the debt that we borrowed at the close and repositioning our towers. So we\u2019re strategically trying to push up the long-term debt longer at a more fixed lower rate than we had. And we will continue to work those towers into the future. I really won\u2019t talk about our future plans at this point. It would be inappropriate to do that.","As far as bonus depreciation goes, look, I\u2019m optimistic but I\u2019m not because here we sit in July, there\u2019s not much activity moving around us. There\u2019s many things that the government has to deal with including the highway build that\u2019s pertinent to us because of pensions moving that\u2019s included in that bill. There\u2019s also the Internet Freedom Act that has to get passed or else consumers are going to be detrimented here at the end of this year.","And then of course, we have the overall tax reform in bonus depreciation. So look, I think, we\u2019ll have to wait to see, but as the year runs out, bonus depreciation becomes less and less impactful.","So we\u2019re hopeful that the government will do the right thing here to stimulate the economy and investment around this but it\u2019s hard for me to predict that. So at this point, we\u2019re not counting on any decrease in our federal tax payments because of bonus depreciation. And as I said at the beginning of the year, this was about $1 billion of incremental tax impact to us by not having that Bonus Depreciation.","As far as dividend policy goes, look, I think we\u2019ve both Lowell and I have reiterate that we understand the dividend policy is important. Our Board of Directors understand the dividend policy is important but it is a Board of Director decision, so I can\u2019t sit here today and tell you what that policy will be. But we do understand it\u2019s important and I think we\u2019ve reflected our board has been very aggressive in our dividend policy over the last seven years and so I think that should set the stage for the future.","Michael Stefanski","David, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America","Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, two if I could. Just first, Fran, obviously there\u2019s a lot of focus on wireless service margin this quarter, from the comment of last quarter that there was next vacation that we\u2019re going to get a huge increase in the installment payment plan take rate. There was an equivalent expectation that we\u2019re going to get a lot of upfront revenue recognition and that would have helped the margins a lot. But that obviously didn\u2019t really take place. At 18% take rate, that probably gave you a couple of hundred million relative to street expectations.","You said that the installment payment plan impact was about the same at this quarter as last quarter, but it was net of the service price discounts. Could you parse that out between the impact that you took from a cash perspective of giving lower prices versus the revenue benefit non-cash that you got from the upfront accounting related issues that going to the installment payment plan?","And I guess, the second question would be more of a strategic one. I know you guys have been working on video and pushing video through the wireless network from a TV anywhere perspective buying content partnering people through the last couple of years. Could you talked a little bit about what the talk now of consolidation of the content environment, how your strategy is unfolding, how you\u2019re working to try to bring video content into the wireless environment so you can monetize it over to 4G network? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Good. Thanks, David. So as long \u2013 look, on the service margin, I think here\u2019s the way I would answer this is that we produced a 50.3% margin on extremely high volume growth under a subsidy model and I think that\u2019s the key for this quarter. So we really didn\u2019t get much benefit from the Edge program because the take rate was only 18%.","We said that the billings around Edge were $180 million, so you can do the backwards math there. But if you look at the actual EBITDA impact of Edge I said was similar to the first quarter. As far as the pricing refresh that we did in the first quarter to respond to the competitive environment, again, there is some impact there from dilution on customers that are moving and that we are as I said addressing from a churn perspective. But this is all good for us because we maintain those customers on an appropriate plan. They stay with Verizon Wireless. They\u2019re adding tablets. They\u2019re increasing their ARPU again.","So the way I would venture to say on this one without getting to too much math on service revenue pricing and so forth, if you take the $180 million and add that to the ARPA, I think you\u2019d come out with a number that\u2019s significantly higher than the 4.7% from a recurring revenue standpoint if you will. So I think from a 50.3% quarter based on the growth that we had on a subsidy model, I think it\u2019s just an outstanding quarter for us from an overall profitability on Verizon Wireless. So I\u2019ll stand on that one and leave it at that.","As far as content goes, look, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated through our NFL agreement, some of our IndyCar agreement and some other agreements that we have around some sporting networks, that we will continue to search for those opportunities that make content available to our wireless customers without a linear TV or satellite TV subscription.","And I think that\u2019s important for the wireless user as we see more and more of the younger generation are cutting the quarter in their home and want their content either via or the internet or wireless, that\u2019s the strategy that we hold. If you\u2019re asking me, do we need to own the content? We continue to position ourselves but we believe we do not need to own content to be successful in this ecosystem, but we just need to get the rights for that content. We understand that content providers want to be paid for those rights and as long as that\u2019s a worker commercial model for us then we will continue on that strategy.","I\u2019d also highlight that one of the big things here that\u2019s coming to market is of course Multicast which will really enhance the experience for our customers around watching video and also extremely efficient for the wireless industry to provide that video through their network without consuming a lot of spectrum and a lot of capacity. So we will start to embed chips in our handsets here, the back half for this year.","The network will be ready by the end of the third quarter to actually launch Multicast. We won\u2019t go commercial with that until \u201815, but the network will be ready and it\u2019s a matter of getting the handsets in customers\u2019 hands and then obviously getting the content which we demonstrated with the Super Bowl this past January.","For those types of the events that we think will be very, very really consumed by the consumer on real time live type events. So more to come around the whole video strategy of Wireless but I think the breakthrough point here will be once Multicast technology is up and running and launched.","Michael Stefanski","Okay, David, we\u2019ll take the next question now.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","Great, thanks, guys. Fran, can you give us a sense of what percentage of your postpaid base takes a 10 gigabyte or larger bucket and maybe how that\u2019s changed over time? Just trying to get a sense of the up strategy some more tablets into the base. And then on the Wireline side, that\u2019s more of the follow up. You saw a 100 basis points year-over-year improvement in margins but you didn\u2019t talk about somewhat that one time that drove the revenue, did that also affect the margins or is this 100 basis point improvement sort of a good run rate for what you can expect for the second half of the year? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, John. So first, on the 10 gigabit plan, we don\u2019t disclose where our customers sit within the bands. But what I will tell you is it that we have quarter-to-quarter over the last three quarters seen an increased in the amount of customers taking the 10 gigabit plan and pricing up.","So we watched on a quarterly basis the number of customers that buy down in data bundles and buy up in data bundles and that over the last several quarters we\u2019ve had a significant net positive in buying up in data bundles. So from that perspective the takeaway will be is that we continue to see an increase in customers buying up in their data bundles and that includes the 10 gigabit plan.","As far as the Wireline margin, look, we\u2019ve said from the beginning of this year, Lowell and I were very opportunistic on increasing the Wireline margin. Now some of this is seasonality. Second quarter is always good. Third quarter tends to have some seasonality into it. But look, overall I think you should see that we are moving the Wireline business in the right direction from a profitability standpoint.","And there are a lot of things that we still need to work on obviously. As I\u2019ve said FiOS is the big driver on the top line, copper migration continues to be an important strategic initiative for us. But I don\u2019t want to down plate the fact that our VLSS, we\u2019ve been at this for two years and we\u2019re now starting to see the benefits of a lot of these projects around efficiencies and cost cutting starting to come through.","So again, that is part of this, you should see us improve our productivity especially around the new Quantum TV where we can put a media server into the home and start to get some real efficiencies in the install process and we think that will happen entering in 2015.","So again, I think that\u2019s part of it. The other thing too is this that we can\u2019t lose side of the fact that we continue to look at this portfolio and as I\u2019ve said in my prepared remarks we did divest of a branch of our public sector business which was about $600 million of revenue that last year.","You will see the impact of that going into the third quarter. So we will lose that revenue in third quarter, so that\u2019s going to show up in our public sector business. But from an overall margin standpoint, that\u2019s going to help the profitability of this company. And this is again looking at non-strategic businesses that are what I would say is not our niche in the business and we need to divest to them. And Lowell and I continue to look at things that we can divest of that are best for overall shareholder value. And we will continue with that.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","Great, thanks, Fran.","Michael Stefanski","David, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Fran Shammo","Mike, are you on mute?","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Can you hear me?","Fran Shammo","Yes, now I can. Go ahead.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Sorry about that. Yes, Fran, just thinking about the net add numbers, the 2.3 million 4G LTE postpaid versus the 1.4 overall. Can you just sort of map us through that, what you\u2019re saying as far basic and features phone sub losses or migration? You talked about migrations, but you\u2019re saying is more pressure standpoint from the competitors. And then secondly on FiOS and these targeted MDUs more recently, what you\u2019re saying with their expected changing video behaviors among that youth demographic, maybe just a comment on what kind of returns you guys get on a broadband only sub? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Okay, let me start with the MDU side. So from an MDU perspective, look, these continues to be one of our strong penetration gains. And as I\u2019ve said before, New York City is still our lowest penetrated market but it is our highest year-over-year gain. And a lot of this has to do with MDUs. But this is a \u2013 it\u2019s a challenging business because the average tenant of an MDU in New York, I think the last time I looked was eight months.","So these units change and of course the strategy, part of the strategy is to accumulate the new residence coming in to continue to use the FiOS demand. But obviously within this younger generation, a year ago, we tested the ability to have them select whether they wanted large TV bundles and lower Internet speeds or high Internet speeds and lower TV bundles. And what we saw is the majority of this said does this segment selected the highest speed that they could get and didn\u2019t really care about how many TV stations they got because most of them are consuming their video via Internet.","Again, this is just another position for us of why we\u2019ve gone the symmetry within our broadband offers. We just launched that this week, so you will see that heading the consumer market which symmetry on all of our broadband offers. We launched it six months ago in our small business segment, so this is again another strategy which we think is important for that generation who really wants the highest speed that they can get and they want the symmetry in that speed. So that will continue to be an overall concentration for us.","As far as the handsets and all, look, I think that you can probably do the backwards map here and we said that we added 2.3 million 4G, LTE phones overall. We\u2019ve said that we had million 4G smartphones net adds for the quarter. So with the 304,000 net number the majority of those losses were basic phones and then the rest were made with 3G.","So again, you can see that the basic phone category or I would consider this to lower end phone category continues to be the category that we lose but I will say that we made substantial improvement from what we saw on the first quarter with all the pricing actions, the retention tools that we put in place and some of the new pricing tools that we put in place.","Overall, I think we significantly improved and that came through on the operating results of Verizon Wireless.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Hey, Fran, just a quicky on the EIP, could you just give us a sense for how that paced through the quarter? Was it accelerating throughout? And then what should we think about for the full year on the EIP uptake? What\u2019s your expectation?","Fran Shammo","I think I would put it this way. What I saw was in our store channel, it was pretty much relatively flat. The increase came through the indirect channel when we launched that. Right now I would say that I think one important piece of information here as well is that on the front line our sales representatives make the same compensation whether they sell on Edge plan or a legacy subsidy model.","There was no difference in their compensations. So again, this comes down to the important ingredient that this is truly a customer choice. The rep shows them both models and the customer chooses.","So as far as going forward, look, I think that we are on pace to be somewhere between this 18% to 20% but again, when you think about all of the new phones that are coming in the back half of the year through the indirect channel, this could escalate a bit on us. The competitive environment has a lot to do with this. But right now under current course and current environment, I think that the 18% to 20% is really where we sit.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Great, thanks Fran.","Michael Stefanski","David, next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Smithen on Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie","Thanks. With Edge adoption at just 18%, the fall in year-over-year seems to imply a repricing of non-Edge base. I think you said you had some churn mitigation promotions in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about that and also where do you expect year-over-year ARPA stabilize?","Fran Shammo","Yes. So I think Kevin as I\u2019ve said at the beginning, I think you have to do a little of backwards math here because the Edge plan if you take that 180 million billing number that I gave you and you look at ARPA, I think what you\u2019ll see is if you calculate back in the returning monthly and equipment revenue which in essence would have been service revenue, I think your percentage increase would be relatively flat with the first quarter and some past quarters. So, again I think that the service revenue impact and the ARPA impact is really Edge-related.","Now, there is some of course service pricing discounts in there and we are moving as we said proactively some of our customers who are out of contract and we think that they have a high propensity to churn. We are proactively moving them to the Edge pricing. But we\u2019re doing this very, very systematically. And so there will be a little bit of pressure there, but I think if you do that backwards math that I gave you, I think you\u2019ll get to the true numbers of what the ARPA growth would have been with this recurring equipment revenue in it.","Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie","And how should we think about the AWS refinancing? Will this be an additional capital raise or funded out of cash on-hand and how should we think about your sort of leverage targets with the spectrum auction? And it sounds like you want to be very aggressive with that.","Fran Shammo","Well I think the way you want to think about this is it is an auction. So I\u2019m not going to talk about how we think we\u2019re going to pay for that auction because I\u2019m not going to give anybody information of how much I\u2019m willing to spend for the auction. So I think we\u2019ll just wait there. As I said, the strategy is to build cash, prepare for the auction and we\u2019ll execute accordingly. So more to come on that in the latter back of the year.","Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie","Thanks.","Michael Stefanski","David, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.","Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore Partners","Oh, great, thanks. Two if I may. First, just in terms of the outlook on the top line for the remainder of the year and you guys have had a very strong first half of the year up almost 6% revenue growth year-over-year in the second quarter. And the outlook for the year is only about 4%. I\u2019m wondering if that is just conservative stance at this point in the year or if there\u2019s something that we should look out for in particular as we examine our back half for the year projections. And then yet another question around EIP. I\u2019m just wondering if we could get a census to where the receivable currently stood or maybe the change in receivable over quarter-over-quarter. Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So on the 4%, look, being the CFO, we generally are conservative. So I\u2019ll stick to the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year which was top line growth of 4% plus, so I\u2019ll stick to that. As far as the balance sheet goes, if you look at our balance sheet, the change in the AR is directly related to the Edge program, so you can look at that change and pretty much come to your answer.","Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore Partners","Thank you for taking the questions.","Michael Stefanski","Okay, last question?","Operator","Your last question today will come from Jennifer Fritzsche from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Jennifer Fritzsche \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great, thank you for taking the question. Fran, you have mentioned a lot about the AWS-3 auction. I know there\u2019s a lot of complications and a lot of blurriness around it. But I\u2019ve not heard you talk openly about the broadcast or incentive auction. Your closest peer obviously made a big monetary number, put a monetary number with that. And I just was wondering your current thought as you stand here today.","Fran Shammo","Yes. So thanks, Jennifer. So look \u2013 I mean we are focused on AWS-3 auction and the reason we\u2019re focused on that is it will start November 13th, deposits will be required. We actually know exactly what the rules are. The procedures for that auction will be announced sometime in the next coming weeks. So that\u2019s really the focal point for us. As far as the broadcast spectrum goes, look, currently there are no final adoptive rules on this. So it\u2019s hard for us to sit here and make a comment on something that has not been finalized. So I think that would be premature for us.","I know what others have done, but look we are focused on AWS. We\u2019ll get through that. We\u2019ll see what the broadcast spectrum final rules are and then you\u2019ll hear more from us when that happens. But at this point, I\u2019m not going to make anymore comments around the broadcast.","Michael Stefanski","That\u2019s all time we have for questions for today. But before we end the call, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Fran.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, Mike. Just a couple of quick closing comments. So look we had an extremely strong first half of 2014 in terms of our buy-in growth and financial performance. Importantly, we closed the Vodafone transaction and now have sole ownership of the Wireless asset.","To the first half of this year, we have exceeded our revenue growth targets and delivered strong earnings growth. We have great momentum heading into the second half and we are competing well in all of our key strategic areas. Our cash generation is very strong and we have great confidence in our ability to execute on our strategy and grow this business profitably while making the necessary capital investments to position us for the future. We are excited about our growth opportunities and we will continue to invest, innovate and deliver for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.","Thank you so much for joining us today and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."],"21379":["Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call October 23, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Brady Connor - SVP, IR","Matthew Ellis - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","David Barden - Bank of America","Philip Cusick - JPMorgan","John Hodulik - UBS","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson","Michael Rollins - Citi","Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo","Jeff Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Partners","Walter Piecyk - BTIG","Matt Niknam - Deutsche Bank","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our investor relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the third quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of $1.19 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to walk you through.","Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss of $159 million primarily associated with the early debt redemption costs of $476 million; acquisition and integration-related charges of $137 million primarily pertaining to Oath; and a pension and benefit remeasurement credit of $454 million.","The net impact after tax was approximately $120 million or $0.03 per share resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $1.22. Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter up 3.1% compared to $0.98 a year ago. It has been three quarters since the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The effect of this change is illustrated within the table on slide 4.","As a reminder, it results in a reduction of wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue and the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. The impact from this change has been fairly consistent during all three quarters of 2018 with a $0.06 per share impact in the third quarter. We continue to expect the accretive benefit to full year earnings per share to be between $0.27 and $0.31.","The accretive benefit to operating income in 2018 is expected to moderate in 2019 and then become insignificant in 2020 as the timing impacts to revenues and commission costs converge. This will create year-over-year EPS pressure in both 2019 and 2020. For the remainder of this call, unless otherwise noted financial results will exclude the impact of this accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt to take you through the results for the quarter.","Matthew Ellis","Thank you, Brady, and welcome everyone to the first earnings call in the 5G era. Installations of 5Gs Home by Verizon, the world's first ever 5G commercial product, began earlier this month continuing our proud history of driving innovation. It is just the first service of many to come on this new and exciting technology.","In the third quarter, we continued our strong operational and financial performance by executing on the fundamentals with laser focus while retaining and expanding our high-value customer relationships. Our methodical and disciplined capital allocation model affords us the flexibility to compete and win in the marketplace while investing in our best-in-class networks, strengthening the balance sheet, and returning value to shareholders.","Also, during the quarter, our Board approved the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. Critical to our ongoing profitability is the work we are doing across our business excellence initiatives that are transforming all parts of our Company.","In 2018, this has included adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, driving capital efficiencies from the network restructuring began last year, and more recently evolving our IT strategy and the announcement of the voluntary separation program. These initiatives are focused on positioning us to meet the rapidly evolving demands from our customers for years to come in a competitive environment.","Let's move next to slide 6 to discuss our network and technology. During the quarter, we extended our leadership position, delivering the best network performance and overall experience to our valued customers. We won more J.D. Power awards than any other wireless provider for a record 21st time in a row and ranked highest in wireless network performance in all six regions of the U.S. In the most recent Nielsen report on streaming data quality, our reliable network ranks highest in video success ratings.","And finally, we continue to extend our RootMetrics leadership position obtaining the highest percentage of wins nationally. While we are excited to be at the dawn of the 5G era, our 4G LTE network will continue to be a foundation of our services for many years to come. We continue to make enhancements to our 4G network through fiber and small cell densification as well as the deployment of new technologies to provide additional functionality and quality.","5G technology will provide meaningful value above the current network experience. At Verizon, we believe that true 5G requires an ultra-wideband solution, utilizing millimeterwave spectrum to address the full array of use cases that 5G enables.","Our network preparation for nationwide 5G deployment requires deep fiber resources, a vast array of small cells, critical spectrum holdings and mobile edge computing capabilities. All of which we have been assembling for years.","5G Home by Verizon continues our legacy of consumer firsts. We are now providing wireless broadband service using millimeter wave spectrum. This revolutionary product offers customers a wireless in-home Internet experience with speeds and capacity that rival leading wide broadband products available today.","The initial launch of 5G Home on proprietary standards in four markets positions us for a larger rollout in 2019. We are gaining valuable insights ahead of the industry that will drive refinements to the customer experience prior to the arrival of global standards-based equipment.","We have said all along that we intend to be first not only in launching the world's initial 5G commercial product but also the first to deliver true 5G mobility to consumers.","During the quarter, we completed the world's first end-to-end global standards compliant call with a smartphone test device using our network facilities in Minneapolis.","As soon as devices and equipment are available the deployment of our 5G network on the global standard will begin for mobility and residential broadband in the new 5G ultra-wideband era.","Let's turn to slide 7 and take a closer look at consolidated financial highlights of the quarter. On a reported basis third-quarter consolidated revenue was $32.6 billion up 2.8%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard total revenue was $32.5 billion up 2.6%.","The primary driver of the increase was improved wireless service revenue due to customer step-ups to higher access plans and an increase in the average connections per account.","On a consolidated basis excluding special items third-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% which was up from prior year's margin of 36.0%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.4 billion or 3.4% due primarily to wireless service revenue performance as well as continued improvement in operational efficiencies across the business.","Our business excellence initiatives have produced cumulative cash savings of $1.3 billion year-to-date, from a mix of capital and operational expenditure activities. The program remains on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative savings for the four-year period.","Let's now focus on cash flow results on slide 8. During the third quarter we continue to drive strong cash generation. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $26.2 billion an increase of $9.8 billion from the prior year.","This was driven by strong operating results supplemented by the benefits from tax reform and the completion of the transition of device payment plan securitization to on-balance sheet financing.","Year-to-date capital spending of $12.0 billion supported the increased demand on our industry-leading 4G network, the launch of 5G Home, earlier this month, significant fiber deployment in markets nationwide and pre-positioning for additional 5G services.","We now expect capital expenditures for the full year to be between $16.6 billion and $17.0 billion. This reflects the benefits from our business excellence program which has allowed us to make all of the planned investments while aggressively advancing the 5G ecosystem and transforming our structure to deploy the Intelligent Edge Network.","This architecture will provide both CapEx and OpEx efficiencies compared to the networks of the past. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $14.2 billion year-to-date.","Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility. We continue to maintain near-term maturities at low levels which give us confidence to operate through different financial market environments. We ended the quarter with $112.9 billion of total debt, which was comprised of $103.7 billion of unsecured debt and $9.2 billion of on-balance sheet securitizations.","We have made good progress this year towards our goal of strengthening the balance sheet. Operational cash flows and the benefits from tax reform have resulted in a decrease in our total debt of $4.2 billion year-to-date while allowing us to make discretionary contributions of $1.7 billion to employee benefit programs. This has driven a change in the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA from 2.6 times to 2.4 times since the beginning of the year.","Now let's move into reviews of the operating segments starting with wireless on slide 9. Total wireless operating revenue increased 6.1% to $22.9 billion in the third quarter primarily driven by strong trends in service and equipment revenue.","Wireless service revenue increased by 2.6% driven primarily by customer step-ups to higher price plans and an increase in average connections per account. Our mix and match unlimited offering provides customization options to suit the individual needs of our customers while providing a superior network experience.","In the third quarter, equipment revenue increased 13.7% on a year-over-year basis driven by higher-priced handsets and increased sales of wearables. Our postpaid customer migration to unsubsidized pricing has stabilized to 83% of our phone base. Comparatively, the same quarter in the prior year was 78%.","Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone base had an outstanding device payment plan at the end of the quarter consistent with the prior year. The combination of service revenue growth and efficiencies gained within the business have led to segment EBITDA growth of $664 million, an increase of 6.7% year-over-year. For the quarter wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.4%.","Let's now turn to slide 10 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. In the third quarter, wireless operational performance sustained momentum from the previous quarters by expanding our relationships and subscriber experience with postpaid customers.","Total net phone editions were 295,000 compared to 275,000 last year including postpaid smartphone net addition of 510,000. Postpaid net ads totaled 515,000 including tablet net losses of 80,000 and other connected device gains of 300,000 led by wearables.\\","Our postpaid phone churn of 0.80% is a result of our network quality and reliability coupled with the diversification and personalization of our unlimited offerings. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.04% was up compared to 0.97% in the prior year. We expect postpaid phone churn to increase seasonally through the fourth quarter due to the holiday season.","Total postpaid device activations of which approximately 80% were phones were down 1.4%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.0% down from 5.5% in the prior year. In the third quarter, prepaid net additions declined by 96,000 compared to an increase of 139,000 in the prior year.","Within this we had smartphone net additions of 15,000. The change in the size of our overall prepaid base reflects our ongoing activity to focus our prepaid offerings on value-added segments.","Now, let's move to our wireline segment on slide 11. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.7% in the quarter as growth in our high-quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by technology shifts and ongoing secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition.","Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.8% driven by legacy core declines and cord cutting partially offset by Fios broadband growth. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 1.1% due primarily to our broadband offerings.","Fios broadband Internet experienced growth of 54,000 customers due to demand for high-quality Internet connectivity. Fios video results continue to be impacted by ongoing shifts away from linear video offerings with losses of 63,000 in the quarter.","Our Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets revenues declined by 4.0%, 6.3% and 7.0% respectively. Enterprise Solutions revenues declined by 3.8% on a constant currency basis. Results in each of these businesses reflect the pressures on legacy products and price compression, which at this time continue to offset the growth in fiber-based products.","Segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 19.9%. We expect price compression on legacy products, secular trends and increasing content costs to continue to put pressure on the wireline margins.","Let's now move on to slide 12 to discuss our media and IoT businesses. For third quarter, Oath revenue was $1.8 billion, which was 6.9% below the same quarter last year. We are seeing revenue pressure from search and desktop usage, which is more than offsetting positive growth in mobile usage and video products, including our distribution partnership with the NFL.","Because search and desktop products make up the majority of the Oath business and we believe pressure in those sectors is likely to continue, we do not expect to meet our previous target of $10 billion of revenue by 2020. The leadership team at Oath is focused on returning to revenue growth by completing the integration of the legacy AOL and Yahoo! advertising platforms by year-end, implementing initiatives to realize synergies across all of our media assets and building services around our core content pillars of sports, news, finance and entertainment.","Additionally, we are utilizing Oath's technical capabilities such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality across all of Verizon. In our telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $241 million. Total IoT revenue including Verizon Connect was up approximately 12% year-over-year.","Let's now move to slide 13 to summarize our third quarter results. We remain focused on our strategy to invest in our networks while expanding our high quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We continue to lead in 4G LTE performance, while building momentum for our ultra-wideband 5G network.","Our launch of the world's first commercial 5G product signals the beginning of an era that will transform the way people live and work. Our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network enabling efficiencies throughout the core infrastructure and delivering flexibility to meet customer requirements at the edge of the network.","We are excited about our current positioning in the marketplace our financial strength and the opportunities ahead of us.","With that I will turn the call back to Brady, so we can get to your questions.","Brady Connor","Thank you, Matt. Brad we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Feldman","Yes. Thanks and two if you don't mind. I just want to come back to CapEx and the lower outlook there, it sounds like you are certainly enjoying some efficiencies as a result of your cost savings program.","I am wondering if there are any timing considerations. So for example are we in maybe a little bit of an air pocket as you ramp down the 4G spend but you haven't quite hit run rate on 5G?","And then on ARPA you continue to see some strength there. I was hoping you could deconstruct that a little bit. How much of it is strong product level ARPU trends particularly in phones as people take unlimited? And to what extent is it being driven as more devices are attached to accounts? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks Brad. Good morning. So on CapEx you certainly see the benefit of our operational excellence activities we have been doing throughout the year. This really started a year ago when we reorganized the network organization and we are seeing the benefits of some changes and how we run that organization using new capacity utilization models, changes to our inventory management systems, adoption of procurement analytical tools and a whole host of other things.","So this is activity that began last year. It is showing up this year. I will tell you we are getting everything done that we wanted to get done in 2018. We are just doing it more efficiently than we initially originally expected to.","And I don't see - you used the word air pockets. I don't see an air pocket here. We have been pre-positioning the network for the transition from 4G to 5G for a number of years now.","So we will get into obviously our views on 2019 and beyond when we talk again in January. But we've got everything done this year we expected to. And the team has done a great job of just doing it more efficiently so that will open up more opportunities for us as we go forward.","On the ARPA side as you mentioned we've certainly seen some good increase this year and it's been largely coming from step-ups. We have been seeing an increase in connections per account.","But as we get customers onto unlimited and they see the quality of the experience there and then they step up from one plan to another plan we have been seeing some good overall results in ARPA.","I will tell you there is still a good amount of runway there as well. So excited with the momentum that we have in wireless at the moment and I think there is still some way to go with it.","Brett Feldman","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Matthew Ellis","Brady, we are ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead with your question.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks a lot. Good morning. Matt. you talked about 5G quite a bit. I don't know if there is any early commentary that you can give us on the launches and what you are seeing so far.","And then as we think about next year and I think you said you would accelerate that. What is the timeline looking at like in terms of getting the standards-based gear and in particular a path to having a self-installed solution for 5G Home? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Simon. So, yeah, as you say we're excited that we are now in the 5G era. I will add that we started doing installs earlier this month. And we've seen performance as we've expected since we started doing those installs.","The technology works, our customers are getting the experience they expected and we are getting a lot of good learning which will benefit us next year when we roll-out the product to that much larger audience. 5G Home will become more significant as we expand coverage and we get on the global standards equipment in 2019.","And I would expect that that would start to have an impact on consolidated revenues as we get into 2020 and beyond. And you mentioned self-installs. A big part of what we are learning in these four markets is that install process.","So when we get to rolling out across a broader geography on the global standard next year, we will just have a level of learning about the customer experience that will differentiate us from everyone else.","Simon Flannery","Okay. So is that sort of mid-2019 that we start to see this gear coming on in scale?","Matthew Ellis","Yes, we are really dependent on the industry to develop it. We will be ready to deploy both on the network side and the customer side when the equipment is ready whether that be from the network OEMs or the customer equipment manufacturers.","So sometime in 2019, we will push the industry to get there as quickly as possible and we will see how soon that happens.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you.","Matthew Ellis","Brad, we are ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead with your question.","David Barden","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Matt, could you kind of elaborate a little on the voluntary separation program. You know what the goal is? What the timetable is and what the margin impact is expected to be? And where we see that across the wireline and wireless organizations?","And then the second question is with respect to delevering you've had good success there on the back of the cash flow windfall from tax reform and operations. With looking down the pike we've got C-band spectrum potentially coming to market, millimeter wave spectrum coming to market.","What are the limits and the parameters around the balance sheet that inform what you are willing to do on the spectrum from so that we can kind of anticipate where the balance sheet looks like in the next 12 months? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, David. So on the voluntary separation program the way that I would suggest you think about it is - it's part of our overall business excellence initiative whether that be the adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, some of the other things that we have done.","Really what we are looking at is while we are certainly glad to see the financial performance we have today and made good progress there what Hans and I are focused on is making sure that we are not just successful today but we can be successful into the future as well. And that we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along in the marketplace.","So what this really is about is saying do we have the - if you were setting up our business from scratch today would you set it up the way it is? And there are significant process improvements that we have around us.","And so the voluntary separation program is part of continuing to evolve and transform the way we do business to continue to improve the efficiencies across the business and we will be driving those changes over the course of the next 12 months. In terms of the size of the impact of it - it is too soon to tell. We are in the middle of the period where employees can choose to accept the offer.","So in terms of the size of the initial charge that will come through in fourth quarter or the size of the benefits that we will start to get in 2019 it is too soon to say. When we have information on that we will certainly look to share it with everyone.","But this is just part of the continued drive to transform the business, to make sure that we are successful in the long run and have the right cost base to be able to compete irrespective of how the industry develops.","On the balance sheet, certainly glad to see the progress we've made this year. Strong cash flow certainly helped by tax reform, but also the operation of the business driving a lot of that benefit.","So, you have seen the leverage come down from 2.6 times at the start of the year to 2.4 times now, and so glad to see that progress there. I'm not going to get into specifics about parameters about what we may or may not do around any type of acquisition whether that be spectrum or anything else.","The key for us is making sure that we have a balance sheet that gives us the flexible structure to take advantage of whatever comes up.","So if you kind of think across those two questions you had, we'll make sure we got the cost structure that we can take advantage of opportunities that come along. And then we've got the balance sheet flexibility to make sure we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along.","And then we've got the balance sheet flexibility to make sure we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along. So we can be very adaptable no matter how the industry develops going forward and the opportunities that come up.","David Barden","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Ellis","Brad, we are ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. You may go ahead with your question.","Philip Cusick","Hey, Matt. Thanks. First, wireline margins were pretty stable, but you talked about continued pressure. How do you think about that from here? Is your comment of about 20% from the last call still a good level or should we expect some degradation?","And then second, you called out a $0.27 to $0.31 tailwind from ASC 606 this year, and that that will fade to essentially zero in the next two years. As we think about the underlying growth in revenue and EBITDA driving earnings, do you think we can expect the Company to grow reported earnings in 2019 and 2020? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Phil. So, on wireline, yes, certainly expect to see the margins over the near term to be in that range we discussed on the last call around that 20% level. Would be a little above, a little below depending on the quarter. But certainly with the revenue trajectory in that business that will provide some pressure on that margin.","So we are focused on continuing to address both the revenue trajectory and the cost side of the wireline business, but that's something we've been doing for a while and we'll keep working on it.","As you talk about the impact of 606, and yeah, we still see about $0.27 to $0.31 of GAAP benefit this year. But when you back that out 3.1% EPS growth on an adjusted basis year-over-year and that's certainly what we are focused on doing.","So as you think about next year, you really have to take this year's number back out the $0.27 to $0.31, put a growth rate on and then put around half-ish or so of this year's benefit in next year.","And that will get you in around the right ballpark. But, net-net we are certainly focused on getting - showing growth at the EPS level and at the top line. But we just obviously got some noise from the accounting as we go over the next couple of years, and 606 flows its way all the way through our financials both for the current year and the prior year we are comparing to.","Philip Cusick","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Ellis","Brad, we are ready for the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead with your question.","John Hodulik","Great. Thanks. Two if I could. You have some commentary in there on the revenue growth or declines at Oath. Any commentary on the losses we got, have you in there for about less than $1 billion this year?","Does the sort of I guess change in approach to Oath mean that you could find some cost savings there as well and maybe get that business closer to profitability as we look out to 2019 and 2020?","And then more broadly on the 5G rollout the FCC passed some small cells citing reform. Does that change the sort of internal targets you have for the rollout of the small cell and 5G infrastructure and possibly allow you to go a little faster as you look out to 2019 and 2020? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks John. Yeah on the 5G rollout certainly we were glad to see the FCC rules around the small cell adoption, doesn't necessarily increase the velocity that we see.","Our teams have been engaged with municipalities across the country on getting permits to put up small cells whether for 4G or 5G. Certainly like the fact that they are providing a little more guidance for how quickly that should happen.","But I don't see it having a material impact to our build out plans. We are going as fast as we can. And while the federal level rules are helpful it is still a very local activity municipality-by-municipality. So a lot of good work going on there.","On Oath from a profitability standpoint certainly as we said in the comments revenue not progressing quite as fast as we'd like, but from an EBITDA standpoint the team's made good progress on their synergy targets coming out of the closing on Yahoo over a year ago.","The integration is now largely complete. We think we will have that substantially complete by the end of the year. So the cost side of that business is being managed well, and we just need the revenue side of the business to achieve its potential too and then we will be happy with what we are doing in the Oath business.","John Hodulik","Okay. Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Ellis","Brad we are ready for the next one please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead with your question.","Craig Moffett","Hi. Good morning, guys. I guess just if I want to return to the question a couple of questions ago about growth. You've always said in the past that you can be something like a GDP grower.","If I kind of step back from today's results what are the moving pieces that get this business back to being a GDP grower at some point?","Matthew Ellis","Yes. So Craig when you look at the results we posted today, I'm not sure we have to say what it would take to get back to that level. I think you are seeing growth in the business year to date both at the top line and the bottom line.","And it is driven by largely by what's going on in the wireless business. When you have the best network and when we get it paired up with the right consumer offerings as we have and our wireless consumers can take advantage of that network and the way they want to do so you see the results we have.","We see customers step up and as I said earlier we have still got significant runway in terms of the ability for customers to step up. So like the number of increasing connections we had during the quarter increase in ARPA as well, and we very focused on continuing that momentum.","There is a high level of stability in the core of our business. So that's driving top-line growth as we reported this morning. And then as we also manage the cost side I think we will continue to have the opportunity to post good results.","Craig Moffett","If I could just follow-up I mean presumably just given the maturity of the industry with respect to penetration it's presumably an ARPU or ARPA story as you get to 5G.","What kind of ARPU and ARPA growth do you think that you could eventually get to in this business, obviously barring any unforeseen big changes in competitive intensity.","Matthew Ellis","Yes. So we continue to look for new pockets of demand out there. You know, b0ut this maturity comment we've talked about for a long time now but we posted smartphone net adds of 510,000 during the quarter. So we are continuing to add to our base of customers. There is still a significant opportunity to do that. We have the opportunity to get a number of our customers stepped up from their current price plans.","They often come in on a bucketed data device and then over time they step-up into unlimited. And we now have options there for customers to step-up to different levels of unlimited plans too. So we still have runway here in terms of developing the wireless business in the 4G world.","And then before we know it we will be talking about transitioning the largest base of wireless customers in the industry over to 5G devices too. So I am certainly comfortable that our wireless business will continue to grow as we go forward.","Craig Moffett","Thank you.","Matthew Ellis","Brad, we are ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead with your question","Michael Rollins","Thanks. You talked a bit about the cost cutting. And in the past I think the cadence you were looking for was an incremental $1 billion a year. So that would get you through a cumulative $10 billion over four years. You mentioned you are at $1.3 billion through nine months.","So is there an opportunity to create even more cost savings over time than the $10 billion? Or is the $1.3 billion progress to-date just pulling from the future pulling forward some of those savings?","And then secondly if you could just help us think about what the right cadence is over the next couple years in just broad cost-cutting terms? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Mike. So as we think about the cost cutting certainly glad to see the progress the teams have made this year. And as they have gone in and started looking at the business in different ways we are seeing lots of different opportunities show up. And now we are in the phase of really executing against a number of those.","So certainly glad the progress we have made. Is there the opportunity to get more than $10 billion cumulatively over four years? We will wait and see. I am not good to provide any change to that number at this point in time but certainly we are being as aggressive as we can and making sure we are running as efficient a business as we possibly can and that will continue.","In terms of the cadence of those savings over the four year period nothing really to update. I think we are still in the first year. And as you can imagine as you start a program like this there is a lot of energy upfront just deciding the things you want to do identifying the opportunities deciding how you are going to go after them.","And so you are not necessarily turning them into savings immediately. So I think we've still got some good opportunity ahead of us from a cadence standpoint.","Michael Rollins","Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Okay, Brad, I think we are ready for the next one.","Operator","The next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead with your question.","Jennifer Fritzsche","Great. Thank you for the taking the question. I wanted to ask about the public safety sector. Obviously with AT&T officially having FirstNet it seems in their advertising they are going hard after this sector which some have identified the TAM is as many as 9 million subs.","Can you talk a little bit about your strategy there? Because you have exposure to hold onto these customers. What are you seeing in that? Are you seeing any early signs of churn or anything like that? Thank you.","Matthew Ellis","We continue to perform very well in that sector and it is built on years and years of strong partnerships, and we will be continuing to focus on that sector. Look, when you have large market share in many segments as we do, it provides opportunities for different people to decide to go attack them, whether it'd be in public sector with FirstNet or whether it'd be some of the things we've seen other competitors do over the past few years.","I think we have been very effective at defending the market share that we have. It's based on building deep relationships with our customers, and builds on the reliability and the performance that they see on a consistent basis.","So, we will continue to do that across all parts of our business, Jennifer, and it's really about just service execution. And when we do that on a consistent basis we typically win.","Jennifer Fritzsche","Great. Thank you.","Matthew Ellis","Okay. Brad, let's move to the next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead with your question.","Jeff Kvaal","Thanks a lot. Two questions if I may. The first is on CapEx. I think you have been pretty clear with us that we should not be expecting a surge in spending associated with 5G. I am wondering if that premise or how we should be measuring that surge from. Is that from where we began the year in 2018 with guidance or from where we are ending the year in 2018 with CapEx?","And then secondly on churn, obviously great improvement over the past couple years although that improvement has reversed a little bit. I am wondering what you can tell us about what's happening with churn and what we can expect from here. Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Jeff. On CapEx, so really as you say no surge level. We'll give guidance for 2019 when we get into the New Year. We will be spending on 5G. You may not see a change in intensity, but we are spending on 5G today. We will continue to spend on 5G just as quickly as we can. But as we've talked about in the past, 5G uses a lot of the assets we already have in place.","As we've been densifying the 4G network over the past three, four years now, we've been doing it with an eye also to pre-positioning the network for 5G. And we are seeing the benefit of that. As you see us roll out 5G and get the network ready to deploy and not seeing a massive surge in CapEx, and we've been pretty consistent on that messaging, and I think it's starting to show up.","So, look, I think you'll see CapEx stay within reasonable bounds of what you've seen from us in the past. And we will continue to take advantage of the efficiencies in the network whether that is through the Intelligent Edge Network design, which will create efficiencies. Whether it's across the other things we're doing on the business excellent side I spoke about earlier.","We will continue to look for ways to build the network that we want to build to provide the best customer experiences, but doing it at the lowest possible capital intensity. So, obviously we will talk more about the plans for 2019 in 90 days or so, but feel pretty good about the activity we have in the network as we complete 2018.","From a churn standpoint you are right. We've seen good performance over the past, the past couple of years. And as I have mentioned, when you get the combination of the best network, which we've obviously had for a long time and when you get the customer proposition right as well, you get great results whether that's on net adds or whether that's on the churn side of the equation.","And we've seen that now for over a year on the churn side. So look there is additional players in the marketplace today obviously with using the MVNO agreements and some other things. So we may see just a few points tick up there, but we'll continue to have very strong churn performance as we look forward here and expect to do so.","Jeff Kvaal","Thank you.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Jeff. Hey, Brad, let's move to next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. You may go ahead with your question. Mr. McCormack you may need to check the mute button on your phone.","Mike McCormack","Hey, guys sorry about that. Hey, Matt maybe just a quick comment on what appears to be a pretty good uptick in gross adds - gross phone adds on a year-over-year basis. Thinking about what the drivers might be there.","Obviously last year you had introduced the unlimited plan earlier in the year so it seemed like you had maybe a tougher comp. Just trying to get a sense for whether we are seeing any prepaid migrations or anything else in the marketplace we should be aware of?","And then on the Fios video side I guess no real surprise but yes downtick in sub losses there. Is that really just a function of lack of connects or are we seeing an uptick in churn on the Fios video site? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Yes. Thanks Mike. So on the phone gross adds and you mentioned the comp in 3Q. And as I'm sure everyone recalls 3Q last year was when we saw the first sequential revenue growth in about three years.","So as we came into this quarter we knew we were lapping a good quarter from a year ago. So to see the performance in wireless this quarter is certainly something that we are pleased about the way that the organization has performed in the marketplace.","When you think about the phone gross adds, as I said it's really the combination of the great network experience. And when we went on unlimited people were concerned what was going to happen with the network experience.","And we talked at the time that the network team had tested prepped for moving to unlimited. And all we have seen since we have been on unlimited is our network performance continue to improve.","And in fact as we sit here in the second half of 2018, I think we are continuing to see us widen the lead and set the standard for the rest of the industry. So, that's part of it. And then you get the right offer out there. So we launched unlimited. And since we launched unlimited we have added other flavors to it. We see customers enjoying that experience and expect them to continue to do so.","In terms of the prepaid-to-postpaid migration the thing I point your attention to is within the third quarter in our prepaid business we had smartphone net adds of positive 15,000. So while there certainly is some level of migration from prepaid to postpaid it's not driving the 510,000 smartphone net adds that we recorded in the quarter. So we are very happy with the performance that we saw there.","And again comes back to combining the right network experience and the right customer proposition and good things happen at that point. On the Fios video side I think just what we are seeing here is - is you touched on is it's the secular trend.","Whether it be cord-cutting or cord-nevers that certainly continues. What I am pleased about on the Fios side of the business is we saw Internet net adds of 54,000. That says there is strong demand for broadband.","And as we have said before if you're going to rely on OTT for your video entertainment you want to make sure you have got a great broadband experience. And whether that be Fios broadband or now for those customers who can get in-home broadband through 5G.","We believe we have the best in-home experience out there for those customers who want to get their entertainment from an OTT fashion. So we will continue to see pressure on the TV numbers, but I would expect us to continue to grow the broadband side of our Fios franchise.","Mike McCormack","I am sorry Matt. Do you see an uptick in churn there or is it just less connects coming in on the video side?","Matthew Ellis","Well it's certainly less connects coming in and we see more new customers come in as broadband only. We still see a number come in as triple play. And the churn side, I think is part of the equation too. But I would start off with its less gross adds coming in upfront and us seeing more customers - the mix of new customers as broadband only versus traditional triple play.","Mike McCormack","Great. Thanks Matt.","Matthew Ellis","Hey, Brad, I think we are going to take two more questions. So let's go to next one please. Brad, you with us?","Operator","The next question comes from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. You may ask your question.","Walter Piecyk","Thanks. Hey, Matt the upgrade rate, the decline in it has really helped your cash EBITDA in recent years. Record low, it looks like 5%. Can you give us a sense on kind of how the fourth quarter has been going so far relative to the XR was launched? And even just looking into 2019, can you continue to expect a benefit to your cash EBITDA by lower and lower upgrade rates?","And then my second question on the prepaid side, I mean, prepaid is obviously tiny relative to the overall business. Does it make sense to even maintain a prepaid product? And would you be interested in scaling up that through an acquisition if Sprint T-Mobile were required to make some divestitures or if TracFone was looking to sell that business? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Walt. So on the prepaid side, while certainly postpaid is the bigger part of our wireless business, we want to give customers the opportunity to experience the Verizon network however they want to come on board. So we value our prepaid customers. We certainly look to focus our prepaid business on the parts of that business that add value. And not all part of the prepaid segment does, so you have seen us change our approach there. You should expect us to look for ways to provide offerings to customers across the full spectrum of customers, whether that be prepaid, postpaid, or whatever.","And we will continue to evolve the offerings there. But as you say, prepaid is certainly a small part of our business, but it is an important part of our business. And we will continue to evolve and adapt the product offering there over time. I'm not going to speculate on any other - anyone else's customers or so on. That is not what we are focused on. We are focused on our offerings and we will continue to do so.","In terms of the upgrade rate decline, and while there has certainly been some benefit there, I would say the bigger benefit to cash flow has come from just the operational performance of the business. Certainly the lower upgrade rate has helped. I don't see that changing anytime soon.","Certainly as we get into the fourth quarter, we would expect to see seasonal uptick in the upgrade rate. But whether it will be at the same levels we saw in the last couple of years or whether we will see a slight year-over-year decline, it's too soon in the season to tell.","Obviously, we are not one month into the fourth quarter and the heavy part of the fourth quarter activity is still ahead of us. In terms of there are new devices out there, as you know, and they have been performing about as we had expected. And whether that be - you mentioned the Apple devices.","And also the Google Pixel is a great device, a new device out there, and we are seeing very strong demand for that as well. So we will see where the upgrade rate comes out for the quarter as a whole. But I don't see a major change from the trends we've seen over the past couple of years.","Walter Piecyk","Great, thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Walt. Hey, Brad, I think we got time for one more.","Operator","Your last question will come from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead with your question.","Matt Niknam","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick ones. One on enterprise, if you can share any color on how competitive intensity and pricing trends have been going in Enterprise of late whether there has been any change there. And then just go back to the question on Oath, are there monetization opportunities you would evaluate with Oath given the relative scale relative to some of the larger players in that space? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Matt. So, on Oath the team is focused on the right things. As I mentioned, they are driving demand in mobile and video offerings. And as I said, we have some great assets and talented people in there at this point. The business growth is not yet consistent with the quality of the assets of the people, but they are working hard and we believe they are going to get there. And that's what we are focused on, is supporting that team and the efforts they have.","I would also point out the value that it's harder for people to see that came with the Oath business around some of the very strong technical skills, whether that'd be in data analytics, artificial intelligence, VR. And really taking those skills and deploying them across the totality of the Verizon business is providing significant value, too.","On the Enterprise side, I would say no major change in the competitive intensity. We're certainly seeing businesses looking to do more, and change the connectivity profiles of their businesses, but we also are seeing pricing pressure in there as well. So what's going to determine our success there is if we continue to develop the products enterprises are looking for, not just for today, but for tomorrow.","And as we continue to do that, that will be the determinant of our success in that space. The team is very focused on doing that. They've had a number of good wins this year. And if we keep on that trajectory, I think we have a chance to like where we will end up.","Matt Niknam","Thanks, Matt.","Brady Connor","Great. Thanks, Matt. Hey, Brad, that's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt for some closing comments.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Brady. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. The 5G Era is here and we are positioning the Company for long-term growth by taking advantage of the full array of opportunities they have to offer. During the quarter, we again delivered solid financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace. We remain confident in our strategy and priorities led by building the best networks creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model, and creating value for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for your time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."],"21657":["Verizon Communications Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on the website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the third quarter of 2015 we reported earnings of $0.99 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a non-cash pre-tax charge of $342 million or $0.05 per share for a pension remeasurement adjustment due to a settlement accounting threshold that was met in the third quarter.","Excluding the effect of this non-operational item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.04 for the third quarter compared with $0.89 a year ago, or a growth of 16.9%. There were no special items of a non-operational nature in the third quarter of 2014.","Through the first nine months adjusted earnings totaled $3.10 per share compared with $2.65 per share last year. However, as we've consistently pointed out, last year's adjusted EPS would've been higher on a non-GAAP illustrated basis if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for the entire first quarter. On this more comparable basis, the adjusted EPS growth rate was about 14% for the first nine months of 2015. As a reminder our Wireline results include the operations in the three states that we agreed to sell to Frontier. These operations will be included until the transaction closes, which we expect at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Also as previously noted, we are no longer recording depreciation expense on these assets as they are classified as held for sale.","We continue to estimate that the full year 2015 earnings benefit of lower depreciation expense will be about $0.13 per share. In terms of the AOL acquisition, which closed in late June, our third quarter consolidated results include the operations of AOL, which are reported as part of corporate and other. We have not restated prior history to periods prior to the third quarter of 2015, and will not include AOL results.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran.","Fran Shammo","Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate that we continue to execute on the fundamentals of our business and deliver strong financial performance, which actively positioning the business for future growth and profitability.","We are very committed to building the business for the future and we are doing so through investments in our existing networks, as well as the platforms that will position us to capture incremental profitable growth in new areas like mobile video and the Internet of things.","We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model. In addition to our consistent investment strategy, we are also committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have had a very active year with capital investments in spectrum purchases, which position us for the future growth, the strategic acquisition of AOL and the return of more than $11 billion in value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, where remaining on track with our previously stated deleveraging plan.","In early September, our board of directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows. ","On the operational front, our focus is to provide customers with consistent network reliability and a great customer experience, and we are competing very effectively in all parts of the business. We once again delivered strong earnings growth and free cash flows. In Wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability with sequential improvements in postpaid growth and net ads, as well as net phone addition. ","Postpaid net ads totaled 1.3 million, which does not include any wholesale or Internet of things connections. Net phone add additions were 430,000. Customer retention was also a highlight with postpaid churn of 0.93%, down 7 basis points from last year. Total Wireless revenue grew 5.4% and our EBITDA margin expanded.","Our Wireline quarterly results were highlighted by FiOS revenue and customer growth, with sequential increases in both in Internet and video subscribers. Our segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 50 basis points. ","Now, let's get into our third quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide four. Total operating revenue was $33.2 billion, an increase of 5%, which as Mike indicated, includes revenues from AOL. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 3.1%. Our consolidated revenues have been consistently driven by customer and usage growth in both Wireless and FiOS.","Our overall revenue mix continues to change, driven by the unsubsidized equipment model, increasing video demand in Wireless and a higher mix of broadband and FiOS. As these trends evolve over the near-term we expect future revenue growth to result from increased video and Internet of things traffic, enabling new business models in wireless and continued broadband demand in Wireline.","In terms of our mobile video strategy earlier this month we were the first to market with the commercial launch of go90tm, a differentiated, mobile-first social entertainment platform. Go90 includes a broad selection of premium content and social engagement features, and the capability for sharing and conversation around the content. The initial feedback has been strong with increasing engagement without significant promotion, and we have received positive industry recognition.","As go90 develops, we will be adding more great content, features and advertising opportunities. You can expect a flow of product enhancements creating a new ecosystem for digital creators and advertisers, and a video consumption model that we can monetize in multiple ways. AOL is expected to play a key role in the success of our video strategy. The acquisition of AOL significantly improves our digital media and advertising capabilities. These capabilities will be a key component of our video business model, which will be driven by digital mobile advertising in the future.","We are taking a strong leadership position in the Internet of things. With our experience in networks, devices, platforms and applications we are creating an ecosystem that will foster innovation and expand the entire IoT market. Here are few examples of our early initiatives. In August we announced the commercial availability of Hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service creating a connected car driving experience that can operate in more than 150 million vehicles in the United States. We are very active in Smart City solutions market and we have already announced a partnership with the city of Savannah, Georgia. Municipalities like Savannah are looking to take advantage of our intelligent solutions to integrate its parent systems, monitor traffic and safety conditions in real-time to improve efficiency and public safety. These are just a few examples of the many opportunities we are pursuing.","We are very well positioned to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both the ubiquity of mobile service and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer. This will enable us to monetize usage through new commercial models, include data analytics and applications. New revenue streams from the Internet of things continued to emerge and grow with revenues of $175 million in the quarter and about $495 million year-to-date.","As our revenue mix expands we are focused on improving the customer experience while reducing our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. The focus on cost structure has enabled us sustain a strong earnings profile. ","Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion, up 7.5% on an adjusted basis, and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 80 basis points to 35.8%. ","Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide five. Cash flows from operations were $9.5 billion in the third quarter, and totaled $28.4 billion year-to-date. The nine-month total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring.","In the third quarter, we continued to securitize Wireless equipment installment receivables and received about $2 billion in cash proceeds. Free cash flow for the first nine months, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $13.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.4 billion in the quarter and $12.5 billion year-to-date. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion.","Our balance sheet remained strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $112.3 billion of gross debt, net debt of $108.4 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.4 times. ","Now, let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide six. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability, and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues grew 5.4% in the quarter to $23 billion. Service revenue of $17.6 billion declined 4.1% while equipment revenue increased to $4.3 billion, up 73%. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.2%.","Service revenue growth will continue to be pressured and equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device installment plans increase and more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing. In early August, we simplified our pricing structure centered on the device installment model. The pricing change simplified the customer experience at the point of sale and provided a cleaner structure for managing their accounts.","Existing customers can still choose to sign a two year service contract and remain on subsidized pricing when upgrading to a new device. Additionally, business customers do not generally select device installment plans. Consistent with our expectations, the percentage of phone activations on installment plans grew to about 58% in the third quarter compared with 49% in the second quarter, and 12% in the third quarter of last year.","In the fourth quarter, we expect the percentage of phone activations on device installment plans to increase to around 70%. During the quarter, 5.6 million phones were activated on device installment plans. We have about 19 million device payment phone connections in total, representing approximately 22% of our postpaid phone base. Overall more than 30% of our postpaid phone customers are on unsubsidized service pricing. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 9.2%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 56.4%, up from 49.5%.","As we have said before, we believe a more relevant measure of profitability is EBITDA as a percentage of total wireless revenue, which expanded to 43.2%, up 160 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, our EBITDA margin was 43.9%, up 100 basis points from a year ago.","Now let's turn to Slide seven and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 110.8 million total retail connections. This total does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.9% to 105 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.7 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.2 million. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.93% in the quarter, compared with 1% a year ago. ","Each quarter this year we have improved our year-over-year postpaid churn rate between 4 and 7 basis points. We are very focused on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service calling rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction.","Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.3 million were high quality. With a sequential improvement in the number of smartphone and total phone net adds, we added 889,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 694,000 net new smartphones.","Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 430,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 818,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 80,000.","Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide eight. Total postpaid device activations totaled 11.6 million in the quarter, down about 1.2%. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the quarter with 71.5 million smartphones in total and our smartphone penetration increased to more than 82% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 76% of our retail postpaid connections base. As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continues to drive increased data and video usage.","Approximately 89% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network and overall traffic on LTE has increased by about 75% in the past year. About 7% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. The quality of our overall postpaid phone base continues to improve. Through gross adds and upgrades, our 4G phone base has increased by roughly 34% in the past 12 months to $64.6 million.","We still have a sizable 4G upgrade opportunity with roughly 15 million basic phones and nearly 7 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connections base. Tablets are also under penetrated in our postpaid base at only 10%. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.9 billion in the quarter and $8.5 billion year-to-date, up 8.4% from a year ago.","We continued to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry\u2019s best reliability and to position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are focused on improving our network capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effective management of our spectrum inventory and further densification in urban markets.","Our densification program is progressing well and it is achieving the capacity gains that we expected on the spectrum that is in service. For example in Chicago, we are on our plan for small cell deployments covering key locations with distributed antenna systems and expanding our in-building coverage. This has helped support approximately 75% data growth on the network, while maintaining our number one ranking in network quality according to both internal and external competitive benchmark studies.","National studies continued to consistently rate Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent reliable performance. Densification is just one aspect of our network evolution strategy. We are working on centralizing network radio control to enhance capacity and provide operational efficiencies, while beginning to implement a software defined network architecture, laying the groundwork for new innovative services and applications.","We are extending our network leadership into 5G with our announcement several weeks ago that we are leading the technology forum with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standard developments and appropriate requirements for the next generation of wireless technology.","Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide nine. In the consumer business, FiOS continues to be the driver of revenue growth, and now represents 79% of consumer revenue. In the third quarter consumer revenue grew 2.8% and mass markets, which include Small Business, grew 1.8%. As we expected, there was a change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory. The primary reason for the decline is driven by lower paid TV subscriber growth, and an increase in customers rightsizing their existing bundles.","While FiOS broadband continues to grow, we are seeing a decline in the percentage of triple play customers. In addition, we continue to see interest in our custom TV offering, which offers more choice and control at a lower price point. We expect the continued adoption of custom TV will pressure revenue growth, but result in a higher contribution margin.","In the third quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 7.1% driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. Our Quantum broadband service continues to scale and because there are no content costs has a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, roughly two-thirds of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75 megabit speed tier, where one fourth of our Quantum customers currently subscribed.","As I highlighted earlier, FiOS subscriber growth improved sequentially in the third quarter. In broadband we added 114,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.9 million FiOS Internet subscribers, representing 41.7 penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 2000 in the quarter. ","In video, we added 42,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.6% penetration. We are working closely with Frontier to finalize the sale of our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California, and to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and ensure a seamless transition. We are making good progress and have secured for approvals from the DOJ, SEC and the State of Texas. We expect to close a deal at the end of the first quarter of 2016.","As we prepare to divest these properties, we are focused on reducing our shared cost structure post transaction. In addition, we will also take this opportunity to significantly reduce the broader cost structure of the entire Wireline business. ","Let's turn to Slide 10 and cover Enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the third quarter, global Enterprise revenue declined 4.9% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 5.1% in the third quarter. In both businesses we continue to see similar trends impacting growth, with secular declines in legacy transport revenue and competitive price compression in other services.","Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2.3% in the quarter. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.5%, up 50 basis points and on a year-to-date basis expanded 20 basis points to 23.2%. As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on expanding margins and improving the profitability of the Wireline segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure, while maintaining strong customer satisfaction.","We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning, and are seeing improvements in productivity. We will continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs with some of the future savings depending on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations. Capital spending in the Wireline was $1.2 billion in the third quarter and totaled $3.4 billion year-to-date, down 18.6%.","Let's move next to our summary slide. Throughout 2015 we have executed on the fundamentals of the business, growing high value customers and delivering strong financial and operating results and generating free cash flows. We have also continued to consistently invest in our networks and platforms to position us for the future growth. Our year-to-date consolidated revenue growth was 3.3%, after adjusting for the inclusion of AOL this quarter and the sale of the public sector business in 2014. On the same basis, we continue to expect revenue growth of at least 3% for the full year 2015.","Our adjusted EBITDA was up 6.4% with margin expansion of 80 basis points to 36.6%. Excluding the Tower proceeds, cash flows from operations were up about 13% year-to-date and free cash flow totaled $13.5 billion. We have added 3 million net postpaid Wireless subscribers, including total phone net adds of 613,000. Our new customer growth is high quality with 2.4 million new 4G smartphone customers and 2.5 million new 4G tablets.","We have also improved the quality of our postpaid base through upgrades and effective customer retention and have approximately 10 million more 4G smartphone customers than we did at the beginning of this year. In FiOS broadband, we have added 319,000 new subscribers, and 158,000 in FiOS video. We are very focused on developing new products and services in mobile video and the Internet of things to monetize usage on our networks and expand our revenue mix. In time, these incremental revenues will become more meaningful to our overall top line growth.","The launch of new products like go90 and Hum are examples of where we can monetize usage of the network and platform layers, providing more diversity to future revenue streams. ","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.","Michael Stefanski","Thank you, Fran. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simon Flannery","Thanks very much. Good morning Fran. I think Lowell had talked recently about earnings plateauing in 2016. Could you just give us a little bit more color about the puts and takes with the Frontier divestiture and \u2013 during the end of the first quarter and all the cost cutting. And then any updates on the [600] auction given that the application rules came out last week? Thank you.","FranShammo","Sure. Good morning Simon.","Simon Flannery","Good morning.","FranShammo","So on the comment about the plateau of earnings, I guess it is first off, let us start with this simple piece, which is \u2013 some of which is just pure math. So when you look at this wireless model, and converting from a subsidized phone model to an installment plan model, as we have been pretty transparent with all of you, there was a GAAP accounting that falsely increased the earnings of any company who adopted this model, and that we have tried to be as transparent as possible giving you the baseline in the beginning, but that became more complicated.","And what we have said going forward is look, the better measurement here is not service margin EBITDA but regular EBITDA percent on total revenue because that kind of normalizes out the fact that we are now recording 100% of the revenue upfront for the sale of the equipment, rather than a subsidy and then recouping that through service pricing over a period of time.","So when you take that into consideration, as you plan out the curve on the installment sale and penetration of the base, and I said in my prepared comments, our base is \u2013 30% of our base is already on this new pricing. So as you go into \u201916 and you get into that 50%, it starts to normalize out the earnings impact that was accelerated through the year 2015. So I guess what I would say is if you took out the impact of that in \u201915, and you look at \u201914 to \u201915 earnings growth, you would probably get a more normal growth trend than what we are delivering in double-digit growth now and then if you put that normalization to the \u201916, we actually would have grown earnings, but because of the math exercise here, you are getting the flatness in that GAAP accounting.","So that is part of it. The next piece of it is as we have said also with the divestiture of the","Frontier properties in the [South], these are classified as properties for discontinued operations. And for the year, we're anticipating that's going to be a $0.13 to $0.14 EPS lift, because we discontinue the depreciation of those properties. So, again that has to get normalized out as we go into '16. So, if you looked at it today, we are reporting $3.10 to-date. We have about a $0.11 of benefit. So, it'd be around a $2.99 versus $2.65 of last year.","The next thing is, if you look at the divestiture of those properties as we've said, these are higher margin properties, and since we are more of a centralized cost based company, we have a lot of allocations into those three property. So, as I said before when we announced the sale, we have this what we call stranded cost that we need to work out of the business since the time that we announced this.","I think we've proven a great track record here at wireline, that we know how to do this. If you look at year-over-year, we are down over 8,000 resources because of all the system enhances and profits improvements that we've made through processes and frontline execution on more online billing and so forth. So, we know how to do this and we got about five more months to go, but we also have to consider the fact that we're in the middle of a labor negotiation and some of those benefits won't be realized until we come to an agreement with the labor.","So, this is more of a timing issue on this one. We will realize those benefits, as you know the last time we entered into a labor negotiation, we said that we would incur about $500 million worth of savings over the three years. And you can see that coming through the EBITDA of wireline. So, I think that's important.","Then of course the last piece of this is, as you can see in our results this quarter, you're seeing more of a ramp in corporate for the start-up businesses. So, as any start-up business goes, you incur losses upfront, because you're investing in the product development, you're investing in the marketing and the promotional of that new business. And that's going to be a drag on earnings through '16 because the revenue will not kind of catch up with the cost.","So, when you take all that into the consideration, that's where low was mentioning and forecasting more of a flat if you will or flat-toe for 2016.","Simon Flannery","And that's the GAAP --","Fran Shammo","And just chiming on the update of the 600 megahertz. As you know, application to participate as buyers, the FCC did some forward part of the auction and which are expected to be due in January. And the whole purpose of this was to give the broadcast or is a sense of what the bid would be that they would receive. And now the broadcast was how that chance to look at that and decide whether they're going to participate or not.","I think one important thing here, though, too, is that after we saw the abuse in the AWS-3 Auction by Dish, I think the FCC should learn from this and not give preferences to large corporations, award credits or set aside and the government shouldn't be in the business of picking winners and losers. Let the consumer do that. So we'll have to see how the rules play out here but at this point, we do plan to participate but we'll see how the rules play out and then we will go from there.","Simon Flannery","Thank you.","Fran Shammo","Brad, we're ready for the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.","David Barden","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks. Maybe two questions if I could. Just, first on the Fran disclosure about the 22% devices be on EIP plans but 30% of customers being on EIP pricing. Could you talk about the difference there, is that BYOD, is that a forward pricing strategy that you are starting to implement? It'll be helpful to understand that.","And then just second on the, we unfold the go90 strategy and think about content acquisition. Now that AT&T and DTV are together, is there any thought about revisiting Verizon's historical kind of conversations with the cable industry about maybe joining forces to try to work together on content and distribution and allocation of resources? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Hi, thanks David. Good morning. So, on the difference between the 22% on edge and the 30% on pricing, obviously, if customers have fulfilled their contract over the two year period time under the old subsidized model, those customers are free and always have been free to select whatever price plan they want and we are allowing them to move to the new pricing because they fulfilled their contractual obligation under the old pricing.","So, in essence they are bringing their previous device into the new pricing. So, that\u2019s part of it. The other thing is that, there is a little bit of forward pricing here with current customers and as we talked before on calls, we have pretty diligent exercise where we go through our customer base and we attack the high value customers who we think will have a higher propensity to churn from us.","So, there is some proactiveness there. And I think you're seeing that come through on the reduction of churn through this year of 4 basis points to 7 basis points. And I would anticipate the going into the fourth quarter, you should consider us to be within that improvement on a year-over-year basis. Now, given the fourth quarter is always a generally a higher churn quarter as it was last year, but we do believe that we will see a consistent improvement as we have seen through the beginning of this year.","As far as go90, look, go90 is a very different product set. It's mobile first, a social entertainment platform. Let me just talk a little bit about where we are here. But this really is just a totally different perspective than linear TV and content deals. And we know how to do that and we've been doing that for 10 years with files.","But this is a very different platform. Keep in mind we are 20 days into this. We actually haven't done any advertising or promotion activity around this product. So, for early stages, we are seeing very good platform stability. We are seeing very encouraging feedback. And of course we're looking at some very specific matrix here of what's the viewership, how many times do people revisit the site, and what do the new shows capture.","And if you haven't downloaded, I would encourage you to, because we now have over 10,000 assets in the product. We have two exclusive episodes; one is called Top Five Live and the other one is called Betch - \"B-E-T-C-H\". And these are really starting to take form with the Millennials. And we are starting to see a number of encouraging revisits to the platform on a daily basis to see what Top Five Live and Betch are doing. And we have 48 more exclusive content deals coming that will be on this product before the end of the quarter.","So, go90 right now we are seeing very good upstage but again we really haven't started to advertise the platform. We do have entertainers tweeting the platform who are part of the platform like Kanye West on his live show. So, there is a lot happening in this platform. So, we are really pleased with the initial stages, but this is very different than the legacy linear TV model. So, I will stop there, David. Thanks for the question.","David Barden","Thanks Fran.","Fran Shammo","Brad, next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Phil Cusick","Hey guys, thanks. Fran, can you talk about the Custom TV effort and what you are seeing overall in the video landscape. It seems like the 42,000 this quarter was a little bit weaker than we would have thought, given seasonality. I wonder if you are still having any advertising issues or if this is just the way we should look at it going forward? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, Phil, good morning. The TV environment this past quarter was extremely competitive and continues to be. Custom TV, though, actually within the portfolio is performing similar to what it did last quarter, with the number of people choosing the product and the number of migrations that we have within the product. And of course, as we said, this is going to put a little bit of topline pressure on FiOS growth. And the reason for that is the way I have to think about this is the new bundle is about $20 less than the average normal FiOS bundle.","But the offset to that is we are also getting an incremental benefit in the content cost. So, we're seeing an incremental margin gain by people selecting the Custom TV package. I think what is more important though is the consumers are speaking to the total linear environment that says \"they only want to pay for what they want to watch and they don't want to pay for 300 channels when they watch only about 10% of those channels.\" So, I think that\u2019s more important is to where the ecosystem is going.","We will continue to support Custom TV. As we said we know we have some disputes that we're working through but Custom TV right now is doing what we thought it would do. As far as the growth perspective, I think, if you look at last quarter with the negative 625,000 negative adds, we continue to be positive, so we are gaining share, but look the environment is Millennials don't want linear TV content.","They are disconnecting their cable for just internet content and mobile content and that goes to why we are launching go90 with the mobile first perspective and that\u2019s attacking that entire segment that FiOS brand does not attack today through our linear TV product.","Phil Cusick","Thanks. When you reported the second quarter, you talked about Custom TV, most people were taking only the basic sort of 55. Have you seen that evolve upward a little bit as we're seeing for both season and other things starting to form?","Fran Shammo","Phil, no, we haven't. The basic package is the basic and then you get two packages included. Now, of course you have a selection of those package among seven. Some people are selecting the sports, others are selecting the live like Hallmark station and those things. Yes, generally sports fanatics generally take a premium package. So Custom TV more is for those folks who really aren't interested in sports and are taking less of the sports channels but it's more or less the same trend not seeing any difference there.","Phil Cusick","Got it. Thanks, Fran.","Fran Shammo","Brad, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.","John Hodulik","Good day, thanks. Back to wireless, Fran, if we could. You had a handset upgrade rate of about 7% which is down slightly on a year-over-year basis. But there is a much better comp coming up in the fourth quarter of '14. We did almost 10%. Do you expect a bigger sort of year-to-year decline in the fourth quarter here and if so what kind of impact could that have on the margins? And then if you could give us a sense for how you expect given the trends you are seeing with installment plans '16 over '15, would be great. Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, John. So, on the handset piece for upgrades. What I would say is we are anticipating a little less volume than last year because of the total iconic launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. But this quarter we are still anticipating a fairly heavy volume quarter as every fourth quarter is, but I would anticipate a little less than what we saw last year. So, I would think that upgrades would be a little less than what we ran last year. As far as what we see from a take rate on installments going into 2016, look, at this point we are guiding to 17% in the fourth quarter.","We are now 100% at the point of sale with Edge only. Of course, we have an exemption for current customers who are on the subsidy model who can opt to take a new subsidized handset. So, I'll have to see how that works going into 2016 and that may keep us around that 70% to 75% take rate but it's too early to tell. So, I don't really want to give guardianship on what the take rate will be. Let\u2019s see how we come out the fourth quarter, I will readdress that in the first quarter.","John Hodulik","Great. Thanks, Fran.","Fran Shammo","Brad, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mike McCormack","Hi guys, thanks. Fran, just thinking about the uptake of factoring -- of EIP and looking into next year, you have got two competitors getting very aggressive on leasing. Just a sense for your thoughts on leasing as a structure and then secondly the prepaid declined, is that just sort of defocusing on that segment or you are actually seeing some wins on the postpaid side from the prepaid base? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Yes, thanks Mike. So, on the EIP, yes we have gone to the full Edge product. As I've said before, I am not interested in a rental program. We are not seeing any impact from those programs from the competitors in our base and I think our results speak to that this quarter and I think they'll speak to that in the fourth quarter as well. I think what you'll see is if you speak to the rating agencies, they are becoming very concerned with the balance sheet risk of some of the industry on putting up rental phones on the balance sheet with what the residual value will be with those rental phones.","So, again, as I have said before, that\u2019s not something that we are entertaining at this point. Again, I never say \"never say never\" but that is not something that I would have an appetite for. On the prepaid decline, I think, look, generally if you look at how postpaid and the price points of postpaid and I've talked about this before. Postpaid pricing is more or less mirroring what prepaid pricing was in the past. And we are seeing some migration of our prepaid product customers to postpaid, but it's more probably limited than some others because of our intense credit models and you have to pass the credit in order to become postpaid.","But there is a segment of prepaid customers that are good credit customers, that now that the price point is closer to affordability for them on postpaid, they are moving into the postpaid product. So, I don't really look into the prepaid product decline as a problem set for us at this point. We generally really compete with prepaid in our reseller model with companies like TracFone and StraightTalk and Straight Wireless and that\u2019s where we really drive home the lower-end product without our brand connected to it.","So, and that although we don't disclose much in reseller any more, that segment continues to perform well for us.","Mike McCormack","I guess, Fran, on the residual risk, because that\u2019s just you think secondary market can become softer or new devices being launched or is it just an overall view on risk in the balance sheet?","Fran Shammo","If you look at some of the programs, you have balloon payments that are doing 18 months. 18 months from now the market is changing. There is a lot of Apple product hitting in the Chinese market now, where China was one of the larger areas where we sold off used handsets. So, as these markets get heavily penetrated with newer product, that could impact the residual value of these phones going forward. So, it's just a risk that it's going to have to be handled by the industry under that program and at this point that\u2019s not something we want to deal with.","Mike McCormack","Great. Thanks, Fran.","Fran Shammo","Brad, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.","Michael Rollins","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two, if I could. First, Fran, could you talk a little bit more about what the mobile data usage looks like. You talked about the mix of data that's on 4G LTE, I am kind of curious how much does the customer use, how much is the data growing year-over-year in that metric set; you can help on that basis. And then, secondly, you described that the service revenue plus installment billing was 1.2% up year-over-year. As you're making the transition to these new great plans, the unbundled installment plans, what\u2019s the risk, does that goes lower before it goes higher? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, Michael. On mobile data, what we are seeing right now is that the trend across our entire network of 75% growth year-over-year, obviously, some of the metropolitan areas like in New York and Chicago are higher than that. I mean, Chicago we said is up 75% but New York, San Francisco, some others are higher than that in growth rate. So, it depends where you are at and then we have markets obviously lower than that because of more of rural areas.","So, that\u2019s generally what we are seeing in the network right now. On the installment sale billings of 1.2%, yes, I do believe that will go lower as we make this transition into 50% of our base for installment sale. So, the trend of service revenue and the installment billings plus the service is going to continue to decline, until we get into that middle part latter part of 2016 where the curve will reverse and then you will start to see that flattening out and start trending back up just like the math would dictate.","Michael Rollins","And could that go negative?","Fran Shammo","I am sorry? Go ahead.","Michael Rollins","Could it actually be a rate of decline, during this transition?","Fran Shammo","No. I think what you are seeing now if you look at the previous quarters, it's pretty trending about the same. I don't think it's going to accelerate.","Michael Rollins","Thank you.","Fran Shammo","Brad, next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you, very much. And good morning Fran and Mike.","Fran Shammo","Good morning, Amir.","Amir Rozwadowski","I was wondering if we might be able to discuss a bit more about your midterm thoughts on the competitive landscape. For some time, of course, we've seen the impact of increased competition in the market with respect how devices are sold, pricing of services, etcetera. And at least from our end the most draconian fears have yet to be realized.","As we head into 2016, both of the comparatively smaller carrier seem to be positioning themselves to be levering up here, albeit one of them synthetically through the lease company. With that in mind, are we potentially entering a period in which the focus may increasingly shift towards increased returns versus one that\u2019s overly emphasizing competition and if so how do you believe you can fare in that type of environment?","Fran Shammo","Amir, first of all, let\u2019s set the stage that the wireless industry has always been very competitive. And even through all this competitiveness, the industry themselves continues to grow even though everyone thinks that the industry is slowing we continue to have net adds overall. Tablets become a bigger piece, data continues to grow. So, the industry overall although very competitive, continues to grow despite all that.","Our focus has always been competing on a network quality, reliability and simplicity. And that\u2019s how we have been winning for the past 18 years and that\u2019s our focus going forward. And you can see that with our new brand campaign, better matters, because what we believe with our brand in our campaign is we're trying to send the message that although some say video and data are not as important and people are willing to get disrupted, I think if you talk to the Millennials, the thing that frustrates them the most is the spinning wheel when they want to watch a video or download something.","So, our focus on our brand is better does matter. We have the best network, we are the most reliable, and we become a more simple company to deal with our simplicity of pricing. So, that\u2019s where we look to compete. I think the fourth quarter will be a competitive quarter as it always is every year. I think you're going to see promotions in the marketplace and this industry is going compete as we always have.","But I think our differentiation is how we differentiated ourselves through this whole entire process of installment sale and now rental and as I said before the rental programs don't seem to be having any impact or appeasing to our customers. So, I would say that we will continue to do the same. As far as how the industry changes, I think what you are seeing from us is we're going in a different direction with our go90 launch. We are appealing to our Millennial population with our network and our products and I do think that as we said before you can only price down so much and then you need to generate cash,","And I think as you said some have to start generating cash in order to invest in their networks to support the growth of the data or else things are going to start to fall apart. And I think you are starting to see some of that in some of the national RootMetrics drive test, where some of the networks are starting to feel pressure and starting to fall down in the ranking.","We continue to invest heavily in our networks as I said before. You should continue to see us as a flat overall capital company but wireless continues to trend up and that\u2019s important for the product set that we are launching. So, I do think there will be more focus on returns and profitability and that\u2019s good for the industry.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you, very much for everything and then for color.","Fran Shammo","Brad, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman","Thanks. I then go back to the question I think David asked earlier about sort of your relationship with the cable industry. And one of the things that has come up is the MVNO agreement that you guys signed several years ago and because it was signed several years ago it's perceived to be maybe a little outdated.","And so I am just curious, do you still feel comfortable with the agreement the way it structured. Do you feel like it's enabling the cable companies to do whatever they want? And are you open-minded if they approached you about redoing it if they felt that the industry has evolved to a point where the agreement was stale and was not likely to create value for either you or for them?","Fran Shammo","Well, I think that you stated, Brett. We have an existing MVNO agreement and we were informed that they are going to execute on that agreement and the agreement is the agreement. I am not going to get into whether we're discussing of revising the agreement or the terms and conditions of that, since it's under NDNA and we will see how this plays out. Obviously the industry is moving. Cable is going to do what they are going to do and we're going to do what we're going to do.","I think that again though what I would say is we truly believe that Wi-Fi is a complementary wireless network if you will with LTE and we don't believe one replaces the other. Just like when we launched LTE, we said \"look it's not going to replace Wi-Fi, it's not going to replace broadband into the home.\" Similar, Wi-Fi is not going to replace LTE. So, I think that\u2019s where it stands right now, so, I really won't interject any more around the MVNO.","Brett Feldman","All right. Just a quick follow-up, since you mentioned Wi-Fi and I was thinking about small sales. I think you had earlier said you are looking to deploy unlicensed LTE maybe in trial phases, I think either this year or early next year. Where are you on that?","Fran Shammo","We are right on course. We are actually testing in the labs now and we are looking to deploy some time in 2016. And again, the unlicensed LTE is a great piece for us to increase our capacity. And again, another differentiator between LTE and Wi-Fi, is LTE is a fully managed network, Wi-Fi is not. So, when you start to load up Wi-Fi, that\u2019s why you start to see real degradation in service, whereas, with LTE and then overlaying unlicensed LTE. We can dynamically increase capacity when we see that that capacity needing increase. So, it's going to be a very viable tool for us in order to increase capacity without deploying a lot of dollars.","Brett Feldman","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Fran Shammo","Brad, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Moffett","Hi, good morning. Two questions, if I could. First, you talked a little bit about the upcoming options. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about how you think about different spectrum bands at this point with the options I guess out there being 600 MHz from the option versus 2.5 GHz from Sprint that maybe per sale versus Charlie Ergen's spectrum that's mostly in the 2.1 range.","And then if you could also just talk about on the wireline side. How do you think about your commitment to the wireline business in FiOS going forward with LTE coming into the New York market? Are you divesting some properties outside of the Northeast, is that still a meaningful focus or would you look to reduce your exposure to wireline if you had the opportunity?","Fran Shammo","Thanks, I appreciate it. On the auction and the spectrum bands, it's a good question because the current auction is 600 MHz band and as you know we deployed LTE contagiously on 700 MHz that doesn't mean that we can't operate with 600 MHz but 600 MHz and 700 MHz don't play well together. There is a lot of interference. So, where we have 700 MHz, there will be a lot of work to deploy a 600 MHz spectrum. But there is areas where we could use lower band spectrum but it's probably not the top priority.","We like the higher band like AWS. We've said that all along that Charlie is sitting on very good spectrum. It's very good for capacity, which is why we spent $10.4 billion in the auction. But we also can do things like we've done in Chicago and New York, where we felt the license cost was way too high and we instead decided to deploy small cells and get capacity in a more reasonable cheaper way, if you will.","Now, some of this spectrum will come back to market. We don't know how the FCC will treat that yet. So, we'll just wait and see but higher frequency spectrum is capacity and that\u2019s really what we need at this point in time.","As far as the wireline commitment, look, I think with the three divestitures in the South, they were more or less footprints which were not contiguous to anything else. Most of that property was copper, not fiber. So, when we look at the East Coast, it's a much different footprint. I mean, we'll have covered over 70% of the footprint with our FiOS product. We are very committed to it.","We are investing over $4 billion into the wireline company, a year. So, that shows our commitment from a capital investment perspective. We've already passed 20 million homes when we committed to originally 18 million. So, we are very committed to the FiOS product. It goes hand in hand with our wireless strategy. And I think if you've asked anybody like you know tease, if you are going to come in and compete for Fiber Into The Home, you certainly would either pick the East coast or the West coast, and they've started with Cablevision in East coast.","So, we have a very viable footprint and we are committed to that. Now, again, as I've always said, \"you never say never\" and of course Lowell and I are always open to new options and we always keep our eyes open for that. But at this point we are very committed to the wireline business.","Craig Moffett","Thank you, Fran.","Michael Stefanski","Brad, we have time for one more question. If you can please see that up.","Operator","Certainly. Your last question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jonathan Atkin","Thanks. So, my question is on enterprise. And I just wondered if you're seeing any notable changes in competitive behavior versus other carriers. And then just on wireless, on the network side, if you could just remind us the approximate timeline for AWS-3 deployment. And then when would the network be ready for LTE-only phones to be sold at retail? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Okay, great. Hi. So, Jonathan, on the enterprise piece, I guess what I would say is we are seeing more or less the same, there has really been no change. I think there is a lot of competition. There is a lot of price compression continuing in the IP space, as we said before the strategic side around security and data centers. But even within the data center space, now there is an awful lot of competition happening with price compression.","So, I think what you are seeing is the trend that we think will continue as we revamp the portfolio if you will and come into more of whether we're going to willing to compete. So, I think you are just going to see more of the same here.","As far as the wireless network and deployment of AWS, you were looking at probably in the 17, 18, timeframe. With that, similar to where LTE, you would be for starting in 16 and then of course, so that will continue to deploy there. And then on the phone-only where we would only get a LTE only handset probably more to the end of 2016 as where we're looking to deploy in LTE-only handset.","Jonathan Atkin","Thank you.","Michael Stefanski","Thank you. Okay, Brad. That takes us to the end of the questions, but I would like to turn the call back on to Fran to close.","Fran Shammo","All right. Thanks, Mike. I just like to close with a few key points. So, through the first nine months, we have solidly executed on our fundamentals, delivering quality customer growth and strong financial results while positioning the business for the future and returning value to shareholders. This execution has generated strong cash flows, enabling us to consistently invest in our networks, platforms, future growth, and innovation. In addition, we have returned value to shareholders and maintained a strong balance sheet, keeping us on track with our leveraging plans.","As I highlighted earlier, we have returned more than $11 billion to-date through dividends, and a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. In September, our Board of Directors again re-innervated their confidence with a 2.7% dividend increase; making this the ninth consecutive year of a dividend increase.","We look forward to maintaining our positive momentum in the fourth quarter, as we execute our strategy, launch new products and services like go90, positioning ourselves for future growth and creating value for customers and shareholders. Thank you, again, for joining Verizon today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."],"21404":["Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Q3 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call October 20, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Michael T.

At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael T. Stefanski","Thanks, Jay. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo and Matt Ellis, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Finance Operations and Chief Financial Officer designee. Thank you for joining us this morning.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website.","The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are an on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Fran reviews the third quarter results, I'd like to highlight a few items from our quarterly earnings. For the third quarter of 2016 we reported earnings of $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several significant non-operational items that I would like to highlight.","Our reported earnings include a noncash pre-tax loss of $797 million. The pretax pension re-measurement adjustment due to settlement accounting resulted in a $555 charge and severance costs related to existing separation plans amounted to $242 million. The net impact after tax approximated $500 million or $0.12 per share.","In third quarter 2015 earnings includes $0.05 per share of a noncash charge due to pension re-measurement. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter a decline of 2.9% compared with $1.04 per share a year ago. Additionally, in the quarter we executed on our first on balance sheet asset-backed securitization transactions totaling $2.6 billion.","The cash flow statement reflects asset-backed securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. This captioning impacts the free cash flow metric, but overall net cash available remains unchanged relative to off-balance-sheet securitization. We plan to continue to securitize equipment receivables with on balance sheet financings in future periods.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.","Francis J. Shammo","Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2016 continues to be a transformational year for us just as we had outlined over a year ago. During this transformation we are executing on a very challenging competitive environment, investing and positioning for the future growth and returning value to our shareholders.","Competitive activity in the wireless market increased during the third quarter as expected and we responded in a measured way to grow and retain our valuable customer base by introducing new wireless plans and discipline promotions. We have been successful in retaining our high value postpaid smartphone base and improving service revenue trends. In the wireline market we returned to a strong quarter of execution following the strike that impacted the second quarter.","We grew our Fios base and improved the consumer revenue trend. We are focused on continuously improving our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. This execution enabled us to deliver overall strong margins and adjusted earnings per share.","We remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation that consists of investing for growth, returning value to shareholders and preserving our strong balance sheet. Our investments are consistent with our three-tier strategy starting with investing in our network by expanding our wireless capacity and prepositioning for future growth in both 4G and 5G. We continue to lead in all third-party measures for network performance and reliability. We are investing in new growth businesses in digital media technology to extend our ability to monetize the usage on our networks and create new revenue streams from advertising, content rights, telematics and other IOT solutions.","In early September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.2% dividend increase which raises our annualized dividend to $2.31 per share. This was the 10th consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase endorsing their confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and returning value to our shareholders.","Let's move to third quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 6. Our third quarter results highlight our ability to execute in a challenging environment and drive strong operating and financial results. On a reported basis, total operating revenue decreased 6.7% in the third quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of the three wireline markets to Frontier which closed on April 1, 2016 and the wireless commercial pricing model change. Excluding the impact of wireline divestiture, consolidated revenue was down 2.9%.","In terms of wireless revenue, the service revenue trend was on track with our expectations for the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans and optimization of our current customers to the new pricing plans. Equipment revenue, which started the quarter slowly due to low volumes ended strong with the introduction of the iPhone 7. Wireline revenue trends were consistent with previous quarters.","Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $11.3 billion up 1% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5% up 140 basis points in the quarter. We remain focused on enhancing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business which we expect will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future.","Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Cash flows from operations were $4.8 billion in the third quarter. Keep in mind as we shift to the asset-backed securitization model, there is $2.6 billion of cash that is reflected in the financing section of the cash flow statement, while in prior periods under the off-balance-sheet securitization model this funding would have flowed from cash flow from operations.","Free cash flow for the nine months of the year totaled $6.2 billion which was impacted by our on balance sheet securitization transactions. Cash taxes for the quarter were higher compared to a year ago primarily due to transaction tax payments of $2.4 billion. This amount represented the majority of total taxes due for the gain on the sale of our wireline operations to Frontier earlier this year. The remainder is expected to be paid next quarter. The increase was also affected by certain benefits that we realized in prior periods which did not occur in this period.","Capital expenditures were $4.1 billion in the quarter driven by increased spending in wireless for densification and in wireline for Fios installations as volumes expanded post work stoppage. We now expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the low end of the range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.","We ended the quarter with $106.6 billion of total debt which includes $2.6 billion of asset-backed securitization debt, net debt of $100.2 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.3 times. The net debt includes the asset-backed securitization debt. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.","Now let's move into reviews of the segments starting with wireless on Slide 8. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.2% for the quarter compared to a decline of 5.4% in the second quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.3 billion in the third quarter. Service revenue trends are consistent with our expectations as the postpaid base migrates to the unsubsidized price plans. We now have approximately 60% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We continue to expect that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the end of 2017.","Equipment revenue was $4.1 billion down 3.9% due to lower equipment volumes. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 70% in the third quarter compared with about 67% in the second quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the fourth quarter to be around 70% given the higher seasonal consumer mix of volumes.","During the quarter 6.1 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total we have about 35.8 million phone connections activated on the device payment plan representing 41% of our postpaid phone base. Total wireless operating revenues decreased 3.9% in the quarter to $22.1 billion.","The cost structure in wireless continues to improve driven by streamlining of business process improvements in distribution, care and supply chain resulting in higher digital customer contact and lower transaction costs. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, flat with last year and we had a segment EBITDA margin of 44.9% up 170 basis points from 43.2%.","Now let's take a closer look at wireless additions on Slide 9. Total postpaid net adds, which we do not include any wholesale connections including Internet of Things totaled 442,000. Within the postpaid net additions we added 357,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter which were partially offset by a net decline of 3G smartphones resulting in 242,000 net new high-quality smartphones.","Overall net phone additions were a negative 36,000 due to the offset of basic phones and softer phone gross additions. Tablet net additions totaled 221,000. All other postpaid net additions totaled 257,000 with Verizon Wireless retail Hum devices being the primary driver.","Postpaid gross additions were 3.8 million down from 4.2 million and up slightly from last quarter. Retail postpaid churn was 1.04% up 11 basis points driven by tablet churn. As we have previously discussed, we expect this higher rate of tablet churn to continue into the first half of next year as two-year agreements associated with prior tablet promotional offers roll off. We continue to see strong retention in our retail postpaid phone base. Postpaid phone churn was up 2 basis points from a year ago and remain below 0.90% for the sixth consecutive quarter.","Net prepaid additions increased to 83,000 for the quarter which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year due to the impact of new price plans for our prepaid market. We ended the quarter with 113.7 million total retail connections excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base grew 3% to 108.2 million and our prepay connections totaled 5.5 million.","Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 10. Total postpaid device activations were 10.7 million in the quarter up 12.2% sequentially and down nearly 7.7% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones with tablets accounting for the majority of other device activations.","About 6.3% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. This represents a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year and up from 5.4% in the prior quarter. Our upgrades and momentum in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the recall of the Note 7. Additionally, we experienced an iPhone 7 backlog primarily for upgrades.","Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass-markets revenue performance on Slide 11. Consumer revenue increased 0.2% at mass market's which include small business declined 0.5%. Fios total revenue grew 4.4% with consumer Fios revenue rising 4.2%. The growth in Fios was driven by a higher customer base, strong retention programs and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 16% of our Fios Internet based has opted for speeds of 100 Mb or greater. We continue to see strong demand consistent with prior quarters for custom TV.","During the third quarter we returned to normal seasonal volumes ahead of our expectations coming out of the work stoppage. Fios Internet subscriber growth was strong in the third quarter. In broadband we added 90,000 net Fios customers for the quarter which were at pre-work stoppage levels. Overall net broadband subscribers increased by 24,000 in the quarter. Fios Internet penetration was 40.4% in the quarter compared to 40.1% representing an increase of 30 basis points.","In Fios video we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter which was also consistent with pre-work stoppage levels. Fios video penetration was 34.5% in the quarter compared to 35.4% representing a decline of 90 basis points driven by increased open-for-sale markets and softer linear TV demand. We continue to see an opportunity to further penetrate the Fios markets we serve.","Let's turn to Slide 12 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.3% in the third quarter consistent with recent trends. In the third quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.4% and on a constant currency basis the decline was about 2.9%. In our wholesale business, revenues decreased 3.9% in the third quarter. Trends in our global enterprise and wholesale businesses remained consistent with prior periods. However, we expect that in the fourth quarter we will see a decline in wholesale in the range of 7% to 9% due to nonrecurring items in the prior year.","Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 21.2% compared to 18.9% in the period last year up 230 basis points due to Fios growth and cost management. We believe we will continue to make progress in expanding the Wireline EBITDA margin. As we expected, Wireline capital spending levels increased in the third quarter as we returned to normal operations after the work stoppage in the second quarter.","Let's move next to Slide 13 and cover strategic positioning and investments. Network leadership is our primary objective in the markets we serve. We are investing in our networks and building capacity for the future and positioning our business for new industry growth opportunities. Recently, we launched LTE Advanced in over 460 markets delivering improved service to more than 90% of the U.S. population.","We are steadily advancing our cloud and software defined network architecture and moving forward aggressively with our densification efforts and prepositioning for 5G technology. Our one fiber strategy initiative is on track and we are building our next-generation fiber network in the city of Boston.","In July the FCC approved our millimeter wave spectrum band lease agreement with XO Communications clearing the way for testing 5G technology in different environments. Our 5G technical trials have been successful and we are now planning a commercial pilot program in 2017 where we will test the technology in different environments with several infrastructure providers to determine ability to scale and operationalized fixed wireless product offerings. Based on the outcome of our commercial pilot program, Verizon intends to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband solution in the United States.","In the third quarter network usage increased 45%. Digital video is the primary driver of traffic on our network. In order to participate in the digital media value chain, we have assembled assets to grow in the digital media business. We have accumulated a large portfolio of digital rights and invested in specific assets to distribute, publish and create digital content.","In order to drive incremental value from digital media traffic we are scaling and leveraging AOL's ADTECH capabilities to monetize digital impressions on and off our network. We believe we are strategically well-positioned with the right set of assets to grow in this expanding market. In the third quarter AOL's net revenue measured as gross revenue less traffic acquisition costs amounted to $486 million which represented an increase of approximately 10%.","Net revenue growth was primarily driven by advertising revenue from programmatic platforms. Over the next two quarters we expect AOL net revenue to follow seasonal trends, but year-over-year growth to be lower due to one-time benefits in the prior year from the Microsoft deal especially in the fourth quarter.","We are seeing strong demand from advertisers for AOL's expanding programmatic capabilities and high quality data analytic tools. We expect that the pending acquisition of Yahoo will further expand our scale in the digital media space. This would place us in a unique position to serve unmet customer needs, participate in digital publishing and video and to monetize the content.","On the go90 platform, the level of viewer engagement as measured by daily usage has been rising steadily since re-platforming the application earlier this summer. In the third quarter, the average daily usage in go90 surpassed more than 30 minutes per viewer with less than 20% of traffic served on the Verizon wireless network. While still early in its product cycle, we are very encouraged by the traction with users primarily attracted by unique content.","For example in July we introduced an original streaming monthly reality series titled \"The Runner.\" Viewers can watch episodes aired three times daily via the go90 app, go90.com and AOL.com. The innovative game format with an emphasis on live user participation contributed to strong usage and engagement. During the quarter we expanded go90 participation in FreeBee Data 360, a sponsor data service which allows customers to screen live sports including NFL games and music without accounting against the Verizon data. We are seeing increased engagement in the application.","In September with our partner Hearst, we announced the formation of Complex Networks which brings together complex and digital video networks RatedRed.com and seriously.tv. In the United States Complex reaches more than half of the male 18 to 24 population and it is one of the largest properties for this population. The content produced in this partnership will be available on go90 which we expect will further increase user engagement and traffic growth.","The rapidly evolving Internet of Things market provides us with new business opportunities for our customers globally. We intend to scale Telematics, ThingSpace, Smart City and other IOT solutions globally. Organically IOT revenues were $217 million up 24% from the comparable period last year. Including two months of Telogis activity IOT revenues were up more than 30% in the quarter. IOT revenues were primarily driven by Telematics. Telogis which closed in July expands our Telematics capabilities targeted for the enterprise space.","In July we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Fleetmatics, a global software-as-a-service based telematics provider in the small and medium-sized business space for $2.4 billion. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. In September we completed the purchase of Sensity Systems, a leading provider of IOT solutions for Smart City. This transaction closed in October. The acquisition adds a leading comprehensive suite of Smart City solutions to our IOT platform. We are now focused on integrating the assets.","Now let's turn to Slide 14 for an overall summary. As we stated coming into the year, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We continue to deliver consistent performance during this transitional period. We are executing in a competitive environment. For the third quarter, despite a challenging competitive environment in wireless we added over 42,000 postpaid net customers, retained high-value postpaid phone customers and improved our wireless service revenue trends.","In Wireline, Fios performance was ahead of our expectations. In both wireless and wireline, we have made significant progress on improving our cost structure. We continue to invest in our networks and platforms to be the network leader in the markets we serve and we are setting up the business to return to growth in 2017. We are focused on developing new business models and revenue streams. In our new businesses we are scaling our media assets and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress.","As we enter the final quarter of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute, deliver results and return value to shareholders while transforming the business. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations. Full-year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015 excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full-year 2015, consolidated capital spending at the low end of the $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion range.","We made a full year total pension contribution of approximately $750 million which consists of minimum funding of approximately $550 million and a discretionary contribution of about $200 million. We expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate to be in the range of 35% to 36%. While we will be providing more guidance in January, we expect that organically consolidated revenue growth in 2017 will be at a level consistent with GDP growth for that year and adjusted EPS growth will be at normal levels.","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get your questions.","Michael T. Stefanski","Thank you, Fran. Jay, we are now ready to take questions for Fran and Matt.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Philip Cusick","Well that was harsh on for Simon. So first, and thanks for all your help in the last five years and good look going forward and Matt, congratulations on the new seat. How should we think about postpaid phones and accounts going forward given what seems like a saturated industry and reinvigorated competition, are you more in a mode to harvest the existing customers than hunting for more share and accounts?","Francis J. Shammo","Yes, thanks Phil I appreciate it. So look, I mean, as we came into the year, we said that one of the top priorities we had was to protect our high quality base and that's what you're seeing. Look, we want to continue to grow from a net subscriber base both in phones, but as I've said before smartphones are going to be a slower growth for the entire industry as it gets more densified. But just a couple things that happened this quarter that did have an impact on our overall growth and really it was more from a gross add basis because as you saw we gave you for the first time our phone churn which is at a 0.90% for the last six consecutive quarters.","So you can see that we are continuing to maintain that base and protect our base. But of course this quarter, some things happened that affected our inward bound or gross adds. One was, as we previously talked when the competitive world launches new price plans and this quarter was around unlimited and obviously we did not respond to that. But as I've said, there's going to be a two to three-week period of time where there is an impact to our growth and we saw that. But as I've always said, after that three weeks everything kind of normalizes back out.","So once we got through with that we were off to a really good start with the Samsung Note 7 and then unfortunately there was a total recall of that phone which definitely impacted our growth because historically Verizon has always been the number one leader in high-end Samsung phones, so that certainly impacted us. And then of course we had the Apple launch and as normal everyone is in a backlog situation. So that's just a couple of things.","The other thing we saw this quarter as well was we are totally focused on smartphones and you saw that our net smartphone growth was 242,000 and that's really where we're focused in on. As you saw also we made some moves in prepaid because where we're losing the subscribers is mostly in the basic phone category and we know that our postpaid pricing is more premium to the marketplace and less attractive to that segment.","So we did launch some new prepaid pricing and what we did see was, we saw a double amount of our postpaid subscribers move over to our prepaid more than we've seen in history and that accounted for a little less than 50% of our prepaid net adds this quarter. So we did see some shift in our base, but the good news there is, is that we didn't lose the customer. We maintained the customer at least on the Verizon wireless network.","So going forward as I've always said, we will continue to be very rational in our competitive response. We will respond when we need to. Obviously, we responded on the equipment side of the equation, but as we continue here unlimited is still not something that we're going to move to, but as you saw also we launched new pricing this quarter which we believe also addressed two of the major pain points for our customers.","One was overage and we saw over 7 million of our customers moved to the new safe mode plans that we constructed which will protect them from getting overage charges in the future. And then second, we also allow them to now carryover if they buy an extra gig the month, if that gig is not totally used we allow them to carry that into the next quarter for usage for 30 days. So we have seen some really positive responses within our base, but obviously there was some impact on the gross adds and some of the competitive environment and we'll go into the fourth quarter very strong. And as I said, we will continue to strive to grow all aspects of our business.","Philip Cusick","Thanks Fran.","Michael T. Stefanski","Jay, we can take Simon now.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions.","Simon Flannery","Thank you, Mike. And Fran I going to add my best wishes to you and thanks for everything. Just following on, on the topline and the growth question, could you just help us bridge the path to the GDP type growth that you referenced again for 2017 versus the decline of 2.9% normalized for this quarter? some of it I guess is around the service revenue, but you've got to help us with the building blocks and the timing of delivering that. And then I think you were hoping to give us an update on the data center transaction, if you have any news there? Thank you.","Francis J. Shammo","Sure, thanks Simon. I'll take the data center and I'll pass the other question on topline over to Matt. On data centers we are proceeding with the sale of our data centers. We are currently in negotiations and we should have something to formally announce to everyone here early in the fourth quarter. So more to come on that, but we are progressing with the sale of our data centers. So Matt?","Simon Flannery","So that's with one person, party is it?","Francis J. Shammo","At this point, yes we are in negotiations with one individual.","Simon Flannery","Okay, thank you.","Matt Ellis","Good morning, Simon. So your question about 2017 and where that GDP like topline growth will come from, so let's break it down by the different parts of the business predominately in Wallace as we've said we've been doing this transition. You've seen the year-over-year service revenue trajectory continue to improve. We had negative 6.2% in the first quarter. That came down to 5.4% in the second quarter and 5.2% this quarter. So as we go into 2017 we now have 60% of the base on the non-subsidized pricing. That will continue to expand and that will obviously be a contributor to the improvement in revenue next year.","And as Fran mentioned earlier, we expect to get back to year-over-year growth by the end of the year in service revenue. We expect to see consistent trends within the wireline business, but remember we only have one quarter of Frontier in the 2016 comparison as we get into 2017. And then as you saw in our comments, we continue to make good progress in IOT and in the video advertising space and we continue to expect those pieces to continue to contribute to the revenue as we head into 2017. So when you add all those things up, we're confident at this point in time that we will be on track to deliver that GDP type topline growth and look forward to giving you more color commentary on that in our January call.","Simon Flannery","Great, thanks for the color.","Michael T. Stefanski","Hey, Jay, next question please?","Operator","Your next question is from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael T. Stefanski","David? Jay, let's move to the next question.","Operator","Your next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Hodulik","Great and Fran again, it's been good working with you for the last five years and good luck in the future.","Francis J. Shammo","Thanks John.","John Hodulik","Hey with the cable companies announcing that they are going to move forward with the MBNOs mid next year, is there anything you can tell you or about how Verizon sees the economics of those agreements? And obviously given your unique knowledge of the terms what do you think that, what kind of impact do you expect it to have on the sort of overall competitive environment that we're seeing in wireless? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo","Yes, thanks, John. So look, I mean I'm not going to get into the agreement. Obviously we're under nondisclosure with Comcast on that agreement and the other cable providers, but look, I mean we knew what we entered when we bought the licenses back just several years ago. This is a wholesale agreement and as Lowell and I have repeatedly said, we would do the agreement today again if we had to. I mean, it's a good agreement for Verizon Wireless. It is a good wholesale agreement. I can't speak to the economics of what they're going to do. You have to ask them that question, but look as I've said before, the wireless pie continues to grow.","Everyone wants to get a piece of this pie. The industry itself will continue to grow around that pie, so it's not like I believe the industry. With the carriers will lose share to anyone. I just think there's going to be more opportunity for growth. If you look at the future and you think about the LTE densification projects that we have going on and then you look at the whole 5G world for fixed wireless. That's going to enter into a whole new growth trajectory for the entire industry.","So look, again we'll compete against the competition, we'll compete against new entrants in the marketplace, we'll wait to see what's launched. And as I said before, we will respond where we need to respond and we'll wait to see what happens.","John Hodulik","Okay, thanks Fran.","Michael T. Stefanski","Hey, Jay, next question please?","Operator","Yes, we have David Barden. Please go ahead with your question.","David Barden","Can you hear me now?","Francis J. Shammo","Yes, thank you, David.","David Barden","All right, so I dabbled with my mobile phone the first time and again thanks Fran for everything over the past few years. I want to ask few questions if I could, just first on the kind of it sounds like the IOT and AOL ADTECH is that you are going to be part of the kind of revenue equation on a go forward basis. I was wondering if you could talk a little about the margin profile of those relatives to kind of the margin of the kind of general business as we look at it today.","And then second, specifically on the wireline margin side, obviously we have the new union contract and we're expecting that to kind of have some follow-on benefits into kind of the second half and into next year. Could you talk a little bit about the cadence at which we might see the margin trajectory of the business kind of start to graduate upwards towards the legacy 23% if possible, thanks?","Francis J. Shammo","Sure, David, thanks for the questions. I'm going to answer the first one, I'm going to have Matt answer the wireline one. So on IOT, look, I mean we're \u2013 we see the Telematics piece of this to be a really high growth engine for us and as I said in the prepared remarks, we're looking at a 24% without Telogis growth rate year-over-year and mainly most of that is all driven via Telematics and Hum. So we will continue on that. As far as the margin profile goes, look I mean these companies are still maturing. They are profitable, but we expect that the margin profile will continue to grow as we leverage and on to these platforms.","The other thing too to note that in the IOT world since it is a platform based technology whether you look at IOT or smart cities, these are all very what I would call minimally capital-intensive type businesses and that would go for video as well. So when you think about the return on invested capital, you get there much quicker than say on a network-based type platform. So we're expecting that the ROI on this will happen relatively quickly, but the margin will come and we'll talk more about that as we grow this business. Matt, on Wireline?","Matt Ellis","Yes, so had a good quarter in Wireline as you saw the EBITDA margin improved to 21.02% so you're starting to see some of that improvement we've been talking about especially as we got out of the impacts from the work stoppage. So as we've said we expect that the new union contract would generate $500 million of cash savings through the term of the contract spread across 2017, 2018, and 2019, so you should certainly see that come through.","We believe that you will continue to see the wireline margin expand. We had a good expansion in the past quarter and you should see us continue to make progress on that as we go forward into the fourth quarter and then into 2017.","David Barden","Great, thanks, Guys.","Michael T. Stefanski","Okay, Jay, next question?","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Rollins of Citi Research. Please go ahead with your questions.","Michael Rollins","Hi, thanks for taking the questions and in fact I just wanted to extend my best wishes since you first get upcoming retirement. If I could just follow-on two questions, first if you could talk a little bit about where you are in the testing of the 5G services and what you're learning in terms of the capabilities performance in the economic model and a potential third type into the Hum?","And then secondly, just going back to the guidance on earnings where you mentioned that you want to get back to normal levels, but given the impact of installment plans and the purchase of the Verizon Wireless minority it's been a few years since I think you could call the changes normal. So how are you defining what normal earnings growth is for Verizon? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo","Thanks, Michael. I'll take the first pool, I'm going to put the earnings one to Matt. So for the 5G obviously we've been mainly centered around lab testing of 5G we are now moving out into the commercial trial which we're going to span out across several different cities with several different types of testing, with different OEMs. So I wanted to give you an example, one city may be very density going into multidivisional job areas another one might be more urban with just looking at single-family homes. So, we're going to test this in very different types of commercial environments.","The big issue that still has to be answered quite honestly is the scaling of the technology. So for each small cell how much can each small cell deliver to how many households and still deliver a consistent 1 Gb of speed or some speed that is comparable to a broadband connection to the home. So that still has to be answered and we expect to do gain more knowledge around that in 2017 with the number of commercial trials that we're going to launch. So at this point, that's really all there is just talk about I'm from a 5G perspective. Matt, I'll turn it over to you.","Matt Ellis","Yes, good morning, Mike. In terms of the EPS growth for next year and where does she come out, she has stopped topline and we've already talked about how you get to that GDP type growth next year and the changes year-over-year that you should expect to see. And then you're layering in on top of that the continued cost improvements we talked in your layer and I'll talk about the continued cost improvements we talked about in Wallace. Obliviously it started last year with the restructuring of the business. We continue to make good efforts in reducing the cost to run the business whether that's reducing the number of calls we receive, we're reducing the transaction times and moving more of the transactions online, et cetera, ct cetera and you should see more of that continue.","Wireline, we have the full year benefit of the new union contract coming through. You've seen some of the headcount changes that we talked about that we'll continue to help us expand the margin there. And then in the other parts of the business whether it will be the IOT or the videos we continue to add scale there. The margins there should improve. So when you add those things up you kind of get to an improvement in EPS that we think is in line with what the expectation out on the street should be.","Michael Rollins","Thanks very much.","Michael T. Stefanski","Hey Jay, if we could take the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.","Craig Moffett","Hi, good morning everyone and Fran let me add my thanks and congratulations as well and to you too, Matt. I want to ask about the Yahoo transaction and first if you could just comment on press reports about the finding of a material adverse condition or a change and if you have any update to offer there? But then more broadly with respect to Yahoo and AOL, can you talk about how the proposed rulemaking at the SEC whereby their ISP would likely be held to an opt in standard for adjustability does that change your expectations of how you can monetize either the AOL or the Yahoo asset?","Francis J. Shammo","All right, thanks Craig. So on yahoo, look Lowell and Craig have both commented on this recently. So let me just reiterate what they have said. We are still evaluating what it means for this transaction. This was an extremely large breach that has received a lot of attention from a lot of different people. So we have to assume they will have a material impact on Yahoo. Lawyers had their first call yesterday with Yahoo to provide us information but as I understand that's going to be a long process. So unless Yahoo comes up with different process it's going to take some time to evaluate this. So until then we haven't reached any final conclusions around this issue.","As far as the privacy goes, look I think there's a couple of things here. I mean obviously we take privacy and security of our customers extremely seriously. We live under the regulation of the SEC which has a very high standard for carriers around privacy and what we're looking for is that the FTC and the FCC come out with a common rule that makes it competitive across the entire ecosystem and that the rules are more consistent and so that everyone can compete equally and there's no winners and losers within the ecosystem.","So we look forward to reviewing the final order of privacy from the FCC and hopefully the FTC and then we'll have to react to that. But look, I mean we're operating AOL today under the current environment and we will continue to operate and as you saw we'll continue to grow AOL under that purview of the privacy regulation. So I think we'll just have to wait to see where this all comes out, but we're hoping that it's an equal playing field across the board.","Craig Moffett","Thank you.","Francis J. Shammo","Thank you.","Michael T. Stefanski","Jay, next question please?","Operator","Your next question is from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking my question and once again Fran congrats and it's been great working with you. So my question is, if I look at your postpaid ARPA the quarter it was actually reasonably stable versus the prior quarter. So I was hoping you could maybe just give us a little more color on what drove that particularly the uptake rate and reaction to the new pricing you put in several weeks ago?","And then just as an extension of that, if we extrapolate the trend we saw here suggests that maybe you would actually stabilize your service revenues a little sooner than you're talking about and I was wondering what you think the opportunity could be there to maybe get that stabilization a bit faster? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo","Matt, why don\u2019t you take this one?","Matt Ellis","Yes, so I think what this one comes back to Brett is and Fran talked about it within the basic the continued growth of our 14 smartphone base we had net adds of 357,014 smartphones during the quarter. That has obviously contributing we saw a very strong adoption from our existing base to the new price plans. We saw a number of those customers step up in terms of the buckets they are purchasing and so I think you see that we have a very strong relationship with our base and our consumers continue to take full advantage of the network.","We've seen video use or total usage on the wireless network up about 45% this year and you continue to see that show up in the after trend. So yes, as you think about heading into 2017 we expect to see especially as we've got 60% of the base now on the non-subsidize pricing, we expect to continue to see some strong ARPA trends as we go forward into next year.","Brett Feldman","Great and actually just one quick followup, you had mentioned earlier that there were some device supply issues, for example the Note 7 and some of the iPhone 7 models recently. Have those cleared up and maybe just as a bigger picture, do you think that over the course of the holiday season you're likely to continue to suffer the supply issues and maybe that could contain some of the upgrades and activity levels we would normally expect?","Francis J. Shammo","Well, the Note 7 has been recalled totally and won't be re-launched. So obviously that's a permanent change to the lineup. We're bringing in new phones for the fourth quarter. As always Apple is always generally in a backlog situation for the industry. I don't expect that to change at least not in early in the fourth quarter. But other than that Matt, have you anything else to add?","Matt Ellis","No that sounds pretty much it would expect Apple to get caught up as we go through the quarter here and we will see how that plays out.","Brett Feldman","Great, thanks for taking the questions.","Francis J. Shammo","Thanks Brett.","Michael T. Stefanski","Okay, Jay, next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael McCormack","Great, thanks and again best of luck Fran and it has been great working with you. On the feature phone base you have north of 13 million phones out there. How should we think about that? Is there going to be an acceleration loss situation or is there something you are doing there either with respect to you are mitigating churn or care or attention efforts if you can comment on that that will be great.","And then just on the delta between those that are on unsubsidized plans versus those making Edge payments, that gap continues to widen out a bit. Is there retention efforts going on there or is there something else we should be thinking about? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo","Yes, so I'll have Matt do the feature phone one. Let me just answer the unsubsidized and subsidized Edge phone. So as you know, we have allowed our base to upgrade and choose whether they take a subsidized or an unsubsidized plan. So that currently is the policy that we have and we'll have to review that policy as time goes here into the fourth quarter, first quarter of next year.","So there may be some shifts within that going forward, but right now that policy still holds and that's why you see some of the separation between the number of people who have moved to the unsubsidized plan versus the number of people who are currently on a device payment plan. So we'll update that in the fourth quarter as we go. Matt, on feature?","Matt Ellis","Yes, I think what you're seeing on feature phones is and Fran mentioned this in our earlier remarks that you're seeing some part of the move to prepaid has come from the feature phones. Look, we will have some people who have feature phones in postpaid stay as postpaid customers and we're very happy to glad that they will do that, but we also expect to see some of those continue to move into a prepaid environment which may be a better place for them to be. We also continue to see people moving from feature phones to smartphones and when we get that we see increased usage with those customers as well. So we will continue to monitor that, but we're happy with the trends, where they are going at the moment.","Michael McCormack","Great, I look forward to working with you Matt.","Matt Ellis","Thank you.","Michael T. Stefanski","Jay, next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Horan","Hi and good luck guys. Can we get a little more color on the CapEx its feel and the whole industry seems to be coming at the low end of expectations and I know you focused on this at the end and densification a little bit more. Is this kind of a trend that is sustainable? And related to this, how do you think your network is kind of holding up versus your peers? A lot of your peers are spending a lot less CapEx, but the RootMetrics and other services are saying that their quality is kind of catching up with your network, just any thoughts? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo","Yes, thanks Tim. So look, on the CapEx trend, I mean I think this was all related to the strike that we experienced in the second quarter and we're not going to be able to catch up on that from an overall year-over-year perspective. So that's why we've revised the guidance to the lower end of our range. But we're still spending around $17.2 billion this year in CapEx.","The other thing too is, you have to remember, we're spending our CapEx around wireless for LT densification and as we have talked many, many times before, we do our usage projections well in advance of where we believe that usage will come and obviously we know that video is the major driver of the usage. With a 45% increase year-over-year I think the satnav is over 90% of our data usage is on the LTE network. We see that continuing to increase. So we're really preparing for two years out from where our usage is today.","So we are densifying the network and we've seen this movie before where CapEx trend goes down and user catches up and then all of a sudden the networks falter. So look, I think the RootMetrics report speak for themselves once again we want hands down across the country. That is the brand that we live by and we will continue to build and densify our networks to meet our customer's demands before they actually realize they need it.","Timothy Horan","Thank you.","Michael T. Stefanski","Okay, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Your last question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks very much and once again Fran I wanted to echo prior comments wishing you the best of luck with your next endeavors and congrats now on the new role.","Francis J. Shammo","Thanks Amir.","Amir Rozwadowski","I was wondering if we could talk more broadly Fran about your M&A strategy, clearly you folks have made concerted efforts improving your asset portfolio to support both the media cover and IOT initiatives. As it stands today, do you see any areas where you may need to bolster your pool of assets in order to move forward with these strategies or as you exit this transition year should we consider 2017 more of an integration here for you folks.","Francis J. Shammo","Yes, I think that's right. I mean I think we've made some strategic moves here around diversification. We know that the Telematics business is a business that has high potential and if you looked across the industry there are a lot of competitors in there, but no one really has a big share within that marketplace and we want to gain more share within that marketplace and we think we can with the assets that we've accumulated between Telogis and Fleetmatics here.","So we'll continue to move in that direction, but I don\u2019t think that there is anything large on the table at this point. We now have to integrate those assets and that's what our Telematics Group is actually doing right now. And as you saw, we launched Hum. Hum came out of the Telematics Group although it is for the majority sold through Verizon Wireless. It actually is a product to come out of the Telematics Group.","So we will continue to innovate in that area. You're starting to see us do a little few things around smart cities because we believe that with the pre-positioning of 5G and the latency issues smart cities is going to be an area of growth for the future. I mean we have demonstrated with certain cities where we're deploying it now that we can actually save them money on a lot of different things and that their payback is relatively quick. So I think that is just something that we're positioning for the future.","And then around media Co. obviously we have the Yahoo asset sitting out there, but to date we have accumulated assets that we believe are really strategic for us to grow this business. And as we've said before, we know that the wallet share of consumer for communications has been flat for relatively the last 15 to 20 years. So we have to think about a different way to monetize our network capability and that monetization will come through advertising.","And it's real simple, I mean, the equation is, if you get more views, you get more advertisers, therefore you generate more revenue. And we see that now with AOL, even with the 10% increase in revenue year-over-year which is the first time we've given that to you, we're starting to see that advertisers are coming to our platforms. So now we just have to integrate and execute on that model and we believe we have the right assets to do that. So the long and short of the answer is, there is nothing large out there that we need to be successful with at this point in time.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you and a quick followup if I may on the mediocre strategy. You know it does seem like increasingly many are attempting to gain share from consumers via video not just some of your peers in the market but on a whole technology company level as well. How do you view your positioning and your ability to do differentiate going foreward? And I guess the question I have is, what have you learned about your strategy thus far be it with AOL Verizon digital media services go90 and how is that informing your strategy going forward in your ability to differentiate?","Francis J. Shammo","No, I think the big differentiation here Amir is, we're developing content for short foremen and really for life and that's really the differentiation is short form content whether that's over the top or via mobile. Also I think the differentiation for us is the integration across our platform. So if you go to AOL now you're going to start to see Complex come through. You will see RatedRed and seriously TV in the future come through on that platform. If you look at the NFL we've adopted that into the go90 platform and I know there's been some articles around viewership of NFL. We've actually seen a healthy increase year-over-year on our platform around the NFL.","So, you know, we are headed in the right direction. The key learnings here have been, you need to have the right content that is appealing to the audience that you're going after and you've seen us make moves. You're going to see us move out of certain content that was originally in go90 that just isn't the right content. But sports news live original content is with the direction that we're taking on this platform and we think we will be successful with that.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks very much for taking my questions.","Francis J. Shammo","Sure, thanks Amir.","Michael T. Stefanski","Thanks for all the questions. So for one last time I have the privilege to turn the call back to Fran.","Francis J. Shammo","Thanks Mike. Before we end I want to highlight just a few key points. Number one, we are focused on maintaining leadership in network quality customer loyalty and financial performance. Strategically, we are aggressively building new businesses with revenue streams and ecosystems are expanding the entire industry. I am confident that Verizon will remain a leading player in the next growth phase of the industry and create value for our shareholders.","Finally, I want to thank the Board, our investors and all of you on this call. It has been a pleasure working with all of you. It has been an honor and privilege to serve as the CFO of Verizon for the last six years. Thank you again for joining Verizon and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President Investor Relations.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Brett. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor and I'm here with Hans Vestberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website.","This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the second quarter of 2019, we reported earnings of $0.95 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a pretax charge of approximately $1.5 billion related to early debt redemption costs. The impact after tax was approximately $1.1 billion or $0.28 per share, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.23. This represents growth of 2.5% on an adjusted basis compared to $1.20 a year ago.","Let's now move to slide four and take a closer look at our earnings profile for the second quarter. Consistent with the approach we discussed last quarter, we have illustrated the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition as well as the adoption of ASC 842 for leases. As we pointed out last quarter, we expect a smaller benefit in 2019 than we realized last year from the adoption of ASC 606 primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction and benefit creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share. The impact was a $0.03 headwind in the quarter and $0.06 year-to-date. As a reminder, this headwind is expected to continue until the end of 2020.","At the beginning of this year, we adopted accounting standard ASC 842 for leases, which resulted in the gross-up on the balance sheet for all operating leases. In addition, the lease standard affects our earnings per share, primarily due to the expensing of certain lease costs. As highlighted previously, we expect this result in a $0.01 to $0.02 per quarter headwind on earnings per share throughout 2019. For the second quarter, this headwind was $0.01 on the earnings per share.","As you can see on the slide, the 2.5% growth in adjusted EPS includes both the impacts from the deferral of commission expense related to the revenue recognition standard and the adoption of the leasing standard. This highlights the strong underlying performance of the business. Matt will take you through the details and key drivers later in the call.","With that I'll now turn the call over to Hans. ","Hans Vestberg","Thanks, Brady, and thanks, everybody, for joining this second quarter earnings call. We had a strong second quarter. It was fueled by a very good wireless service revenue growth as well as a strong EPS -- adjusted EPS growth as well. So I think the team had a good quarter with a lot of focus on the execution. At the same time our operation metrics was good with net additions on the wireless side, as well as a very low churn.","That in combination with a very solid capital allocation, as well as efficiency coming out from our capital allocation process, all-in-all all stranded up to a very good cash flow. So if I sum it up very quickly, a very good quarter from us financially.","Together with our work in the network which is so important to us when we're building our network as a service, we also won all the top third-party measurements. We won from J.D. Power, the 23rd consecutive time, when account the RootMetrics, the 12th straight win there as well. So we are really getting the right feedback from the market and the measurements that is really valuable in this market.","At the same time, we won some more spectrum in the millimeter-wave auction, which is now adding up to our portfolio which means that we have a portfolio for the 5G-era where we can build capacity and we can build coverage, which we said all the time, we want to be in the real 5G with all the 8 currencies that I've talked about before.","We also have launched quite a lot of CTLs lately adding up, so we are on-track for the 30 markets that we have said we will do this year. At the same time we continue to add new devices to the portfolio, the latest one was the Inseego, MiFi and 5G device that we launched recently and we're now four different devices on 5G.","We're also very focused on the fiber because ultimately if you're going to the 5G, you need fiber. Our fiber deployment is now in more than 60 cities and we had 1,400 route miles a month in average in this quarter which means that we increase on the first quarter continued this so important build for our overall Intelligent Edge Network and for the 5G deployment we're doing.","When it comes to Verizon 2.0 won a transformation one of the proof points of course today that we now are reporting Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group as segments in the earnings release that we're doing today.","I can also say that, we get a lot of good traction with our customers especially with enterprise customers with the new support and the new go-to-market we have, where we can show the full portfolio of Verizon and seeing that we have the right support also for the people in the line, meeting our customers everyday.","At the same time we continued Network as a service concept, where we are now announced our collaboration with YouTube TV where we're going to offer up both our Fios customers, but also the wireless customers.","Again working on the motto where we outlined earlier this year, how we can partner with some of these content players instead of investing ourselves in it and seeing that we can bring your seamless service for our customer, but also making it very efficient for ourselves and for our customers.","We also have continued and finalized the Voluntary Separation Program in the quarter and we have done quite a lot of that and that in total now puts us up to have a competitive cost base and actually down quite a lot of these changes recently. So I would say that we are doing this transformation from a positional strength, and I'm really proud of the team that have done all of these changes and transformation in the last 12 months and delivering these results at the same time. And it really sets us up for continue to be very competitive in this market and definitely continue to be the leader in this market. So, I'm proud of the team and what we're producing this quarter.","By that, I hand it over to Matt to go over the financials more in detail.","Matt Ellis","Thanks, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with a recap of our consolidated operating and financial results. On a reported basis, second quarter consolidated revenue was $32.1 billion, which was down slightly as compared to the prior year. Wireless service revenue growth was offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and wireline service revenue.","On a year-to-date basis, consolidated revenue is up slightly at 0.4%. We are maintaining our full year GAAP consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage growth for 2019. On a consolidated basis, second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.7%, which was up from 36.8% in the prior year and includes headwinds of approximately 80 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the impact of the lease accounting standard that Brady mentioned earlier.","Adjusted EBITDA increased more than $200 million or 1.8% over the prior year due to wireless service revenue performance as well as continued improvement in operational efficiencies across the business.","Our business excellence initiatives have realized cumulative cash savings of $4.1 billion since the program started in 2018. We have now completed all three phases of our Voluntary Separation Program and have realized approximately $480 million of expense savings year-to-date.","With the last tranche of employees exiting in late June, we expect additional incremental savings in the third quarter. We remain on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021.","As Brady mentioned, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.23, up from $1.20 a year ago. The increase in our earnings per share was driven by growth of more than $200 million in adjusted EBITDA slightly offset by a higher tax rate. The higher tax rate resulted in an approximately $0.01 headwind to adjusted earnings per share.","As a reminder last year's tax rate included certain one-time benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which do not repeat this year. For 2019, our adjusted effective tax rate is now expected to come in at the lower end of the 24% to 26% range.","Continued wireless service revenue momentum and solid margin performance keep us on track to achieve our guidance of low single-digit percentage growth in adjusted EPS excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard. Our expectation of the lease accounting headwind remains unchanged to approximately $0.04 to $0.08 for full year 2019.","Now, let's move on to the review of the new operating segments under Verizon 2.0 starting with consumer on slide 7. As a reminder, our new consumer segment encompasses both wireless and wireline products and services targeting retail customers as well as our wireless wholesale operations.","In the second quarter, total consumer operating revenue was $22.0 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. These results were primarily driven by continued strong growth in wireless service revenue and file service offerings offset by declines in wireless equipment and legacy wireline services.","Consumer wireless service revenue increased by 2.5%, driven by customer step-ups to unlimited plans and migration within Unlimited to higher tier plans as well as an increase in connections per account. Less than 50% of our customer account base are on unlimited plans.","In the second quarter consumer wireless equipment revenue decreased 8.2% as lower upgrade rates more than offset an increase in phone gross adds. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 1.2% due primarily to the demand for our broadband offerings. Consumer EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 46.5%, which was up 80 basis points from the prior year. This includes headwinds of approximately 100 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and a new lease accounting standard as previously mentioned.","Let's now turn to slide 8 and take a closer look at consumer operating metrics. Within consumer, wireless performance is very strong, while operating in a highly competitive environment. Phone net additions were 73,000 for the quarter as compared to 17,000 last year including postpaid smartphone net additions of 209,000, up 17% from the prior year. This was driven by phone gross additions, which are up more than 5% year-over-year.","Postpaid net additions totaled 126,000 including other connected device net additions of 187,000, primarily wearables offset by tablet net losses of 134,000. Postpaid phone churn of 0.72% improved sequentially due to focused retention efforts around our high-value customer base as well as normal seasonal patterns. This performance was in line with last year strong results. Our superior network quality and personalized offerings continue to resonate with our customers.","Total retail postpaid churn of 0.97% was up compared to 0.93% last year. Total postpaid device activations, of which 81% were phones, were down 7.6%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.3%, down from 5. 1% a year ago, reflecting the continued elongation of the handset upgrade cycle.","In the second quarter, prepaid net losses were 213,000 compared to a loss of 236,000 last year. We continue to focus on high-value account and profitability in our retail prepaid wireless offerings.","Fios Internet net additions of 28,000 were driven by continued demand for our high-quality fiber broadband products. Fios Video losses totaled 52,000 as consumers continue to adopt over-the-top video services to replace traditional linear video offerings.","Now let's move to our business segment on slide 9. Our business segment includes wireless and wireline products and services provided across four customer groups; Global Enterprise, Small and Medium Business, Wholesale and Public Sector and Other, which includes Verizon Connect. Total operating revenues for the business segment decreased 1.1% in the quarter as growth in wireless services and our high-quality fiber products were offset by ongoing secular pressure from legacy technologies.","In the quarter, revenue from our business wireless products grew 5.6% including 6.1% wireless service revenue growth. This strong performance reflects Verizon's best-in-class network quality, reliability and solutions-based approach with our business customers. Revenue from our wireline products declined 7.6% in the quarter.","From a Customer Group perspective, Global Enterprise and wholesale declined 4.8% and 15.1% respectively, driven primarily by legacy pricing pressure and technology shifts. Small and medium business revenue increased 5.4% driven by wireless service and Fios growth partially offset by ongoing declines in traditional data and voice services.","Public sector and other revenue increased 3.8% as a result of growth in wireless and wireline products and services. Business segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 27.3% which was down 20 basis points compared to the prior year driven by declines in legacy wireline product revenues. This includes headwinds of approximately 10 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard as previously mentioned.","Now let's move on to slide 10 to discuss business operating metrics. Business wireless is transforming consistent and strong. Postpaid net adds were 325,000 which includes 172,000 phones 90,000 tablets and 63,000 other connected devices.","Phone churn of 0.97% improved sequentially, while total postpaid churn of 1.21% increased 5 basis points compared to the prior year. Total postpaid device activations were up slightly at 0.6%, while our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.2% down from 4.6% in the prior year.","Let's now move on to slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. For the second quarter Verizon Media Group revenue is $1.8 billion which was down 2.9% versus the prior year, a significant improvement from the 7.2% year-over-year decline reported in the first quarter.","Gains in native and mobile advertising continue to be offset by declines in desktop advertising though the business continues to build on positive momentum in key areas. We are continuing to migrate customers to our recently integrated advertising platforms, simplifying interactions with partners and driving synergies within the business.","We remain focused on growing our audience, engagement and monetization across our super channels which includes sports, finance, news, entertainment, home and mail. During the quarter we launched Yahoo! Finance Premium and HuffPost Plus which is a subscription services that enhance the experience of two of our most popular media assets.","Let's now move to slide 12, which reconciles Verizon 2.0 results to our legacy Verizon 1.0 results. As we mentioned during our Verizon 2.0 segment reporting webcast in mid June, we will be providing overall wireless and wireline results through the remainder of this year. You can find these results in our supplemental information included on our website.","Slide 12 shows a reconciliation from Verizon 2.0 to Verizon 1.0 for both consumer and business revenue. The voice full chart shows the bridge from consumer revenue to wireless and from business revenue to wireline.","The top chart shows consumer which had $22.0 billion of revenue in the quarter. The subtraction of consumer wireline removes $3.1 billion and the addition of business wireless brings in $3.8 billion resulting in total wireless revenues of $22.7 billion.","The bottom chart shows a similar reconciliation from business to wireline revenue. We start with business revenue of $7.8 billion subtract $3.8 billion of business wireless and $0.2 billion of Verizon Connect and then add $3.1 billion of consumer wireline to ultimately arrive at total wireline revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter. Total wireline operating revenues in the quarter declined 4.5% while wireline margins were 19.3%.","Let's move to slide 13, which highlights our overall legacy wireless results. Looking at overall wireless results, which includes both consumer and business wireless, total wireless operating revenue increased 1.0% to $22.7 billion in the second quarter, primarily driven by a 3.1% increase in service revenue.","For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect overall wireless service revenue growth to be within the mid 2% to 3% range. Total wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 48.2%. This includes headwinds of approximately 100 basis points, primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standards as previously mentioned.","Excluding the impact from the accounting standards, second quarter EBITDA margin was 49.2%, up 140 basis points year-over-year. Total postpaid net adds were 451,000 in the quarter. This includes phone net adds of 245,000, which were up from 199,000 a year ago. Postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter were 420,000. Postpaid phone churn of 0.76% was similar to last year while total retail postpaid churn of 1.02% was up five basis points year-over-year.","For the quarter, we increased customer accounts by 8,000 as compared to a loss of 24,000 in the second quarter of last year. Total postpaid device activations were down 5.7%. This was driven by an increase in postpaid growth additions of 3.9 million from 3.8 million in the prior year offset by a decrease in our retail postpaid upgrade rate to 4.3% from 5.0% a year ago.","Let's now focus on our consolidated cash flow results and the balance sheet on slide 14. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $15.8 billion, down from $16.4 billion during the prior year. Benefits from operational improvements were offset by a higher cash tax payments and payments related to the Voluntary Separation Program. The one-time benefits realized last year related to tax reform were primarily recognized in the first half of 2018.","Capital spending for the first half of the year was $8.0 billion, which is up slightly from the prior year. Our capital expenditures continue to support the growth in data and video traffic on our industry leading 4G LTE network, the launch and continued build-out of our 5G Ultra Wideband network, the upgrade to our Intelligent Edge Network architecture and significant fiber deployment in 60-plus markets outside our ILEC footprint.","We maintain our full-year 2019 CapEx guidance range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion. The net results of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first half of the year of $7.9 billion. We ended the quarter with $113.4 billion of total gross debt, which is $1.3 billion lower than the prior year. The unsecured debt balance was $102.1 billion which is lower year-over-year by $3.9 billion and lower sequentially by $1.2 billion.","Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0 times and is down from 2.3 times last year, reflecting the continued strength of our balance sheet. We continue to actively manage our debt portfolio to minimize near-term maturities, optimize our overall funding footprint and lower our cost of capital.","During the quarter we tendered $4.5 billion of notes that resulted in the pretax charge of $1.5 billion that Brady mentioned earlier. The charge is predominantly non-cash. Our balance sheet strength provide us with financial flexibility to execute on our strategy. We continue to maintain near-term maturities at low levels giving us confidence to operate and invest throughout the business cycle.","So in summary, second quarter saw a continuation of our strong performance while we made the transition to Verizon 2.0. We grew customer relationships and increased service revenues.","The growth in our earnings was driven by operational performance from the business which also led to strong cash flow results for the quarter. We continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation and we remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady, so we can get to your questions. ","Brady Connor","Thanks, Matt. Brad, we're now ready to take questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip Cusick","Thanks guys. One short term and one long-term, if I may. First your 2.5% to 3% service revenue growth guide seems very conservative at this point versus 2.7% on the first half. Are there headwinds in the back half that we should think will get the average down below 3%?","And second, Hans can you dig more into the 60 market fiber build? And help us understand any early progress on in-sourcing backhaul, as well as when you will start marketing that to consumer or business out of region? Thank you.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you. Let me start with the wireless service growth and then Matt will come back on that. But I think that, the team has really shown a really good work here in the last couple of quarters since, I would say, we have this new structure.","I'm confident we have a good momentum in our business. Rolling on the team probably have some more quarters up their sleeves, thinking how they will continue to compete in this market. So we think it's our at least, I have a lot of confidence in the team we\u2019re rolling on and continue to progress on the service revenue growth that we have done so far.","On the fiber build, yes that's a very important build for us. And we have been on for that for quite a while right now and the speed in this quarter was 1400 route miles per month in average in the quarter. Remember in the first quarter we talked about 1000, so definitely everywhere coming up.","Right now the majority of the fiber is going to our own sites to build, if I may say. But over time of course when we roll in later in part of this year next year, we're also going to be able to offer that to our enterprise customers and wholesale et cetera. So that's how we're working right now and we're building it in 60 more and because it is just so essential for the whole Intelligent Edge Network, it's so essential for the whole 5G play that we have to have this fiber. So we have a good speed now. The team has been there on for quite a while, and so it will take a little bit longer before we can offer it to all our customers. But mainly I would say we're right now we're taking to our own sites, which is very important improvement for our efficiency. Matt?","Matt Ellis","Yeah. So good morning Phil. So on the service revenue, certainly pleased with the results we've seen in the first half of the year, 3.1% in second quarter, driven by over 6% in the business segment. So great momentum in the wireless products and services across both segments as we head into the second half of the year. We like the momentum we have as we jump off into second half and we'll wait and see how the back half of the year plays out in terms of the total service revenue growth. We certainly see a continued path to continue on the service revenue growth we've had for over a year or so now.","Philip Cusick","And Hans if I can follow-up the in-sourcing of your backhaul as you take fiber to your sites, has that really begun to start lowering cost, or are you not starting to light that up yet?","Hans Vestberg","We have been starting, but of course today on the total cost we have, it's not significant yet. But this is all part of the Intelligent Edge Network, the multipurpose network we're building and that's what you're seeing in our CapEx, the last two years the efficiencies. And as you remember Kyle talked about the Intelligence Edge network build is going a couple of year more. So we, of course, believe that we have more efficient as it come out and one of them is definitely the fiber, which we're now building that definitely should get a their own economics long-term and also remember that -- also that this is a growth opportunity for us as well in certain areas.","Philip Cusick","Thank you.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Phil. Hey, Brett, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the questions. This one's for Matt. As you show on slide 14, you're getting very close to achieving the net unsecured leverage target you outlined at your analyst meeting a couple of months ago. Is it a question as you get down to two churns of leverage and below, how do you think about prioritizing the incremental capital you'll be generating at that point? Should we think about that as dry powder for spectrum, which you may be look to flex up on CapEx a bit, or are we actually getting closer to a point where share repurchases become a higher and more immediate priority? Thank you.","Hans Vestberg","So let me start here and this is of course something that me and Matt is working with confidence. Remember what we outlined in February, we're very clear and disciplined where our capital allocation. Number one into the business, the CapEx you have seen what we have done with the CapEx the last couple of years. We do everything we need and we are on historical levels and we will continue to be very disciplined there.","Secondly, we want to put our Board in a position to make a dividend that we have been working and ultimately we work with our debt. That's how we work all the time. So it\u2019s business, dividend and debt.","And we -- want to continue this commitment that we made to get into this range and remember that was a commitment longer before me, but as you know we are company to always deliver on the commitments. So that's why it's important and ultimately we will get there. We will get optionality to our board to have a great conversation what we\u2019re going to do with it. That's how I see it. And then of course Matt is working with this daily to see that we have the right balance sheet structure and the capital allocation of the company. Matt?","Matt Ellis","Yes Hans. So thanks for those points. And just building may be on the back end of that. So as you said Brett, we are -- we're as close as we\u2019ve been to that range in the past 5-plus years. And \u2013 so, we're making good progress to get there and that comes from having strong results that drive good cash flow and you see the progress we've been able to make.","But just a couple of add-on points to what Hans said. It's a range that we say we want to be instead of long term. That means, we don't want to go past the 1.75 end of that range either. And so get into the range and then be in the range. And then we also don't expect to build up cash on the balance sheet beyond our normal operating level.","So as we get into the range we look at the opportunities priority number one, which is to invest in the business and the rest of the items that Hans talk about. We'll then decide the most appropriate use of cash that we may have to drive long-term value for our shareholders.","Brett Feldman","Thank you.","Brady Connor","All right. Thanks Brett. Hey Brad we are ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simon Flannery","Thanks. Good morning. Hans I wonder if you could update us a little bit more on here 5G. You talked a bit about opening up the new mobile broadband market. Perhaps if you can talk about your learning so far and where we stand on expanding 5G Home? I think you've talked before about new markets later this year and dynamic spectrum sharing. How is that panning out? And when do we expect to see that hitting the Verizon network? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","Thanks. Great questions. So on the 5G, you have seen our progress in the quarter. We have basically now launched nine markets on the way to get to the 30 that we have talked about for the full year.","You can also see on the 5G Mobility, how the improvements has gone extremely fast. I mean, take a couple of the cities where we basically have doubled the footprint in this since we launched the markets and that's this pace we're onto.","At the same time we are going from roughly having 600 megabits in speed on the handset now we're doing easily 1.3, 1.5 and averaging up to 2 gig. What I want to tell you is that the development we're doing on technology is actually extremely fast compared to what I saw in 4G. And remember I was part of 4G as well.","I mean we are here to quarter into all these nine markets we have launched, we have launched with all the three infrastructure vendors we have which means that, we are coming out from sort of your scaling in the beginning, getting all the technology to work and now again starts our scaling. At the same time we are now three handsets and we have the Inseego MiFi that we launched which is sort of a business proposition as well for 5G.","So I think that, that's what you see. We see a great improvement. But still it's a lot of the intelligent antenna sort of technology that we're developing. The team is out in the field every day. So I'm confident that we will continue to do well here.","And remember now in 5G out of wideband that we're doing right now. We're doing that in the most dense populated areas where really 5G is coming to its right, you know, with a fantastic sort of the performance there. So that's it.","When we then talk about the 5G Home, you're absolutely right. I said that later this year we're going to launch 5G or 5G Home with and\/or chipset. So that will come back, so there's no changes to those plans. Ultimately your question about DSS, which is dynamic spectrum sharing, which is an important piece for anyone that wants to do coverage on 5G. That is still coming in the first half of next year.","But in our case what I said before, the most important is to get our customer the best experience. We have the best experience on 4G right now. We are just giving an extraordinary experience on the Ultra Wideband. We're going to be in the position to give optionality when we turn that off\/on and we're going to turn it on with coverage and capacity when we see it's a benefit for our customers.","But I would say the activity level in the engineering team, the team working on the ground in every city, doing the fiber is extremely high in Verizon right now. So I think our focus is absolutely in the right place to see that our network is the number one. I remember also what I said previously, the 4G network now continue to win all the third-party awards. I mean, RootMetrics, J.D. Power in this quarter, so we're not neglecting that part neither. So you need to think about that when you have a customer in front of you.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks a lot.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Simon. Brett, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.","David Barden","Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could. One for Matt. If we're guiding for the low end of the tax rate for 2019, should we be then thinking that we're steering our earnings per share growth up, or are there other things in the mix that we shouldn't be taking that improvement right to the bottom line?","And then the second question would be, just with respect to the legacy 1.0 reporting for the business segment. I think one of the surprises that came out of the AT&T result was the strength that they showed relative to history in the enterprise business and they talked about price stability, and other things I think Randall said that this was good at outlook as you have for that unit for some time. I think that the performance that Verizon didn't seem to kind of reflect the same strength. But I'm wondering if it had something to do with the reorganization in the quarter and we should start to see some improvement there. I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit on that? Thank you.","Hans Vestberg","Yeah. I can start with the last question there about the business side of it. And I think that when it comes to what you called out the wireline business, I mean it was little bit blended, little bit tougher on the enterprise side. But on the other hand the governmental business and the small and medium have a good growth for us. So I think we see a very good possibility to continue to see that with the accelerates, sort of, the decline in enterprise. We have great funnel in the enterprise business as well.","I remember I mean there's no impact of the reorganization we have done. I mean I would go the opposite. I will say that, hey the changes we have done in the last 12 months compared to what we've done in the last five to 10 years and we delivered these results in all the units, I think it's a really strength of the company that we are doing a transformation from a positional strength and then, which will set us up to be even stronger going forward.","And, of course, Tam and our team are working daily with our customers and as I said also in my previously, I mean the excitement from -- enterprise customers when we come with the full portfolio, so be it fiber or if it's coming with the 4G or 5G solution, mobile edge compute. I think we have a good and compelling story to continue to work on there. So that's how I see the business. Then of course we still have some legacy business declining in the enterprise side which we'll have for a couple of quarters right now. Our work is to see that accelerated all the time. Matt?","Matt Ellis","Yes. So David, on the ETR, so as I look at that, remind you that on a year-over-year basis the adjusted ETR is actually is up as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and largely that's because of the onetime impacts a year ago from the adoption of the tax reform.","So we do see that continuing to be higher year-over-year. But despite that the EPS in the quarter was up $0.03 even with some headwind from the ETR on a year-over-year basis and also approximately $0.04 of headwind from the accounting standard. So kind of similar to the first quarter, so good EPS performance year-over-year in both first quarter and second quarter, strong momentum there for us.","We jumped off into the second half of the year and so I feel good about where we are so far this year and we'll see how the back end plays out, but certainly a very strong platform to be building from. ","David Barden","Thanks, guys.","Brady Connor","Thanks, David. Hey, Brett, we are ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.","John Hodulik","Great. Thanks. Two questions, first on the 5G Home. Hans how should we think about the expansion of the 5G Home footprint once you get the standards-based equipment? And anything you could tell us on sort of growth in the target market or higher expected subscriber base to grow out?","And then second base -- the second question is on spectrum. Obviously you guys control less spectrum then your current competitors and with a T-Mobile Sprint deal, we're looking at coming with over 300 megahertz of spectrum. Is that a competitive disadvantage for you at this point? And would that situation worsen with a competitor out there with that much spectrum certainly relative to its smaller subscriber base? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","Okay. On the 5G Home, I think -- remember we have the limited sort of 5G Home in four markets right now and we capped both the development on our software as well on how many cities. That's how we did a proprietary solution.","The only thing I can say, our win share is really good in those markets. It seems to be good appetite for 5G Home. We have a good performance of it. And then we're going for the second half of this year or this part of the year, we're going to come back with NR sort of 5G Home CP equipment.","And I think that what we're going to do, we need a certain size of market that -- so it makes sense for us. So I think as we said before, I mean this is the 2021 when we're going to have a significant impact on our revenue. So 2020 is going to be an important year for us and of course coming out now in the latter part of this year and starting at the markets all the time will be very important.","On the spectrum side, I mean, I think that we always have the headwind that people don't think we have enough spectrum and all of that. I mean what this organization and this engineering team is doing with the spectrum is, I would say is magnificent.","Now remember sometimes when we talk about spectrum its so much more it is softer how you plan, how you build the network, how you get utilization out of it? And I think that -- that the team has done very good all the time.","As I said previously, we have a very compelling position when it comes to millimeter wave for ultra wideband, but we also have spectrum where we can deploy 5G in the other bands ultimately 5G is going to be on all bands. And I have a high confidence that my team is going to be doing that well continue to have the leadership in the market when it comes to network performance. There might also come up opportunities all the time where it could be added spectrum. But right now to launch both capacity and coverage, we feel confident on the assets we have.","John Hodulik","Great. Thanks.","Brady Connor","Thanks, John. Hey, Brett, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jennifer Fritzsche","Great. Thank you for taking the question. If I may, I just wanted to revisit on the fiber activity. I think you said you're now adding 1,400 miles of fiber -- route miles every month versus 1,000. Some tower companies have cited some issues with municipalities and power companies and utility. Are you finding that easier lately or harder? Because that just seems like a 40% increase monthly is a big jump.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you for the question. I would say this is not an easy work. This is really what Verizon is great at. I mean, we have people all the way from working with the municipalities, working with engineering, planning, working with third parties. And remember in the couple of years since we decided to invest together with warning in the fiber factory, we have come to actually around 1,400 route miles a month.","So yes you're right, we are scaling right now and the team is really, really responding to the demands we have on them. We're always going to have even higher internal demands on them, but as you can see we definitely have a good role right now, but that doesn't mean that it's easy to do it. But I think we have put the machine in place with a team that I have lot of confidence into it.","Jennifer Fritzsche","And Hans if I may, should we continue to see that number increase throughout the year as you gain more scale?","Hans Vestberg","Not so much. I think we start to getting on the volumes we are and that's really important on the stand, because there has been questions on market, the CapEx will go up and all of that. Remember we are almost on the higher volume where we believe we need to be in order to serve this market, because there are of course technicalities of doing it. So I think we have a machine right now that is actually executing very well on the high volume. There might be some increases but maybe not so much more. I think now it's more about the broad deployment in all of these markets where we are right now deploying fiber.","Jennifer Fritzsche","Terrific. Thank you.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Jennifer. Hey, Brett, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Rollins","Hi thanks. Couple of questions. First, has there been any recent changes to the cable MVNO deal? And how do you see your role continuing to evolve as a wholesaler of capacity in the industry?","And then secondly is there an update on any of the potential strategic moves you could make on the wireline side, whether it's asset optimization or trying to figure out maybe how to proceed in the video business with the current size that you have? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","Okay. Thank you. On the MVNO side, no, there are no major differences but the important is that, we believe its good model. Remember we outlined our network-to-service strategy where we -- sometimes we're doing the connectivity and then we have others being on top of this in MVNO, sometimes we do the connectivity to platforms and in some cases we do the whole strategy.","So I think that that continues to be important for us and we're happy with our partnership with the cable MVNO which is part of how we are actually doing a month usage of our assets, getting maximum utilization of the investments we're doing. So for us this is playing straight into the long-term goals as we have as a company.","On the wireline optimization, we -- I would say that the biggest assets we have here is of course all the infrastructure we have, but also the customer relations we have and we are working. Of course we are looking into all the areas we need to fortify or all the areas we should drop which was the market is not demanding. And I think that's a very normal way of reviewing the strategy all the time.","And Tammy and the team is now in place for this quarter, they are confident talking to the customer what we need to do and where we need to fortify in some areas where the products maybe around heating. But is no major, it is just the daily grinding that you do in order to optimize, how you work with your customers and how you optimize your capital and efficiency.","And I can also add of course that, in this quarter we announced and that we're going to work with YouTube TV when it comes to the sort of the linear TV both for the Fios optionality as well as for the wireless customers. So again, working with the model that we outlined in February and just continue with that.","Michael Rollins","Thank you.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Mike. Hey, Brett, ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Moffett","Yes, hi. Hans, I wonder, if we could go back to the spectrum question for a second. I understand that the longer term spectrum position for 5G, you have a lot of spectrum bands outside of millimeter wave.","But there's been a lot of concern in the market of late that for the near term your coverage map may be more limited than your competitors, until you can start peeling away some of your LTE and 3G committed spectrum bands and dedicate them.","Can you just talk about that issue? And how you think about the coverage layer of 5G over the next few years as you make the transition?","Hans Vestberg","No, that's a great question. I think first of all DSS which is Dynamic Spectrum Sharing is the same for all and that's a standard solution coming out in the market software. So I think that we're not disadvantage -- anyone if you want to deploy your coverage and I think that's how we are on.","At the same time you also want to see that there's enough handsets things out in the market when you start turning on 5G, so you get because we want to do a transformative feeling of over 5Gs. We don't want to rebrand them and say it's 5G and you don't feel a difference. We already have the best 4G network and for us the customer is the most important.","So you're right. I mean I see that we will have a coverage map whenever it's going to be needed for our customers and is going to be enough handsets in the market and not disadvantage for anything. So I think that historically we have had those feedbacks that we are not in the right position with spectrum etcetera.","I come from the outside. I worked and saying what Verizon has done with spectrum and with new software\u2019s and with the optimizing, how you build the networks and I'm confident that we have a good path here. I'm not feeling that we're disadvantaged. I feel that we're executing right now, we're launching markets where others are doing other things. ","Craig Moffett","Is there any concern that even from a marketing messaging perspective though that your competitors will have more ink on the map so to speak early on in 5G even if the experience in 5G may not be all that much better than your 4G networks?","Hans Vestberg","Let's see how that turns out. Because again there\u2019s a lot of promises. I think that Verizon has had and I actually inherited a fantastic DNA in this company that we first do the things and then we start marketing it. And I think that's what we will continue to do. Other might have other strategy, so I'm not going into that contest about who is talking most right now.","I'm working with a technology, myself weekly to see that we are doing this right for our customers and that's a consumer, it's an enterprise customer, it's a governmental customers, it\u2019s an IoT customers. We think it through and that\u2019s why we build the Intelligent Edge Network already and started two years ago.","And I think that the significance of understanding, how important that is for the success of Verizon, I think has not really been understood yet. And we will just continue to execute on that. But there's going to be a lot of message in the market and you know it as well. Just be confident that our company, Verizon will continue to execute on the real 5G with eight currencies and seeing that we can actually give the right performance to all our customers in the right moment. ","Craig Moffett","Thanks, Hans.","Brady Connor","Yeah. Thanks, Craig.","Craig Moffett","Thank you.","Brady Connor","Hey, Brett, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Colby Synesael","Great. Two questions if I may. First for Matt, I was hoping you could quantify the cost of the VSP plan that was implemented in the second quarter. Since that didn't seem to have an impact on free cash flow? And then secondly if you're able to just quantify the savings you could expect from that as we go into the third quarter?","And then my second question has to do with the fiber out miles you're referencing on the call. I just wanted to separate the conversation between the route miles and small cells. So I appreciate your adding about 1,400 miles, route miles per month in the second quarter. But are you seeing the same momentum in terms of actually getting the small cells put up as well? Because I feel like you could still be adding the fiber route miles, but not necessarily getting the actual small cells up and seems like those two things would have to go hand-in-hand and that might explain why some of other companies that are out there doing the same thing might be seeing the lease on the small cell side? Thank you.","Hans Vestberg","I can start with the fiber and Matt will on start on the other one. So the fiber, remember it's a multiuse fiber and I have several different customers. I have the network guys that need this for 4G and 5G, I have the enterprise, I have the small and medium, and I have wholesale. And that's, of course, very important when we build that we can have owner economics on fiber and we can build it as we had all those customers.","But, of course, initially quite a lot of the fiber is coming and going to the small cells and that's why we are able to turn up the 2019, as we have done so far. But again, the question earlier was about how much we are now actually gaining on it.","I think this is an early indicator about how we're building the network, because you need to start with the fiber and getting the permits in the cities before you can deploy the 5G. So this is early indications that we have a high speed and organization to be prepared for the 5G. And whatever our use cases we have for fiber. Matt?","Matt Ellis","Yeah. So, Colby, on the voluntary separation, yeah, obviously, the income statement charges we took in the fourth quarter of last year from a cash flow standpoint, we took but the largest piece was in the first quarter and then some in 2Q and 3Q. Certainly I think that there's good savings in the first half of the year. We mentioned like $418 million of positive impact in the first half of the year and we'll have another step-up in 3Q as the final tranche of employees came off payroll at the end of June.","So for the full year, I expect that to be north of $1 billion of impact and that benefit on a year-over-year basis will carry over into the first half of next year until we get to a full run rate by June of next year. So certainly being a positive thing is part of our overall focus on improvement the cost efficiency of the business and we will continue to focus on that. We're well on-track to more than meet the $10 billion commitment we made and the VSP was a big component of that.","Colby Synesael","Thank you.","Brady Connor","Yeah, thanks, Colby. Hey, Brett, we are ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Mike McCormack","Hey, thanks guys. Hans maybe just a quick comment on what you're seeing at robust subscriber estimate business segment for wireless. What you're seeing from a competitive standpoint in the B2B marketplace?","I know one of your competitors is pretty loud about getting bigger there. And just thinking about the ARPA drivers going forward, what do you see there? Obviously you have more route to move to Unlimited. Any other puts and takes of ARPUs should be thinking about the back half? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","Yes. On the business side when it comes to wireless we are taking share. We feel really good about it. I think that Tam and the team are doing a great job with relationship that we had of course the network quality we have, it is very important for businesses. I mean there's no doubt about that coverage and capacity becomes even more important and there's no enterprise company there has not been a bigger to transformation. So I'm pleased with that we want to do even more. So yes.","The second question was about the ARPA. I will hand it over to Matt. But I can also say that, a team with Ronan, especially on the consumer side has been since Unlimited would launch continue to lean forward with new offerings with new ways of dealing with the market segmenting and up and actually continue to have good service revenue role.","And I think that's what I'm pleased with and I look at the team. I know that they have more call up the sleeves so they say. So what Matt and I are doing together we're transforming the company to have a decent term to closer that to be prepared for that marketplace to continue to do well. So I feel good about Ronan and what his team is doing. Matt?","Matt Ellis","Yes. Thanks Hans. So Mike as you think about wireless as a whole in your office trajectory, it's coming from the overall growth of the business. Just a few things to point out that's really driving both ARPA and obviously the total service revenue being the B2B space which have very strong results in the quarter, while the consumer space which also performed well.","Net account growth positive in second quarter of this year, that's up year-over-year so a good growth there. We continue to lead the industry in phone gross adds yet again a number of quarters in a row that we've done that. And in addition to leading the industry in gross adds, growing year-over-year and not \u2013 that\u2019s something that not all industry participants can say that they did.","So leading the industry in gross adds also leading the industry in phone churn, yet again. The net result there is phone net adds of 245,000 a nice increase over the 199,000 last year. So as I think about the business in the first half of the year, we had nice strong performance that went from the operational side on to the financials as well, puts us in a good great place as we jump off into the second half of the year to continue that momentum, and feel good about where we are at this point in time.","Mike McCormack","Great. Thanks, guys.","Matt Ellis","Yeah. Thanks, Mike.","Brady Connor","Yeah. Hey, Brett, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question will come from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. Just a couple on wireless competition. So Hans, obviously, a strong wireless quarter. I'm curious if you're seeing any competitive impact from the first set initiative at AT&T. I know, I think you recently signed a deal with the Massachusetts first responder. I'm not sure if that\u2019s sign of competition going back and forth.","And then I was just hoping to revisit, bundling and the importance of video to wireless with AT&T planning to bundle HBO Max when the launch it next spring with wireless services. Is bundling video with wireless, is it a lower churn, or is it just necessary to compete on the promotional basis with others that are offering video. I'm just sort of curious how that informs your video strategy? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","Yes. So you need to speak a little bit when we talk about the consumer and business. But let me just say, I mean if I look in the second quarter it was a little bit more competitive than the first quarter when it comes to competition in the market and that tells a lot about our performance that we gained all those net additions at the same time we had the low churn.","And so I think that on the business side, as I said before, we are -- we're doing well on the business side and again I think that the wireless part of the business side is important than the network performance ease of critical essence, the coverage and the performance. But, of course, there's competition for those deals as well. I think we're doing well in that area and we will continue to do well.","We have new offerings coming out and we'll continue to build the network even more robust and getting more quality on it. So again I think the team is there, Matt and I are working with transformation of the company to enable after continue to compete and do well in the market and even both Tami, I would say and Ronan are the sort of tools to work in the market. And that's what we're doing. And I think we're done it well in this quarter and preparing for the rest of the year.","Matt Ellis","Just one follow-up on the video question there. Look we're very confident with \u2013 the most important thing to customers and wireless is the quality of the network experience. And so for the past couple of years now, we're seeing competitors bundled video offerings in with wireless and we continue to lead the industry in phone gross adds and we continue to lead the industry in churn. So I think that demonstrates the most important thing to customer is the quality of that connection, the reliability of that connection and that when you have the best network, you don't need to bundle other things in there in the same way and we'll continue to be focused on providing the best quality network out there.","Doug Mitchelson","Great. Thank you.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Doug. Hey, Brett, that's all the time we have right now. Before we end the call, I'd like to hand it over to Hans for some closing comments.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you, Brady. I think we've covered quite a lot of ground in this call, because basically question has range for all our business. But here's just a couple of things. First of all, I'm really proud of the team, what they\u2019ve achieved. And remember we have change the structure, we have changed how we build a network, we have done large voluntary program. We're reporting in a new structure, we're putting new structure and team is executing well.","I think that's the way we want to work here, continue to lead the market and continue transform to be a strong company with a strategy we set out in February.","So that then comes back to execution on fundamentals. That's what we're doing and will continue to do so to be disciplined on our capital, also continue to lead to market. And then of course I think a lot of questions are circulating around the 5G what we laid out in the February, Capital Markets Day is still valid and that's what we're aiming for and we are executing on and I think that the team is doing a great job there.","So I think that to sum it up. I'm proud of the quarter and the changes that we're doing at the same time delivering this quarter so -- and financial earnings. So thank you very much for attending this call. And I guess I'll see you out there soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the conference call for today.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.","John N. Doherty","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.","Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.","I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on the website.","Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I\u2019d like to cover a few items upfront. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64, up 12.3% from last year and $0.05 higher than the first quarter. To the first half of the year, EPS of $1.23 was 15% higher than a year ago. There were no special items of non-operational nature included in our reported results for the second quarter or the first half of this year or the comparable periods in 2011.","In terms of activity below the operating income line, you will note that equity in earnings from unconsolidated businesses, which is primarily our minority interest in Vodafone Italy declined by about $50 million this quarter due to the continued economic pressures in Europe. This represents about $0.02 in earnings per share. other than that, there is nothing unusual in terms of other income, interest or income taxes.","I'd also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","with that, I'll turn the call over to Fran.","Francis J. Shammo","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our financial results. We continue to execute well across the entire business. Solid top line performance combined with a strong focus on profitability, and cost management has resulted in double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share for the last two quarters.","This strong operating performance together with our disciplined capital spending is driving significant increases in free cash flow, resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business.","Through the first half of the year, we generated $7.8 billion of free cash flow, which is more than twice the amount we generated in the first half of 2011. The Wireless business is firing on all cylinders and our strategic actions and results clearly demonstrate our position of leadership in the industry. We continue to post strong growth in retail service revenue, driven by increased smartphone penetration, Internet device adoption and new customer additions.","In the second quarter, this top line growth combined with effective cost management and excellent customer retention resulted in a record setting EBITDA service margin of 49%, which surpassed our previous high of 47.8% in the third quarter of last year.","In Wireline, consumer revenues were up 2.5%, which was the highest growth rate we've seen in several years. While we continue to face challenges in the enterprise and wholesale markets, we are confident that the decisions we\u2019re making and the actions we are taking are the right ones for the long-term.","We're intensely focused on profitability management and key actions related to this include product portfolio rationalization, targeted pricing moves and cost management initiatives. I will go through these in more detail during our segment review. In time, these actions will result improved wireline profitability. in spite of some revenue softness this quarter, we were able to increase the EBITDA margin by 50 basis points sequentially to 23.1% and our objective is to have a stronger EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012. Overall, our strong second quarter and first half putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year.","Let\u2019s begin our review with a look at consolidated results on slide four. We sustain solid consolidated growth trends in the quarter, with contributions from all strategic areas. Consolidated revenue grew to $28.6 billion, up 3.7%. Our focus on expense control helped drive double-digit operating income growth of 15.5%.","To put this in perspective, while consolidated revenue increased $310 million sequentially, operating income is up over $450 million. This clearly demonstrates that our product rationalization, cost management, and process improvement efforts are starting to payoff. We continue to be very focused on improving profitability, moving more of every dollar we generate to the bottom line.","Consolidated EBITDA grew to $9.8 billion and our margin expanded to 34.2%, up 150 basis points on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. The upshot is an improved earnings growth trajectory for this year. As John indicated in his introductory remarks, we posted better than 12% EPS growth in the second quarter and we are up 15% year-to-date, which is at the upper end of the guidance we provided in January of last year.","Let\u2019s turn now to cash flow and capital spending on slide five. Our free cash flow this quarter increased $3 billion sequentially to $5.4 billion driven by a 56% increase in cash from operations and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $690 million compared to last year.","For the first half, capital spending of $7.4 billion was down more than 16% year-to-date. Our outlook for the full-year is flat to down versus $16.2 billion in 2011. We continue to expect our annual CapEx to revenue ratio to decline, based on improving revenue trends and disciplined capital spending.","In Wireless, CapEx in the second quarter was $2 billion, which was 23% lower than last year. Through the first half, Wireless capital was $3.9 billion, was down 27% year-over-year. You will recall that in the first half of last year, we were spending more for 3G capacity in connection with our initial launch of the iPhone. Going forward, we expect to see continued migration of traffic from 3G to our lower cost 4G LTE platform, which will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency.","We will also continue expanding our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation by a wide margin. In Wireline, we spent $1.6 billion in capital during the second quarter, 5.3% less than last year. Through the first half, Wireline capital was essentially flat with last year at $3.1 billion.","Our balance sheet and credit metrics remained very strong. Total debt of $52.4 billion is down $2.8 billion since the end of last year. Net debt was $42.4 billion at the end of June and our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2 times.","Let\u2019s now move into our review of the segments starting with Wireless on slide six. Our Wireless business had another very impressive quarter sustaining strong growth in retail service revenue, higher retail postpaid ARPU growth and excelling cost and churn management resulting in our highest EBITDA service margin ever.","Total Wireless revenues of $18.6 billion grew 7.4% and now represents 65% of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue year-to-date. Our revenue results were driven by 8.6% growth in retail service revenue. Postpaid revenue, which makes up most of retail service, grew 8.3%. Retail prepaid revenue was also very strong, up 27.2%, the highest growth we\u2019ve seen in four years. Total service revenue grew 7.3% this quarter and is up 7.5%, year-to-date. Data which represents almost 44% of service revenue grew 18.5% to $6.9 billion in the quarter. Retail postpaid data revenue grew more than 20%.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at connection growth on slide seven. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market driven by sustained demand for our 3G and 4G LTE handsets, tablets and internet devices, with the unmatched service quality of the nations largest and most reliable wireless network. We have an industry leading 94.2 million retail connection, with nearly 89 million postpaid and more than 5.3 million prepaid.","During the quarter, we added 1.2 million new retail net connection; 888,000 postpaid and 290,000 prepaid. Before we discuss postpaid in more detail, I\u2019d highlight another strong quarter of retail prepaid performance with a 24% sequential increase and net adds. Similarly last quarter, tablets represented a little more than half of the add, however this quarter 95% of our prepaid tablet additions were 4G LTE, which is key from the standpoint of better operating and capital efficiency.","In postpaid, our 888,000 net adds represent a substantial sequential increase from 501,000 in the first quarter. Our porting ratios with the major carriers continue to be strong and our churn metrics remain excellent. Retail postpaid churn of 0.84% is the lowest we\u2019ve seen in four years.","Postpaid growth additions in the quarter were just over $3.1 million, up about 3% sequentially. As expected, upgrades were lower sequentially with about 7% of our postpaid base upgrading devices in the quarter. In addition to increasing smartphone penetration, we also continue to make good progress with internet devices, which include postpaid tablets.","In the second quarter about 90% of the internet device sales were 4G LTE. We are far and away the market leader in this space with more than 7.5 million internet device connections in our retail postpaid base.","Next, let\u2019s turn to slide eight and take a look at smartphone and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. We had another strong quarter of smartphone sales increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 50%. Once again an increasing majority of retail postpaid phone sales were smartphone, 73% compared with 60% a year ago.","During the second quarter, we activated 2.9 million Android smartphones, 2.5 million of which were 4G LTE and 2.7 million Apple iPhone, up from 2.3 million a year ago. During the second quarter 25% of iPhone sales were gross adds or new to Verizon, with 75% representing upgrades from existing customers. In terms of 4G phone sales 20% were new to Verizon and 80% upgrades. Importantly, more than 40% of customers upgrading this quarter were buying a smartphone for the first time.","Retail postpaid ARPU was $56.13 this quarter, up 3.7%, which was higher than the previous record growth of 3.6% last quarter. In terms of the mix, retail postpaid phone ARPU of about $58, grew 4.9% while internet device ARPU of about $47, declined 6.6%. As expected, Internet device ARPU has become less dilutive to blended post data ARPU and growth.","In addition, these devices continue to generate double-digit service revenue growth. Our 4G LTE deployment has expanded the market for these devices. All of which enables higher usage of our network.","Our Share Everything plans, which became available on June 28 represent a new and innovative pricing framework, providing a unique customer value proposition and at the same time creating an optimal way for us to monetize increasing data usage. These strategic thrust of these plans is to encourage device adoption and stimulate usage. Our plans are designed to make the decision to upgrade to a smartphone or add a tablet much easier.","By allowing up to 10 devices to share data, these plans also provide for the creation and adoption of all kinds of new connected devices. Early feedback has been great and our customer adoption is tracking with our expectations. We are seeing a wide variety of customers and family share accounts opting into Share Everything, including existing smartphone customers with unlimited data plans.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 9, as I\u2019d like to spend a few more minutes talking about the strength of our 4G LTE leadership. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE coverage, which is now available in 337 markets covering more than 230 million tops, which is nearly 75% of the U.S. population. And point of fact, we have more 4G LTE coverage than all of our competitors networks combined. Throughout the year, we will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nation wide footprint similar to our 3G network by mid-2013. We continue to be very pleased with 4G LTE adoption.","Customer awareness of our 4G LTE network superiority is increasing. And our new brand advertising further positions us as the network of choice for 4G LTE. Sales of 4G LTE devices have risen steadily, each and every quarter since we launched service about a year and half ago.","During the second quarter, 4G LTE smartphone sales increased more than 16% sequentially to 2.5 million units, nearly a 11 million or 12% of our 89 million retail postpaid connections are 4G LTE. Roughly 70% are smartphones, and 30% are Internet devices.","Stated in other way, about 19% of our smartphone base has a 4G LTE handset, and more than 43% of our Internet device connections are 4G LTE. While these statistics are impressive in their own way, they also show we have lots of room to grow, which is a very positive indicator for us looking forward.","Let\u2019s conclude our Wireless segment review with the discussion about profitability on slide 10.","We generated $7.7 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, which is an increase of 15.8% and expanded our EBITDA service margins by 270 basis points sequentially to 49%, again a record high for us.","Our margin performance is once again a testament to our sustained ability to execute well on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. The combination of sustained service revenue and ARPU growth, an intense focus on cost management, lower upgrade eligibility, and consistently excellent in churn metrics are contributing to our industry leading margin performance.","We will continue to look at all opportunities within our cost structure to drive process improvements and operating efficiencies. As I previously indicated, we have identified $2 billion in cost savings opportunities in wireless, and we remain right on track to successfully capture these savings.","On the transaction front, our purchase of the AWS licenses from SpectrumCo, Cox and Leap Wireless are at varying stages of review by the FCC and the Department of Justice. We continue to expect approval and to close these transactions this summer. Our plans for an open sale process for our 700 megahertz A and B spectrum licenses are proceeding as planned, but of course remain contingent upon the closing of the AWS purchases I just mentioned.","The agreement that we announced in late June with T-Mobile to exchange specific spectrum in the AWS band is also contingent upon the closing of those transactions. These license transfers also require FCC approval, which is expected later this summer. These transactions are good for all parties and the industry as a whole, as we facilitate the best first use of this spectrum for all players. We appreciate the constructive role the FCC has played in this process, and look forward to securing approval.","Let\u2019s move to our wireline segment next on slide 11. Second quarter wireline revenues were flat sequentially, but declined 3.1% year-over-year. From a profitability perspective, wireline EBITDA declined 6% year-over-year, but improved about 2% on a sequential basis, with EBITDA margin moving up 50 basis points sequentially to 23.1% despite lower quarterly revenue.","Wireline revenue is affected by a number of underlying factors. On the upside, revenue growth is accelerating in the consumer market, driven by FiOS, which again at 2.5% was the highest growth we\u2019ve seen in several years.","Enterprise and wholesale revenue continues to be impacted by secular and global economic challenges, particularly in Europe as well as by related foreign exchange movements.","In addition, as we indicated last quarter, we are also making deliberate and specific moves to rationalize and simplify our Enterprise Solutions product portfolio, eliminating products where they no longer make sense, reducing product complexity, streamlining services, and consolidating networks to improve efficiency and product profitability.","We currently have more than 700 different products and thousands of variations that are defined by particular geography, network or system. This portfolio simplification effort will dramatically improve our go-to-market speed and operations quality. In the near-term, these actions create revenue impacts. Over time however, the actions will result in margin benefits and improved profitability.","We estimate that about 65% of the overall wireline revenue decline this quarter was a result of our own deliberate actions to improve profitability. Examples include the de-emphasis of drop-ship CPE, the continued exit from certain international wholesale routes and contracts, decommissioning end of life products like ATM, frame relay and IP VPN, no longer offering dry-loop DSL or selling DSL in FiOS markets, and exiting non-strategic product lines by calling cards and payphones.","Again, we firmly believe that these are the right actions to be taking at this time. We are on the right track, and I\u2019m confident that these product rationalization and process simplification initiatives, along with additional cost management actions will improve the long-term profitability of the wireline business.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at revenue results starting with mass markets on slide 12. Within mass markets, consumer revenue growth of 2.5% improved from 1.7% and 1.3% in each of the last two quarters. As a result, our pricing actions related to set-top box rentals, triple play bundles, and higher data speeds available through our new FiOS Quantum offer. The outlook for accelerating consumer revenue growth in the next several quarters looks very encouraging.","Our residential connections trends also continue to improve. We lost 199,000 retail residential connections in the quarter, representing a 6.6% decline year-over-year, compared with a loss of $240,000 or 8.2% at this time last year.","FiOS revenue grew 17.4% in the quarter and now represents 65% of consumer revenue. As a result of the increasing scale of FiOS, total consumer ARPU is now over $100, up 8.5% from a year ago. FiOS ARPU now stands at more than $149 per month and 70% of our FiOS consumer customers are triple play, with voice, Internet and video services.","In terms of broadband, we added 134,000 new FiOS Internet additions and now have more than 5.1 million subscribers, representing a penetration of 36.6%. We had a net loss of 132,000 DSL subscribers, which is higher than the last few quarters primarily due to seasonality. We believe that the discontinuance of dry loop DSL, also negatively impacted net add, but was clearly the right decision from a profitability standpoint.","In FiOS Video, we added 120,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.5 million and increasing our penetration to 32.6%. We continue to seek ways to drive FiOS revenue growth, improve operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability. Key parts of the strategy include targeted pricing actions, further differentiating our services with the offers like FiOS Quantum.","Our copper to fiber migration in areas with chronic repair issues within FiOS markets, and a number of other cost management initiatives. In light of these actions, we feel a more natural range for FiOS quarterly net adds going forward should be about 20,000 to 30,000 less than our previous range of 180,000 to 200,000. We are confident that at these levels, we can still maintain an increasing revenue growth trajectory and expand profitability.","Let\u2019s move next to our business markets starting with global enterprise. Global Enterprise revenue was down $32 million sequentially or less than 1%, but declined $136 million or 3.4% year-over-year. In addition to a $70 million impact from lower CPE sales in the quarter, foreign currency translation had an $84 million adverse impact on growth as the stronger dollar versus the euro, and pound sterling caused the decline in the current quarter compared with the benefit a year ago. Absent these effects, we would have had positive revenue growth in spite of the continued secular and global economic challenges.","Strategic services, which comprises 52% of global enterprise revenue totaled $2 billion, up 4.4%. While we continue to perform well in these services, international and FX are having an adverse effect on growth at this time.","Looking ahead, we do expect our enterprise business to contribute more to the overall wireline revenue growth and profitability, particularly as we work through our product streamlining and process efficiency initiatives.","Our strategic realignment of Verizon Enterprise Solutions will better position us to unlock value in the core business, while better aligning our strength in high growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine, and advanced communications. We remain confident in the strength of the enterprise asset portfolio and the value it will generate over the long term.","On the acquisition front, our purchase of Hughes Telematics has passed the Hart-Scott-Rodino stage, and we expect to complete the transaction in third quarter. We look forward to combining Hughes Telematics\u2019 robust service delivery platform and suite of applications with our global IP network, cloud, mobility, and security solutions. We believe that this platform has the potential to reach beyond automotive and transportation and create new M2M opportunities in mobile health, asset tracking, and home automation to name a few.","Moving next to global wholesale, revenues in the second quarter declined $34 million or 2% sequentially and $203 million or 10% year-over-year due primarily to declines in transport services. We continue to take all the necessary actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and to better position the business in the fiber-based Ethernet data services space, as customers with special access transition from DS1s and DS3s.","Let\u2019s move now to our summary slide. Overall, a strong second quarter and first half putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. We continue to execute very well. Our solid top line performance in the first half of the year has been fueled by strong retail service revenues in wireless and increasing growth in consumer wireline.","Our record-high wireless margins in the second quarter combined with our strong focus on improving profitability through product rationalization and cost management in the wireline has driven double-digit growth and consolidated operating income, and earnings per share for the last two quarters.","This strong operating performance together with our disciplined capital spending drove significant increases in free cash flow and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business. We expect to continue to build on this momentum and look forward to a strong second half of the year.","With that, I will now turn the call back to John, so we can get to your questions.","John N. Doherty","","Thanks, Brian. Before we jump into questions, I know that we are having some link issues with the IR website this morning. we are working on it, and all the typical documents will be available shortly if they are not already.","With that Brad, let's take our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) our first question will come from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning, Fran. A couple of questions, first on the FiOS metrics you just talked about, sort of a new range for additions that I guess implies more or like 160,000 to 180,000 adds per quarter going forward. You flipped a little bit lower than that this quarter, I am just \u2013 can you help us think through that. You obviously talked about some price hikes, are we also at a point where the base is large enough that 2Q seasonality in video i.e., were negative, and then rebounced in 3Q, is this starting to catch up with the business as well.","And then second question, just on the wireless distribution. it was roughly this time last year you announced intentions for a $10 million upstream payment to the JV partners. Can you help us think through maybe a timeline for announcing the distribution for next year and then given the stronger free cash flow you\u2019ve seen in the business, would that point sort of conceptually to a bigger distribution? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo","Yeah. sure, Jason, thanks for the question. So first on the FiOS piece. just a couple of things here, so yes, there was \u2013 we actually did have slower growth in this quarter than we anticipated. so a couple of factors here, one was there was a seasonable unusually high move season in the month of June compared to prior second quarter. so we experienced some additional moves out and normally in this business, it takes us a quarter to recapture the move in. So I think that partially would set off from a timing difference. But more importantly, I think that we have refocused more on our profit, on the FiOS side.","So first we went through these price ups, you saw some of the benefits there in the first quarter, where we drove our consumer revenue growth, the 2.5%. And this was the price ups of our set-top boxes and you\u2019re going to see more price ups coming in the third quarter around the bundles and into the fourth quarter.","In addition, we launched our Quantum product and the price ups that we have on people choosing additional speeds. I am extremely confident with both of these actions. We can double our revenue growth by the end of this year from 2.5% to around 5%, and I am very confident that we can accomplish that.","So, one is that that we\u2019re really concentrating on revenue growth. Second is, as you know we\u2019ve really concentrated around copper to FiOS migration. We nearly doubled the amount of migrations we did in the second quarter versus the first quarter and also what we\u2019re seeing is, the first quarter migrations that we accomplished, these customers are generating more ARPU, close migrations and free, because they are also selecting higher speeds under our Quantum offers.","So I think the range as we said is probably in the neighborhood of 150,000 to 170,000. I know you said, 160,000 to 180,000 but it\u2019s around 150 to 170. But we are on a steady growth pattern, and I believe that we are really focusing in on better margins and acceleration of the top line.","On the Verizon wireless dividend, I know there has been a lot of press lately out there and I am not sure where this idea is coming from, but I can tell you, right now the only thing I will say is that, there is not distribution on the agenda for the upcoming Verizon wireless board and that\u2019s probably I am going to say at this point in time.","Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Okay, thanks Fran.","John N. Doherty","","Brad, can we move on to the next question please.","Operator","","Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may ask your question.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","Thanks, guys. Two quick ones for you on the Wireline side; first, Fran, thanks for all the info on the product rationalization on the wholesale side. But you could give us some idea of when you think you should start to see some improvement, I think the 10% was a little bit worse than we thought, when do you think that could start to get better? And then, second of all, if you could update us on the union contract and where you are in negotiations that would be great.","Francis J. Shammo","Okay, great. Thanks, John. So on the wholesale side, yeah, 10% decline, this was accelerated from 8.9% in the first quarter. And to be honest, I think that we're fighting an uphill battle here on the core voice in LTE product, and that will continue to decline. The focus right now is to reposition ourselves for Ethernet and fiber-to-cell, and those products are picking up. And I think that quite honestly the range that you see here is probably the range that we will continue with somewhere between an 8% to 10% decline going forward. But again, this is a diminishing revenue stream and we will continue to manage that stream.","On the union side of that half, as I've mentioned before, when we entered into these negotiations, we knew that this was going to be extremely difficult and very hard negotiations, and it was going to be a long-haul not a short-haul. And given our peers, it took them 500 days to get the contributions and some pension resets, and we're now almost the year-end of this, sort of 365 days.","So, when you look at the profitability of this business over the last five years, it has decreased and this cost structure is not sustainable going forward. We really needed the business to address this cost structure in relation to the benefits, particularly healthcare contributions and pensions, and we need increased flexibility around our work rules, which we \u2013 some of these work rules date back to 1960. So we aren't asking for things that have not already been given to other companies, these are not new issues for the union, a many of our peer companies are already there. So we are standing strong on our position of cost restructure in this business, so the negotiations are continuing albeit slow and the process will take as long as it takes for us. So at this point, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll report on the union negotiation.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","Great. Thanks, Fran.","John N. Doherty","Thanks, John. Brad, can we move to the next one please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much. Good morning. Following up on the pension situation, have you had a chance to run the numbers on the new highway bill and the new discount rates and any impact that you may have on your near-term pension contributions? And related to that, you\u2019ve talked about strong cash flow generation this quarter, your leverages in the low ones, how are you thinking about target leverage here, about dividend increases for Verizon Corporation and potential buybacks down the road? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo","","Thanks, Simon. So on the pension plan, we have looked to build preliminarily, but there \u2013 this is a very complex thing. I will tell you that at the beginning of this year, we said we would have to contribute $1.3 billion into the plan. We have $400 million left to contribute for the remaining piece of this year. But I think there\u2019s other things that have to go into consideration here other than just the timings benefit of this bill.","First, you have to look at the borrowing rates. Second, you have to look at tax rates structures, then what the current rate is versus what future rates may be. And then you have to look at the overall pension strategy that we have related to our pension plan. So at this point, I\u2019m not prepared to speak to whether we will adopt the funding plan or not adopt it, what I will tell you is, this is not material to the cash flow either this year or into the next three years, and again, it is just the timing issue. So I will have more to report on that as we complete our analysis and come into the 2013.","As far as cash flow goes, we had an unbelievable quarter in cash flow from operation generation, our continued focus in on investment and making the right investments to return additional investments on that and get greater returns both in the wireline and the wireless business. As I said, we really have curtailed the spending on our EV-DO networks, which is generating more cash flow in the wireless business. But again, without really going into a lot of detail here, the dividend policy is extremely important, it is a board decision, but it is very, very important to Low and I, and we will continue to recommend to the board what we think is appropriate. And from a share buyback, as I said before, I don\u2019t think we are in a position to start buying back shares, it is always a timing issue for companies to \u2013 when the best time to do that is and at this point, we probably won\u2019t be in a position to do anything like that until late \u201913 or early \u201914.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","John N. Doherty","Thanks, Simon. Brad, let\u2019s move on.","Operator","Our next question will come from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hi, guys. Thanks Brad. You mentioned that some customers have been moving over to the new price plans, I wonder if you can give us some idea of whether we should be looking for some ARPU headwind in the third quarter versus the rapid rate that you\u2019ve been growing before it starts to sort of be accretive maybe in next year? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo","Yeah, thanks Phil. I mean, it is very preliminary, we just launched this on June 28, so we just started in on this. I think some of the positive factors that we are seeing, is that obviously all of your adopters are always your optimizers, but to be honest based on where we are at right now, we are actually tracking ahead of where we thought we would be and we don\u2019t see any ARPU impact in the third quarter or fourth quarter. I think our trend will continue that we have established here in the first and second quarter. And the benefit though that we do see is that we are seeing some 3G unlimited customers move into our 4G share data plan product and that is excellent for us from a cash flow position on capital efficiency and cost reduction metrics. So there are some interesting things there, and then that again the other thing on ARPU here is, as Internet device ARPU continues to improve that gives us better opportunity to accelerate our overall ARPU growth.","Philip Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","That\u2019s all. Thanks Fran.","John N. Doherty","","Thanks, Bill. Can we take the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin of Credit Suisse your line is open.","Jonathan Chaplin \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","","Thanks. Fran, I\u2019m wondering if you can give us some context of where you think, sort of longer-term over the next three or four years, CapEx to revenue trends in wireless?","Francis J. Shammo","","Well, I think that without giving a lot of guidance here, beyond this year which we set our overall capital plan will be flat to down from where we were last year. Obviously, you can see that wireless is utilizing capital extremely efficiently, down, I think now or most for the year about $1.3 billion year-over-year. Our overall CapEx to revenue ratio in the first half of 2011 was 16.4%, and that\u2019s down to 13.1%, and as I said before, we are committed to continue to improve on that metric this year and continuing to \u201913 and \u201914. And I think we will leave it at that.","","Jonathan Chaplin \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Thanks.","John N. Doherty","Thanks, Jonathan. Brad, let's take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Michael I. Rollins \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets","","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just a quick side note, if you can just give us an update on the wireless net debt at the end of the quarter. And then secondly, if you can go in a little bit more depth on what's happening in the enterprise business, maybe you could help us size Europe or international for you, versus U.S. and give us a sense of what strategic services, would be growing at, if you can have the European issues, this CPE influence side, et cetera. Thanks.","","Francis J. Shammo","","Sure, Michael thanks. So for the end of this quarter gross debt on wireless box is a $10.9 billion. On July 1, we actually paid down another piece of that debt of $800 million. The cash rate now is $8.4 billion so net debt at the end of this quarter was $2.4 billion.","On the Enterprise business just a kind of set some of this \u2013 as I said last quarter, our international revenue is about $400 million a quarter. We were growing close to 15% to 17% on a year-over-year basis, both within EMEA and in Asia. Last quarter, we said that we saw the first time that it actually went flat on year-over-year basis, and this quarter we actually saw a decline on a year-over-year basis. Strategic services is about 75% of our sales in international, which is very different than it is here in the United States.","So with the FX impact and the impact that Europe is having on that strategic revenue stream that is having an overall impact on the overall strategic revenue growth. I think the important thing here is the way we move forward, is that we are really building our business around platforms. And if you look at what we\u2019ve done, we are rated number one in the world on security. We have build our data center platform around our Terremark acquisition and now we are going to build our machine-to-machine and applications platform around the Hughes Telematics. And I think that brings a different paradigm to us going forward.","So I\u2019m very optimistic on the Enterprise business. We are showing still some growth in strategic services and I think if we didn\u2019t have the headwinds and some of these other economic pressures, I believe we are a double-digit strategic growth company there should be no reason why we can\u2019t get back to those numbers that we showed in the past two years.","So I think this is a temporary thing, but given where we are with Europe this could be another two to three quarters out, mid \u201913 before we start to turn the corner here. But we are positioning ourselves and I think we are making all the right decisions that when we do turn the corner and get some economic release that we will show a very good portfolio here.","Michael Raynes \u2013 Citigroup","","Thank you.","John N. Doherty","Thanks Mike. Brad, let\u2019s move on to next question, please.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Barden of Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","David W. Barden \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Fran, just a quick housekeeping item. I think this quarter you said that Wireline margins in the second half would be higher than the first half. Is that the same thing as what you said last quarter that Wireline margins would be up year-over-year, just to clarify?","And then, the upgrade rate fell from 8% in 1Q to 7% in 2Q and obviously that\u2019s a big swing factor for margins, almost 200 basis points. Have you think for the rest of the year and maybe as a run rate as a function of the actions that you\u2019ve taken for upgrades, how do you think about that 7% upgrade rate as a baseline as a driver of margins through the rest of the year, and maybe just generally going forward? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo","Sure. Thanks, David. So on the Wireline margins, look, we are very, very solid on improving our Wireline margin here in the second half, first the first half. I think that given some of the cost structure issues that we have, especially around the contract, we think that we can still improve our margins. If we can get to a better [inhere] with the contract, then I think that we can actually improve our margins on a year-over-year basis, but that will come down to a timing issue.","I do think, though, that when we\u2019re focusing on the consumer side of the house, as I said, I\u2019m very confident that we can double our revenue growth here. We are very focused in on the profitability of FiOS. The profitability increase in Wireline this quarter was really centered around the FiOS, really progress that we made on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I think we have a lot of good things here, and we\u2019ll just have to play this out, but we\u2019re very, very confident that we\u2019ll improve our wireline margins here.","On the upgrade side of the house, obviously this is timing a lot of things go into play here. We\u2019ve made a lot of moves in the last year and a half around restructuring our upgrade policies. As you know, we\u2019ve launched our $30 upgrade fee. Obviously, this all has an impact on the level of upgrades and then of course, there is always that Rumour Mill out there with a new phone coming out in the fourth quarter. And so people maybe waiting, but look, we manage this on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","I think, the way I look at this though going into the back half of this year on the upgrades is that, we\u2019ll manage this business on a profit and on a growth trajectory. And if you think about what wireless has done when we get to the fourth quarter. We will have taken $5 billion out of our cost structure in the last three years, which is why we can generate margins of 49%, which beat our all-time high from last year. So I think that wireless has a very good track record in history to deliver both on profitability and growth.","John N. Doherty","Thanks, David. Brad, we will move on.","David W. Barden \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Fran.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Michael McCormack \u2013 Nomura Securities","Hey, guys, thanks. If I maybe just a little bit deeper dive on that thought process, and we obviously with some new policies in place and relatively lower upgrades. We might not see the same pattern, we saw last year and last year, we all remember that people were waiting for the iPhone in Q4, so Q3 margins were super high. Should we not expect that same dynamic given the changes in policies? And then secondly, on the FiOS side, when you talk about profitability, is this on a per subscriber basis or just slowing down overall growth adds, and should \u2013 we will not be making a margin sacrifice to take share here? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo","Thanks, Mike. So just a couple of things on the margin side of the half. So I mean, I think, again, I\u2019ll just repeat what I said is, we\u2019ll manage this business both on a growth and profitability perspective for wireless, and I think we\u2019ve proven that. look I mean, obviously the fourth quarter is always a seasonable volume quarter for the industry, and I expect that to happen again with the holiday season that\u2019s coming up.","So it will really factoring on the volumes that what new devices, and I\u2019m sure, we\u2019re going to have plenty of new devices that come up between now and the holiday season. and if you look at phone to device side of the house, we just launched the Samsung Galaxy 3 on our 4G LTE network. And it proved the point that when we launch a very technical phone that\u2019s great when appearance and viability that people accept that phone, and that phone is selling extremely well. So all these factors come into play, but I think that we are very, very confident that what we laid out in January of 2011 regardless of what phones come, what phones don\u2019t come, and what kind of a season it will be, we will hit our financial objectives.","On the FiOS side of the house, as I said, we did have some seasonality pressure here, but look, we have to balance the perspective; most of you\u2019d look at our wireless portfolio. we have to balance the consumer wireline portfolio in the same fashion. we have to balance growth with revenue acceleration and improving profitability. and that\u2019s what we\u2019re set out to do, and we\u2019ll make the decisions in the right ones to in order to achieve all three of those metrics.","Michael McCormack \u2013 Nomura Securities","Great, thanks Fran.","John N. Doherty","Thanks, Mike. Brad, can we take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Thanks for taking the question. Just for our own understanding that you mentioned that the distribution would not be on the agenda to next Verizon Wireless board meeting, according to me I have no idea how often the board meets, is it quarterly or semi annual. and then just to the business, you\u2019ve talked about the prep work you\u2019re doing on the 700 megahertz license sale, assuming you\u2019ll get a favorable resolution with the regulators on the contingent transactions. How quickly do you think you can move ahead with it? Do you have a sense of urgency or is it just one of the things that can take while?","Francis J. Shammo","Sure. Thanks, Brett. On the vote of our dividends the board meets on a quarterly basis and in each \u2013 the partnership agreements specifically states that on an annual basis the dividend will be reviewed at the end of the year. So that\u2019s really all there is to say on that.","On the 700 A and B megahertz sale, as you know, we\u2019ve already hired a third-party, we are ready to go as soon as we get approval on the SpectrumCo deal. So, this is going to be an immediate thing, not something that\u2019s going to take a while. So we are really setup to go and it will be as fast as we can get the auction done, and make sure that we get a price that we believe is fair, and then we will sell the spectrum. So that\u2019s the timeline.","Brett Feldman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Great, thanks for that.","John N. Doherty","Thanks, Brett. And just an update \u2013 I continue to get updates on the IR related \u2013 website related issue. We continue to work it. We should have all documents available very shortly for those that couldn\u2019t get them. Brad, right now, it looks like we have time for two more questions. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Seitz with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Thomas Seitz \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Fran, you mentioned you\u2019re accelerating a bit the copper shutdown., in the past, you\u2019ve mentioned that a gating factor was regulatory approval to shutting down the copper plant for those that wanted circuit switched lines. I\u2019m wondering if there has been any sort of change in the local regulatory environment that allows you to accelerate that? And then secondly, I think in the past you\u2019ve mentioned the shutdowns would be in the hundreds of thousands, is that materially going up? And is that a thing where you\u2019d sacrifice a bit of margin and maybe spend a bit more CapEx to accelerate this process.","Francis J. Shammo","","Okay. So on the copper shutdown piece, over the past few years we have gotten a lot of regulatory release in a lot of states on copper being the provider of last resort and those types of things. So as we go here and through our product rationalization, we are moving as quickly as we possibly can in shutting down that copper plant and obviously we did that in Dallas a year ago and we currently have one we\u2019re running in Florida that we\u2019re shutting the switch.","So we continue down that path and we\u2019re doing that as quickly as possible, and as I said, from a FiOS to copper migration, or a copper to FiOS migration, we nearly double the amount of migrations that we did, and so we\u2019re being as aggressive as we possibly can in these areas. So from that perspective I think we\u2019re right on track.","Thomas Seitz \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Francis J. Shammo","","Thanks, Tom. Brad, let\u2019s take our last question please.","Operator","Our last question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie Capital","","Thank you. Your investment in Italy was, I think, you said a $0.02 drag on EPS this quarter. How should we think about the impact over the next few quarters, and can you talk about what the strategic importance of your Italian asset and that is this going to a be drag, why not try to dispose it?","Francis J. Shammo","I think that given the pressures that we\u2019re seeing in Europe it\u2019s not unforeseen that there would be a pressure there in the Omnitel market of Italy. And what we\u2019re seeing is that that created a $0.02 pressure on a year-over-year basis. Strategically, I\u2019m not going to discuss whether we\u2019re going to stay a partner or not a partner, but right now it is a strategic asset for us to be a partner.","Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie Capital","","And you think that $0.02 drag will continue over the next few quarters, will it get worse, how should we model it?","Francis J. Shammo","","I think it will be pretty consistent.","Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay.","John N. Doherty","","Okay. thanks, Kevin. Brad, that concludes our call. Thanks everybody, we appreciate you dialing in this morning and once again, we\u2019re doing everything we can to work on the IR related \u2013 website related issue we had this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brady Connor","Thanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I\u2019m here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Lowell McAdam, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started, I like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are now available on our website.","This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides enduring our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell.","Lowell McAdam","Thank you Brady, and good morning everyone. I wanted to join today's call to talk about 2017 results, the implications of tax reform to Verizon and then to talk about our strategic priorities for 2018.","Let me start off by recapping our impressive performance this year. I am proud of the focus and the execution from our team in 2017. We regained positive momentum in the marketplace and delivered strong operational and financial results. We launched","and expanded the most reliable unlimited experience for our customers, executed the world\u2019s largest successful 5G pre-commercial trial, invested in assets and platforms for the future and gained significant traction in the integration of new businesses.","We finished the year with great momentum in the fourth quarter as evidenced by our smartphone net additions and reoccurring levels of outstanding customer loyalty. In addition, the improvement in our wireless service revenue trajectory positions the business for growth moving forward.","The integration of new businesses is accelerating our mobile-first digital strategy and providing a platform for global reach. In 2017 we made significant progress with our Oath assets as we build engaging brands around the key pillars of news, sports, finance and lifestyle and we leverage the Oath capabilities across all of our Verizon properties.","The game changing content and technology partnerships that we recently announced with the NFL and NBA are great examples of how we are accelerating our digital right strategy with Yahoo sports and Verizon\u2019s family of digital media brands. We are becoming the first screen for fans of live sports and superior partners for advertisers positioning us to show live-action in the engaging ways people want to consume video content.","We are investing for the future while maintaining a well-rounded approach to funding all aspects of our business. We enhanced our financial profile in 2017 with a number of transactions that strengthened the balance sheet that included lowering our borrowing cost, extending out our debt maturities and making a significant voluntary contribution to the pension fund.","Now let's take a look forward. We ended the year with the president signing tax reform into law effectively restructuring the tax code for U.S. corporations. Verizon has long supported corporate tax reform that reduces rates to globally competitive levels and we are very pleased to see this legislation passed. The new tax law will have a positive impact to Verizon\u2019s cash flow and earnings profile.","We expect tax reform to enhance our cash flow from operations in 2018 by approximately $3.5 billion to $4 billion. We have been disciplined in our approach to capital allocation since the inception of Verizon. We have always been focused on keeping our network the gold standard and investing in the business for growth while strengthening our balance sheet and maintaining strong dividend performance for our shareholders. This will continue to be the driving force behind the use of cash savings from tax reform.","And by strengthening the balance sheet it will give us the flexibility to execute our strategies going forward. Our employees drive the innovation and success of our business, so it is vital that we all share in the success of not only tax reform but the overall performance of Verizon. We will provide details on how we are investing in our employees later today, and will provide those details outside the company later today.","We are good corporate citizens and share our success with the community. In 2017, Verizon and its foundation donated $75 million for disaster recovery and community projects. We will increase our contributions to the Verizon foundation by $200 million to $300 million over the next two years with the additional funds being dedicated to our efforts around human ability. And by human ability we mean applying our technology to making our customers lives better.","Combined these two initiatives will have an approximate $0.05 to $0.06 impact to our earnings per share for each of the next two years. As we head into 2018 our strategic priorities remain clear and are unchanged. The cornerstone of our strategy continues to be our best in class wireless network, which continues to be ranked number one in the nation in both voice and data network quality. Our unbroken run of JD Power and RootMetrics awards keeps getting longer.","In our history, Verizon has always been in the forefront of technology innovation. We have led the transformation of the wireless industry from analog to today's fourth generation LTE service. Now we have an unprecedented opportunity in front of us as we drive the evolution of the U.S. wireless industry to the fifth generation of mobile services.","Not too long ago people were saying 5G would not be possible until sometime between 2020 and 2022. Only one carrier has been consistent in its actions and messaging regarding 5G. Verizon has the spectrum bandwidth needed to provide the rich services of true 5G, our intelligent edge network capabilities and engineering know-how to lead the industry in providing the full suite of 5G gigabit services.","The investment and pre-positioning of assets that we have accomplished will enable us to deliver the full range of 5G services including mobility, residential broadband, sub-millisecond latency applications, and other advanced consumer and IoT use cases. We have flexed our innovation muscle and are now taking 5G from a mere possibility to commercial reality by bringing 3 to 5 cities online this year with commercial services. The next industrial revolution will be on Verizon\u2019s network and will positively impact society like no technology we have seen before. As we say around our offices, we don't wait for the future. We build it, and we are doing it again with 5G.","Now I will hand the call over to Matt to talk about the financial and operating details of the business starting with Slide 4.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Lowell. It is great to be with you today and to share the results of our strong performance. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we reported earnings of $4.56 per share and full year earnings of $7.36 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss from special items of about $2.6 billion. This net loss consists of severance and mark-to-market adjustments for pension and OPEB liabilities of $1.2 billion, early debt redemption costs of $681 million, a charge for product realignment around early stage developmental technologies of $671 million, acquisition and integration related charges of $154 million pertaining mainly to Yahoo, and a non-cash pre-tax gain on spectrum license transactions of about $144 million.","Additionally, as noted in our 8-K filing last week, the new tax law resulted in a one-time benefit of approximately $16.8 billion, or $4.10 per share. This benefit is primarily related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at the new 21% corporate income tax rate. The cumulative net impact from these items after-tax was approximately $15.2 billion or $3.71 per share. Excluding the full effect of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 in the fourth quarter, which is flat compared to our performance in the same quarter a year ago.","For the full year adjusted earnings per share was $3.74. Now let us move to a summary of the consolidated financial highlights of the quarter on Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, total operating revenue was $34 billion, an improvement of 5% and for the full year 2017 revenue was $126 billion. On a comparable basis, excluding divestures and new businesses, adjusted operating revenues declined approximately 2% for the year.","For the full year, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items totaled approximately $45.1 billion and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.7%, slightly higher than last year's margin of 35.5%.","Let us turn now to our wireless results on Slide 6. Our value proposition of providing unlimited service on the best network together with the simplicity of our offers is driving increased engagement from our valued customers. In the fourth quarter, total wireless operating revenue increased 1.7% to $23.8 billion, our first positive year-over-year growth in two years.","For the full year, operating revenue totaled $87.5 billion, a decline of 1.9%. The sequential results in service revenue increased for the second consecutive quarter by 0.2% to $15.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, service revenues declined by 2.9%, a marked improvement over the same period last year.","The improved trends to service revenues are attributed to several factors, including increased access revenues and new account formation. Our postpaid phone base migrations to un-subsidized service pricing are progressing and now represent approximately 80% of our postpaid phone base, approaching steady-state as most of our business customers remain on subsidized plans.","In the fourth quarter, equipment revenue increased to $6.5 billion up 12.9% for the quarter and 7.8% for the full year. At the end of the quarter approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance. During the quarter we generated $9.5 billion of EBITDA, an increase of 9.6%. Wireless EBITDA margin was 39.8% compared to approximately 36.9% in the same period last year. As expected, the improvement in EBITDA was a function of better trends in service revenue and lower promotional activity than the prior year. For the full year, we generated $38.6 billion of EBITDA on total revenues of $87.5 billion.","Now let us turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. In the fourth quarter, total smartphone net adds were 647,000 compared to 456,000 last year. Total postpaid net adds were 1.2 million, including phone adds of 431,000, 193,000 tablets and 550,000 other connected devices, predominantly wearables. For the third consecutive quarter we increased customer accounts adding 40,000 to our base.","For the full year, postpaid net additions of 2.1 million included 774,000 phones, 31,000 tablets, and 1.3 million other connected devices. Our competitiveness in 2017 was highlighted by smartphone net adds of 1.8 million, up 34% versus the prior year. The overall experience of pairing our unlimited plan with the best network continues to resonate with our customer base, resulting in outstanding retail postpaid churn of 1.00%, and phone churn of 0.77% in the fourth quarter.","On a year-over-year basis, postpaid churn improved by 10 basis points driven primarily by strong phone results. In the quarter, postpaid device activations totaled 12.4 million down from 13.1 million last year. About 82% of these activations were phones with wearables accounting for the majority of the other device activations.","Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 7.2%, up sequentially as expected but was lower compared to the prior year. We are seeing an elongation of the upgrade cycle as more customers hold onto their devices for a longer period. During the quarter, 8.1 million phones were activated on device payment plans.","Pre-paid net additions declined by 184,000 compared to a decline of 9,000 in the prior year. Our smartphone prepaid base increased during the quarter. All of the decline in prepaid net additions was due to basic prepaid phones as we have deliberately reduced our focus in that area. We ended 2017 with 116 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 1.9% to 111 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million for the year.","Let us move next to our wireline segment on Slide 8. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment increased 0.1% in the quarter and 0.6% for the full year. On an organic basis, excluding revenues from our XO acquisition, segment revenues declined in the quarter by 3.6%. Growth from our high quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition. Consumer markets\u2019 revenue decreased 1.4% in the quarter as Fios internet growth was overshadowed by declines in video and copper.","For the full year, consumer revenues grew by 0.2%. Consumer Fios revenue grew by 1.7% in the quarter. Fios revenue growth is primarily driven by an increase in the total customer base and strong demand for higher internet speeds, including our gigabit connection launched early in 2017. In the quarter, we added 47,000 Fios internet customers.","We now have a total of about 5.9 million Fios internet subscribers representing a 40.1% penetration rate. In Fios video, the business faced ongoing headwinds as observed throughout the linear TV market. The Fios video business ended with 29,000 subscriber losses in the quarter and 75,000 for the year.","Our multiuse fiber initiative is progressing as expected. This provides the foundational layer for multiple ways to interface with a wide array of customers and is the cornerstone of our intelligent edge network. We launched our partnership with Boston in 2016 and are seeing good results in that area. We announced our public private partnership with Sacramento in June of 2017, and you will see more activity from us on this front as progressive municipalities work with Verizon to bring new technologies to their communities.","For the quarter, excluding XO, Enterprise Solutions revenue decreased 4.1%. New customer wins and growth in advanced communications products were more than offset by secular and pricing pressures in our legacy offerings and technologies. Partner Solutions revenue, excluding XO, decreased 5.8%. Strong demand for fiber access is a growth opportunity for this business. In business markets revenue declined 5.6% without XO.","We are competing and winning with our fiber-based products but continue to see declines in legacy technologies. Segment EBITDA margin was 20.9% for the quarter and 21.1% for the year. Our commitments, operational gains and efficiencies in the business were largely offset by content cost escalations producing a stable margin profile. Let\u2019s move next to Slide 9 to discuss our media and Telematics businesses.","Our integration efforts for the Oath assets are progressing ahead of schedule. We remain focused on exploiting synergies across all of that media assets to create a streamline platform with rich engaging content and simple functionality. For the quarter Oath revenue is $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately 10% sequentially. As expected revenue trends were driven by increase appetizing spend during the holiday season and we expect to see the normal seasonality from fourth quarter to first quarter. Our Telematics business which includes Fleetmatics and Telogis continues to grow. Total Telematics revenue increased to just over $230 million. IoT revenues increased approximately 8% in the quarter on an organic basis. Our solution set is evolving as our engagement with municipalities gains more momentum with increasing multi-use fiber deployments and the commercial rollout of 5G services.","Let's move next to Slide 10 to discuss our cash flows. In 2017 cash flow from operations totaled $25.3 billion including the $2.1 billion net after tax discretionary pension funding and the $6.0 billion impact from completing the transition to on balance sheet device payment receivable financing. On a year-over-year basis our cash flow has improved by $2.5 billion. As expected full year capital expenditures were $17.2 billion. Free cash flow for the year totaled $8.1 billion and does not include $4.3 billion of proceeds from asset backed securitizations.","The transition to on balance sheet accounting for device payment plan receivables and funding is now substantially complete. Changes going forward will mostly reflect seasonality and wireless equipment volumes. We ended the year with $117.1 billion of total debt comprised of $108.2 billion of unsecured debt and $8.9 billion of on balance sheet securitizations. Our new term unsecured maturities are modest to $2.3 billion through the end of 2019. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us the financial flexibility to methodically investor growth in the business. ","Now let's take a look at 2018 on Slide 11. As Lowell mentioned upfront out strategic priorities of 2018 are clear. Our focus is on executing on the fundamentals which positions the business\u2019 strong performance in the upcoming year. We expect year-over-year consolidated revenue to grow at low single-digits in 2018 on a GAAP reported basis. Excluding the impact from the near revenue recognition standard we are on track to achieve year-over-year wireless service growth by the middle part of 2018.","As we disclosed in our January 17, 2018 8-K filing the new revenue standard will negatively impact wireless service revenue. Inclusive of the new standard we expect wireless service revenue growth to turn positive towards the end of 2018 or early 2019.","The benefits of our business excellence initiative included the deployment of zero based budgeting will begin to show up in our results in 2018. We expect low single digit growth in adjusted earnings per share which includes the diluted impacts from the full year of depreciation and amortization cost from 2017 acquisitions. The straight path acquisition expected to close later in the first quarter. And the ongoing impact of the last year's data centered divestitures. This is before the impact of tax reform on the revenue recognition standard.","In terms of tax legislation we expect the savings to generate a net $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion uplift to cash flows from operations in 2018 and is expected to yield a $0.55 to $0.65 increase to EPS in 2018. [Net of our] employee initiative and contributions to the Verizon foundation that Lowell mentioned earlier. The resulting 2018 effective tax rate for Verizon is projected to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Lowell stated earlier there are internal capital decision process and return objectives have not changed. We are consistent and methodical in our allocation. We expected consolidated capital spending to be between $17.0 billion and $17.8 billion including the commercial launch of 5G. With that I will turn the call back over to Brady, so we can get your questions.","Brady Connor","Thank you Matt. Brad we are now ready to take questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from Philip Cusick of JP Morgan. You may go ahead.","Philip Cusick","Hi, thanks. One for Matt and one for Lowell if I can. First Matt, I wonder if you can talk about the company's target leverage and is there any change in your thoughts or the discussions with the rating agencies on what appropriate EBITDA multiple when your conversion from EBITDA to cash flow is now substantially better because of lower taxes and then Lowell can you please discuss Verizon\u2019s view of the attractiveness of media assets in general? A year ago you offered a definitive no on any interest in buying big media and yet Verizon has been thrown out as a potential buyer and nearly every media M&A story of 2017 which has probably been confusing for your investors. Can you just give us an update? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Good morning Phil. I will take the first question. So the target leverage we haven't specified an exact number there but as we have said consistently we want to strengthen the balance sheet. The additional proceeds from the benefit of tax reform allow us to get there little faster. The key here is to have a strong balance sheet that allows us to pursue and execute on our strategy as quickly and as efficiently as we can. So as we say we haven't given an exact leverage target but you should expect us to deleverage from where we are today. We said previously getting into the same type of profile that we had prior to the Vodafone transaction, so I think that gives you a general review at the direction we would like to head. In terms of the rating agencies not had any specific conversations with them since tax reform happened about how that may change their views but certainly it gives us the ability to bring the leverage down at a little faster rates and we look forward to doing that through [\u201818] and we will continue to have conversations with them and put the balance sheet in a place where it continues to support the business.","Lowell McAdam","And Phil, good morning. I guess my first comment is I guess it's nice to be loved. So there certainly is a lot of interest here which frankly we ignored. But I think in seriousness there is a lot of movement in this area right now and we don't even know whether AT&T is going to get approved. It's clear that the messages that Disney and Fox are sending is that scale matters. So we look at this but you have to take a look at whether being a big independent distributor is a reasonable alternative to owning content. And I think until all of this shakes out you really can't determine whether that's a path we would be interested in but I can say unequivocally there is nothing going on right now without considering a large media play. In fact if you look at our actions things like the NBA and the NFL announcement that we have made in the last few weeks we think being a great partner being able to monetize through advertising and being independent is a very good place to play for us right now. And that's still further notice that's what our investors should assume we are doing.","Philip Cusick","That's helpful. Thanks Lowell, thanks, Matt.","Lowell McAdam","Brad, let's take the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead with your question.","Simon Flannery","Great, thank you very much and good morning. And one for Matt and Lowell as well. Matt, can you just help us with the math from Q4 to Q1 around the revenue recognition. You're moving some revenues from service revenues to equipment and then you should get at least a temporary EBITDA and EPS left. If you can just give us a little bit more color around what we should be modeling there.","And then Lowell, you obviously went through the 5G role in a lot of detail in November or a couple of months past. Can you give us a little bit more clarity about what we should be expecting for the rest of the year, when should we see Sacramento launching, what about announcing from the other cities? How many pops should we be expecting covered in 2018 and then into '19? Thank you.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Simon. So, I'll take the first part of that on the adoption of revenue recognition. So, a couple of things that firstly we created an opening balance sheet adjustment to reflect some of the treatment of open contracts, assuming they had been recorded under the new standard.","Remember, unlike most adoption of accounting standards, the prior periods are not being recast and so you'll have it all difference between the accounting standards for the 2018 numbers versus the 2017 comparison. You'll see that so as we go through the year. And we report '18 on the new standard. We'll also give a view as what '18 would have looked like if it's been under the old standard as well.","So, in terms of breaking those pieces apart as we said in AK last week, total revenue won't have any significant impact from the change but there will be a change in geography. We'll record more equipment revenue unless service revenue initially based off that change and how we treat contracts that are still subsidized which is primarily our B2B contracts.","And in the biggest impact of the EBITDA line's going to come from how we treat commissions and rather than taking those commission expenses and expensing them immediately when they're incurred, they'll get spread over the life of or the estimated life of the underlying customer contract.","Now, the opening balance sheet adjustment is only for the open contracts that had a 24-month commitment or promo cost. So, it doesn't relate to all of the contracts. So, that's why you'll see a build-up in that over the next two years. So, we said the net benefit in '18 to be about $0.9 billion to $1.2 billion because of the change in accounting standards; most of that coming from the commission's line.","We didn\u2019t break it up by quarter but I think you should expect it not to be too dissimilar from quarter-to-quarter as we go through the year. And then the impact in '18 would be bigger than it will be in '19 and then it'll be largely immaterial by the time we get to '20 because that contract asset builds up on the balance sheet. We'll reach a plateau level where the ins and outs are equal, by the time we get into '18 they won't be materially different.","So, hopefully that answers your question on rev rec.","Simon Flannery","Thank you.","Lowell McAdam","Okay, and Simon on 5G. As you indicated, we shared a lot of information in November. The trials are continuing to go extremely well for us. We have more than 200 sites up online. We continue to learn every day. The distances that we shared are and the throughputs are very consistent up to about 2000 feet, which is much better than we expected.","We're doing more testing around throughputs. We're seeing 10 Gigabits of peak throughputs. So, we're very comfortable with being able to deliver a gigabit of service at everyone that we're providing service to. As you may have seen the new standard, the global standard was approved in December and we've announced with Qualcomm bringing chips online that will fit that standard in the second half of '18.","So, we will be deploying with our proprietary standard but also very quickly in '18 coming on with the global standard as well. If you saw what was going on at CES, there was a lot of discussion about devices and we believe that there will be mobile devices late in 2018 and then more available as we get into 2019.","If you saw just last week, the FCC approved our purchase of straight path and so we're excited about moving that forward to close. So, as far as execution goes and pops, we're placing the fiber that we need now as we shared and I know you were there. In November, we shared the number of incremental sites that you need over a densified 4G network, is much smaller than we had expected.","So, we're not seeing that sort of capital intensity that some were assuming. So, as you indicated, we've announced Sacramento. We have three to five plan for the year. I am personally out meeting with some of the mayors talking about what we're going to be providing and the reception has been extremely positive.","So, as you know, it takes a little while to work through the city governments and get these things approved. But Sacramento is a terrific model for us. We continue to build that partnership and I wouldn\u2019t suspect it'll be too much longer before you'll see the other cities announce. And then we can be more specific on pops.","But as far as capital goes, Matt told you what our guidance was for the year. We are reallocating the capital that we have been spending. We don\u2019t see any upward pressure of this in this year. And we'll be able to determine the return on invested capital as we go through these trials in these commercial launches and we'll share more information as the year moves along.","Simon Flannery","Great, thank you very much.","Lowell McAdam","Okay, Brad. Let's take the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.","John Hodulik","Thanks, guys. Either for from Matt or Lowell. Can you guys talk about the low single-digit GAAP earnings guidance which I assume includes straight path and the $0.5 to $0.6 from increase in the charitable contribution? Talk about the some of the underlying drivers of that. You've seen wireless cap our EBITDA margins continue to move up, some pressure on the wireline side.","Is that what we can expect for 2018 and talk about how you see that the competitive environment evolving in the wireless market that may support continue to increase in margins on that side? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Yes. Thanks, John. Good morning. So, year-end ago we talked about the low single-digit GAAP earnings. And we talked about a few below-the-line items in the straight path will be dilutive because we're largely paying for that transaction in shares. And you will see an uptick in D&A cost because of the transactions we did last year.","But we're confident the underlying earnings are improving. You're seeing that come through the service revenue on the wireless side to the business. You saw that number improve to just a negative 2.9 in the fourth quarter. And then we said on an apples-to-apples basis getting back to flat-to-positive by the middle part of the year.","So, excited that we've completed that journey of transitioning the base and look forward to continuing to see wireless revenue growth from there. Wireline, I think in 2018 will be on a similar trajectory that you've seen in the past couple of years. Although as we continue to deploy more fiber in the network, it gives us opportunities to replace some of those earnings that were on copper based products with fiber based products which should be more sustainable going forward.","So, net you should certainly see an improvement in the earnings profile of the company versus the last couple of years. And then you mentioned the charitable contribution in your comment. I want to be clear that the guide is before the impact of tax reform and revenue recognition and when we say before the impact of tax reform we also mean the net impact of tax reform which includes the contribution to the foundation and the employee piece.","So, the low single-digit EPS guide is before that $0.5 to $0.6 impact of those couple of initiatives Lowell described, which is baked into that $0.55 to $0.65 positive impact from tax reform. So, hopefully that gives you a little more clarity on the moving parts within there. But it's built off the underlying earnings profile been stronger year-over-year.","John Hodulik","Okay. Thanks, Matt.","Lowell McAdam","Brad, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. I've got two follow-ups here around the impact of tax reforms. You talked a bit about how you're going to be taking advantage of some of the benefits you're going to see. I'm curious if we could expand on that.","Do you see an opportunity to maybe reinvest some of the savings in your competitive behavior meaning we've had kind of a com period here to end of year, you've invested a lot in your business? Is there an opening here for you to maybe spend a bit more to get customers revisit your network or even just to get your existing customers to maybe move into newer devices, whether it can take advantage of some of your network investments even making recently.","And then just also, we're kind of hoping that at a broader corporate level you'll see a lot of changes in behavior. You obviously have relationships with large enterprises. I know its early days but in your discussions with them, are you seeing any green shoes that perhaps will start increasing investments in their businesses and ways that can maybe have a positive lateral implication for your enterprises services segment down the road? Thanks.","Lowell McAdam","Okay. Well, let me start out Brett, on that, and then Matt and certainly add in. on the competitive front, you've been around me for years. I have said from 1983, when I got involved in telecom and wireless, that it's an extremely competitive market. And that competition can come from different places at different times but it's always very strong.","Verizon has never been one to lead the market down from a price perspective and we're certainly not going to change that now. Our focus inside the business is to use the assets that we have in our portfolio today like owe to be competitive in ways that the others can't compete. And as we roll 5G out, we see much more opportunity to be innovative as a way to be competitive versus using tax reform to just take our prices down.","Now, on your enterprise front. I think we've all been very pleased at how the market and the economy has run up here since tax reform. And just like we're positioning ourselves to be able to execute and accelerate our strategies, I see other businesses doing the same thing. And telecom is such an important part to the productivity measures of a lot of these enterprises, we do see the opportunity to pick this up.","But we remember we're only 30 days end of the tax reform process and we're all trying to understand the implications and what we can accelerate and how we can accelerate. So, where we build our fiber, where we're deploying 5G, what enterprises are telling us they want to do with our Intelligent Edge Network is influencing where we put our capital dollars. And I expect this to continue and I expect to see things pickup.","Brett Feldman","Alright, thank you.","Lowell McAdam","Brad, let's take the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may ask your question.","David Barden","Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe a couple of quick clarifications from Matt and one for Lowell. Matt, so just following up on that EPS guide to be clear, the low single-digit guidance does include the benefit from the change in the accounting for the handset related selling costs. And just to clarify that.","And then the second on the cash flow guidance, the $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion cash flow benefit, is that a sequential year-over-year benefit or is that a benefit relative to what you're expecting to pay in cash taxes in 2018. And then Lowell, if I could just ask, you've done a number of things on fiber both organic builds in terms of Boston for instance, acquisitions of XO and then more creative partnerships like on the WOW front.","Can you kind of talk a little about as we look into '18, '19, kind of the path forward on fiber infrastructure in supporting the 5G build. Is it more of an organic game plan from here on out or are they still on ways to make acquisitions on that front? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, David. So, your second question to me the cash flow guide, the $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion that is compared to what our 2018 cash taxes would have been without tax reform. So, it's not a comparison against 2017's cash taxes. It's just the 2018 impact with and without tax reform.","On the EPS guide, maybe I'll try to say in this little clearer. The EPS guide is our view on the business without revenue recognition and without tax reform. So, then you lay on top of that number, the impact of revenue recognition that we gave in the AK last week and you also lay on top the $0.55 to $0.65 increase in EPS that I described in the prepared remarks earlier this morning.","So, hopefully that does that help clear up the EPS question?","David Barden","Sorry, Matt. Because the revenue recognition is one thing but there is an expense recognition change, that's a separate thing that's a benefit between $900 million and $1.2 billion.","Matthew Ellis","Right.","David Barden","And I was just wondering if that's included in the single-digit or not included in the single-digit?","Matthew Ellis","It is not included in the single-digit, you add it on to the single-digit guidance.","David Barden","Perfect, thank you.","Lowell McAdam","Okay. Then David, so your question kind of boils down to or is it organic or is it M&A and where do we see deploying fiber. So, just for everyone else on the call, we have done some M&A. XO had a fair amount of fiber and WideOpenWest had fiber that we did by M&A.","But we also announced our deal with Corning, which is a multi-year deal where we're doing 12.5 million miles of fiber per year for the next three years. So, that would tell you we're sort of tilting toward organic. And our priorities are really what can we do to get off of others lease services to meet our 4G cell densification needs, then 5G, and then our enterprise customers.","And we're out in markets now obviously placing fiber but it's a market-by-market analysis of the three factors that I just talked about. And frankly, the cities the meeting that we're having with the cities and what access they will give us to street furniture and conduit and those sorts of things factor into the equation.","So, it's a bit fluid at this point and I wouldn\u2019t tell you that if an opportunity came up to accelerate it through M&A, we would do it, but most of the fiber companies were built for different purposes. They were point-to-point enterprise sort of services and they don\u2019t fit the architecture that we're building today which is multi-use fiber for Intelligent Edge Network.","So, and I hope that's clear enough for you but certainly leaning toward organic builds to meet Verizon needs to drive our cost down in our performance up.","David Barden","Thanks guys, I appreciate it.","Lowell McAdam","Brad, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Research. Your line is open.","Michael Rollins","Hi, good morning. Question for Matt as well as a question for Lowell. First Matt, can you talk about the strength in wireless phone that adds in the fourth quarter in a bit more detail and can you also describe what you're seeing from two of the changes in the competitive over the past 12 months which is cable starting to sell wireless subscription and also some of your competitors bundling in video services.","And Lowell, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the vision at Verizon. As you look at what you're investing in the mobile business, fiber infrastructure, 5G, is there a broader vision inside the company that you want to provide broadband access to as many premises as well as mobile customers across the country?","And is there some vision of what proportion of the country you may be able to reach in three to five years as you take all of these things together that you're dealing as a company? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Mike. So, I'll start off with the wireless front question and then Lowell can get onto fiber. Look, we had a great year on the wireless performance. The net ads were very strong as I mentioned, our smartphone net ads at 1.8 million for the year up 34% year-over-year.","So, we really saw a significant change. Today we launched unlimited back in February of last year and from that point forward, we have competed very effectively in the marketplace and it really allow customers to have a similar currency to compare different carriers on and the value proposition is resonating.","And despite all the noise that you hear from other people and the claims you hear from other people, the network quality matters. We saw that numerous times throughout the year and we see that in the performance we had on net ads whether it be the new activations coming in or the churn that we'd had.","So, each of the last three quarters of the year, phone churn was below 0.8% and I think that tells you how much customers enjoy being on the Verizon network. So, you ask about the game of source. Look, we're happy of what we've seen so far. Obviously, Comcast is on and Charter has said they expect to be on later this year.","And as we say consistently we like those agreements and we signed them in 2011 and we're happy to be doing them today. And we'll see how they play out but everything we've seen so far is in line with our expectations and we're glad to have that traffic on that network and monetize in that traffic based on what those companies are doing with those agreements.","And in terms of what the competitors are doing. Look, they bundle a number of things into their services during the course of last year and our numbers have staid very consistent. So, at the end of the day, the quality of the network that the device is on is of fundamental importance. And overall, when you look at our value proposition, it continues to resonate strongly.","And let's say we're very happy with the results we had last year and starting off 2018 on the [front foot].","Lowell McAdam","Okay Mike, let me take where we want to have from infrastructure in a vision perspective. Look, I think it's very clear here whether you look at what's going on today with customers or what you're anticipating that you saw at CES and others from what's next that there is an insatiable demand for broadband.","And it's not mobile and it's not fixed. It, customers don\u2019t care and I think who wins is going to be able to provide them the service that they can move seamlessly from fixed to mobile. We have been a much stronger mobile company over the years but the way we're positioning our fiber deployment and the way we're positioning 5G, we will be able to disregard geography and deploy those broadband services at a much lower cost than we've ever seen at least during my career.","Now for us to complete the vision, you need to be able to provide sort of those internet information services and video drives an awful lot of that. And we talked at length about taking the Oath assets to be that information source around news boards, finance and entertainment and lifestyle. And we think that the assets that we have will provide what customers need.","So, and you look at the applications going forward, they will whether it's medical and healthcare services, whether it's smart cities, whether it's education, whether it's autonomous cars and transportation systems, you're going to need that sort of seamless high bandwidth. And we lump that under the title human ability.","So, our focus is around giving all of our customers the capabilities to embrace these applications, so the future that are going to make their lives so much better. And so our investments they are all about providing the assets in the platforms to deliver that.","Michael Rollins","Thanks, very much.","Lowell McAdam","Brad, let's take the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead with your question.","Craig Moffett","Hi, good morning. A question about your capital budgeting process in the light of tax reform. Just given that the returns on a whole range of projects will now have been boosted by both the lower tax rate and the accelerated depreciation. Does that change your priorities with respect to capital investment or are there some specific types of projects whether it's deploying fiber or that sort of thing that now pops in front of the queue as being meaningfully more attractive than they were.","And how should we think about that with respect to the total size of your capital budget going forward?","Lowell McAdam","Well Craig, I'll take that and then Matt can jump in. I guess you could accuse us of being boring but you at least should give us credit for being consistent.","We have been extremely disciplined and then when we see an opportunity, we go hard. And you saw that in 3G, you saw that in 4G and you're going to see it and you're seeing it in 5G in placing fiber. We see a real opportunity here. We were the ones that stood up and said two years ago when everybody said we are way too early but we've been deliberate about it.","We've gone out, we've done the field trials, we've developed the ecosystem, we worked with partners from Korea as well as the infrastructure providers were out there as I said with 200 sale sites today learning and we're going to see what commercially happens in these three to five cities. Then we'll make the decision.","So, to us it's a very inconsistent that just because tax reform comes through, we're all of a sudden going to draw the line at a different place or lose that discipline. What tax reform does do is it gives us great flexibility that once we prove to ourselves that we can get a reasonable return on invested capital, we can accelerate very rapidly. And that gets the match point about we want to early on strengthen that balance sheet to give us the flexibility.","But the strategies there and we are all sort of like a spring ready to expand very quickly if we need to. But we have to get through another couple of hurdles here before we make those decisions and we're not ready to say that in January of '18 but I certainly hope by fourth quarter results next year we're accelerating because we've got such a great story to tell.","Matthew Ellis","The only other thing I'd add to that, Craig, and I'd kind of come back to the comments that Hans Vestberg made earlier this month that \"In our Industry, the nature of the way that we spend money, having significant increases and decreases is in a fashion the way we deploy CapEx.\" So, we're certainly looking at given as you say tax reform can change that some of the return math, but we'll be methodical about it.","And there's a lot of planning that goes into our capital spending before we get to it. And so, that's why you see us making the comments we do. We certainly look forward having the right opportunities in front of us. But you will us do it methodically and do it in the way that creates the greatest value.","Craig Moffett","Thanks.","Lowell McAdam","Brad, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jennifer Fritzsch","Okay. Thank you for taking the question. Two, if I may. One, the inevitable spectrum question. With T Mobile\u2019s purchases in the broadcast [auction] may have I think two times the amount of low band spectrum. Well, you have a kind of millimeter way spectrum, some may say or as might say as how the eggs are in that basket. How do you think of that?","And then second if I could get some math around David's question earlier. You mentioned moving away from leases, can you quantify how much right now you're paying them back house to them about cyber providers same class?","Lowell McAdam","Why don\u2019t I take the spectrum question? As you say, Jennifer, \"the inevitable question.\" Look, there is going to be an awful lot of noise around deployment of 5G. If you recall back when we deployed 4G, there was a big scramble for everybody to try to get 3G to look like 4G and we called it 4G Faux. And you're seeing some of the same stuff right now.","In order to do 5G and this is right out of the standard which we certainly agree with, you need at least a 100 megahertz of bandwidth to provide the latency, the reliability, the throughputs that really are the 5G promise. I can take 5G and I can put it on 10 megahertz of PCS if I want to. It won't perform like 5G, it will be the technology but it won't have the reliability, it won't have the throughput and it won't have the latency.","So, you're going to get a lot of this, well they need this or they are depending on whether your selling spectrum or what you've got in your basket of spectrum today. But I wouldn\u2019t change positions with anybody out there. I've got plenty of low band spectrum that works great for 4G, it's going to serve us for years to come.","But in order to put all of the aspects of 5G into play, you need 100s of megahertz of bandwidth. The only one who has that in a big way in the market place is us.","Matthew Ellis","And so, I'll just add one other piece to that, I agree exact low set about 5G and you should think about 4G network. We've always said these three things. Spectrum is a densification in the architecture and then the technology. I can tell you over the past few months there's been a number of technology upgrades to the network and you will see in that in the network performance a number of those we deployed in the back end of the fourth quarter, so significant amount of additional capacity being added to the network as we head into '18, again without having to go acquire additional spectrum.","But I do expect you to ask that question on those who's going forward. It would be a kind of a miss if people didn't. In terms of your question on how much we are paying back on fiber end, that's not a number we disclose. We really don't break out the income statement by individual line items, we're not going to start doing that now. But I would just say as we think about fiber, we look at the most economic way of getting it irrespective of where it shows up in the financial statements and we'll continue to do that.","Jennifer Fritzsch","Thank you.","Lowell McAdam","Hey Brad, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Your last question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. You may ask your question.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks, very much. Late last year, Lowell, you had highlighted a goal for $10 billion in cost cuts over the next few years. I was wondering how should we think about the areas where you believe the biggest opportunities for cost reductions are and how should we think about those cost cuts filtering in through the company over the next couple of years?","And then secondly, I was wondering if going back to the 5G topic, if you can touch upon whether you believe that fiber will be a competitive advantage in this world. Clearly you folks are making a significant amount of investment to get the necessary densification capillarity that you need for fiber. Others seemed to be working with cable providers to improve densification and back haul, do you believe that this is a viable alternative versus what you guys are doing or do you believe that at this point in time you are setting the stage for a longer term competitive mode as 5G comes to commercial positioning?","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Amir. Let me take the first one on the $10 billion number over the next four years that Lowell mentioned in September and we have talked about little since then. Look, what every area of the business is where we're looking and we believe that there is opportunities across every area of the business. Obviously network; cost are significant part, distribution; is something we're taking a close look at customer care or the back office type activities.","Essentially there is no area of the business it isn't going to get examined as part of this exercise because this imperative we make sure that we're as efficient a company as we can be as we go forward. From a timing standpoint, I can tell you we've embedded the 2018 targets for this activity in each of the business units operating plans for the year. And I look forward to discussing the results that we achieved on this as we go forward in '18 and into the future.","Lowell McAdam","And then Amir, I guess my answer on the fiber competitive advantage is, throughout my career I have always believed and it's been reinforced many times that if you've got a critical component of your success, you better own it and control it. And that fits with our direct distribution, it fits with a lot of our customer service. We don't outsource sales. We certainly wouldn't outsource critical components of our network.","As Hans has come in and put in our architecture for Intelligent Edge, owning that fiber asset is important to our financial performance as well as the performance of the network. And as we've seen time-and-time again, network competitive advantage drives customers which ultimately drives financial. So, you won't see us outsource much in the way of network unless someone has a huge scale advantage and we could negotiate very strong performance and very consistent financials that would go along with it.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Brady Connor","That's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I would like to turn it back over to Lowell for some closing comments.","Lowell McAdam","Thanks, Brady. So just a couple of final points from me. I don't come on these calls very often. I like to save that for when we've got significant changes in the business. And obviously, tax reform and our use of those funds was important for us to clarify.","But there was a second reason for me to come on and I have been in this industry for 30 years and I think we're breaking into one of the most exciting times that I've seen in my career. We are on the cusp of what I call the fourth industrial revolution as we see smart city applications, the changes in medical, the changes in transportation and education; all of those are fueled by a strong telecommunications infrastructure.","So, I think this is a great time for our industry overall. Obviously, I think Verizon is the best positioned to deliver that future. We've had a long history of strong operational and financial performance. We're investing in the media platforms and the fiber assets and the network and in the new technologies to meet the needs that are coming forward.","And I think as I said that will be a major change in the way people live, work and play. So, I am very excited about 2018, what lies ahead for us. I look forward to sharing the results and the successes as we move forward in this year and coming on a call next year at this time and recapping one of the best years in our history.","So, with that we'll close the call and we appreciate all of your time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you, for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect."],"21380":["Verizon Communications Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with our Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.","This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","In addition to our comments today, on February 21st, Verizon will be hosting an Investor Day event in New York City, and we will be webcasting presentations by Hans and the leadership team. More information about this event will be posted on our IR website.","Now, let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of $0.47 per share and full-year earnings of $3.76 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings for the fourth quarter include a net pre-tax loss from special items of about $4.9 billion. This net loss consists of a previously announced goodwill impairment for Oath of $4.6 billion, acquisition and integration charges of $189 million, and severance and annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liability of $165 million. ","In addition, we recognized the deferred tax benefit of $2.1 billion related to an internal reorganization of wireless legal entities. Excluding the effect of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.12 in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted earnings per share was $0.90 in the fourth quarter, up 4.7%, compared to $0.86 a year ago. On the same basis for the full-year, adjusted earnings per share excluding tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard was $3.87, up 3.5% compared to $3.74 a year ago.","It has now been a full year since the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The effect of this change is illustrated in the table on slide four. As a reminder, it results in a reduction of wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue and the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. The impact from this change was $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.28 per share for the full-year. The effect has been fairly consistent throughout 2018 with the fourth quarter slightly higher due to seasonality in wireless volumes.","In 2019, we expect a smaller benefit from the adoption of the standard due to the deferral of commission costs. The reduction in benefit creates a year-over-year EPS headwind, which is expected to be about half of the 2018 impact in each of 2019 and 2020.","For the remainder of this call, unless otherwise noted, financial results will exclude the impact of the revenue recognition accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2018.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you, Brady, and good morning to everyone.","This was truly a great year for Verizon. I\u2019m so proud of our team and what they have accomplished in 2018. As I traveled around and met with our employees and loyal customers, I have seen firsthand the great work that they are doing in pioneering solutions, focus on creating value and meeting customer needs. We\u2019re on the forefront of technology innovation as to provide our customers with fantastic experience on our networks.","2018 was a remarkable year. We delivered solid financials, returned value to our shareholders and strengthened our balance sheet as we continue on our trajectory to achieve a pre-Vodafone credit rating profile. Our capital allocation remains disciplined and focused on as we invest in our networks and put our Board in a position to maintain our consistent approach to the dividend.","Financially, on a like-for like basis, 2018 was highlighted by a strong wireless service revenue and earnings growth. This is a testament to Verizon providing the best wireless experience on the nation's best network.","Our bottom line performance was delivered through a combination of these revenue growth and our business excellence initiatives, which drove cash savings across the Company. We widened our network leadership position in 2018 and continued our momentum in delivering solid financial and operational performance. Our networks remain best-in-class and our performing better than ever, as evidenced by recent wins from J.D. Power and RootMetrics. We extended our leading wireless performance as we enhance our network and deliver the personalized experience for all our customers.","2018 was a year of 5G firsts. We were first to complete an overlay of data transmission on the 5G global standards. We were first to complete the first 5G data session on a smartphone. And in October, we proudly were the first in the world to commercially deploy 5G with our 5G Home product. As is seen in the year, our confidence is high as we\u2019re heading to the 5G era and the beginning of what many sees as the fourth industrial revolution.","Operationally, we\u2019re now transitioning [ph] for Verizon 2.0, which is the realignment of our operations to better focus on our customers. This new operating model realigns our customer-facing units into consumer, business and Verizon Media Group. This will enable us to leverage our scale and infrastructure to create better solutions for our customers.","We expect Verizon 2.0 will go live in the second quarter of 2019 and our results for the second quarter will be presented under the new structure. This transformation in how we face our customers is matched with the transformation under our business excellence initiatives where we recently announced our voluntary separation program and plans for our IT outsourcing. Together, these initiatives, along with our Verizon 2.0 operating model, position us to be even more competitive in a rapidly changing environment.","Now, I'll hand over to Matt to talk about the financial and operating results of the businesses, starting with slide six. Matt?","Matt Ellis","Thanks, Hans. In the fourth quarter, total operating revenue as reported was $34.3 billion, an improvement of 1%; and for the full-year, 2018 revenue was a $130.9 billion. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, total revenue was $34.1 billion in 4Q, up 0.5%. For 2018, on a comparable basis, excluding impacts from revenue recognition, divestitures and partial year impacts from acquisitions in the media group, adjusted operating revenues grew approximately 2.2%. The primary driver of the increase was continued wireless service revenue growth driven by step ups in access and net account growth.","In the fourth quarter, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, totaled approximately $11.0 billion, compared to $10.7 billion last year. For the full-year, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, totaled approximately $45.6 billion, an increase of 3.1%; and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.9%, slightly lower than last year's margin of 35.0%.","Our business excellence initiatives produced cumulative cash savings of $2.3 billion in 2018. For the full-year, the mix of activity skewed more towards capital reductions than OpEx savings. The voluntary separation program gives us a good starting point for further benefits in 2019, and the program remains on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative savings for the full-year period.","Let's now turn to our cash flow results on slide seven. In 2018, Verizon significantly strengthened the balance sheet with strong cash flow while continuing to efficiently invest for sustained network leadership. Full-year cash flow from operations totaled $34.3 billion, up $10 billion year-over-year. Year-over-year improvements in cash flow from operations was driven by strong operating results, recurring and nonrecurring tax reform benefits, reduced headwinds from the wireless device payment model, as well as lower discretionary pension and benefit contributions.","Full-year capital expenditures were $16.7 billion, in line with our revised guided range of 16.6 to $17.0 billion. Free cash flow for the year totaled $17.7 billion, up $10.6 billion year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $113.1 billion of total debt, comprised of $103.0 billion of unsecured debt and $10.1 billion of device payment securitizations. Our near term unsecured bond maturities are modest at $2.6 billion through year-end 2020. Total net debt was down $4.7 billion in 2018 and unsecured debt is lower by $5.2 billion. The reduction in unsecured debt and higher EBITDA were the primary drivers in improving our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio from 2.6 times at the end of 2017 to 2.3 times at the end of 2018.","In addition, the balance sheet is stronger as a result of about $5.1 billion of discretionary employee benefits funding during the last two years. This was primarily related to our pension plans, raising the funded status from approximately 70% at year-end 2016 to about 91% at year-end 2018 on a GAAP basis. The strength in balance sheet provides us with a financial flexibility to grow the business. We expect excess cash flow remaining after investing into business and paying our dividend will be deployed in 2019 towards our balance sheet goals.","Now, let's focus on the operating segments, starting with wireless on slide eight. Our customized experiences within our unlimited plans on the best wireless network have created a strong value proposition, and this is resonating with consumers. New customers are coming to Verizon at higher access points, and existing customers are stepping up in their plans. Additionally, we have seen our customers expand their accounts with more lines throughout the year.","In the fourth quarter, total postpaid net adds were 1.2 million, up 3.9% including phone net adds of 653,000, which were up 51.5% over last year\u2019s strong results. In addition, we added 11,000 tablets and 556,000 other connected devices, predominantly wearables. Smartphone net adds were 873,000, up 34.9% compared to 647,000 last year. For the quarter, we increased customer accounts, adding 118,000 to our base. For the full-year, postpaid net additions of 2.5 million included 1.1 million phones, 1.6 million other connected devices, and 181,000 tablet losses. Our competitiveness in 2018 was highlighted by smartphone net adds of 2 million, up 13% versus the prior year.","The overall experience of paring our unlimited plans with the best network continues to resonate with our customer base, resulting in outstanding retail postpaid churn of 1.08% and phone churn of 0.82% in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, postpaid device activations totaled 11.9 million, down from 12.4 million last year. About 81% of these activations were phones with wearables accounting for the majority of the other device activations.","The reduction in activations was the net result of higher gross additions being more than offset by lower upgrades. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 6.3%, up sequentially as expected, but was lower compared to 7.2% for the same quarter last year. The elongation of the upgrade cycle continues as more customers hold on to their devices for a longer period. In the quarter, prepaid net losses were 90,000 compared to a net loss of 184,000 in the prior year. Our 4G smartphone prepaid base increased during the quarter and all of the decline in prepaid net additions was due to 3G and basic prepaid phones.","We ended 2018 with 118 million total retail connections excluding wholesale and Internet of Things. Our industry-leading postpaid connections space grew 2.3% to $113.4 million and our prepaid connections totaled 4.6 million at the end of the year.","Let's turn to slide nine and take a closer look at wireless profitability. Our wireless operating results provided the basis for growth and profitability in the fourth quarter. Total wireless operating revenue increased 2.1% to $24.3 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, operating revenue totaled $91.3 billion, an increase of 4.4%. For the quarter, wireless service revenue increased by 1.9%. For the full-year 2018, service revenue grew 1.7%, attributed to ongoing customer growth, step-ups to unlimited and the benefits of subscribers customizing their experience through mix-and-match plans.","On a year-over-year basis, equipment revenue decreased 2.1% in the fourth quarter due to lower upgrade volumes. For the full-year, equipment revenue increased 8.4%, driven by higher-priced handsets and increased sales of wearables. At the end of the quarter, approximately 48% of our postpaid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance. Our postpaid phone base on unsubsidized service pricing increased to about 84% at year-end versus 80% at the end of last year. The fourth quarter trends in service revenue, business efficiencies and upgrade volumes provided the basis to EBITDA margin to increase year-over-year to 40.5% compared to approximately 39.8% in the same period last year. In the fourth quarter, we generated $9.8 billion of EBITDA, an increase of 3.9%. For the full-year, we generated $40.9 billion of EBITDA, up by approximately $2.3 billion year-over-year.","Let's move next to our wireline segment on slide 10. Total operating revenue for the wireline segment decreased 3.5% in the quarter and 3.1% for the full-year. Growth from our high-quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition. For the full-year, consumer revenue decreased by 1.5%. Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.0% in the quarter as Fios Internet growth was overshadowed by declines in video and legacy products. Fios revenue grew by 2.9% in the quarter. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in the total customer base and strong demand for higher internet speeds. In the quarter, we added 54,000 Fios Internet customers. We now have a total of about 6.1 million Fios Internet subscribers.","In Fios Video, the business faced ongoing headwinds as observed throughout the linear TV market. The Fios Video business ended with 46,000 subscriber losses in the quarter and 168,000 for the year. For the quarter, enterprise solutions revenue decreased 3.0%, partner solutions revenue decreased 9.2%, and business markets revenue was down 5.6%. Overall, secular and pricing pressures continued to be significant headwinds for these businesses. We expect legacy product revenues to continue to decline in 2019 at rates consistent with last year. In order to counter this decline, we continue to invest in fiber-based products and new applications that will open new opportunities for customers across our business lines. Through our One Fiber initiative we are building a single, highly-resilient and scalable fiber network that will allow us to efficiently provide advanced data services to customers across our consumer, business and enterprise customer groups. As a result, we remain confident that we can continue to generate growth and momentum in fiber-based products and new applications. Segment EBITDA margin was 16.9% for the quarter and 19.2% for the year, as our focus on operational efficiencies was more than offset by revenue declines and content cost escalations.","Let's move on to slide 11 to discuss our media and IoT businesses. For the quarter, Verizon Media Group revenue was $2.1 billion, a decrease of approximately 5.8% year-over-year. As expected, revenue trends were up sequentially from 3Q, due to seasonal advertising spending. Year-over-year, we continue to see traction in growth in mobile usage. However, this is overshadowed by the macro pressures from declines in desktop volumes. From a technology standpoint, we have now completed our supply and demand side platform integrations. We are focused on technologies and resources in the business that will yield forward momentum. In our telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $242 million. IoT revenues including Verizon Connect increased approximately 9.5% in the quarter. Our value proposition is evolving as our engagement with municipalities gains more momentum with the upcoming commercial rollout of 5G services.","Let's move next to discuss 2019. Our focus on executing on the fundamentals of the business positions us for strong performance in the upcoming year. On a GAAP reported basis, we expect low single-digit percentage growth in full-year 2019 consolidated revenue, compared to the prior year, driven by the continuation of wireless service revenue growth. We expect to see organic earnings growth in 2019. However, our EPS will be impacted by the revenue recognition headwind we discussed earlier as well as a few nonoperational items, primarily a higher effective tax rate and increased interest expense due to placing additional spectrum into service.","After the effect of these items, which we expect to be approximately $0.24 to $0.28 of pressure on EPS growth, we expect our adjusted EPS in 2019 to be approximately the same as our adjusted 2018 EPS, excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard. At this point, we expect the adoption of the new lease accounting standard to have about $0.01 to $0.02 per quarter headwind impact on EPS in 2019. The 2019 effective tax rate is projected to be in the range of 24% to 26%. We expect cash income taxes to be $2 billion to $3 billion higher due to tax benefits that were realized in 2018 that we do not expect to repeat this year.","Our internal capital decision process and return objectives have not changed. We are consistent and methodical in our allocation. We expect consolidated capital spending to be between 17 and $18 billion, including the expanded commercial launch of 5G. This capital intensity is consistent with historic levels.","Let me now turn it back to Hans to walk through our strategic priorities for 2019.","Hans Vestberg","Thanks, Matt.","Verizon\u2019s strategic priorities for 2019 all clear. I have outlined five priorities with my team that focus on our customers, financial performance, 5G leadership, our valued employees, and Verizon's role in creating benefits for our society.","First, we will redouble our long-standing excellence in customer satisfaction. This customer centric mentality has always been one of our core assets and will become even more essential as innovation continues to accelerate.","Second, we'll build on the momentum of our strong 2018 financial and operating results. Today, we're growing the business, strengthening the balance sheet, and improving the cost structure to compete in the environment. In the future, we will enable and monetize new use cases on our advanced networks.","Our third priority is to extend our leadership in 5G. The cornerstone of our strategy continues to be our best-in-class network. We have demonstrated our network leadership through every cycle from analog to 4G. We run to and embrace the challenge of deploying the best technology for our customers. Whatever is technology such a small cells, dense fiber or LTE advanced features, Verizon has a proven track record of setting the gold standard for others to follow. In return, our consistent investment in our networks, particularly 5G will pay dividends as well as we advance and lead the industry into the fourth industrial revolution. Not too long ago, they mere thought of having a 5G network before the beginning of the next decade would have seen implausible, but we pushed the industry to get there faster. As a leader and catalyst of change, we advanced 5G development and delivered to the word the first two 5G deployments in 2018 with our initial four commercial markets, and this is real 5G. This is a completely transformative experience that gives customers speeds, measuring hundreds of megabits to gigabits, reduce latency, allow for connections per square kilometers by millions, and energy efficiency at a fraction of today's consumptions.","Our 5G network is projected on delivering a game-changing wireless experience. The assets we have compiled and put into place in 2018 have enabled this vision. We have the spectrum to provide a rich ultra-wideband 5G services. Our deep fiber backbone connects our assets, enabling a high-capacity and efficient architecture. Our investment in the intelligent edge network creates new capabilities and gives us the flexibility to serve our customers. And it is our engineers and the know-how they've accumulated through this development process that binds our 5G solution together. No other wireless operator has this unique combination of assets. We are the leader in 5G as we have said before and proven once again. We don't wait for the future, we build it.","Our fourth priority is our employees. Our winning team within new Verizon 2.0 will be the key to creating new solutions in today's world. We want to continue fostering [ph] organization environment that embraces change, sparks curiosity, and encourages strategic-risk taking while inspiring all of us. Internally, our shared purpose [ph] is to deliver the promise of the digital world by enabling people, businesses and society to innovate and drive positive change.","Our fifth priority is carrying forward Verizon\u2019s commitment to responsible business practices and making the world a better place. At Verizon, we coined the word humanability, which means the power of technology to create new ability for humans to innovate and drive positive change in the work. I'm confident that Verizon\u2019s 5G network will be universal enabler of advanced use cases and technology that brings humanability forward.","I\u2019m super excited to host our upcoming investor day on February 21st. We will bring the Verizon executive team and go deeper into our strategy, our vision of Verizon 2.0 and our enhanced customer focus.","With that I will turn it back to Brady for the Q&A session.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Hans. Brad, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Hans, I wonder if you could give us an update on 5G Home. When do you expect the standards-based gear to be available? And what does the CapEx guidance really imply in terms of homes passed this year and the progress towards the 30 million? And then, any commentary on the handset outlook for mobile 5G and what we should expect on that side this year?","Hans Vestberg","When it comes to the 5G Home, we are so thoughtfully deployed in the four cities that we decided for. So, what we\u2019re waiting for right now is the CP equipment for 5G Home. And as the industry is evolving, the first focus for the industry is actually to do chipset for smartphones and then secondarily the next generational chipset comes on the CPE side. We definitely believe that this year, we will get CPEs on the NR standard in the second half of 2019. So, that's where we are. We\u2019re building the network as we\u2019re speaking. And as soon as we see the availability of the CPEs, we will of course -- getting that out in the marketplace. And that of course subsequently answers the question on handset as well. We\u2019re going to see handsets coming out in the first half of 2019. As you know, we have announced two phones, one from Motorola and one from Samsung. The one from Samsung has not been seen yet but hopefully it will be seen soon. And as soon as those are ready, and we have been together sort of interoperability testing that, we\u2019re going to launch that.","Remember now that the network is a multiuse network. So, the home and the mobility is the same network we\u2019re building. We\u2019re not building two different networks. So, it\u2019s more what type of devices you\u2019re connecting to the network.","And then, ultimately, on the question on CapEx, I think Matt guided our CapEx, which has been consistent over the years. We are doing everything. Remember, the majority of investments in the 5G network is coming with the fiber networking we\u2019ve been doing, the passive asset we\u2019re doing, the intelligent edge network design that we\u2019ve been working on for years, and then, of course, you have the equipment coming at the end of it. So, we are actually -- been for several years investing into be prepared for the 5G, and this is including the CapEx guidance for this year for obvious reasons.","Operator","The next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead.","John Hodulik","Maybe a couple of quick questions for Matt. On the wireless side, you saw ARPA decline a little bit in the fourth quarter versus the growth in the third quarter, and you saw decel in the service revenue growth. What's driving that decline that we saw this quarter? And, are the sort of benefits of moving to the unlimited sort of fully reflected in the decline we're seeing, and how do you expect that to turn going forward? And then, on the free cash flow, thanks for the CapEx and the taxes guidance. Any other sort of things you should be thinking about as we look to free cash flow in \u201819 from a pension contribution or working cap standpoint? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","Thanks, John. So, on the wireless service revenue, I think, as you look at the fourth quarter number, what we have is, we continue to have good underlying momentum in the wireless service revenue, whether you're talking about the social service revenue line, or whether you're looking at the ARPU line. But, there is little bit of noise in the fourth quarter number that masks that growth. So, let me just give you a little more detail.","In 4Q, both in \u201817 and \u201818, we had some nonrecurring items that gives us that 1.9% year-over-year increase, which as you say, slightly lower than the past two quarters but still certainly a good positive number. 4Q in \u201817, we had a positive adjustment related to our wholesale revenues, and that adjustment didn't repeat this year. So, we're lapping that adjustment. Additionally, this year, we had a couple of items go the other direction, including some service credits related to that we granted customers impacted by natural disasters. So, when you compare those, you remove those, the underlying core retail postpaid service revenue increased sequentially, had good momentum year-over-year, in line with what we saw in 2Q and 3Q. And importantly we start 2019 billing more accounts and at a higher ARPA than we started last year. So, it's a good place to be. I think, we continue to see opportunity to increase service revenue in 2019 by adding accounts as we did last year, but also increasing ARPA. There is still significant headroom for us to move customer to unlimited and step them up when they're in unlimited, adding more devices to accounts. So, I think the momentum we saw in \u201818 will certainly continue into \u201819 in a good way.","On the free cash flow, so, we don't actually provide, as you know, a free cash flow guide for the year. We did talk about the fact cash taxes will be higher. As I think about cash flow for 2019, there's five major items I would think about, a couple of them in the positive direction. We certainly expect the core EBITDA of the business to increase year-over-year. Additionally, last year, we had $1.7 billion of pension and benefits contribution, so we would not expect to be at the same level in 2019. And the other direction I mentioned in the prepared comments, the higher cash taxes, will also have the payments related to the voluntary severance program; all of those cash outflow will be in 2019. And we do expect CapEx to be higher part slightly year-over-year too. So, when you net those items together, you can kind of get to a view for 2019 cash flow. But certainly cash flow in 2018, very strong, $34 billion, up $10 billion year-over-year. We're proud of the progress we made there and will certainly look to build on that in 2019.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Philip Cusick of JP Morgan. You may go ahead.","Philip Cusick","Hey, guys. Thanks. Two if I can. How should we think about wireless EBITDA in 2019, given your continued cost focus, and the comment that 2018 cost savings were more focused on CapEx than OpEx? And second, on the balance sheet, I wouldn't let you get away without talking about leverage, 2.3 times today and headed lower. Can you think a little bit for us about priorities for cash flow from here? Do you see buying assets like spectrum or fiber that could lever your back up or should we start thinking about capital return in the next couple of years? Thank you.","Matt Ellis","I'll start with the second one down on the balance sheet. So, you say good progress on the leverage ratio on a net debt-to-EBITDA from 2.6 to 2.3 during the year. As I think about hitting into 2019, our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. We'll continue to be disciplined in how we deploy capital. Our number one priority is investing in the business, whether that be CapEx or whether that be other ways we can invest in the business. After that, we certainly -- the dividend continues to be very important to our shareholders. And then as we said, we continue to strengthen the balance sheet.","In addition to the reduction in the leverage ratio, I\u2019d also point out, in the past couple of years, we've made approximately $5 billion contributions to our pension and benefit plans. And so, our funded status on our pension plans in the last couple of years has gone up from approximately 70% to 90%. So, some really good progress there. We'll see how the year plays out. We certainly expect to continue to improve, strengthen the balance sheet. And we'll also look for opportunities to grow the business. And if there is still cash left over, we\u2019ll decide what to do at that point in time.","In terms of the wireless EBITDA in 2019, look, I'll start at the top of the income statement, and we expect service revenue to continue to grow. So, that's the tailwind that we have coming out of 2018 and will build on as we get into next year. So, we'll have some growth there. And then, as we continue to focus on the cost side of the business, obviously, we've got 10,000 people leaving the business over the course of the next few months that will have a positive impact on the EBITDA. And we continue to look for other ways to continuously make our business more efficient and competitive. So, I think you should see some good EBITDA trajectory as we go through 2019 and that will help contribute to the cash flow, as we talked about.","Hans Vestberg","And I can only add that on the question about CapEx and OpEx and in \u201818, we had more cash savings on the CapEx. We will continue with our disciplined way of the business excellence program, both on CapEx and OpEx. And I think that in \u201818 we show that we did everything we wanted to do on CapEx. At the same time, we actually became more efficient. And I think, the program we have put in place is very rigorous and very good. And that brings us all are benefits that we need to get from the investments at the same time as we\u2019re getting the efficiency. So, that's very much part of it, but we also look very much for the top-line, as Matt talked about. I think, it's a combination with the new leadership team coming into the second quarter, I think we want to have a great focus on it.","Operator","The next question will come from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.","Brett Feldman","If you don't mind, I was hoping maybe you clarify some of the comments you made around the EPS guidance and some of the drivers. So, you're basically saying that you expect earnings exclusive of the new lease accounting to be similar or effectively flat this year. And I think you indicated that there's essentially about a $0.14 headwind from the ASC 606, you had $0.28 benefit in \u201818. I think that goes to about 14 this year. And I just wanted to clarify. I think you also indicated, there's another say $0.10 to $0.14 coming out of the higher tax rate and the increase in interest expense because of putting spectrum into service. So, all in, those items are $0.24 to $0.28. Is that the point you made?","Matt Ellis","Yes. Good morning, Brett. Exactly. So, yes, you heard the guide right. On a GAAP basis, prior to the lease accounting, roughly similar. And you're right, within there, and we\u2019ve talked about this I think on the third quarter call, you have these headwinds from 606, and that's $0.28 of the benefit in 2018. We said roughly half going the other way in \u201819. So, you're right. That's around $0.14, and then, a couple of other items below the line that we talked about in the prepared comments. So, as we deploy the AWS-3, we\u2019re capitalizing less of our interest expense. So, that creates a year-over-year headwind; that doesn't change the cash flows of the business one bit.","And then, on the ETR, we have the same guided range this year as last year, 24% to 26%. Last year, we ended up with 24.2%. We had a number of nonrecurring items that had us at that lower end of the range. Going into the year, we don't necessarily have line of sight, the same amount of the nonrecurring items this year. So, at this point, we\u2019re planning on being closer to the middle point of that range, and we will see how that plays out. But, as you say, when you add those up, you\u2019ve got about $0.24 to $0.28 of headwinds. And so, that means you have operational year-over-year improvement of a similar amount that get you to that guide. So, I think what you see over the past couple of year here, Brett, is certainly in \u201816 and \u201817, we had a business that was pretty flat to the revenue and earnings line. And then in \u201818, when you adjust that for the impact of tax reform and 606, we had 3.5% increase in EPS, and that was even with some headwinds in there from the share count dilution from Straight Path and couple of other items. So, good EPS growth in the core business in \u201818, and then you see us building on that in \u201819. And we tried to provide a little more color commentary in the prepared remarks, so you get the flavor of it and get some of the puts and takes to get us to the overall guide. But certainly, it\u2019s based off of the core underlying business continuing to grow year-over-year.","Brett Feldman","And if you don\u2019t mind, just a quick follow-up. You walked through the wireless components that are driving that core growth. What have you assumed for -- in your outlook for 2019 for Verizon Media services? I believe it was dilutive to earnings in \u201818, what are you assuming that impact will be this year?","Matt Ellis","So, Verizon Media Group, certainly, we talked a lot about in the second half of last year. We didn't provide a breakout of the earnings, not going to now. But certainly, when you saw a negative 6.9% revenue growth in 3Q and negative 5.8% in 4Q, it wasn't as much of a contributor to earnings, as we would've liked it have been last year. The assumption, as we head into this year's is they will make progress on the revenue line. And as they make progress on improving that revenue trajectory, it certainly will have a -- will change the earnings side as well. So, we think that they\u2019ve got some good plans in the business, we now need to execute against those, get the revenue trajectory turned around, and that will then impact earnings in a positive way as well.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead.","David Barden","I guess, a couple for Matt. You are focusing on the wireline side, Matt, kind of pros and cons we saw, little bit of an uptick in enterprise; we saw a big step down in wholesale; and margins really kind of came off in that division. And I'm wondering if that's going to be kind of a focus for the voluntary separation program that you've undertaken, and that's where you are going to see some of that. So, if you could kind of walk us through the drivers on the wireline side. The second question is just for the sake of thinking about 2019, where are we going to see the IFRS 16 lease accounting changes kind of have an effect on the -- on the business on the income statement would be helpful. Thank you.","Matt Ellis","Thanks, David. So, on the wireline side -- and I'll ask Hans to add a couple of comments as well around it. But certainly, the ongoing secular decline in some of the legacy technologies, that continues. What's encouraging in the business is as we build out our fiber assets and the opportunities that creates there, some of the incremental technologies we're deploying in the area, like SD WAN, we're seeing some good progress to offset those secular declines. So, we will continue with that. And then, as you rightly say, as you think about the margins, as you head into \u201819, wireline will see a good part of the benefit from the voluntary severance program. So, that in addition to the other ongoing cost actions that we continue to take, should be of assistance to the wireline margins in \u201819.","Hans Vestberg","Yes. And if we look at the whole wireline team, as you rightfully pointed out, we have a secular decline in certain areas there. But to be honest, we also see with the assets we're now bringing out with intelligence edge network, we see possibility for many new solutions, sort of coming out of our customers based on the fiber we're deploying, but also when it comes to SD WAN and a couple of other very important solutions that are bringing out. At the same time, the small and medium business segment is very important for the U.S. economy where we are well-positioned. The wholesale has of course come down a little bit. But remember, now, we are deploying more infrastructure than ever before. So, I think that over time, but it will take some time, we'll definitely see even more possibility there. We have a very focus on that team to actually break the trend. We have now been coming down for -- when it comes to growth, I think the team is really focused on getting new products out. And we have a really good customer base to hold the wireline business. And as we move into the second quarter and our customer centric organization, it will even be more important with these customers that we can orchestrate with all our product portfolio from wireline, wireless, the IoT business et cetera. So I think we're really focused on coming back to growth. At the same time, you see that we're taking out costs. So, we see that we're managing that. So, again, we have a surgical focus on actually top-line, but at the same time seeing that we are managing our cost basis at the same time. And I think that Matt and the team are on to that operation all the time and we will continue so in 2019.","Matt Ellis","Yes. On the lease accounting, David. So, couple of different things. On the income statement, as you heard upfront, we expect $0.01 to $0.02 of headwind per quarter. That's going to come mostly above the line. There may be some initial adjustments that will hit below the line but mostly above the line. If you think about it, there are some costs upfront costs associated with leases that we historically would've capitalized under the old rules that we won't necessarily be able to capitalize all those rules -- all of those upfront costs under the new rules. So, that's where you'll see some of the change come through. From a balance sheet standpoint, we will be grossing up both the asset and liability side of the balance sheet. At this point, we expect in the $21 billion to $23 billion range. So, that's the impact, you should see come through in the first quarter of 2019 from adopting that new standard.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett","I wonder if we could just stay with the discussion of wireline for a second. Matt, when you were talking in your prepared remarks, you talked about pressure from programming costs. I wonder, if you could just think about kind of the Fios Video business for a moment. It seems like you've been hitting on some of the same themes for a while now, and that it may be right for sort of reimagining what you do with that business. Can you just talk about your strategic thinking about how long does it make sense to stay committed to a linear video product for Fios versus sort of repositioning it along with your 5G product as really almost a pure connectivity service, focused on broadband?","Matt Ellis","So, as you say, a number of the trends we've seen in wireline have been ongoing for a number of years, including the increasing content costs. So, we continue to look for creating different options for customers that make sense for the price points you can then put in front of customers. And so -- but we don't expect the trajectory of content costs to change significantly over the next few years, unless we take some actions. And if we have the opportunity to provide customers with different ways of getting to the video content they want, we will certainly be excited about doing that. So, ever since we did choice TV, about four years ago now, we've been looking ways to get customers better choice around the cost of getting their video product, and we\u2019ll continue to do that.","Hans Vestberg","And I agree with Matt here. We will of course over time see that we can create optionality for our customers to choose between different solutions for their TV viewing. So, we will have that definitely in our pocket. Initially, of course 5G Home has been focused on other cities than our footprint for Fios. But ultimately, we need to see that our customers have all the choices when it comes to how they want to consume the video. We see the trends in the market. And as Matt said, we're working hard with our cost in Fios all the way from content to other cost elements and see that we're managing that well. But ultimately, we need to create optionality for our customers. That's what Verizon always has done and that we\u2019ll continue to do.","Craig Moffett","I guess, if I just -- if I were going to paraphrase, it sounds like you still believe the linear video product is still helpful in your ability to market Fios Broadband, and the Fios Broadband is not more competitive on its own as a broadband only product?","Hans Vestberg","No. I think that first of all, there we\u2019re going to manage our customers and see that they are getting what they want, and we're going to follow the market very closely. But, we still have plenty of customers using our Fios business on the linear TV and we will continue to serve them if they think that's important. But at the same time, we\u2019re going to create optionality; and that's the way old the job that we have as a tech innovator to constantly innovate and bring new solutions to our customers as the markets are evolving. So, we're going to see that the ones having Fios getting that; we have upgraded our Fios technology during 2018 and 2017 after a while of holding back a little bit. You'll see that the ones that our customers that feel that is good service, they are getting more of the service as well. So, we will continue with that but at the same time, create optionality over time. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Michael Rollins","Just a couple if I could. First, going back to the comments for expanded commercial launch of 5G in 2019. Can you frame how much of the country Verizon will cover for mobile 5G by the end of \u201819 and maybe also by the end of 2020? And then, secondly can you quantify the specific potential earnings benefit from the voluntary separation program, once it fully rolls through the financials?","Hans Vestberg","If I start with the 5G, we have not disclosed where we are on the deployment. I can say, we\u2019re deploying as fast as we can. And much of the work that we've been doing last couple of years is of course to prepare everything from the fiber to the agreement with the cities to getting the intelligent management network from the transport network, core network all out to the access. As the industry matures, the equipment is maturing for NRs, [ph] so we can bring that in. And we actually have quite a lot of deployment already of those types already base stations. So, we will come back to that when we commercially launch that, what we have noted. It\u2019s nothing we want to disclose for competitive reasons. So, I wouldn\u2019t talk about it right now.","But, I think what is important to understand this lead that Verizon has on 5G. We have been on to this for several years, including the millimeter wave where we already have commercial service, where we of course not only understand the engineering of the 5G technology and the spectrum, it\u2019s also all the way from operations, marketing, installations all of that. And that is extremely valuable insight when we want to go fast as soon as we see that we have all the pieces that is needed for launching 5G Home or 5G mobility with ecosystem there and all of that. So, again, we have triggered the industry to be probably one and half to two years ahead of the schedule of 5G. We think that is enormously important for Verizon to be on the forefront of innovation. And we want to push that and said, we\u2019re nothing holding back coming out to 5G; it\u2019s more that we just need to see that the ecosystem is equally ready as Verizon is right now.","Matt Ellis","Hey, Mike. On the voluntary benefits, as we announced, 10,000 people coming off payroll in terms of the benefit this year, they come off in predominantly three different waves. Some came off at year-end and we\u2019ve got a couple of additional waves coming off, so that factors in. We will have a small amount of backfills, not exactly the same position but as we re-imagine the work, but net, net a significant -- down the vast majority of that 10,000. So, the timing at which people come out will matter. Remember, the charge we took was $1.8 billion. We haven't disclosed what we expect the income statement benefit in 2019 will be. But certainly, we expect to get a good payback on that initial cost of doing the severance. So, you should expect a pretty significant benefit in 2019. And as we continue to change the way the work gets done, those heads don\u2019t come back into the business and that should be a sustainable cost improvement as we go forward.","Hans Vestberg","And I just want to put it in context, and remember, we started with a large transformation in the network and by that a lot of new ways of working. Then secondly, on top of that, we also define a new way of working with our IT where we have a fairly large outsourcing ongoing; at the same time, we have the voluntary program. All in all, it's our way to prepare ourselves for the future to be even more efficient, so we can be even more agile in the future. And you saw also lot weak, I guess. We announced also that we're doing a work in the Verizon Media Group where we are reducing. And all in all, it's part of a large transformation for us to prepare, doing that when we are as strong as we are right now. So, we\u2019re actually coming out there when the competitive landscape continues to be around and what's happening, we want to be agile and much more quick on own investments et cetera.","So, I think, it's a larger transformation, the third part of that transformation of course, the Verizon 2.0 that we are implementing in the second quarter in order to have much more customer centric solutions for our customers. And that's based on our assets, when it comes to the network or brand and our distribution and seeing that work excelling in this marketplace. So, that is -- you need to put that all in a context when you think about what we're doing right now. And I think I've been here now for quite a while, I see the response of the organization be very positive to all these changes to see that we continue to be the leader in these markets.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt Niknam","Hey, guys. Thanks for getting me in, just two brief ones if I could. First, have you seen any signs of impact in the business from either a small and macro backdrop or the government shutdown earlier this month that we should consider? And then secondly on a wireless competitive landscape, can you just talk about what you saw in the marketplace in 4Q, and whether anything is really changed materially thus far in January? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","Yes. Hey, Matt. So, on your first question, no major impact at this point on the macro economy or even the shutdown. On the shutdown, we did see some impact in our government business, as you'd expect, but nothing significant to the overall business. And then, in the wireless market, we see a continuation of the trends that we saw in 2018. The vast majority of promotions now are more on the handset side, the hardware as opposed on the service revenue. We continue to see that promotional activity in the marketplace, but we continue to believe that -- and see the evidence with the great network experience and having the right offers where we compete effectively. And I would reiterate what we said earlier, when you talk about that best network experience, when you look at a number of the third-party surveys that came out for the second half of 2018 performance, not only did our performance improve but we widened the lead against the competition. So, that continues to matter to our customers and puts us in a position to compete effectively in the marketplace.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike McCormack","Hey, guys. Thanks. Maybe just circling back on the wireline side. The enterprise decline seem to be a little bit more muted this quarter. Was there some sort of CP benefit that you got or anything else going on, on the enterprise side? And then, secondly on the competitive front, I guess both in wireless and wireline, any change from the recent launches in cable? I know we have charter launching wireless; and then on the broadband side, obviously rolling gigabit services across the footprint, any change that you\u2019ve seen across both of those segments? ","Hans Vestberg","On the enterprise decline, there was nothing special from the -- it was a normal mix, and of course we had some good wins in the quarter, but there was nothing, so no CPE that was taking out. On the MVNO, and I can only comment that we're happy with the agreements we have. And for us, with the technology and the network we have, I mean, it makes sense to work with the MVNOs. And I think that we are very happy with the setup that we have with the two cable guys right now in the market. Matt?","Matt Ellis","No. Exactly, I think the -- nothing we saw changed significantly in the fourth quarter from the trends we discussed previously in here in terms of the makeup of competitors in the marketplace. And look, as the supposed gig footprints expand, it doesn't seem to be impacting our competitiveness at all. So, we continue to believe, by having the best product out there is resonating with customers. And we welcome other guys into the market and look forward to competing with them.","Brady Connor","This is all the time we have for questions today. Before the end of the call, I want to turn it back over to Hans for a few closing comments.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you, Brad. And just to summarize up a little bit what we\u2019ve been discussing. I mean, first of all, we had the strong financial operating performance in the fourth quarter, but not only that, the hold 2018. I think, the wireless team has built a momentum, all the way from unlimited launch. I have to say, I'm proud of the team, they continuously innovate. And as Matt has said several times on this call, that give us a very good start for 2019 what they have been doing so far this year.","So, we are coming in with -- in 2019 with good momentum, both from a business point of view but also our business excellence work we continue doing and we're in the start of it. And I think that both Matt and I, we would do it in the best way in the courses way, but also prepare ourselves for the future to be even strong Company. I outlined my five key priorities, you heard them, and I think that they should be resonated with all of you, both from the growth point of view, implementing the new structure, the 5G, and of course, our asset and our employees, and continue also to see that our brand evolves and that we're doing the right things for our society. I think that goes for any company in today's world where employees, customers and shareholders expecting it from you. And I think that's our normal strategy. So, it's nothing new, but it's more that we need to continue to leverage that in our humanability.","We will continue to focus on innovation and our network. There's no debate that that is extremely important to us. And I'm proud of what the team did in the engineering, in the network, on the 4G network. It continues to lead and extend the leadership, which I think is a great contribution to the skills that we have in our technology group. And that, of course, continue in the 5G, which we have already our 5G Home commercial. We're going to see much more of 5G commercial, both mobility and home during 2019.","And I hope that you\u2019re equally excited as I am. And I hope that you will join us for the Investor Day in February. We're going to bring the executive team there; you\u2019re going to meet the new leaders. We want to go a little bit deeper on the things we're discussing today in the structure what we're doing and of course, we want to talk about 5G.","So with that, thank you for your time today and great that you\u2019re listening. Thank you very much.","Brady Connor","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."],"21569":["Verizon Communications Inc.

At this time, all participants have been pleased in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.","This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. In addition to our comments today, on February 13, Verizon will be hosting an Investor Day in New York City and will be webcasting presentations by Hans and the leadership team. More information about the event will be posted on our IR website.","As a reminder we're in the middle of a millimeter wave spectrum auction so we will not be able to comment on our current millimeter wave spectrum holdings or strategy. ","Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.23 per share resulting in full year earnings of $4.65 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a net pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $2.4 billion including an early debt extinguishment charge of $2.1 billion; an impairment charge of $236 million primarily related to the write-down of goodwill within our media business; and a net charge related to severance and annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities of $135 million.","In addition, we recorded a $2.2 billion tax benefit related to the sale of preferred shares in a foreign affiliate. The cash impact related to the tax benefit of this sale will be realized in 2020. Excluding the effects of these special items adjusted earnings per share was $1.13 in the fourth quarter up 0.9% compared to $1.12 a year ago. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $4.81 up 2.1% compared to $4.71 a year ago.","Let's now move to slide 4 and take a closer look at our fourth quarter earnings profile. The impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standards ASC 606 for revenue recognition and ASC 842 for leases continued throughout 2019.","As we illustrated in previous quarters we realized a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction of the benefit realized creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share which will continue throughout 2020.","The impact was $0.03 for the fourth quarter and $0.12 for the full year. For 2020, we expect the headwinds from the deferral of commission expense to be approximately $0.09. In addition to ASC 606, accounting standard ASC 842 for leases which was implemented at the beginning of 2019 results in a gross up on the balance sheet for all operating leases.","This new leasing standard affects our earnings per share primarily due to the expensing of certain upfront lease costs creating a headwind of $0.01 in the fourth quarter and $0.05 for the full year. We do not expect a year-over-year impact from the lease standard in 2020.","Full year adjusted EPS growth of 2.1% illustrated on the earnings waterfall slide reflects strong underlying performance of the business, partially offset by the impacts of the deferral of commission expense and the adoption of the leasing standard. Additional details of our quarterly performance will be covered by Matt later in this call.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2019 and a discussion of our strategic priorities for 2020.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you, Brady, and thank you, everyone, for joining this fourth quarter earnings call. Let me summarize quickly a little bit everything we have done in 2019, which is building a great fundamental for 2020. The transformation was built on a network, process changes, brand changes, go-to-market changes and of course, also a lot of new talent coming into our team, all that we\u2019re doing during 2019. ","We've fortified our network with new architecture. We had a lot of process changes with a voluntary program. We rebranded and put one brand for everything we're doing in the company. We made a new go-to-market, including new management teams. That has been a big change in the company that is solidifying our way of accessing the market an even better way in 2020.","So all that's happening, we continue to actually execute well on our day-to-day business. Our network continues to be the best in the market. We just had new confirmation from J.D. Power, RootMetrics that again our network, our 4G network is clearly the best in the market. Very happy with the team that they keep up that work.","The other thing that we have been very focused on is of course to continue to lead the market in wireless and for consumers. And here we're seeing Ronan Dunne and his team continue with a good pacing. Unlimited came out with new offerings seeing that our customer getting optionality, optionality when it comes to the wireless offering, but also on the cable side within mix and match that we came out with earlier this year.","We also added in a lot of partnership as we now have network service as a strategy. We added in the Apple Music and more lately, of course, we included with Disney+. Both of them has been a win-win for both our partners, for our customers, and for Verizon. And this is the strategy we want to have going forward.","On the business side, we also did a lot of important partnerships where we had the same model. I think about the partnership with for example AWS Amazon on the 5G mobile edge compute, again, a totally new way of accessing a market that we have not been into.","And speaking about 5G, we had our commitment 30 cities. We made 31. We said we're going to launch 5G Home with the NR standard. We did that and we said we're going to launch the first 5G mobile edge compute. We did that in Chicago in December.","So all-in-all, a year with so much execution and at the same time we continue to achieve what we want to do. And we round that up with our financials in the year-end operational metrics. I'm really happy to report that, we had our best year since 2013 when it comes to phone net adds, a growth of 28% year-over-year. And again, that is how our team has been working with a new model.","And on the financial side, we continue to see that we had a good wireless service revenue over the year with 3.2% for the full year, which is the highest since 2014. And when it comes to our profitability, our EPS was up 2.1% within 2019 for the full year. And we continue to create strong cash flow, which is of course, giving us the flexibility going forward to see that we can execute on our strategy.","Ultimately, consumer group continued to have a very good year in 2019 with everything they're doing. The Verizon business group have of course the headwinds when it comes to the secular decline in the wireline side, at the same time as we're investing more in that area. We're investing in processes, tools and structures.","And why is that important? It's so important, because this is one of the greatest opportunities for growth for us, when it comes to 5G and how we address the market. And I can tell you during 2019, I met so many large corporations that we now can actually work with, because our offering is so strong when it comes to fiber and 5G. But we need to put that structure in place for the Verizon business group in order for them to actually both execute on the revenue side, but also on the cost side. And that's really what we're focused on.","Ultimately, I think we have created a very strong fundamental for going into 2020. And if you think about our priorities for 2020, first of all, continue to grow on the core business. I mean, we showed this year we can continue to grow 4G and our core businesses and that we'll continue to do in 2020 as well, including building our network to be the best network in this market.","Secondly is leveraging our new assets that we're building. We're building on fiber. We're building our 5G and seeing that we can start leveraging that with our customer. And I think that this year, we'll continue to have a lot of focus on our 5G build and what we're doing in 5G, and we will come back to that later on how we see the 5G market when we will have an Investor Day later in February.","So the third priority in 2020 is around our financials and our discipline there. And the ambition is to accelerate the growth in revenue and EPS in 2020, and continue to create strong cash flow as we did in 2019. But it's also to continue to have the discipline and efficiency in our CapEx and OpEx spend. That's very important, because this is really driving us going forward being able to execute on our strategy.","And the four priorities around our customer centricity and our purpose-driven company, both are very important to engage with all our stakeholders, if it's the society, our employees or customers to have that in our genes in the company every day. Here we will drive a lot around thinking about the customers, giving them optionality as we did in 2019, we will just continue to do that.","And when it comes to our responsibility, to drive a responsible business, we laid out a lot of things in 2019 what we want to do and combine our responsibility of our society with our strategy. We think that is strengthening us as a company to all our stakeholders. And ultimately that will create even more value for all our stakeholders.","So all-in-all, I think we have a really good platform coming into 2020. We are excited for it, and we hope that all of you are excited for 2020 as well.","So by that, I hand over to Matt.","Matt Ellis","Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. We will begin with a review of our consolidated operating and financial results. In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.8 billion, up 1.4%.","Service revenue remains the primary driver of growth driven by volumes and step-ups in access, partially offset by lower wireless equipment revenue. And secular declines in revenue from our wireline products and services, predominantly in our business segment.","At the beginning of the year, we provided consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage revenue growth for 2019. For the year, total revenue grew 0.8% including a 3.1% decline, in wireless equipment revenue.","Adjusted EBITDA was $11.1 billion, as compared to $11.6 billion last year. The headwinds mentioned earlier from the deferral of commission expense. And the lease accounting standard lowered EBITDA by $239 million, which is approximately a 70 basis point impact on EBITDA margin in the quarter.","These results reflect continued strong margin performance in consumer, despite a meaningful increase in volumes. And secular weakness in the wireline portion of the business segment.","Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $47.2 billion. And EBITDA margin was 35.8%, slightly lower than last year's margin of 36.2%. Full year adjusted EBITDA included headwinds of approximately 70 basis points, from the deferral of commission expense, and the lease accounting standard which overshadowed our improved operational performance in 2019.","Through our Business Excellence program, we have realized cumulative cash savings of $5.7 billion and are on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021.","The Voluntary Separation Program resulted in approximately $1.3 billion of expense savings this year. And we have been at our full run rate of savings for the last two quarters of the year.","Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.13, up 0.9% from $1.12 a year ago. We achieved our 2019 goal of low single-digit growth by posting a full year adjusted EPS of $4.81, representing a yearly growth rate of 2.1%, including the $0.17 headwind related to ASC 606 and ASC 842, that Brady mentioned earlier.","Let's now turn to cash flow results on slide 8. We had strong cash flows in 2019, which allowed us to continue our focus on investing in our networks, increasing our dividend for the 13th straight year and strengthen the balance sheet.","The year-over-year increase in CFFO was due to operational improvements and lower discretionary employee benefit contributions, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. And payments related to the Voluntary Separation Program.","Capital expenditures for 2019 totaled $17.9 billion. And well within our guided range of $17 billion to $18 billion. Capital spending for the year was driven primarily by our fiber deployment in 60-plus markets, outside of our ILEC footprint and the build-out of our 5G Ultra Wideband network.","Additionally, we continue to support growth in data and video traffic, on our industry-leading 4G LTE network and the upgrade to our Intelligent Edge Network architecture. Free cash flow for the year was $17.8 billion up, 0.7% year-over-year.","Our balance sheet continued to strengthen with our net unsecured debt down $3.7 billion year-over-year. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio rounds down to 2.0 times versus our targeted range of 1.75 times to 2.0 times.","We remain focused on reducing our secured debt portfolio into our targeted range, while continuing to actively manage our near-term maturities, optimize our overall funding footprint and lower our cost of capital.","As part of this management of the balance sheet, we conducted liability management transactions in the quarter. And throughout the year which will reduce our interest expense going forward.","Now, let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on slide 9. Our Consumer segment entered the fourth quarter with strong momentum. The combination of the new mix and match pricing, attractive device promotions, our award-winning network and the new Disney+ partnership drove continued success in the fourth quarter, Amida Competitive [ph] holiday season.","We are extremely pleased with the early uptake on Disney+ and the ability to partner with an iconic consumer brand and content company, to bring even greater value to our unlimited customers.","As a result, fourth quarter fund gross adds were up 9.3% year-over-year. And postpaid phone net adds were 588,000, up 12.6% year-over-year. Phone churn of 0.83% was up six basis points from a year ago, consistent with our expectations and reflecting the elevated competitive activity across the industry.","A breakdown of our postpaid net additions is provided on this slide. Total postpaid device activations were flat from prior year at 9.5 million, including 7.9 million phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 6.3%, down from 6.6% a year ago, reflecting the continued elongation of the handset upgrade cycle.","Fios Internet net additions of 35,000 were up sequentially and down year-over-year. Our customers see value in our high-quality broadband offering, paired with multiple choices for video, such as Fios TV, YouTube TV and Disney+. Fios Video net losses for the quarter totaled 51,000. Earlier this month we launched Mix & Match on Fios, providing customers with choice, transparency and the opportunity to only pay for the services they want.","Now, let's move to slide 10 to discuss the consumer financial performance. We continue to see growth in consumer operating revenues through our updated service offerings in wireless and Fios which were offset by modest declines in wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in copper-based wireline services.","Consumer operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $24.2 billion and for the full year were $91.1 billion, which were up 2.0% and 1.4% respectively. We are utilizing tools such as pricing and partnerships to add to our value proposition and drive further increases in wireless service revenue and ARPA.","Customers recognize the value of being connected to their best network in order to consume services or operate new devices. As customers require additional data, we seek to drive step-ups to unlimited plans from meter plans, step-ups within unlimited to higher tier plans and increasing connections per account.","Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter was $13.4 billion, a 1.9% increase and $53.8 billion for the full year. We expect to see further subscriber growth, as we continue to effectively compete in the marketplace and from continued migrations to unlimited, as approximately 50% of our customer base is still on meter data plans.","In the fourth quarter, Consumer wireless equipment revenue decreased 2.1%, as pressure from promotional offerings and lower upgrade volumes more than offset the increase in phone gross adds. For the full year, equipment revenue decreased 4.4%, driven primarily by lower upgrade volumes. Consumer Fios revenue remained relatively flat, due primarily to the demand for our broadband offerings offsetting the impact of reductions in video subscribers.","Consumer segment EBITDA margin was 39.9% in the quarter, down 130 basis points from last year, including headwinds of approximately 80 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard. For the full year, EBITDA margins were 44.3%, including headwinds of approximately 85 basis points. The consumer segment demonstrated in 2019 that it can increase customer volumes while continuing to produce strong margins.","Now let's move to our business segment on slide 11. Business wireless trends remained strong throughout the year. Fourth quarter phone gross adds were up 10.5% from the prior year, primarily within small and medium business and public sector, contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 202,000 which were up 54.2% from the prior year. A breakdown of our postpaid net additions is provided on this slide.","Our continued strong customer loyalty across the business segment led to phone churn of 1% in the quarter, which was up 2 basis points sequentially and down 7 basis points over the prior year. Total postpaid device activations in the quarter were up 7.1% over the prior year, while our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5% versus 5.3% in the prior year.","Let's now move to slide 12 to review our business financial performance. Operating revenues for the business segment in the fourth quarter were up approximately 1% over the prior year. Wireless revenue growth of 8.4% was partially offset by wireline product revenue declines. Wireless service revenue grew 7%, driven primarily by small and medium business customers.","From a customer group perspective small and medium business revenue increased 7.9% over the prior year, driven by wireless service revenue growth of more than 11% and double-digit Fios growth, partially offset by ongoing declines in traditional data and voice services.","Global enterprise revenues declined 1.6%, driven by legacy wireline pricing pressure and technology shifts. Public sector and other revenue decreased 1.6%, as growth in wireless products and services was offset by wireline declines. Wholesale revenues declined by 10.6%, driven by price compression and volume declines in legacy wireline products, which we expect to continue.","Business segment EBITDA margin was 20.7% in the quarter, down 260 basis points from last year, including headwinds of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense in the lease accounting standard. The reductions in margins year-over-year are due to the growth in wireless activations, reductions in wireline revenues and the investments we are making in the business, such as the launch of our business-ready marketing campaign and the transformation of our go-to-market processes.","Now, let's move on to slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continued to make good progress in the quarter. Total revenue was $2.1 billion, which was essentially flat versus the prior year, a meaningful improvement from the decline reported at the beginning of the year.","While we have more work to do, we are very pleased with the results and the foundation we are building for future growth. Native advertising and our demand-side platform continued to gain traction, mitigating the ongoing declines in legacy desktop search revenue streams.","Let's now move to slide 14, which reconciles Verizon 2.0 results to our legacy Verizon 1.0 results. As we close out 2019, we are providing a reconciliation to legacy 1.0 results for the last time. The charts on this slide reconcile revenue and EBITDA from our consumer and business segments back to wireless and wireline.","The top chart shows consumer revenues of $24.2 billion in the quarter. After removing consumer wireline and adding back business wireless, we had total wireless revenues of $25.3 billion, with EBITDA margin of 41.0%. The bottom chart shows a similar reconciliation from business to wireline results, starting with business revenue of $8.1 billion and arriving at total wireline revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter, down 4.1% from the prior year.","EBITDA margins were 11.9% down from 17.6% last year. The factors impacting wireline margins are largely the same as those highlighted in the business segment, most notably the ongoing pressure from legacy wireline product revenue declines and the investments to drive future growth. You can find additional detail in our supplemental information included on our website.","Let's now move to slide 15 to discuss the wireless results. Total wireless operating revenues increased 3.5% and to $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by a 2.7% increase in service revenue and benefits from the total mobile protection pricing action taken in the third quarter. The fourth quarter performance was below our targeted range, primarily as a result of higher base optimization into new pricing plans, which we believe is stabilizing and the impact of increased gross adds on our promotional expense that amortized reservice revenue.","For the full year, wireless service revenue grew 3.2%, driven by retail postpaid ARPU growth of 2.5% and a 27.8% increase in phone net adds. Total wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 41.0%. This includes headwinds of approximately 80 basis points, primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard. We are proud of this result, particularly given the strong volumes driven in the quarter.","Continuing the momentum from the third quarter, phone gross adds were up 9.6% to 3.1 million. Postpaid phone net adds for the quarter was 790,000, which were up from 653,000 a year ago, marking our highest fourth quarter phone net add performance in the last six years. Postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter were 969,000, up 11% from the prior year.","Postpaid phone churn of 0.86% was up from 0.82% last year, while total retail postpaid churn of 1.13% was up five basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, we increased customer net accounts by 30,000. Total postpaid device activations were up 1.2%. This was a result of a 6.0% increase in postpaid gross additions from the prior year to 5.1 million, offset by a decrease in our retail postpaid upgrade rate to 6.0% from 6.3% a year ago.","Now let's focus on our outlook for 2020 on slide 16. We exit the year with great momentum, reflected by strong wireless volumes in both our consumer and business segments, which together with our focus on execution positions us for accelerated growth in 2020. For 2020, we expect low to mid single digit percentage growth in consolidated revenue compared to the prior year. Included in this outlook, are continued growth and momentum in wireless service revenue trends within both the consumer and business segments and an expected increase in equipment revenue as we expand the availability and reach of our 5G network.","For the full year, we expect to see adjusted earnings growth of 2% to 4%, driven by recurring service and other revenue growth in both consumer and business as well as ongoing cost initiatives. Adjusted earnings growth includes the impact of deferred commission expense as well as investments within Verizon business group and product development, continued process improvement and new work tools that would not only drive cost savings, but create incremental growth opportunities in areas such as 5G, One Fiber and MEC.","We expect to see cost benefits of this work begin to materialize in the back end of 2020 and increase in 2021 with revenue benefits starting in 2022. We are excited about the future opportunities in our business segment and believe revenue and margins will expand in the future.","Below the line, we expect depreciation and amortization to be similar to 2019. Interest expense is expected to decline due to lower debt balances and the impact of our liability management last year. We expect each quarter in 2020 to be below the fourth quarter 2019 expense level. Adjusted effective tax rate is guided between 23% and 25% in line with the actual results from the prior two years.","We expect consolidated capital spending to be between $17 billion and $18 billion including the expansion of our 5G network in new and existing markets; additional 4G densification to stay ahead of demand and our ongoing fiber build; our capital spending guidance results in our capital intensity continuing within our normal range, although the timing will be higher earlier in the year than last year. In summary, we expect to build on our strong financial performance and are positioned for accelerated growth in 2020.","Now, let's take a look at capital allocation. Our capital allocation process is disciplined and focused. Priorities for the upcoming year remain investing in the business, continuing our commitment to the dividend, and managing our balance sheet to achieve our targeted leverage range.","With our leverage near the high end of the target range and expectations for EBITDA growth and healthy free cash flow in 2020, we are pleased to add share repurchases as a fourth priority of our capital allocation policy.","Repurchases will begin after the priorities have been met including investment in our 5G rollout, potential spectrum purchases and the increased investment in the business segment as highlighted earlier. Our earnings growth outlook for 2020, excludes the benefit from any potential share repurchases.","Summing up, in 2019 we demonstrated that we can improve service revenue and grow the company from a position of strength, which drove increased volumes throughout the year, utilizing updated unlimited offerings, effective promotional strategies and partnerships, positioning the company for sustainable growth.","Our 5G built right strategy offers new opportunities to drive further growth as we continue to strengthen our network leadership. Importantly, we achieved strong results while expanding our industry leading margins as adjusted for accounting impacts during a period, in which additional competitors entered our industry. Though we continue to face challenges within our legacy products and services, we are making strategic investments to drive growth in the coming years.","In addition, we continue to make progress in our media group and we believe we have the necessary assets and appropriate strategy to drive further improvements. Execution is a key focus within Verizon and we remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, delivering on our commitment to strengthen our balance sheet. In short, we entered 2020 with strong momentum poised to deliver growth and innovation.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady, so we can get to your questions.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Matt. Brad, ready to take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead sir.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. The principal variance in your fourth quarter results versus ours and I think most people's expectations was the higher level of spending in the business P&L and it looks it's on the wireline P&L. During your remarks you talked about a step-up investments in the business services segment to drive growth in the future. So I'm assuming that we've already started to see that in the fourth quarter run rate. I guess what I was hoping to get more clarity on is, what precisely are you spending that on? I mean, if I annualize that uptick it's well in excess of $1 billion of incremental OpEx. So I think there's going to be a lot of interest in where you're spending it and how we should expect that payoff to flow through.","And then just the flip side of that is, the annual EPS guidance you gave for this year it looks pretty close to what most people are looking for including us, so there must be an offset and that would imply you're getting better operating leverage somewhere in your wireless business. And so I was hoping you can maybe just walk through where the cost performance and the margin improvement is coming from on wireless as you look into 2020? Thank you.","Hans Vestberg","So, Brett I can start and -- so when it comes to the business group, you're right. I mean, we had already impacts in the fourth quarter on our investment that we're doing in the business group. Matt mentioned some of them.","If I go deeper, I mean as we are now approaching the market with a full portfolio for our enterprise customers, small and medium customers, we need to get all our billing system, all our tools behind CRM et cetera, actually working in a customer dimension. And this hasn't been invested in before and we just need to invest there. And that's why you see also in the guide that you say yourself we're staying basically on your line of expectation. That means that at the end of the year, we will see impact of those investments and then they're going to roll off.","So part of these investments are, of course, one-timers investments we're doing and then it will go away because we just need to fix a couple of things in order to address the market in the right side -- on the right way.","Secondly, the secular decline in wireline business that is continuing. So that is a little bit more sustainable. But that's why in the remarks on that we said also that in 2021, we'll see even more impact of the cost reductions we're doing and then the revenue impact will start gradually coming 2021, 2022 in this side. But all-in-all we're very excited about the opportunities that Verizon business group have, because that's why we started building the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network some three, four years ago in order to actually address this market in the best way and the traction we are seeing with our customers is really good. But on your first question, if there is some impact in the fourth quarter the answer is, yes. Matt anything to add?","Matt Ellis","Yes. Good morning, Brett. Thanks for the question. So we certainly saw the uptick in spending as Hans discussed. We feel very strongly about the opportunities in VBG even more so today than we did when we announced a new operating structure. But some parts of that business haven't been a focus of our investment over the years, so we're excited about the future ahead there. You mentioned a kind of annualized run rate of $1 billion and that's certainly not the number that we have in mind for that investment in 2020. So I think that's significantly overstating where the 2020 number will be. But if you go back to the comments earlier, we did say that we would expect to see an impact on margins in 2020 in line with what we saw in the second half of 2019.","I would expect we'll start to see the benefits of the transformation activities on the cost side of the business around the back end of the year really impacting 2021 in a more significant fashion and then getting into 2022 and beyond on the revenue side. But look we -- I think the underlying thing here is the level of confidence that we have that over time by making these investments, we can grow both revenue and margins within the business segment. So that's what we're focused on.","You also asked about the total margin structure of the company. If you've got this additional cost, the earnings guide would suggest there's some other things offsetting it in the other direction. I think it starts with revenue. When you continue to have strong service revenue growth in both consumer and business on the wireless side and some of the other revenue lines that we mentioned that gives you a good starting point for earnings growth. When you combine that with our ongoing cost activities and then even with the investment we're making in VBG, I would expect to see upside to earnings through the year as a result of that.","Brett Feldman","Thank you.","Brady Connor","Brad, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead, sir.","John Hodulik","Okay. Thanks. Maybe for Matt on service revenue growth came in a little bit lighter than we expected here in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a little bit more detail on sort of the drivers there especially in light of the better-than-expected subs? And it also looked like consumer wholesale wireless revenues were sort of flattish sequentially. Was there any kind of reset this quarter in the sort of wholesale rate, especially given the growth in subscribers in some of your MVNO customers? And then lastly, any commentary looking out to 2020 on service revenue growth year-over-year would be great? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","Thanks, John. Look for service revenue growth in the fourth quarter at 2.7% for wireless as a whole as you say was all below the guide that we had. A couple of reasons for that and both of them actually speak to the value that we're creating with our customers. The first is we actually saw the people who had the opportunity to optimize by moving to the new pricing structure that we launched in August actually moved a little faster than we initially anticipated. And so we think that's actually now complete and behind us earlier than we expected might see a little bit of an impact in the first half of 2020, but certainly got more of it behind us in 2019.","And then the other piece is a little bit of accounting noise in the service revenue line. A number of our -- part of our handset costs from a promo standpoint get capitalized and amortized against service revenue. So when you have the increase in volumes that we had in 3Q and 4Q where we had gross adds we're up around 10% year-over-year in both quarters. What that means is we're starting to see an increase in that promo amortization coming against the service revenue line.","That will be a little bit of a headwind in the first half of 2020 as well until that reaches kind of a plateau level in terms of the impact. But certainly, as you think about service revenue at the end of the year, the trajectory of the business having the net add growth that we had, we feel very strong about another good year of service revenue ahead of us. And as we mentioned, net adds the highest number that we've had for six years. So the wireless business is performing well in both consumer and in business and we expect that to continue.","Hans Vestberg","So I can only add on to Matt that of course this is part of our strategy. I mean, since the launch of unlimited, we have constantly sort of developed our model to see that our customer can enjoy different type of packages in the mix and match, but we also had a very clear strategy. You see that our metered customers can be able to go up to unlimited and that's why we made the move in August. And I mean we see the payoffs here with the net adds. We roughly have today 50-50 metered and unlimited.","So we see that the continuation of putting more value in the packages and seeing that we can actually get the journey for our customer coming into the unlimited is extremely good. And that's as a growth engine for us and you have seen that in the second quarter -- or the second half of 2019. So we have more to do here but I think that the whole team of Ronan Dunne, et cetera they are thinking about this. But also don't forget business side with Tami that have done a really good job with the wireless customers as well.","So, we're really encouraged when we see what we have done in the -- in our offerings and how that has responded well with the market. So, we're happy with what we have seen in the last half year end and give us encouragement for 2020.","John Hodulik","Thank you.","Brady Connor","Brad, ready for the next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead sir.","Philip Cusick","Hi guys. Thanks. You put up a big CapEx number at the end of the year and guided to the similar $17 billion to $18 billion. Can you talk about any shifts within the CapEx priorities for 2020 versus 2019 in terms of either fiber versus wireless mix or any shift within the fiber build in terms of the types of locations or deployments you plan to do? And when should we think about you starting to really monetize that fiber build? Thank you.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you. Yes. As you saw that we had a strong CapEx coming into the fourth quarter, ultimately, I'm really happy about it. You can see that our pace is coming up here quite dramatically in what we're investing in right now. And the interesting thing is of course that since we launched the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, we have constantly found a lot of efficiency in our CapEx build and that of course is giving us possibilities to continue to do more and more.","So, I think that our technology department have no constraints on what they need to do in 2020. This is what they have plans for in order for us to continue to fortify our 4G network to continue with strong additions in the 5G as well as continue with our fiber build.","And when it comes to the monetization of the fiber build, we're already starting to do that. Of course because many of the fibers right now are going to our cell sites on air because that was a part of it. Then of course it has come a little bit later in monetization for our small and medium businesses and enterprise business, et cetera. But clearly we're already now seeing the benefits of doing that.","So, going into 2020, I think we have a very solid capital allocation for our CapEx. Matt and the team have worked with the technology team and we are improving every year how we do this work. And, of course, it's a lot of reallocation inside that 2017 to 2018 and if we go back three years, it's a dramatic change how we spend because of the new design on the network but also the technology evolutions.","Matt Ellis","Yes. Thanks. So, on the monetization of the fiber, as Hans mentioned, it's a multiuse network. But you're already starting to see the impact and I'll give an example. And I think some of our network folks have mentioned this publicly in the past few months.","You go back to the first quarter of last year and the majority of our new cell sites were going up on third-party fiber you get into the fourth quarter of last year in the 60-plus markets that -- where we're adding fiber. It's now -- a significant majority is going up on our own fiber. So, that will have a significant beneficial -- significant benefit on you'd think our expenses going forward.","And then as we continue to go, we'll add other monetization opportunities over the course of the next couple of years. So, I'd say we're already starting to see the benefits of the fiber build in our income statement.","Philip Cusick","Thanks Matt.","Brady Connor","Brad, ready for the next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question from David Barden of Bank of America. Sir, you may go ahead.","David Barden","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two questions if I could. First, just with respect to kind of the back part of the year I think that there's a degree of anxiety about the level of competition that might emerge in the market around 5G and around the possibility of a 5G iPhone launch and how the various carriers are going to market and kind of position themselves as network to go to for it. So, if you could kind of give us a little color on kind of how you see the second half of the year playing out with this potential 5G iPhones' super cycle emerging?","And then the second would be I just wanted to have you guys maybe address there's an organization called Opensignal that has shared some data with the sell-side and others that kind of suggests that there's a handful of markets that Verizon's stressed in terms of their spectrum allocations. And I think that that's raised kind of questions about what Verizon spectrum strategy is a network management strategy is going to be as we kind of bump into some of these limitations. So, I just want to have you guys address that if you could? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","Okay. On the first question there. I mean Ronan Dunne already said in the beginning of the year that we're going to have some 20 5G devices coming out in the market this year. So, of course, we're going to see more 5G devices coming out. It's going to be more build in the markets in 2020 than we had last year. So, of course, this is a year that there is going to be even more 5G things coming in.","When it comes to any particular phones coming out in the market, we cannot really comment on it because that we'll leave to the company to do. But, in general, of course, if this is a market which has a high degree of iOS that means that when a 5G phone will come out from Apple, that will be important for many consumers to look into what they think is a good change.","In our case, I think we're building a unique 5G experience with our millimeter wave that nobody else is building and have the capability to do. So I think that's really where the difference will come. I mean, we already have the best 4G network as you have seen in the latest J.D. Power and RootMetrics. We're going to continue to have that.","So we're going to give the best experience for customers. And we -- and I'm confident that how we are building the network will make a big difference. And that's why we also feel very confident if -- with all these devices coming out, including if the iPhone would come out, that we will have a good chance to actually grab more customers that want to be on our network.","When it comes to the spectrum and all of that, I mean, I think that I might have talked about this so many times. I mean, one thing is of course that we first of all have all the assets to deploy our 5G strategy, when it comes to millimeter wave and using dynamic spectrum sharing be able to nationwide when our customers are ready. So I think that's clear.","I think that another thing that is very clear that spectrum is not the only thing that is needed to do a great network. Think about what I have seen. I worked with 400 carriers around the world in my life. It is a lot of carriers have a lot of spectrum. They don't have a great network. I mean, they don't use it in the right way.","I came to this company, because these companies invest on the world, how to deal with data. Everything from spectrum to how you densify networks and what type of software you put in and that's a long-term planning how to do that right. And I think that's something where you -- or people around us go wrong when I look at us, because think about how we have been performing and many actually thought that we would never sustain an unlimited. And the more, the network is growing we're getting more and more headroom as we're continuing deploying our software and the engineering capabilities we have in the company.","So again, we feel good about the position we have. Of course, as we all know, there might come out the C-band. And we're of course encouraged about the FCC's plan of doing that. We think the C-band is an important spectrum for many reasons. I mean, first of all, it's one of the global spectrums that frequency will be global.","So roaming will be done on it, and that's very important for U.S. market to get into that. And it's very important for Verizon to get into that. So I think -- but it's not hindering our strategy right now to deploy a great 5G network and be able to capture the market on 5G.","David Barden","Thanks so much.","Matt Ellis","Yeah. I'll just add one comment on that David on that piece. I mean, our engineers took a look at that report yesterday and they said there's so much missing in terms of their planning. They have line of sight to meet our needs for many years to come. And so I think, I would put money on our engineering team every day of the week and their track record is second to none. So we're very, very confident that we have the spectrum we need to continue to grow the business.","David Barden","Awesome. Thanks guys.","Brady Connor","Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Sir, you may go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you. Good morning. On spectrum, maybe you could just comment on CBRS. Obviously, there's an auction coming up, how do you see that fitting into your plans? And then on 5G Home, you haven't talked a whole lot about it. With the CPE coming, is that still second half of the year? What are your expectations for what we should see in 2020? Thank you.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you. On the CBRS, as you know, we have already started for quite a long time ago to do trials and see how it works and it works fine. We think it's a good addition to the portfolio that in order to see that we get good customer expectations. So we think CBRS is an important spectrum even though it is sort of more share than anything else, but it's going to be definitely something we're using as it comes out.","Secondly, when it comes to the 5G Home, I mean, you're confirming actually what we have in front of us. The next-generation chipset that goes into the CP for 5G Home will come out. At least the plan right now is in third quarter, which means that commercial product is probably coming out a little bit later because it takes some time from the chipset to the device.","By then we will have of course deployed far more millimeter wave across the country, so we will be able to start launching many more markets when that happens. So that will come back to a little bit more about that when have our Investor Day, the 13th of February talk a little bit more about it. But that's in the grand scheme the plans for 5G Home and that's no different from what we said half a year ago.","Simon Flannery","Okay. Thank you.","Brady Connor","Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Sir, you may go ahead.","Craig Moffett","Hi. Good morning. Can you share any early results? I know it's very early days, but of your mix and match video offer? And it's hard to miss that with your mix and match video offer for Fios that the customer is seemingly far better off to choose the YouTube TV option to save a lot of money. Is that the intention? And why not make the step to say that's our only video offer and you really focus the business on the Fios broadband connectivity where it would seem you have a much better story to tell?","Hans Vestberg","Thank you. I think when it comes to the mix and match, we want to give our customers optionality on top of the broadband. If it's the fiber broadband or if it's the 5G Home broadband, we want to give them optionality. Of course, one optionality is always to have a broadband and having over-the-top services. But another is of course giving the mix and match optionality right now to see that they use the right packages that is more fitted for them.","Still of course, it's what they can choose whatever channels you have because they come in packages. But the early \u2013 or early indication is of course that customers that has been on trial for a month, they clearly see what channels they're using and what package we can suggest for that that is going to be more optimized.","So I think for us we just think about our customers and where the market is going and we want to give them the optionality of actually having different ways they can address the market when it comes to their content consumptions. And I think it's good for our customer experience but it's also good for our customers because all of them can do it.","So as you said, it's a little bit early, but I think that our customers are very happy that we're giving them this optionality. And I think this is of course, what everyone see where the market is going meaning more and more over-the-top content is coming in and you want \u2013 you need thought mixing and matching that. And here we have a great opportunity given our NFL service strategy and we can work with all the type of optionality in the content market as we're not owning any content.","Craig Moffett","Thank you.","Brady Connor","Brad, we are ready for the next question","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Rollins","Hi, good morning. Thanks. A couple of follow up questions. First with the revenue guidance range of low to mid-single-digits for 2020. Can you frame the flex points as to what would drive revenue growth to the higher end of the range relative to the lower end of the range?","And then second with respect to the fiber expansion, can you just also frame for us just the total amount of fiber you're trying to go after over a three to five year period to help us put into context what the current deployment activity means for the company's longer-term goals. Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Mike. So let me start with the revenue guide and unpack that a little bit for you. So as you think about how would you get from 0.8% this year to low to mid-single digits next year, if I go through the individual pieces they're obviously within consumer. It's a continuation of service revenue trajectory that you've seen so far the other revenue line as well.","And then within business, again continuation of those service revenue trends. They're very, very strong. We don't see those slowing down anytime soon. So that will be better. A little bit of improvement on the wireline side within business but nothing significant.","And then even within media, you think about that being down 3% on a full year basis in 2019 but getting back to about flat in the fourth quarter, so less of a headwind of revenue from media in 2020 than 2019.","Within the total number, the 0.8% last year, wireless equipment was negative 3.1%. We don't expect that number to be negative in 2020. But obviously that is the biggest wildcard within the overall revenue guide as we think about it in terms of knowing exactly what we see, primarily in the second half of the year as you get into the holiday season and iconic launches and the like.","But we feel optimistic about the revenue growth going forward here really building on the momentum that we've built across both consumer and business over the course of the past couple of years and feel pretty good about that guide as a result.","Hans Vestberg","On the fiber side, I mean, I think first of all I mean, we said it in \u2013 a couple of times during 2019. We're starting to get on the level of sort of activity per month and quarter right now that we were planning from the beginning. It took us some two years to get out to that pace. The team is really good at it right now. We can get much more scalability around it than the way we're doing it.","Remember also, we always do the trade-off between owning and leasing or sharing with someone and that is a very prudent or financially disciplined way of looking at our deployment. In many cases we see it as owning it has really an advantage for us because of the multiuse of our network.","Now we're doing sites all the time. We're going to create revenue for our business side. So we probably have a couple of years left on doing that. But in general I feel good about the pace we have right now and the multiuse of the fiber we have. And I think this is one of the most critical assets in a network today \u2013 in today's world, especially as we build Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and you want actually to start delivering the 5G experience that we're expecting. We need this fiber to be there. So that's basically where we are with the fiber.","Michael Rollins","Thank you.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Mike. Brad, we are ready for the next question","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Sir, please go ahead.","Tim Horan","Thanks. With 5G I think the coverage is going to be very important also and I think you're using dynamic spectrum selection for that. Can you just talk about how that's going and the timing? And then just kind of further on 5G, maybe just some color on what you're thinking, how much further ahead you are than your peers? And maybe lastly any other use cases that you're seeing talking to either enterprise customers or consumer customers for 5G for both coverage and density? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","Yeah. On the DSS, the dynamic spectrum sharing as you have seen some PR, we're done. We have already gotten this to work from the software point of view. And the majority of our baseband is ready for taking DSS. So what we have said, I'm not going to give you an exact date, but I'm going to tell you, we're going to be ready when we feel the market is ready and our customers need to have that coverage. And again, remember we want to have the best network performance-wise. We don't want to deploy it, because it's called 5G. We want to see that, we actually give a superior performance to our customers. And that's why we think that the millimeter wave what we're doing there is extremely important, because we talked about 10 to 20 times at least more throughput and speed than we have on the 4G network and we still have the best 4G network.","So I think that's what we already assessed. When we meet at the Investor Day, we're going to talk a little bit more about the technology sector. We'll get a little bit more in-depth around that. When it comes to the 5G and where we are I think that you saw last year that we had a strong deployment coming in during 2019, but of course, we have even higher ambitions in 2020. And we will also come back and talk a little bit about \u2013 more about that. But it goes in all three directions in our multipurpose network. It's for the mobility case, for the home case and it's also for the 5G mobile edge compute case, not forgetting that because all three of them are using our multipurpose network. And when it comes to use cases, I can do some of them. But of course, on the mobile edge compute, we see a lot of optimization in factories. We see private \u2013 we see private 5G networks in order to keep the data and the security and the throughput in a facility, if that's a campus whatever that use case has come up very early on.","On the consumer side, I guess, there's sort of a big event coming up here on Sunday. It's called Football, American Football and you're going to see quite a lot on 5G experience there. What we can do with millimeter wave in the stadium, how we can use broadcasting cameras with 5G a lot of new innovation both for the consumer, but also for the distribution of content. With our spectrum positioning, we basically are limited on the uplink when it comes to stadiums, which is the big blocker today in a stadium.","So I think you're going to see quite a lot next, I'd say, four or five days on consumer cases, as well as we will continue to give you more insights to it, the next couple of weeks and when we meet in New York here.","Tim Horan","Thank you.","Brady Connor","Yeah. Thanks, Tim. Brad, we got time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Colby Synesael","Great. Thank you. I actually wanted to talk about the buyback. I was wondering, if you could talk about providing any more color on the potential for timing. You mentioned one of the sensitivities was potential purchases of spectrum. Obviously, we had the CBRS auction, I think in June and then C-band whether it's later this year or maybe early next year. Do those have to have first take place and you have to have a better understanding of ultimately what you spent before you could actually start to do a buyback? Or could you actually end up doing it before?","And then secondly, there's been a lot of debate around your current MVNO relationship with various cable companies and some of your competitors making some comments that they're going to try to go after that. Is there a specific date when that contract expires or anything specific about 2020 that we should be thinking about that could be a catalyst, if you will for the wanting to leave? And how important is it to you to maintain that? Thank you.","Matt Ellis","Hi, Colby, thanks for the question. So on the buyback look it's great to be having this conversation. We're approaching our target leverage had good conversations with the board for quite a while now. As we get closer to the target range what comes next? And so glad to announce that change in the capital allocation model this morning. But as you mentioned, there's a couple of key variables as we think about capital allocation going forward here. And spectrum is the largest one of those. So I don't know, if we need to actually get through the auctions, but having line of sight to exactly when the auctions will be is kind of a key variable.","So we're very supportive of the actions the FCC is taking to try to make as much spectrum available. And as we get a little more clarity hopefully in the near-term future, that will also impact our decision on timing of any buybacks.","But as you think about buybacks, the reason why we're having that conversation is the strong cash flow that we saw last year. Last year, we were at $35.7 billion of CFFO. And even after you back out CapEx and the dividend $7.8 billion left over. And with an expectation of EPS growth, working capital might be a little bit of a wild card, but I would expect to see that free cash flow after dividend number be strong again this year and expect it to be higher on a year-over-year basis. So, it puts us in a great position, where we can make some good decisions going forward here.","Hans Vestberg","On the MNO, so I can -- as we're having it as Service as a Strategy, this is important relationships for us. That's how we want to get monetization better than anybody else on our capital investments and that's why we're building a network. We are managing a multitude of stakeholders and the MNOs are important. It's an ongoing relationship. And we really think its important relationships, so that's us any sort of large enterprises.","We need to see that we have both agile on the technology side and having good conversations with them, but it's no different from another enterprise you would have. So -- and I think it's a win-win for both of us. And hopefully they see equally good value having MNO on top of the best network in the country. At the same time as we see a value over there as well. So, we will continue to be there. And it's hard for me to comment, what my competitors are saying about it. I'm not sure what insights they have. But again, we feel good about our relationship and we will continue to see that we are managing it as any very important customer.","Colby Synesael","Thank you, very much.","Brady Connor","That's all the time we have today. Before I end the call, I'd like to turn it back to Hans for a couple of closing comments real quick.","Hans Vestberg","Okay. I will be brief on this one. I think, we have talked about all the relevant things for Q4, 2019 and 2020 and as I said, we have our Investor Day coming up here in February. So -- but all in all, I reinforce that we did a lot of transformation in 2019. The team and the organization has really responded well to it. That goes all the way from a network change, to our organization change, to our voluntary program branding and all of that went down and at the same time, we've delivered a strong result. And I think we have set us up ourselves for actually continued good role.","We have said that long term we have -- would like to have growth of GDP plus. I think the guide this year is an acceleration compared to '19, which means that the confidence level is going up, what we can do with the core assets we have. And we still sort of have told you where 5G will come in, which is more of 2021. So, we work with assets we have right now, but we build also a great foundation on 5G going forward for the years after.","So, all-in-all, I think the whole team, the executive team and the company feel excited coming into 2020 and that's how I sum it up. Thank you, very much for being on this call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

And welcome to Verizon First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions, following the presentation [Operator Instructions]. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks, Junis. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I am here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides, are available on the Investor Relations Web site. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our Web site.","Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our Web site.","This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our Web site. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Matt goes through our results, I\u2019d like to highlight a few items. For the first quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of the $0.84 per share on a GAAP basis, which included about $0.02 of earnings pressure, primarily related to recent business acquisitions. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I would like to highlight.","Our reported first quarter earnings include a pre-tax early debt redemption charge of about $850 million and a non-cash pre-tax gain on a Spectrum License Transaction of roughly $125 million. The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $435 million or $0.11 per share. Excluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.95 in the first quarter compared to $1.06 a year ago.","Recall that our first quarter 2016 adjusted EPS included $0.10 of earnings related to the three Wireline properties that we sold to Frontier. During the first quarter, we reorganized the customer groups within the Wireline segment. On April 11th, we released unaudited historical results recast for the four customer groups, including Verizon Business Markets, a new group that consist of U.S. based small and medium size businesses, state and local governments and educational institutions.","This new group was formed to increase the focus on these markets. The historical total segment revenues remain unchanged from previously reported results. As a reminder,. we are still subject to the FCC and inclusion rules relate to the Spectrum auction, so we\u2019ll not be able to answer spectrum related questions.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Ellis","Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. As outlined in our earnings call in January, our priorities for 2017 are to leverage our network leadership, retain and grow our high-quality customer base while balancing profitability, enhance ecosystems in Media and Telematics, and drive monetization of these networks and solutions. We are executing against these priorities while positioning the business for the long-term as we progress through 2017.","The first quarter of 2017 proved to be a very active quarter for us; first, we extended our network leadership, as recognized by third party testing results; second, we launched an introductory unlimited wireless data plan to address evolving customers\u2019 demand in a highly competitive environment; third, we realigned our operating themes to enable business agility to deliver new products and next generation services.","Verizon's core strength and the foundation of our future success in a connected world starts with the network, and we have enhanced our track record of U.S. industry leadership. We are consistently investing in our network to extend our leadership in both 4G and 5G. We also closed the acquisition of XO Communications fiber assets in the quarter.","Our uncompromising commitment to our customers led to the launch of an introductory unlimited offering in the quarter. This measured approach in a competitive and highly penetrated wireless phone environment was positively received by both the consumer market and more importantly, our existing customer base. Our competitive unlimited offer, coupled with networks strength and reliability, allows us to attract, retain and grow high-value customer relationships across our entire business.","At the end of the first quarter, we announced the realignments of our operating teams to facilitate organizational agility in wireless and fiber markets to scale and expand our Media and Telematics businesses and to maintain leadership in network reliability and new technology. These changes do not affect our segment reporting. We are confident in our strategy and priorities to provide the best network experience in the U.S., create long lasting customer relationships and identify growth opportunities in new businesses. Executing these strategies will enable us to continues to deliver returns on our investments and drive long-term value for our shareholders.","Let's review the first quarter operating performance at the consolidated level, followed by Wireless and Wireline results, Media and Telematics progress and a network technology update. Now on to slide six. On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and acquisitions in the period, consolidated revenue declined approximately 4.5%. The primary driver was a decrease in wireless service revenue resulting from the migration to the new pricing structures introduced over the past nine months, and the ongoing transition of the base to unsubsidize pricing. These pricing moves have been positively received in the marketplace.","On a consolidated basis, excluding non-operational items, first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.3%, which was slightly higher year-over-year due to steady improvement in operating efficiencies and cost management. Let\u2019s turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide seven.","We are generating substantial cash flows from our operating segments. Cash flow from operations is $1.7 billion, which included discretionary pension contributions of $3.4 billion. Additionally, our ongoing asset-back securitization program provided $1.3 billion in the quarter, which flows through the financing section of the cash flow statement. The discretionary pension contributions are net present value positive on an asset tax basis given the reduction in our variable rate PBGC premiums and the expected net return on planned assets.","As a result of these contributions, our mandatory pension funding through 2020 is expected to be minimal, which will benefit future cash flows and improve the funded status at our qualified pension plan. Also, the rating agencies view debt funded pension contributions as neutral to credit rating metrics.","Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we are investing in our networks. Our capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in the quarter, and we expect capital spending for the year to be within our 2017 guided range. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $116.5 billion of total debt, which was comprised of $110.2 billion of unsecured debt and $6.3 billion of on balance sheet securitizations.","During the quarter, we completed multiple capital market transactions, including new debt issuances to fund the discretionary pension contributions, the acquisition of XO and to pre-fund the acquisition of Yahoo. These transactions included a $3.1 billion tender offer and $9 billion debt exchange, which reduced future cash interest costs and extended maturities. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.","Now, let's move into review to the operating segments, starting with Wireless and the impacts of Unlimited on slide eight. In our Wireless business, we have extended our network leadership position, while balancing operational performance in a competitive environment. Verizon is the U.S. market leader across high-value postpaid phone customers, and we have consistently stated that our top priority is protecting our base to build on our customer relationships into the future.","During the first quarter, we made a disciplined decision to launch an unlimited offering, so let's spend a few minutes on the factors leading to our decision. As discussed on the last earnings call, we launched wireless plans in mid-2016 that offered safety mode and carry over data, reducing overage charges. Since the launch, the U.S. wireless phone market experienced greater competition with unlimited plans from other carriers. We chose to compete using equipment promotions during that time, while we evaluated different service pricing options, including Unlimited. At the start of 2017, competitive intensity escalated, resulted in loss of gross add share and an uptick in churn pressure. So we determine that the timing was right for the introduction of an unlimited option at the high-end of our existing plans.","We are confident in our network capability to efficiently manage the expected usage growth from unlimited, because we have invested in technology, architecture and densification. Our early network performance is consistent with our high-quality of service expectations and within the current network plan. The customer response to the launch was favorable as evidenced by an immediate improvement in subscribe activity in the second half of the quarter.","In the quarter, in which we added 49,000 smartphones, our phone net-adds had two distinct trajectories. Prior to our Unlimited launch, we had retail postpaid phone net losses of 398,000 customers. After the launch, we added 109,000 retail postpaid phone customers, which gives us momentum entering the second quarter. Overall in the first quarter, we lost 307,000 postpaid customers, consisting of phone losses of 289,000 and tablet losses of 255,000 offset by other connected devices.","We introduced the Unlimited offering, primarily to protect our high quality base, and we achieved the desired impact as retail phone churn improved after the launch and was less than 0.9% for the eighth consecutive quarter despite heights and competition in the marketplace. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.15% increased year-over-year due to higher tablet churn, which is expected to remain elevated throughout the year as customers roll-off for free capital promotions from prior years.","Total postpaid device activations were down almost 9% over the year prior, of which about 82% were phones. In a seasonally soft quarter, we had 5.2% of our retail postpaid base upgrade to a new device, down from 5.8% last year. During the quarter, 5.7 million phones were activated on device payment plans. While we may progress in the prepaid market, this remains an area of opportunity for us, as prepaid devices declined by 17,000 in the quarter as compared to a decline of 177,000 in the prior year.","Let's turn to slide nine and take a closer look at Wireless revenue and profitability. Total Wireless operating revenue declined 5.1% in the first quarter. We experienced the change in the service revenue trend, which had been improving sequentially. Service revenue declined 6.1% year-over-year compared to the 4.9% decrease in the previous quarter. The service revenue pressure was a result of decreased overage revenue, lower postpaid customers in the quarter and promotional activity. Overage pressure was primarily related to the ongoing migration to the pricing plans implemented last year and the introduction of Unlimited offerings.","As expected, optimize as we benefit the most from stepping down in price, primarily single line users, were the early adopters of these plans. We believe this revenue trend will persist through the first half of the year, but remain confident that these plans will be up and neutral over-time as more users step-up in price, which has already taken place. New customer accounts added after the unlimited launch on average had higher account access fees. While we absorb overages in the near-term, we expect that the increase in account access fees will replace overages overtime.","Equipment revenue decreased 4.8% in the first quarter. Sequentially, the percentage of phone activations on device payment plans remain steady at approximately 76% in the first quarter compared with about 77% in the fourth quarter. We expect the second quarter device payment plan take rate to remain consistent.","At the end of the quarter, approximately 48% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan, while about 71% were in unsubsidized pricing. Our Wireless EBITDA margin, as a percent of total revenue, was 45.1% which was down due to the service revenue trend and the increased advertising activity associated with the unlimited plan launch.","Let's move next to our Wireline segment on slide 10. At the beginning of February, we completed the acquisition of XO Communications which contributed revenue to enterprise solutions, partner solutions and business markets for about half of the quarter. Excluding XO, Wireline segment revenues maintained recent trends, declining 3.2%. Consumer markets revenue increased 0.7%, which was driven by favorable pricing, partially offset by lower customer demand.","In Fios Internet, we added 35,000 customers for the quarter, over 22% of our broadband customers are in plans with speeds of 100 megabits per second or more. Fios video losses of 13,000 in the quarter were indicative of softer demand from linear video due to the increase in over-the-top offerings, mobile video consumption and competitive promotional offers, particularly in the New York market.","On an organic basis, Enterprise Solutions revenue declined 4.3% in the quarter as a result of pricing pressure in the market. On a constant currency basis, this decline was 3.7%. The customer migration from legacy services, such as voice, to advanced communications product is generating a revenue headwind in the near term, while increasing customer satisfaction and decreasing serving cost over the long term.","Wireline segment EBITDA margin increased to 22.7% for the quarter, up from 19% last year. Tight cost controls plus impact of last year's renegotiated labor contracts improved profitability. We expect full year improvements in margins with seasonal fluctuations throughout the year.","Let's move next to slide 11 to discuss their progress in new businesses. In our Media business, AOL continues to deliver solid seasonal performance with growth in gross revenue. Revenue, net of traffic acquisition costs, decreased about 4% driven by a higher percentage of programmatic advertising. Along with our content assets, AOL\u2019s ADTECH capabilities have enabled us to provide unique content across multiple platforms.","We have assembled video platforms to leverage the growing customer demand for digital media. Our targeted content pillars, focusing on news, sports, finance and lifestyle, are already increasing the viewership. To provide the necessary scale to effectively leverage these assets, we are looking forward to combining AOL and Yahoo and operate in the combined businesses under the Oath brand. We are actively working on integration streams with Yahoo to ensure a smooth consolidation when the transaction closes, which is expected during the second quarter.","Consistent with past quarters, digital video consumption on the go90 app maintained in average data usage of about 30 minutes per viewer with less than 20% to the up-traffic served on the Verizon wireless network. During the quarter, the app was updated to improve the user interface, increase content discovery and enhance the programming and advertising capabilities.","In the Telematics business, we are quickly integrating the Fleetmatics and Telogis acquisitions. With these assets, we are the global market share leader and are looking to expand our offerings in this space. Total Telematics revenue was $214 million in the first quarter. Organically, IoT revenue, including Telematics, was up approximately 17% in the first quarter.","Let's move next to slide 12 to discuss network and technology. We consistently invest in our networks to ensure that overall quality and capacity remains ahead of demand. Capital spending of $3.1 billion in the quarter was largely network related to maintain leadership in our markets. Fiber is a critical component of our network strategy and next generation deployments, as demonstrated by the success of our densification initiative. Earlier this week, we announced the strategic agreement with Corning with whom we have a long-relationship to supply optical fiber and hardware solutions of at least $1.05 billion from 2018 to 2020. This investment ensures that we have adequate supply of fiber.","In the first quarter, LTE data traffic increased 57% over the prior-year. While still early in the cycle, the increased data traffic resulting from Unlimited is in line with our expectations, and network management tools have been effective. We are committed to remain in the largest and most reliable 4G network through technological developments in LTE, deploying small cells and refarming mid-band spectrum. As part of the densification, we are deepening our fiber assets, enhanced by the XO transaction. As previously announced, we are launching 11 pre-commercial 5G fixed wireless pilots during the second quarter and we look forward to sharing the results later in the year.","Let's move next to slide 13 to review our strategy for future growth. Our long-term growth model is to lead in network, expand our customer relationships and develop new businesses in Media and Telematics. While executing on our strategy and positioning for future growth, in the quarter, we listen to our customers evaluated the marketplace and launched an unlimited offering in order to retain and grow our high quality customer relationships.","We realigned our operating teams to increase business agility to deliver new products and next generation services and develop new ecosystems in Media and Telematics in order to monetize the rising data traffic on our network. Overall, we are confident in our strategy and ability to execute and deliver long-term value to our customers, partners and shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.","Michael Stefanski","Thank you, Matt. Junis, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Feldman","Matt, you were talking about fiber, and during his Media appearances this week, Lowell noted that the Company does in fact have a pretty strong interest in adding more fiber to the network. And you've indicated that this could potentially be achieved through M&A. And when noting that hwsaid, yes, there\u2019s never really a perfect fit in terms of architecture. So my question is, what type of architecture are you looking to add to the network that you have today? And is it reasonable to assume that the choice you have to make, if you either do this organically through higher levels of capital investment or to do it inorganically through acquisitions, which could potentially result in the Company operating at higher leverage for longer than we have expected? Thank you.","Matt Ellis","So I think if you look at what Lowell said earlier in the week, as we look at the network and is consistent with all being saying for over a year ago, since we announced the fiber initiative in Boston, that as we look at the networks of the future, they are going to be built with a lot of fiber deep into the network and that network is going to be built for multiuse cases, not for a single use case; so it's going to deliver consumer to the home applications; it's going to deliver small business applications; it's going to light up enterprise buildings; and it's also going to deliver smart cities and IoT solutions too.","So as we think about how you build that network out, you\u2019re going to need fiber that\u2019s not out there today, which is one of the reasons we had the announcement earlier this week to make sure that we have access to the physical fiber as we start to deploy it more in places like Boston around the country. Now as you say, the architecture doesn\u2019t exist today in terms of what we could acquire. So there is options here, we can go out we could build that fiber as we\u2019re doing in Boston. And we also look at every way that we get access to that fiber. That\u2019s what it\u2019s critically about, is getting access to the fiber we need to deliver the solutions that we\u2019re looking to do. And there\u2019s multiple ways we can get that.","So depending on the location that may mean us building the fiber network. If there is great assets already in place and as the opportunity to acquire them at a good price then we would certainly look to do that. And then there is also other ways to work with partners thhrough leasing and other arrangements where we don\u2019t have to build or outright buy. So we will look at all those opportunities as how we get access to that fiber, do we need to build the network of the future and provide the solutions that our customers are going to want as we go forward.","So as you say, we could do that organically and inorganically. We\u2019re very comfortable and confident in the assets we have and adding on to them ourselves. But if the right opportunity came along, we would look at that. And I think we\u2019ve been fairly consistent about dealing that and we\u2019ve also been consistent about the impact on the balance sheet. We believe in a strong balance sheet. But if the right acquisition comes along that allows us to add shareholder values in the long run and it\u2019s the right thing for shareholders and all stakeholders in our business, we would look doing that. But we\u2019d do it in a way that certainly reflected the need to have a strong balance sheet.","Brett Feldman","And just quick follow up. Is it fair to assume that if the choice was do it organically, it does require higher levels of capital investment? Because if the answer is no then I guess the follow up to that one would be, what would ultimately make an acquisition attractive, is it really just speed to market?","Matt Ellis","Yes, there is a number of different assets, aspects to it that would make it attractive; speed to market; the quality of the assets, that\u2019s there; and we look at all those things. But ultimately, if we have to build it ourselves, we\u2019re comfortable doing so. And we think we can do that relatively within our investment plans.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Rollins","Two if I could, one of the net add disclosure around the over 100,000 net adds since the launch of Unlimited. Given the seasonality that exist in the first quarter, can you compare that to year-ago period and give us a sense of how net adds performed since Unlimited, relative to what it was last year over the same timeframe? And then secondly, as you look at building small cells, I was wondering if you could put the fiber deal into context in terms of how many small cell that could give Verizon, and then how long does it take to build that? I know it\u2019s a three year deal that got announced. But what's the pace that investors should be thinking about in terms of how many small cells Verizon can deploy in a 12-month period? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","So I'll start with your first one. We really don\u2019t breakout the quarter typically in terms of the net add numbers, and so. But when you look at year-over-year, what you\u2019re really looking at here is the impact of going to the unlimited. And really given our customers, the functionality that they are looking for and that was a decision we made, and you saw an immediate impact in our business. And we certainly do look at that the month-by-month. And I can tell you that this isn\u2019t a seasonality in the first quarter, the change we saw in the first quarter. But really the 398,000 negative number through the first half and in the positive 109 in the second half, was all about the response to Unlimited as opposed to any significant seasonality in the quarter.","And then in terms of your second question on small cells, so the fiber deal isn\u2019t just about building small cells. Obviously, we will build small cells with this, but there would be other use cases as we go out. So we\u2019re not in a position today that to say the number of small cells that we will light up with this fiber agreement with Corning. I can tell you, we will continue to build the best performing wireless network across the country; and we use small cells, we use the new technologies in LTE; and moving into 5G to do that and this fiber will help us to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Hodulik","Matt, just a couple of questions on for the financials, first on the wireless side. The postpaid was down 5.8%, definitely a change in trend as you mentioned. You talked about the impact Unlimited had and the fact that it being that move happening mid-quarter. Should we expect that trend to worsen from here, or do you think you've gotten most of the -- it's been down out of the way? And then secondly in terms of the guidance, you kept the guidance for the year that you had despite revenues being down 4.5% and earnings being down by 10%. Could you talk a little bit about some of the drivers to getting back to flat on both of those metrics for the year? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","So I\u2019ll start with your first one around wireless revenues and the ARPA decline. So as I look through the quarter, and let's see what happened in the wireless revenues. We have the continuation of the migration of the base to unsubsidized pricing. But in addition to that, what we also saw was a reduction in overage revenues. And this really was as much about the continuation of people migrating to the plans we launched last summer with safety mode and roll over data as it was about Unlimited. We've seen a good amounts of our base already roll-over to those plans where the overage starts to decline.","And as we go forward, we should expect to see that continue in the second quarter and then we expect we\u2019ll see the trend in wireless service revenue starts to improve in the second half of the year. So we do think you'll see another quarter of some pressure in wireless ARPA before we see it head-up again. And look the other piece that\u2019s in the wireless number is when we were down close to 400,000 net adds in the first part of the quarter that's -- those were revenues that we didn\u2019t bare on the second half of the quarter but we saw the reverse in those trends and look forward to that piece continuing.","So on the guide, if I go back to the guide real quickie here, what we said is on organic basis we\u2019ll be fairly consistent. So when you look at the first quarter, a year ago was $1.06 and that included about $0.10 from the assets we sold to Frontier. This year, we had $0.95 and as Mike mentioned, there was about $0.02 of pressure in there from the acquisition. So I think we\u2019re in line there. From a revenue standpoint, they\u2019re down 4.5% from an organic basis year-over-year. As I said, the service revenue we expect to improve and the trajectory in the second half of the year.","The big thing around the revenue for the year is going to be equipment revenue. And as we\u2019ve gone through the unsubsidized pricing, we recognized that equipment revenue at the time of the activation of handset; we\u2019ll see what happens in the back half of the year; we\u2019ll see the new devices that come to market; we\u2019ll see how the holiday season goes, and that will be a key driver of getting to that revenue target.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Simon Flannery","I wonder, Matt, if you could just talk a little bit more believe capital spending for the year; you\u2019ve obviously talked a about densification support, but what range is quite wide; you reiterated that today wireless was quite like this quarter. And so how should we think about mid range low end, high end and the trajectory through the year? And we were certainly getting a lot of questions about your Corning deal, $1 billion is a big contract. But I think Lowell was making the point that that\u2019s consistent with your overall capital spending needs. So is this something where it\u2019s consistent with spending or expecting, or have been doing and continue to do? Or is this a real step up in your fiber spending? Thank you.","Matt Ellis","So on the last question, the Corning deal. And as you say $1 billion over three years, it\u2019s certainly not a small number. But when you look within the overall context of our capital spend, it certainly fits in there. So as we go and build out fiber assets, I think you\u2019ll see us do that within our total capital spend. Yes, you will see us spend more on fiber as we go forward. But historically, you\u2019ve seen moves within our capital spend between different components. So this increase in the fiber spend will be offset by reductions in other areas, and that\u2019s the trend you\u2019re seeing consistently for us.","In terms of capital spend for the year, the first quarter was certainly a lower quarter and we sometime see. But the first quarter is often a low capital spend quarter for us. So that\u2019s about where we expected it to come in. In terms of the guide for the year, it's too early in the year to say exactly we will be in that range, I am confident we\u2019ll be in that range. And as we go through the year, we\u2019ll provide more insights into where we think we\u2019ll end up.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","David Barden","I guess a couple if I could. Just first one, could you be more specific with respect to exactly what XO Communications contributed in revenue and EBITDA terms to the Wireline businesses for the two months that it did in the quarter? And then also Matt it looks like taxes were actually a source of cash this quarter, but we are expecting cash tax outflows for the year. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? And then lastly, just a housekeeping question, I guess based on the comments you made about exit rate for subscriber additions in 1Q. Should we be extrapolating that run rate performance into 2Q and rest of the year? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","So on XO Communication, I wouuld say, you'd see nominal impact at the earnings level from the transaction in the course of the quarter. Your question around cash taxes, what you\u2019re seeing there is that you say, first quarter is typically live from a cash taxes standpoint, just because of the timing of when payments are due. As you go through the year, previously we had said the cash taxes would converge closely with the ETR rate. Because of some of the activity we had in the quarter with the discretionary pension contribution and the liability management activity, with cash taxes we\u2019re now actually come-in in a lower rate than the ETR for the year. So that's an improvement to the cash expectation for the year.","From an exit rate of the first quarter, it\u2019s too soon to say just purely extrapolate that number out. But certainly, we\u2019re very confident that the offering is resonated very strongly with the base; both in terms of improvements in churn and also an uptick in growth that, we continue to see that; the rest of the quarter will play out based off of new devices that hit the market; and then also the competitive response, especially as we head into Mother's Day and the Dads and Grads period in June. But we do look forward to a better trajectory from the business with an offer out there that\u2019s certainly resonating with customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Phil Cusick","One sort of short-one and maybe one longer; first, churn in handsets remains below 0.9%. But it sort of looks like it was up a lot year-over-year, or was the problem in the first six weeks of the year much more gross-add driven and not really a churn problem; and then second, and it sounds like Lowell was not on. But I thought the CNBC interview went really well and explain the fiber densification in 5G plan. But where his Bloomberg comments really, they were confusing, and I think they confused a lot of investors. Were they misconstrued, or did he really open the door on deals like this Disney, CBS and Comcast? And if so, what's changed since he clearly shot down speculation of interest in CBS in December? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","So on the churn question, I think it's, as you say, the first half of the quarter we did see an uptick in churn and then we saw it come back down in the second half with the response to Unlimited. Look, we had a lot of customers in the base who love being on the Verizon network and the performance they get. But certainly managing their data was a pain point, it was another thing to do within their lives. And so they was some interest from the Unlimited functionality and as other people are offering that, we saw some people choose to make that trade off between quality of network, but not having to manage their data.","And so as soon as we went to the Unlimited offering and we gave people the option of not having to make a trade-off, they could have unlimited data and beyond the best network we saw an immediate improvement in the churn number where our base saying this is where we want to be. And we\u2019re certainly seeing that continue as we head into the second quarter.","Now your second question, so okay, there is obviously been a lot over the past 24-hours around this, so let's break this down. Lowell was asked a question in an interview about if a certain company called and wanted to talk, would he take that meeting. And he responded, sure we\u2019d take that meeting. And if emphasis he added on just like if a couple of other companies called, we\u2019d take the same meeting. What this really comes down to and is consistent with what he said on CNBC interview was, we\u2019re looking to how we execute our strategy; we\u2019re confident in executing our strategy organically. But if there is the right opportunity out there to accelerate the strategy inorganically in a way that adds shareholder value, we\u2019re always looking at those opportunities.","But I think the story was a little taken out in context, he was answering a question about, if somebody called would we take a call and would we have a conversation with them. Of course, we would. But we\u2019re also very confident with the assets we have and the plans we have of developing the business in an organic fashion as well and generating shareholder value.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.","Craig Moffett","So I know you\u2019re going to get tired of trying to be asked all the same questions the same way. But if I take your, the big answer that you just gave, describing the situation with respect to M&A. Is that to say that the status quo of your network densification strategy, do you view that as a sufficient solution then? And do you have confidence that that leads Verizon to a network superiority position? And then lastly, if you could just comment on, you talked about the momentum into the second quarter. Could you comment on whether you think the dynamics of the -- as we enter the second quarter, are actually a bit better, spread has moved off of it, some of its most aggressive promotions? Do you think that the competitive intensity has moderated even a little bit, or are we still in that same bad cycle that we were in Q1?","Matt Ellis","So I'll take your first question then. But you mentioned, made a comment there Craig about re-lead in networks superiority, that would imply that at some point we didn\u2019t -- we have given up the lead in network superiority, and that clearly hasn\u2019t happened. You can look at any of the third party results of the testing they do over the past year, and you can see if anything we\u2019ve widen the lead. So network superiority will continue to be at the forefront of what we do. We\u2019re very confident that the customers value that. And we\u2019re very confident that we will lead as we move into 5G; we\u2019ll have that network out there first; have customer offering around that technology out there first; and that will give us an opportunity to work to continue to expand the business, just like we have with previous generations of technology.","In terms of your dynamics in the second quarter in the marketplace, look we will have to wait and see. Right now, we\u2019re very happy with how the customer base is responding to the offers that we have out there. We\u2019ll have to see what the competition does. And we will continue to be competitive in the marketplace, but we will do that in a disciplined fashion. And we\u2019ll see other quarter plays out.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Jennifer Fritzsche","Just on the follow up question that network superiority, that\u2019s true every third party report seems to have Verizon by a widely ahead, but which leads to the question about spectrum. I realized you can't comment on the most recent auction. But can you just talk, Matt in general, how comfortable you are with your spectrum position as you sit now? And then four of the 11 markets, can you comment on what spectrum you\u2019ll be using for that last mile of the 5G?","Matt Ellis","So for the 5G trials that we\u2019re doing, we're using the 28 gigahertz spectrum that we have the right to use as part of the arrangement we have with XO. In terms of your broader question about our spectrum position, we\u2019re very confident in it. Approximately 50% of our current spectrum holdings are delivering our 5G network today, so we have significant opportunity to -- about 4G usages there. We have significant opportunities to continue to grow within the spectrum holdings that we currently have; we\u2019re refarming spectrum as we've talked about for a while; we still have the AWS-3 spectrum; and then on license, we\u2019ll come into the portfolio we go forward to.","In addition to using spectrum though, the way the spectrum is used continues to get more efficient based off of the network architecture and advancements in the technology; LTE advance we've talked a lot about, they continues to be additions to that. And so as we look forward, we\u2019re very confident that we have the spectrum we need to continue to deliver the best-in-class 4G experience.","Jennifer Fritzsche","And Matt, if I may, just one quick follow-up. So nothing you've seen since late February with the usage that's come from Unlimited. It seems like that nothing has changed in terms of the need for more spectrum, its just so be consistent with what your prior comments were.","Matt Ellis","Yes, we obviously saw an uptick in usage, but it was expected. One of the reasons we waited until February to launch Unlimited was we said to oursevels if we're ever going to do Unlimited, we are not going to do it at the expense of the core brand promise, which is the network performance. And so we spend a lot of time in the back half of last year, asking ourselves is the network ready for Unlimited. We did a lot of testing around the network. And so we concluded that the network was ready for that.","What we've seen since we launched from a usage standpoint and it's been in line with our expectations. The other important thing of course is when we launched it, we gave ourselves the opportunity to network manage when a user goes pass 22 gigs, and so that's an important point in managing the network in an unlimited world. And so we\u2019re very comfortable with the experience we've seen so far.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike McCormack","Matt, just maybe a comment on the margin trade-off of the ARPA changes that we've seen lot of promotional activity, and you guys have done some yourself there, that sort of versus the lower volumes that we're seeing out there. And I guess just trying to get a sense for whether or not wireless margins have seen their peak, if you will. And then with respect to the sub losses, Unlimited obviously had a positive impact. But it just seems like network quality is no longer resonating with consumers. I'm just trying to get a sense for how you guys think about differentiating against the peers going forward other just the simple rate card?","Matt Ellis","So on your last comment around network quality resonating, I would say that completely disagree with that statement. We know from talking with our customers that network quality matters that they value the quality of our network. The fact that they have the reliability to get on the network and stay on the network work, no matter what they\u2019re doing or where they are, is tremendously important to them. And that shows up in the churn rate that we have coming in below 0.9% three quarters in a row and certainly, the improvement we saw there post launch. So this narrative that network no longer matters, I think we completely disagree with and I think that shows up in the numbers and the results that we show.","In terms of the margin trade-off I think, look, when you\u2019re looking then to the ARPA decline this is a continuation of decline, because we're breaking apart the service revenue and the handset revenue. When you look at the ARPA number, which is really the billings we give to customer every month that includes the handset billing, that still up year-over-year. So we continue to feel good about that trajectory.","And as you think about our move to Unlimited, we did it in a way where we will added the functionality but it wasn\u2019t a price reduction. We think that this ARPA will be ARPA neutral overtime. We\u2019ll initially seize the impact of optimizes and we\u2019ll also see the impact of reduced overage. But we also have the ability for customers to come on the network on a metered plan and then step up overtime, and even our base is stepping up from some of the lower data buckets to get on Unlimited. So there is some offsets there that we think means that Unlimited is not going to be a reduction in ARPA. And this is why we say when we introduced it, we did show in a disciplined fashion, which is something you should expect to see from us as we go forward and respond to the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Amir Rozwadowski","Just building upon that last question, when you folks originally introduced your outlook for 2017, there was an expectation for a push out in terms of the recovery or the growth of service revenues. Given where we are today, how should we think about the potential drivers for service revenue growth in future periods? You\u2019d originally called the Unlimited plan, introductory. And I am just trying to think about the different moving factors and where we could see that potential opportunity to drive service revenue growth in future, and then I\u2019ve just got one follow up from here.","Matt Ellis","So on the trajectory, we still feel confident that we\u2019ll see an improvement in the wireless trajectory as we go through the year, and a stronger overall result from year-over-year number versus last year. Now, what we will see is in the second quarter we\u2019ll see a continuation of the impact of the optimizations, both through the customers that came onto the Verizon plan last summer and also on Unlimited. But then the back half of the year, we\u2019ll see the trend start to improve and we continue to be confident that we\u2019ll see wireless service revenue get back to positive on a year-over-year basis during 2018.","So I think the big thing as you look there is we continue to keep pricing at the right levels. We have the opportunity to step customers up. And as we more successful in adding customers in the marketplace, as we showed in the back half of the quarter, that gives us the opportunity to move those trends in the right direction.","Amir Rozwadowski","And then one follow up, and to some of the prior commentary you made. You discussed this idea of longer term shareholder value in the event that some opportune inorganic asset comes to market. What parameters do you gauge that shareholder value by? I know you have remained committed to de-levering the balance sheet to those pre-Vodafone levels during the 2018 and 2019 period. I was wondering, is there flexibility around that if the right asset was to present itself, or any color you can provide around that would be most helpful?","Matt Ellis","So I think there has been a little surprise by some comments we\u2019ve made over the past few months around this. And really internally, there was no change in how we view this. We certainly have the target to get back to that leverage ratios and credit metrics as we discussed. But we\u2019ve always believed and maybe it's just because we\u2019ve said it more explicitly over the past few months. But look, if you give me two options; option A is, an opportunity comes up and I say no I can't do it because it mean I couldn\u2019t hit that leverage target; or option B is, I do a transaction that allows me to accelerate the strategy of the Company, improve my competitiveness in the marketplace and do it in a fashion that allows me to improve shareholder value versus the first option.","But it means I have to push out when I get back to those leverage targets, is the right thing to do to do the second option. If it means we push that when we get to those targets because we have a great opportunity, we\u2019re going to do that. There is no change there. But I will say that we continue to be committed to a strong balance sheet, whether or not we have any inorganic activity.","Operator","And your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.","Tim Horan","Matt, it seems like some of your competitors have really been aggressive on splashing OpEx and CapEx, and I know now just had a little bit more time to look at Verizon and what your competitors have done. I guess do you have the ability to do the same thing? And maybe a little color around the reorganization what that kind of mean in terms of expense reductions overtime? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","So I would say they have been talking about these reductions in OpEx over the past year or two. I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about it for more years in that now. We continue to look at and manage the cost of the business down, and I think you see that in results. You certainly can see it clearly in the results in the Wireline segment, for example. So we look at managing OpEx and reducing it, not as a program for a year or two but something we do every year. Every year we have cost reduction targets for each of the business units and they diligently work on those and have a great track record of delivering them.","As I think about CapEx, one of the great things about our business is we produce a significant amount of cash flow that allows us to continue to invest in the business. And we do that so that we position the business to be able to deliver products and offer our customers just for today but as we head into the future, because the nature of the business we\u2019re in, we're always looking at least one to two years out in terms of what we need. So we continue to do that and make sure that we're providing the connectivity solutions that our customers need as we go forward.","However, saying that, we look at how we get -- continue to get more efficient in there. And you will see us continually do that, the cost to add capacity in the network continues to come down and it comes down because of the things our network team has done for many years and how we work with the vendors in the space. So we don\u2019t make as much of a big deal about what we do to manage OpEx and CapEx efficiencies. But I can absolutely guarantee you it's a key focus within the business and we have a great track record of doing that.","In terms of the reorganization, I think look, this is just an opportunity to make sure we stay focused on the key things to us, which is the network and continuing to build the network; not just the network of today but the networks we need going forward; the focus on managing the customer base and growing the base, retaining the base and generating loyalty; and then generating those new businesses, whether that be in the Media Co, Telematics or the broad IoT space. So it was really to make sure the organization is aligned with those strategic goals of the Company.","Michael Stefanski","Thank you for your questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back to Matt for some closing comments.","Matt Ellis","Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. The first quarter showed our ability to compete effectively in a financially disciplined manner. We remain confident in our strategy and priorities, led by investing in our networks, creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model and creating value for our customers and shareholders. We are positioning the Company for long term growth; a key foundational element of our vision of the future is our strong network assets.","Our strong networks will enable us to be at the center of this new connected world of people and things, and give us the opportunity to participate globally in the advancing digital ecosystems. We look forward to the tremendous opportunity to leverage all of our assets, and are confident in our ability to execute our strategy.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks, David. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I\u2019m here with Fran Shammo, our Chief Financial Officer.","As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we\u2019ve posted to our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. ","In terms of our financial results, I\u2019ll point out that there were no special items included in our reported earnings for the third quarter of 2014. Earnings per share of $0.89 compares with adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share in the third quarter of last year, an increase of 15.6%. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 were up 21.6%. Keep in mind that the $2.65 per share a year-to-date result in 2014 does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless from the beginning of the year since the transaction close on February 21.","As previously noted full ownership from January 01, to the date of closing would have represented an additional $0.07 of earnings per share in the first quarter. For purposes of comparability in the Wireline segment, the historical results of the business within the public sector that we sold on July 01 have been reclassified for all periods prior to the sale. These results, which previously were part of global enterprise, have been moved to corporate and other, consistent with how we\u2019ve dealt with divested operations in the past. You can access this reclassified historical information on our website. ","With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Fran.","Fran Shammo","Thanks Mike, good morning everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate the consistency of our performance and our ability to compete effectively and deliver strong operating and financial results. We entered the year with great confidence in our ability to generate strong financial performance in 2014 and our conviction has not changed. We believe that steady and consistent investments in networks and platforms will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth. Our Wireless and Wireline networks will continue to be the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we build our competitive advantage.","The overall industry is very healthy and we continue to see strong customer demand for Wireless and broadband services. U.S. market has set the pace for global broadband infrastructure investments. In Wireless, all four national service providers are investing in 4G networks resulting in continued innovation, 4G device adoption and increase in customer usage. Our competitive position is strong and we\u2019re focused on executing our strategy of providing a compelling value proposition and a great customer experience on the best most reliable network.","In the third quarter, we produced very strong customer growth in Wireless and FiOS and sustained our strong growth trends in terms of revenue and earnings. We pride ourselves on being an \u201cand\u201d company, delivering quality growth and profitability. We continue to stand apart from our peers with very consistent high quality earnings results. We have posted double-digit year-over-year growth in reported and adjusted earnings and earnings per share in 10 of last 11 quarters. ","In Wireless, we had a very strong quarter of high quality connections growth and profitability. Retail postpaid device activations of 11.7 million were up 14.9%. This is higher volume than the fourth quarter last year, when we activated 11.5 million devices. Retail postpaid net adds totaled 1.5 million up 63.5% from last year. Year-to-date postpaid net adds of 3.5 million were up 37.4%, which is roughly 1 million more than a year-ago. ","Our Wireless EBITDA service margin was 49.5%. This is a very strong result given the volume of device activations and the relatively low percentage of customers choosing the Edge program in the quarter. ","In Wireline, we had a strong quarter in FiOS with 162,000 internet and 114,000 video net subscriber addition. Consumer revenues grew 4.5%. As we continue to drive FiOS penetration and customer adoption of our quantum broadband and video products. Our Wireline EBITDA margin remained stable at 23%. Our strong cash generation enables us to consistently invest in our networks for future growth and return value to our shareholders. Through the first nine months of 2014, we have invested $12.6 billion of capital and paid $5.7 billion in dividend. ","In early September, we were pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a 3.8% dividend increase which raises our annual dividend to $2.20 per share. This is the 8th consecutive year that our Board has approved a quarterly dividend increase and the highest percent increase since 2008. ","Now let\u2019s get into the third quarter performance in more detail starting with the consolidated results on Slide 4. On a reported basis total operating revenue grew 4.3% in the third quarter. If we exclude the revenues of the public sector business we divested from the prior period, the comparable growth rate would have been 4.9% from the third quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. ","Our consolidated top-line growth continues to be driven primarily by Wireless and FiOS. In addition to top-line growth, we continue to focus on driving process improvements and cost efficiencies through our Verizon Lean Six-Sigma program. Consolidated EBITDA was $11.1 billion in the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 35%. ","Let\u2019s take a look at our cash flow results on Slide 5. As I have noted in prior quarters, it is important to remember that the transaction to acquire full ownership of Verizon Wireless create a lack of comparability between the current and prior period in our state in the cash flow. The first nine months of 2014, cash flow from operations were $23.2 billion. Additional cash outlays this year included $2.5 billion of incremental cash interest payments and higher cash income taxes of $3.2 billion. In addition, we had $1.5 billion in pension contributions that we did not make in 2013. In spite of these additional cash outlets and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $10.5 billion through the end of September. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.1 billion and were $12.6 billion year-to-date up $817 million or 6.9%. ","We project that capital spending will be around $17 billion for the full year. Our deployment of capital in Wireless has been very consistent throughout the first three quarters of this year. In the third quarter, Wireless CapEx was $2.5 billion and trough nine months totaled $7.8 billion. We are deploying capital to proactively stay ahead of demand and our capital investments continue to focus on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density and deploying spectrum. We have been actively deploying AWS spectrum across our nationwide footprint, and currently have more than 400 markets with AWS or XLTE as we branded it. Our continued deployment of spectrum along with investments in small sales, distributed antenna systems and in building solutions will allow us to build upon our network advantage. ","In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion year-to-date, down $273 million or 6.1%. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. Gross debt of $109.2 billion was down $750 million from last quarter. Our net debt position improved to $102 billion and then net debt to adjusted-EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3 times. ","Now let\u2019s move into the review of the segment, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless strategy is built on making consistent network investments and providing a compelling value proposition to our customers. This value proposition includes customer choice and an excellent service experience on the nation\u2019s most reliable network. Our investment strategy is focused on adding capacity to our network to meet increasing demand, which is driven by 4G device adoption and higher customer usage.","Growth in Wireless revenue and profitability continues to be driven by our high quality retail postpaid customer base, where we continue to see very strong 4G device adoption. As I highlighted earlier, we had another exceptional quarter of smartphone and tablet activations. Customer demand on our network continues to increase at a rapid pace. Our recently announced promotional pricing is designed to provide even greater appeal to our MORE Everything plan which we believe will drive more 4G device adoption and stimulate incremental usage on our more efficient LTE network.","We expect that continued success in driving 4G device activations in the fourth quarter will create profitable growth for us as we enter 2015 and beyond. Total Wireless revenues in the quarter grew to $21.8 billion up 7%. Service revenues grew 4.8%, driven by 4G LTE connections growth and higher usage on our network. The declining rate of service revenue growth is attributable to device mix, price changes and the tradeoff between lower service revenue and higher monthly equipment billings for customers on Verizon Edge.","In the third quarter the percentage of phone activations by customers choosing Edge program was approximately 12%, which was down from about 18% in the second quarter based on recent promotional pricing for Edge, the percentage of phone activations taking the installment plan option could more than double in the fourth quarter. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter and our service EBITDA margin was 49.5%. The EBITDA benefit in the quarter from the Edge program was approximately $115 million.","Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on slide 7. Retail postpaid revenue per account or ARPA grew 3.5% in the quarter; growth in ARPA is a function of device adoption, accounts growth and increased usage. The continued rapid pace of 4G device adoption is improving the quality of our customer accounts. In the third quarter, we added 4.4 million 4G smartphones and 1.1 million 4G tablets to our postpaid connection space. All of the important account metrics are improving. We ended the quarter with a total of 35.4 million postpaid accounts and the number of postpaid connections per account was 2.82, which is an increase of 3.7%. 57% of our accounts are on MORE Everything share data plan. The average data usage in MORE Everything accounts has increased nearly 50% year-over-year. ","I would also point out that since the ARPA metrics is calculated using service revenue, it does not capture the monthly equipment billings from customers on the Edge program. In the third quarter these monthly equipment billings totaled about $285 million and were approximately $533 million year-to-date. ","Let\u2019s take a closer look in connections growth on slide 8. We ended the quarter with 106.2 million total retail connections, our industry leading postpaid connections base top the 100 million mark at 100.1 million and our prepaid connections totaled 6.1 million.","In passing the 100 million postpaid connections milestone, it is worth noting that we\u2019ve added more than 20 million new connections since 2009, representing a compound annual growth rate of around 5%. Postpaid growth has totaled 4.5 million in the quarter up from 4.2 million in the second quarter and 3.7 million a year ago. Year-to-date postpaid gross adds were up 15.1% in terms of the gross add mix in the third quarter 54% were smartphones and about 36% were connected devices primarily tablet. Most of the remaining gross adds were basic phones.","Our retail postpaid churn rate of 1% was 3 basis points higher than the third quarter of last year. As I highlighted earlier, retail postpaid net adds in the quarter totaled 1.5 million compared with 1.4 million in the second quarter and 927,000 a year ago. Our postpaid net add mix in the quarter included 2.3 million new 4G devices. Within that total, 1.2 million were 4G smartphones and 1.1 million were 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds totaled 457,000 which is comparable to 481,000 in the third quarter last year.","Within the postpaid phone category, the 1.2 million new 4G smartphone adds were partially offset by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones. Tablet net adds were more than 1 million for the second consecutive quarter. Tablets provide good growth to increase data consumption, lower churn of the account level and have a lower cost subsidies in the smartphones. We have significant headroom in terms of further penetration as our postpaid tablet base was 6.5 million at the end of the quarter. Further customer adoption of tablets clearly represents an incremental growth opportunity for us. ","Our postpaid upgrade rate was 7.2% in the third quarter. Once again, these were high quality smartphone upgrades either from a basic phone 3G to 4G or 4G to a newer 4G smartphones, about 1.2 million were 18% of smartphone upgrade this quarter were from basic phones, nearly 50% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G which we monetized through higher data usage and lower cost to serve.","You will recall that in the fourth quarter of 2012, we activated 3.1 million 3G iPhones as it was the first time we offered a free apple device to customers signing a new two-year contract. A majority of these customers will be coming off contract this quarter providing us with a unique opportunity to try 4G smartphone adoption, almost all of our retail connections growth in 2014 have been postpaid. The first nine months prepaid net adds were only 5000 compared with 274,000 in 2013, we believe that price sensitive prepaid customers are moving to the postpaid market.","Next, let\u2019s turn to the Slide 9 and take a look at the device activations and our continued progress in driving 4G adoption and usage. As I have highlighted, postpaid device activations were very strong at 11.7 million. During the quarter, we activated 8.9 million smartphones and 1.3 million tablets. Our smartphone penetration at the end of the quarter increased to 77% of total phones. We have 65.4 million smartphones in total and 48.2 million of them are 4G. A year ago, we had 29 million 4G smartphones that we\u2019ve made significant progress in driving 4G penetration and yet we still have a significant opportunity in front of us with more than 17 million 3G smartphones and 20 million basic phones in our connections space.","Beyond smartphones, tablets and other internet devices are contributing to our overall 4G device penetration. At the end of the third quarter, more than 59% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G, up from 38% a year ago. Data and video usage on our network continues to rise. Currently about 79% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. As we handle this increased demand, our network continues to be acknowledged as the performance leader and national studies conducted by widely recognized third party organizations. We have raised our own network standards and our performance continues to get better.","Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting with a review our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the third quarter, consumer revenue growth was 4.5%, making it 9 consecutive quarters of growth in excess of 4%. Mass market which includes small business grew 3.2%. FiOS now represents 76% of consumer revenue and we\u2019re sustaining strong double-digit revenue growth. In the third quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 12.3% driven by customer additions, pricing actions and quantum penetration.","Strong adoption of quantum continued at 57% of our FiOS internet customers described of higher speed ranging from 50 megabytes to 500 megabytes per second. We continue to enrich the customer value proposition and drive investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. In the second quarter, we introduced FiOS quantum TV with enhanced features and functionality in terms of storage, recording capabilities and control of content. In July, we introduced Speed Match, a service upgrade that increases customer upload speeds to match their download speeds. This competitive advantage provides FiOS customers with faster and more consistent upload speeds, which is compelling for social media and gaming activities.","Our focus in FiOS markets is to drive higher penetration by adding quality customers, generating profitable growth in a very competitive market and improving our overall investment returns. In broadband, we added 162,000 net FiOS internet customers in the quarter and now have 6.5 million subscribers representing 40.6% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers in the third quarter were up positive 69,000, up more than 23%. In FiOS video, we added 114,000 net subscribers that we now have 5.5 million subscribers representing 35.5% penetration.","During the quarter, we converted 55,000 customers from copper to fiber bringing our year-to-date total to around 200,000. This network evolution initiative is enabling us to systemically upgrade the network and provide higher quality of service to customer. Beside from the maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customer to purchase FiOS services which resulted in additional recurring revenue. ","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and cover the enterprise and wholesale business. In the enterprise space we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the third quarter, global enterprise revenue declined $155 million or 4.4%. Revenue declines in legacy transport services and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications which were smaller in scale. Strategic services totaled $2.1 billion and grew 1%. This category, as currently defined, includes both the IP layer and application such as data center, cloud, security and managed and professional services. Revenue from services in the IP layer have been impacted by competitive price compression which is offsetting growth in application services. ","In our global wholesale business, quarterly revenues declined $79 million or 4.8%. Healthy demand for Ethernet services in each of last few quarters has offset a larger portion than expected as the revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges. In the third quarter, Wireline operating expenses declined 1.7% and our EBITDA margin was 23%. As we said, we are making progress but are not satisfied. We have more work to do in order to drive improved profitability in this segment. On a year-to-date basis, the Wireline EBITDA margin was up 60 basis points to 23%. From an overall segment perspective, our strategy is to continue scaling our FiOS business and improve the enterprise revenue mix by driving growth in the newer strategic services like cloud and security.","In addition, we believe that process improvements and retooling efforts using Verizon Lean Six-Sigma principle will improve our cost structure and drive operating efficiency, resulting in a stronger Wireline business. ","Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. With three quarters of 2014 behind us, our financial performance has been strong. We continue to deliver high quality double-digit earnings growth and our cash generation is strong, enhanced by full access to all the Wireless cash flows. These cash flows have allowed us to consistently invest in our networks and platforms for future growth and innovation. In addition, we returned value to shareholders with the 3.8% dividend increase. We have a strong market position and that demonstrated the ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. ","Our high quality customer base in Wireless and Wireline continue to be the hallmark of our brand and provides the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. We are also building for the future through our global platforms in video delivery and machine-to-machine. New revenue streams from machine-to-machine in Telematics are beginning to emerge. In the third quarter these revenues were approximately $150 million and totaled more than $400 million through nine months, an increase of more than 40% year-to-date. ","Our strong volume growth in both Wireless and FiOS gives us great confidence heading into the fourth quarter. We continue to target consolidated revenue growth of 4% in 2014. For the full year, our consolidated adjusted-EBITDA margin as well as the Wireless EBITDA service margin results will be dependent on fourth quarter volumes and Edge installment plan take rates. The Wireline EBITDA margin remains on track to expand on a full year basis. ","With that I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions. ","Michael Stefanski","","Thank you, Fran. Before taking questions I would like to remind everyone that we filed an application to participate in the AWS-3 spectrum auction. As a result due to the FCC\u2019s rules, we cannot answer any questions related to the auction or AWS-3 spectrum. David we are now ready to take questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) One moment for the first question. Your first question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","David Barden - Bank of America","","Hey guys thanks for taking the question. So two if I could. First, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit in light of Lowell\u2019s comments in the briefing about his conviction level, confidence level about 4Q. About the Cadence Competition and how you felt you had to respond over the course of the quarter, obviously things started off fairly stable and then we have the T-Mobile promotion followed by the Sprint promotion followed by incremental actions in terms of double data and things like that. So if you kind of give us a sense us to how the quarter trended and what you are seeing that\u2019s giving you the confidence for the rest of the fourth quarter would be helpful. ","And then second Fran, I think that we have got a pretty good understanding that Smartphone customers have been generating roughly double the value of feature phone customers. You are referencing the 4G Smartphone opportunity is beings something incremental to the 3G Smartphone opportunity. If you could put some numbers around that, that would be super helpful. Thank you so much.","Fran Shammo","","Okay, great. Thanks David. So look on the competitive front. I think that the takeaway here is just that we provide an extremely strong quarter from growth perspective and I anticipate you\u2019re going to see that across the industry.","If you look at as I said we see a shift from prepaid to postpaid not necessarily within our base because of high quality and strict requirements we have from a credit perspective. But there is still a lot of growth out there. If you look at just the industry itself I mean you take tablets, you take the video consumption, you look at machine-to-machine and internet of things, I mean all these things are contributing to our growth. If you look at machine-to-machine for us it\u2019s the first time we gave you a revenue number and that\u2019s growing to 40% year-over-year. So it\u2019s more than just about a smartphone customer as I said before if I could I would stop disclosing net adds, it\u2019s all about how we build the base of revenue and how we continue to grow this business into the future.","If you look at the competitive front, there was a lot of movement but it was not unexpected I mean as you go into the fourth quarter, this is normally a very high competitive quarter, it\u2019s a very high volume quarter for ourselves from a holiday perspective but I think if you look at us as we\u2019ve done in the past we look at what the competition is doing, we take a very rational and logical approach to what we\u2019re going to respond to? If you looked at what we did, we responded with some Edge pricing on a promotional basis that quite honestly puts us back into the market given all the moves we were slightly out of the market like if you saw it back in the first quarter of this year we did similar things and we continue to grow and we continue to produce the profitability that\u2019s expected of our shareholders.","So, I think the response you\u2019ve seen is a logical rational response, there will be upcoming promotions I\u2019m sure from everyone as the holiday season gets closer and we have our own plans in place to execute on. So I think from a fourth quarter perspective, you should expect high volume, you should expect from us that our upgrade rate will increase, we have the highest backlog of any previous launch of an iPhone that we have coming into the fourth quarter, which is a high backlog of both new customers and also for upgrades. So I know that our upgrade rate is going to be fairly significant in the fourth quarter as we said on the call here 3.1 million, 2012 3G iPhone customers are waiting to upgrade now as they come out of contracts so that\u2019s a great perspective and that leads me into your second question.","So if you think about some of the data points we have given you from a 3G smartphone customer to a 4G smartphone customer, the first time we\u2019ve told you that within our MORE Everything plan which is for the majority 4G smartphone customers. Their usage pattern is going up 50% year-over-year. If you look at tablets, a tablet customer uses more than the 3G smartphone customer. So if you start taking together with the volume increases and other industries have put out what the usage pattern of video customers are on a 4G LTE network, video is a huge consumption for us and it continues to increase quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year and that\u2019s driving that 50% increase in usage in our 4G base.","So when you combine all of that, every time we can move a customer from a 3G smartphone or a basic phone into our 4G portfolio, their usage and revenue goes up. So it\u2019s a great combination for us. And I\u2019ll end the question that says, again we\u2019re focused on the quality of our base and the quality of our adds to generate our growth.","Michael Stefanski ","","Thank you, David. David will ready for the next question.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan; please go ahead with your question.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","","Hi guys, thanks. Two things one to follow up, Fran something you just said prepaid customers move into the postpaid market is that a good thing or bad thing, do you think these customers offer a similar churn level that pass the credit check. Right? And did they tend to bring their own devices or they taking Edge to the different rate from one feasibility you have and then second there has been a lot of articles written likely on asset sales from you whether that was Wireline assets or towers. Can you give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about that? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","","Thanks Phil. On the prepaid customer move to postpaid look I mean, we\u2019re just looking at the overall industry and where prepaid growth is from a year ago to where it is today and the assumption is that we do we see the prepaid customer moving. If you look at the entry prices now that are on postpaid and this is really around single line not multifamily. But if you look at single line pricing, those price points are pretty darn close to what a prepaid customer would pay on prepaid. So the hurdle is there is a credit check and obviously for Verizon we\u2019ve not changed our credit profile for any of our customers it\u2019s same as it has been for over a year now even when Edge was introduced.","So, again it\u2019s not as favorable to us it was more of where are these customers going and we think they are going to a lower end type entry point which is not unusual. I mean the same thing happened back in the Voice world when Voice became closer to what the prepaid were. So, from a device perspective some is on device but others are also buying up into device. ","As far as the asset sales go, look I\u2019ve nothing to announce today. We said publically that we certainly would entertain a sale of our towers if the terms and conditions were right. And at this point, we don\u2019t have anything there. And as Lowell and I\u2019ve always said, we continue to look at our portfolio for opportunities but it has to be at the right time, the right place, and the right price and so therefore there is really nothing to talk further because there is nothing to announce.","Michael Stefanski ","David next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for taking the question. I just want to maybe a follow-up on the full year margin guidance, it sounds like and correct me if wrong, but it sounds like it\u2019s most sensitive to the Edge take rate and so along those lines in the past you\u2019ve been fairly agnostic or you\u2019ve seen somewhat agnostic as to whether your customers were choosing a subsidy or choosing Edge. I am wondering how you\u2019re changing your thought process, meaning are you trying to achieve desire outcome. You noted that it looks like the take rate could double in the fourth quarter and then just broad levels, is there a breaking point? Meaning if Edge were to see adoption rate above a certain level you probably will have margins that were up and if that was below they probably be down just sort of help us with the modeling exercise?","Fran Shammo ","So look, there is a bunch of factors entering into the fourth quarter here. As I said, we do think that the Edge rate will take an uptick and you\u2019ve probably seen us increasing our advertising around the price points of Edge which is where the rest of the industry has been and advertising around. So we need to be in market with those price points which is why we launched the promotional pricing that you saw. But if you look at the 12% this quarter or the 18% last quarter, you can kind of get a flavor on what the impact is to our bottom line, which is 120 basis points this quarter. I think it was 134 basis points last quarter.","So beyond that I am not going to give any further information on that, but if you think about the Edge take rate at the double then you can kind of extrapolate what that math would be, but then offsetting that will be the upgrades. And at this point, I don\u2019t know where the upgrade will come whether it will be Edge or onto the old subsidy model. Again, we\u2019re very focused on customer choice, we give our customers the choice of the subsidized handset with the higher service pricing or we give them the edge which they pay for the phone over the term, but it gives them the availability to upgrade sooner.","So it is the customer choice and it\u2019s hard for me to identify what that will be. But as I said, Brett, we have a very high volume of backlog on the iPhone. We have a bunch of new phones coming out in the fourth quarter from other manufacturers that are extremely good. So I think we\u2019ll have a great lineup of products. It\u2019s going to be a high volume, highly competitive time of the year and beyond that I\u2019m not going to give any specific guidance to margins but it will certainly be based on those volumes and how those customers come in.","Michael Stefanski ","David next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Fran, you\u2019ve talked about a $17 billion number for CapEx, you're coming towards to the end of the ex-LTE rollout, is there some opportunity for the -- it seems like the growth rate have slowed but some CapEx as a percent of revenues to fall over the coming quarters or are we going to continue keeping at this sort of rate as a percentage of revenues? And the on the Wireline side, a bit of softness in SMB and enterprise, you\u2019ve talked about some of the secular factors, do you detect any change in macro or in the competitive environment or is it just more of the same?","Fran Shammo","So on CapEx, we said we\u2019d be around $17 billion. As we\u2019ve said that coming into this year, we were determined to improve our CapEx to revenue ratio and I believe we will do that on a year-over-year basis. This year we had a much more flatness to our CapEx spending, so if you look at prior year we\u2019ve always had more of a ramp into the back half of the year. You won\u2019t see that this year, so it\u2019s become more level and I do anticipate that we\u2019ll be able to continue to improve on our CapEx-to-revenue ratio. As far as whole dollars go, we set around the $17 billion mark and I\u2019ll give you some more guidance in January, but I don\u2019t anticipate that that will change pretty materially going into the next year. So again, the focus will be to continue to increase that CapEx-to-revenue ratio. ","And then on the Wireline side, first let\u2019s talk about the consumer small business area, so we did have an inflexion point this quarter where we did suffer a 4.1% decline in the small business and some of that was due a year-over-year comparison but some of that due to some onetime things and I think that will come back in line here in the fourth quarter. But we did have a very good strong FiOS quarter at 4.5%. The other thing I would say around FiOS is, if you look at the components of content and our revenue per customer, our revenue per customer is growing nicely and is actually outpacing the cost of content. And this year, if you look at our content cost, we\u2019re around that 2% to 4% growth rate in content.","So from a competitive standpoint that\u2019s an advantage for us to drop more margins to the bottom on our consumer piece and if you look at FiOS, FiOS continues to contribute more and more net income quarter-over-quarter, so that\u2019s a positive. On the Enterprise side, look I think that I feel like I record this every quarter and it does not change. I really don\u2019t see much change in the Enterprise spectrum. If you look at the European market and it\u2019s softening for us and also with the FX impact to some of that softness of where the dollar is. So I think where we have a lot of headwinds right now in Enterprise and I will honestly tell you I don\u2019t see that changing for at least the next couple of quarters at this point in time.","Michael Stefanski ","David next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question. ","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research","","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Fran you referenced that the MORE Everything plans were generating 50% greater usage year-over-year. Is there a way to think about how much revenue that usage is contributing? And how you feel about the ability to monetize the growth in consumption in some of the rate plans have promoted higher usage buckets? Thanks. ","Fran Shammo","","Yeah, thanks Michael. So look, I am not going to give you specific how the revenue increases. I mean you can see that in our ARPA which is growing nicely if you see the sequential improvement in ARPA this quarter. From last quarter it grew to a 161 from 159. So if you look at year-over-year we are up 3.5%. So I think that metrics speaks for itself as how we are monetizing the increased usage. But if you think about this the 4G LTE network is three to four times more efficient than prior network. So I guess I look at it this way, if you back in time and you go back to the voice world. And you go from the beginning of time to where that voice world matured. What happened was the price per minute decreased and usage increased, and the overall industry increased its revenue because of that increase in usage. And I, kind of, look at the data world in the same perspective. You are going to see the price per megabit decreased but the usage is going to outpace that. And at least our Tier pricing structure and the MORE Everything planned. Each time you upgrade you are going to incrementally pay a little bit more for what you use. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s favoring in on the revenue growth. But it\u2019s also coming over very efficient network that does not cost incrementally to produce that increased usage. ","So it\u2019s a good combination to have in efficient network with an ever increasing consumption rate. So I do anticipate that the structure works. I think it\u2019s going to grow, as long as we increase the data bundle usage on a competitive standard basis. I still think though with the increasing usage as we said 50% year-over-year you are still going to see a healthy growth in the revenue on an ARPA basis. So think the combination works. But you will see that megabit or price per megabit decrease with the continued increase in consumption. ","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research","","Thanks. ","Michael Stefanski","","Next question please David?","Operator","","Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your questions. ","John Hodulik - UBS","","Thank you. Fran maybe a quick follow-up to Mike\u2019s question on the service revenue. I mean similar margins there is a lot of moving parts as we look into fourth quarter. But you saw a 100 basis points of service revenue growth deceleration. You are going to be having more Edge come through. Is that the kind of deceleration we should see again in the fourth quarter or does it do all the upgrades sort of offset that. That\u2019s number one. And then number two. Apple obviously recently announced they move to soft SIM card at least for the iPads, the new iPad that they are introducing. Verizon was conspicuously absent from the companies in the U.S. supporting that. Can you give a little color in terms of your position in terms of that new product? Thanks. ","Fran Shammo","","Sure, thanks. So on the service revenue side, look there is a lot of puts and pushes here from a service revenue perspective. So if you go back I mean obviously we had a price change in the first quarter which is working its way through the system as we said before we were not going to reprice our base in one lump sum. We would work on that and address those customers that were a high churn profile, and treat them accordingly which we have done for many many years and we continue to do that. And that puts a pressure on service revenue as we get them into the price plan that\u2019s going to keep them on our network. ","In addition, Edge has an impact here because you are moving service revenue into equipment revenue when we gave you those numbers in the upfront comments of how you should think about that. But that improves the -- if you take those recurring monthly billings on equipment revenue and put them back into the revenue stream that increases the rate of percentage increase that we have and also increases the service revenue growth year-over-year. But look there is some deceleration here as Michael brought up on the last one. As we continue to increase the bundles, this is going to take a little bit of time before people have to take the next step up. But I will tell you this quarter with our NFL agreement and the amount of video consumption we are having. We had one of the best quarters ever of customers stepping up for the next bucket. ","So, again I think all these things factor into it, but Edge will definitely have a deceleration factor on the service revenue. As far as the soft card SIM card with Apple. We have our own SIM card that we are putting in the devices both in our indirect channels and our store channel. So that\u2019s really all that is to be said on that issue. ","John Hodulik - UBS","","Okay, thanks Fran. ","Michal Stefanski","","David next question please?","Operator","","Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. ","Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC","","Hey guys, thanks. Fran could you just hit briefly on the small medium enterprise marketplace. It seems like you have continued weakness what you pointed out. How much of that is technology migration versus the cable competitors starting to move up market a little bit. And then secondly thinking about over the top there is been a lot of stuff in the past couple of weeks and it seems like sort of a building discussion between HBO, CBS. How do you guys think about that? I know bought the Intel OnCue business. When do you get more aggressive there?","Fran Shammo","","Okay, thanks Mike. So look on the enterprise space, I think there is a couple of things here. I mean you do have the Tech Refresh and obviously as they come off legacy and going into IP. I mean the IP has a lower price point. And then also as I said in my opening remarks this IP market is becoming more and more competitive from a pricing perspective. So as what we\u2019re faced with as we have major customers who are renewing coming off 3 and 5 year contracts. Obviously, they\u2019re being reprised back into where the IP market is today which is pretty significantly lower than it was 3 to 5 years ago.","So, you\u2019re having that pricing pressure happen there we\u2019re gaining new business but again it\u2019s coming in at a lower rate and we still have that decline of voice and LB that\u2019s going away and it just can\u2019t offset it. From a strategic services perspective, we\u2019re seeing some good things here we\u2019re also seeing some improvement in the federal space but as you know in this business when you start to improve it could take 6 to 8 months before that revenue comes to be as you implement this new technology. ","So there is some glimmer of hope here as the federal government starts to purchase more but we\u2019re probably not going to see any of that until \u201815 but then again that we\u2019re working against the bunch of headwinds as far as repricing on the IP in the tech refresh. As far as cable and what\u2019s happening in the small business, look I mean, as I said in the previous quarters where we have FiOS and compete in the small business market we\u2019re gaining share. We\u2019re losing share outside of that FiOS footprint in the old copper and I\u2019m not going to be able to compete there with the speed. So that is something that we\u2019re just going to continue to see here into the future around that copper plant. But within FiOS we continue to gain share, we expand where we can to capture more small businesses in that footprint and we capitalize on that but we\u2019ve to remember it\u2019s only in 13 states.","Unidentified Company Representative ","","As far as over the top goes I think that the way I look at this is great for the customer, this is great for the industry this shows that there are new innovative type arrangements that are happening and as we said before we\u2019re having discussions with a lot of content providers around innovative models going forward and I think this sets a lot of space so I think it opens up a lot of doors and it\u2019s something optimistic for the future of the video business.","Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC","","Okay, and just like a quick follow up on the small medium piece of it, do you see cable gaining more capabilities there, or there is still really relegated to the very small customer base?","Fran Shammo ","","Well, when they say that they are moving up my perception of this as we\u2019ve look at small medium business and then even in the medium business we capture medium business as anyone that has a 1,000 or less employees so it\u2019s a pretty different definition of where they\u2019re seeing they\u2019re moving up from versus where we are playing. And again within our enterprise business we\u2019re really focused on the major large enterprise customers and we really deal with that small business which is what we classify as 20 and below employees within our FiOS arena. ","So it is a different spectrum of definition but look they are increasing their capability, they\u2019re having success in that what I would consider small business arena maybe the lower and mid business level but they\u2019ll continue to do what they do and we\u2019ll continue to do what we do.","Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC","","Great, thanks guys.","Michael Stefanski ","","Next question please.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie; please go ahead with your question.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie","","Thanks Fran, can we talk a little bit about your net debt targets? Obviously with the spectrum auction coming up potential assets sales, all of this stuff is going impact your ability to deleverage going forward. Can you talk a little bit about kind of where we should think about net debt at the end of \u201915 and given the lower interest rate environment, does that change your calculus on the amount of leverage you want to leave on the balance sheet?","Fran Shammo","","Thanks Kevin. So, it is what I\u2019ll say because I\u2019m not going to give any guidance of where I think our debt will be in \u201915 at this point but today where we stand is as you see where we\u2019re at net debt of $102 billion with our gross debt at $109.2 billion, we have a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.3 and the gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5. I\u2019ll reference you back to S&P report that came out like maybe a month ago on some projections around what they thought, we would spend in the future for auctions and also how much debt that they think that we would pay down and report was extremely optimistic and said that they could see us being upgraded within the 12 to 24 month period of time as things continue. So, I think we are right on track with where we said we would be when we close on the Vodafone deal I said that, we wanted to get back to A minus rating within 4 to 5 years, the S&P report shows that, that could be accelerated based on our performance here. We are generating strong cash flow and what I would tell you is we\u2019re in a great position to execute on the strategic initiative that we need to execute on but we\u2019ll have more to say on this as we close out this year and come to our call in January.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie","","And just quickly on FiOS, we\u2019ve seen a last few years significant price hikes which as you indicated is more than offset programming cost increases kind of as you look at the \u201915, should we expect more of that and can you too have revenue growth outpace cost inflation on the FiOS side?","Fran Shammo","Yes, so I will guidance next call on where we think FiOS growth rate will be but here is what I\u2019ll say is, last year we did our price increases in the fourth quarter we\u2019re doing that again this year to be ready to absorb the content cost that always happen on January 01, so that\u2019s something that you should anticipate and you will see.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie","Thanks.","Michael Stefanski","","Next question please.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","Fran, just building on Mike\u2019s prior question on the recent developments around over-the-top and unbundling, it seems as though you feel pretty comfortable around the opportunity particularly giving you investment in fiber and delivering from these high bandwidth capabilities to you customer. I was wondering if you think about the competitive landscape and developments like this, does it strengthen your view on the diminishing ability for competitive direct video services like satellite technology to compete, and what seems to be an increasing on-demand and OTT world? ","And then I guess secondly, if we think about the opportunity on the Wireless side, you folks have made a number of tuck-in acquisitions around content distribution and I was wondering how we should think about and obviously there is the relationship with the NFL, how we should think about the opportunities on that front? And when we could start to see some either material adoption from customers or sort of some of these new revenue streams come to fruition? Thanks a lot.","Fran Shammo","So a couple of thoughts here Amir, so number one is when I look at the, quote, over-the-top type of video area, I mean there is two avenues there is the over-the-top into the home and there is the over-the-top via Wireless. And I think over-the-top via Wireless you\u2019re already starting to see that with agreements like the NFL and some other things. I also think that with the technology of multicast coming, this will certainly open up doors for more of that content to be delivered over-the-top via the Wireless network because multicast is so efficient in delivering a programming type service over the LTE network. But of course that will be major around more live events concerts, sports those types of things.","As far as over-the-top into the broadband home, I think that what this says is that the content providers there have realized that there is a whole population out there that do not subscribe the satellite TV or linear TV and they\u2019re trying to penetrate that millennial base that does not have these types of offers and wants something smaller, more convenient for them. And as I said, I think this brings in a lot of innovative type models of how to really attack some of these other segments of the marketplace that don\u2019t have that type of service. Do I think in the near-term, this is going to decrease linear TV or satellite TV? No, I don\u2019t. But I think it\u2019s another avenue of how we open up the ecosystem with innovative models and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re very-very interested in especially around Wireless and even as we go out into more of the broadband type market.","Michael Stefanski","David next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with question.","Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo","Fran, I realized you can\u2019t talk about the AWS-3 Auction, but I wanted to explore the broadcast auction, last time we\u2019ve heard from you, you said there you needed to know more about the rules to kind of express your enthusiasm. We know little bit more today, I just wanted kind of take your pulse on what your thoughts are as we look at it today?","Fran Shammo","Yes, so Jennifer unfortunately, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not actually allowed to -- my lawyers have told me I am not allowed to answer any type of spectrum questions, and at this point, it\u2019s still far in the future and we\u2019re focused on the current one. So I think at this point, I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo","Got it, if I could just explore just an M2M question then.","Fran Shammo","Sure.","Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo","Obviously, great growth there, you\u2019ve guided or talked about 40% growth year-over-year. Do you think we\u2019re the point we\u2019re kind of seeing this near move or we\u2019ve often then dream for or is this the year really accelerating \u201814, \u201915 rather?","Fran Shammo","Well, I think that as we try to allude over the last couple of quarters, we gave you growth rate this quarter. We\u2019re giving you revenue numbers and we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward. As I said before, this is not necessarily about how many connections I put on the network. This is about how many of those connections actually pay revenue when we earn money. And so as you know we stopped this closing connection a while ago. But I will tell you that the connection growth is ever increasing here. There is a lot of avenues that are being open up around Internet of Things, around healthcare, around energy management fleet. So you can go through all the verticals and there is some many solutions that are coming to forbear, which is why over -- I guess now a year and half ago, we opened up our second innovation center out in Palo Alto.","So this is something that we\u2019re very-very focused on, I think there is a lot of good opportunity here and this will certainly be a driver of growth for the entire industry. The other thing I think that separates us apart from our competition is obviously with our Hughes acquisition. We play an another tower that no one else plays, I mean everybody is playing today in the connectivity tower, but with our Hughes acquisition, we\u2019re actually playing in the customer service and concierge tower as well and being able to deliver some of that big data and looking at ways to monetize some of that data to our end customers who are really business customers, who are looking at business-to-business versus business-to-consumers. So this is just another area, I think of growth for the industry and obviously we\u2019re capable to capitalize on that.","Michael Stefanski","David, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","And you last question today comes from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners","I got a question on LTE broadcast, I just wanted to get an update on where we were and understand whether sort of implementation go forward as about technology or is it about content? And then Fran, you\u2019ve made some interesting comments about sort of the growth of video within the date consumption packages that you currently have. And I\u2019m wondering if you looked at what amount of that video could ultimately be sent out over LTE broadcast and potential implications to margins? Thanks.","Fran Shammo ","","Sure, thanks Jonathan. So look, LTE multicast, the network was ready in August of this past year so we have to build out the network to be able to handle multicast as you know we demonstrated it back in January with the Super Bowl where the network is capable, the chipsets are now being implemented into most of the devices that are coming out in the fourth quarter, some phones in the third quarter have those chipsets but most will have it in the fourth quarter not all.","So look, the way I look at this ecosystem is that\u2019s going to us about a year before those chipsets ramp and there we have some volume there which gets the attention of the content provider. But as I said before having a lot of great conversations with content providers they\u2019re excited about it but again they want to see how many customers actually have the capability to use that technology and I think that will be a year away but I think that opens up a lot of new avenues for us. I don\u2019t know yet what the -- how the ecosystem will generate revenue on this, is it a revenue share model, is it an advertising model, this is a consumer pay model, we\u2019re not sure yet of how the ecosystem will play itself out and I think that will come within the next year. The other critical piece here is that for the first time coming in the fourth quarter we\u2019ll have an independent third party to be tell the content providers who actually watches their shows on a mobile handset which has never been able to be done before other than from the carriers. So I think this does again open up some of that ecosystem.","So, from that perspective I think we\u2019re really in good shape from an ecosystem perspective and as far as the bundling goes and the usage goes again what the way to see how this multicast technology comes to market and how it\u2019s capitalized on it.","Michael Stefanski","","Alright, thank you but before we end the call I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Fran for few closing remarks.","Fran Shammo","","Thanks Mike and thanks everyone for joining us today. Here is my closing comments I guess I\u2019d say look, we had another strong quarter of operating and financial results, we count ourselves on a quality base and a quality addition. We count on the quality of our network and driving top line growth and profitability. By focusing on execution around the assets we already have in place we\u2019re delivering consistent high quality earnings and returning value to our shareholders. At the same time we\u2019re developing new products and services in the areas of video delivery, over the top, machine-to-machine for future growth and profitability. We have great confidence in our ability to execute on our strategy and grow the business profitably while making the necessary capital investments to position us for the future. Thank you everyone for joining us today and have a great day.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today.

At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with Lowe McAdam , our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Hans Vestberg, our incoming Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials which we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before I turn the call over to Low for his remarks, let me start with a walk through of the second quarter consolidated earnings on Slide 3. For the second quarter of 2018 we reported earnings of $1 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings this quarter included charge for product realignment of $658 million, mainly related to the discontinuation of the go90 platform and associated content. Severance charges of $339 million, and acquisition integration related charges of $120 million primarily consisting of costs pertaining to Oath. The net impact of these items after-tax was approximately $0.9 billion or $0.20 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard adjusted earnings per share was $0.99 in the second quarter compared to $0.96 a year ago. On a comparable basis adjusted earnings per share before the impacts of tax reform and revenue recognition were up 3.1% year-over-year.","Let's now turn to Slide 4. Consistent with the approach we established last quarter we have provided a table that illustrates the ongoing effects from the adoption of the revenue recognition standard on our financial results. As a reminder, the adoption of the revenue recognition standard results in a reduction of the wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue, as well as the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. The impact from this change has been fairly consistent throughout the first two quarters of 2018. On a year-to-date basis, the cumulative impact of revenue recognition was $0.14 per share. For the full year we expect the impact of earnings per share to be between $0.27 and $0.31. The accretive benefit to operating income in 2018 is expected to moderate in 2019 and then become insignificant in 2020 as the timing impacts to revenue and commission costs converge. But the remainder of this call, financial results will exclude the impact of this accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods unless otherwise noted.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Lowe.","Lowell McAdam","Thank you, Brady and good morning everyone. This is the last time I'll have to discuss Verizon results with you so I'd like to take a minute and offer some perspective after serving as Verizon CEO for the past seven years.","When I first took over from Ivan in 2011, the company was well positioned for the future. We were leading the charge in the wireless industry by pushing the ecosystem and driving new user experiences with our robust launch of 4G LTE service. We were growing our fiber to the home business, Fios, and expanding penetration in highly competitive markets. The company had a strong balance sheet and financial profile so that we had the flexibility to execute whatever strategy we chose.","If I look at where we are today, once again the company is well positioned for the future. Our financial and operating results for the first half of 2018 are strong as evidenced by our service revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. Verizon has 100% ownership of our wireless business and it's industry-leading network and customer base. We have driven the 5G ecosystem by pushing the industry to adopt the next-generation several years ahead of original expectations. And we are positioned to be the clear leader in the deployment of 5G services based on our technological expertise, asset base, engineering talent and spectrum portfolio. This leadership position is attracting opportunities in areas such as over-the-top TV, smart cities, transportation, education and healthcare; just to name a few.","I believe the impact of 5G on consumers will be much bigger than any previous generation but the biggest impact will be on businesses as we provide the platform for the fourth industrial revolution. We know the consumer requires a mobile first digital information experience, and the new businesses that we have added such as Oath and our IoT platforms are poised to be at the forefront of enhancing our ability to meet this growing customer demand. Our Fios business and our recent one fiber expansion have proven that fiber-based network solutions will continue to be in high demand and can take significant share in mature markets. The cornerstone of our strategy will always be network leadership and customer experience.","Verizon has an outstanding leadership team, a unique portfolio of assets, solid financial profile and a strong balance sheet that enables us to deliver on the promise of the digital world. I'm also pleased to mention our recently announced tentative agreement with our unions to extend our labor contracts through August 2023; this will give all of our employees the ability to focus on our customers and execute our strategies without disruption. One of my least fond memories as CEO was a strike five days after taking over; I'm glad Hans won't share that experience.","What Brady didn't tell you when he started the call this morning is that the four of us are in Houston, Texas; it's an honor for us to be in Houston today to talk about our second quarter results, spend valuable time with our employees in the area and celebrate the quality of our customers in this great city. We have an excellent relationship with the city, with Mayor Turner, and with the greater Houston area, and we are very proud of our overall customer experience, network performance and community involvement, especially during some of the hardest times like Hurricane Harvey.","Verizon and the nation's best wireless network worked tirelessly to provide customers, loved ones, and first responders with an unparalleled level of reliability and quality when it matters the most. It is with great pleasure that we announce here today Houston as the third of our four initial commercial launch markets for our 5G residential broadband service that will be rolled out later this year. This is an exciting time for our company and the industry; I couldn't be more pleased with the progress that Verizon is making and our recent appointment of Hans Vestberg as CEO solidifies the leadership of this great company for years to come.","As I've said before, I'm confident that Hans is the right person to bring Verizon and into it's next chapter and he is the energizing force we need to position Verizon to lead the upcoming fourth industrial revolution. Matt will now take you through the details of our second quarter financial results which highlight the strength of Verizon. Hans will then outline our strategic priorities and talk about the opportunities that lie ahead.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks Lowe, and thank you for the many years of leadership and the support and encouragement you have provided to all of us.","I'd like to start by reviewing the consolidated results on Slide 6. Consolidated revenue was $32.2 billion on a reported basis including the impacts of revenue recognition. Excluding the impact of Oath and divested businesses, consolidated revenue is $30.2 billion, an increase of approximately 2.6%. The wireless business continues to be the primary driver of growth generating solid service revenue results. On a GAAP reported basis, we are expecting low to mid-single digit percentage consolidated revenue growth for the full year. The update of full year revenue guidance is due to better than expected equipment revenue trends.","Excluding special items, second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.6%, down from the prior year's margin of 36.5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.2 billion due to service revenue performance and as we continue to drive operational efficiencies across the business. Strong revenue momentum and solid margin performance keep us on-track to achieve low single digit percentage growth and adjusted EPS in 2018 before the net impact of tax reform and revenue recognition. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year of 2018 to be at the low end of our guided range of 24% to 26%.","Let's now focus on cash flow results and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Our business segments are generating substantial cash flows. During the second quarter of 2018 cash flow from operating activities totaled $9.8 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion from the prior year and $3.1 billion sequentially; this was driven by strong results from the business, benefits from tax reform, and the completion of the transition to on balance sheet financing of our device payment plan receivables. But the second quarter -- capital spending was $3.3 billion bringing the year-to-date spend to $7.8 billion. We currently expect capital expenditures for the full year to be closer to the lower end of our guided range of $17 billion to $17.8 billion driven by efficiencies from our business excellence initiatives and CapEx management process, as well as the Intelligent Edge Network design. 2018 capital expenditures include deploying 5G for both, residential broadband and mobility launches.","Free cash flow totaled $6.5 billion in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with $114.6 billion of total debt which was comprised of $106 billion from secured debt and $8.6 billion of secured debt. As we stated at the beginning of the year, we intend to use the majority of the benefits from tax reform in 2018 to strengthen the balance sheet. We began to realize these benefits during the second quarter and our total debt balance declined by $4.4 billion sequentially. Our capital allocation methodology remains consistent focused on having a strong balance sheet with improving credit metrics while continuing to invest in our businesses and returning value to our shareholders.","Now let's move on to reviews of the operating segments starting with wireless on Slide 8. Total wireless operating revenue increased 4.7% to $22.3 billion in the second quarter. Service revenue continues to generate strong results producing a 2.5% increase excluding the impact of revenue recognition driven by customer step-ups to higher access plans and increases in the average connections per account. Sequentially, service revenue increased by 1.5%. On a reported basis including the impact from revenue recognition, service revenue increased by 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. Customer migration to unsubsidized pricing continues to approach a steady state, currently at 82% for the quarter as compared to 75% a year ago, and 81% in the first quarter.","In the second quarter equipment revenue increased 6.8% driven by higher priced handsets more than offsetting a reduction in activation volumes. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone base had an outstanding device payment plan at the end of the quarter consistent with the prior year. Our wireless EBITDA was $10.3 billion in the second quarter which represents an increase of 5.5%. As a percent of total revenue EBITDA margin was 46.2%, up from 45.8% a year ago and was relatively flat on a sequential basis.","Let's now turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. Wireless continues to deliver solid results driven by the quality of our network experience and strong customer retention. In the second quarter net phone additions were 199,000 including 398,000 smartphones, postpaid net adds totaled 531,000 including tablet net losses of 37,000 offset by 369,000 other connected devices led by wearable's. Our postpaid phone churn of 0.75% is a result of our compelling customer experience on the nation's best network. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of customer retention at 0.80% or better. Total retail postpaid churn of 0.97% was slightly up compared to 0.94% in the prior year.","In the quarter, postpaid device activations were 4.6% lower than the prior year of which about 80% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.0% as compared to 5.6% a year ago. During the quarter, 5.8 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Prepaid activity in the quarter reflected a total net loss of 236,000 devices compared to 19,000 prepaid net adds in the prior year. 150,000 of the prepaid losses in the quarter were basic phones.","Now let's move to our wireline segment on Slide 10. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.4% from the quarter due to ongoing secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition, partially offset by growth from our high quality fiber-based products. Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.4% driven by legacy core declines partially offset by Fios growth. Fios consumer revenue increased by 1.7% primarily due to our broadband offerings. In Fios we added 43,000 internet customers and had video losses of 37,000 in the quarter. Internet ads were driven by strong demand as customers value their broadband connection more than ever before. Video results continue to face macro pressures from chord-cutting [ph].","Enterprise Solutions revenue decreased 4.2% from the quarter driven by declines in legacy services partially offset by growth in our fiber-based products. On a constant currency basis, revenue is down 5.1%. Partner Solutions revenue declined 2.8%, the increasing customer demand for fiber access is a growth opportunity for this business and is mitigating declines in copper-based products. Within business markets revenue decreased 7.4% mainly due to reductions in CPE sales and ongoing headwinds from legacy services. Fiber-based products continue to grow and are becoming a more significant component of recurring revenue. Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 19.6% excluding the impacts of revenue recognition. Price compression on legacy products, secular trends and increasing content cost continue to pressure wireline margin performance. Excluding the impact from revenue recognition we expect margins to be around 20% for the near-term.","Let's now move on to Slide 11 to discuss our Media and IoT businesses. During the second quarter the Oath team continue to build out and operationalize it's content strategy and make progress towards the integration of Ad products into one interlinked cross platform and cross device solution. As we highlighted on our last call, the video platform became integrated in the first quarter. During the second quarter, half of the demand side platform for Ad inventory was integrated and Oath is on-track to complete integrating the remaining components of the platform within the second half of the year. We expect to see momentum build after advertisers and content owners have the ability to come to us on a single platform. For the second quarter Oath revenue is $1.9 billion which was relatively flat on a sequential basis. In our telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $241 million. Total IoT revenue including Verizon Connect was up approximately 13%.","Let's now move to Slide 12 to summarize our second quarter results. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results and our business is well positioned for growth into the future. Consolidated revenue growth was led by wireless service revenue turning positive, inclusive of the headwinds from revenue recognition. Our unlimited offerings are evolving to provide a new level of flexibility enabling people to customize their experience on the nation's best network. Churn rates remain low signaling excellent customer satisfaction and retention of the nation's best wireless customer base.","Last year we announced our goal to drive $10 billion in cumulative cash savings throughout the business over a four year period. Our business excellence initiative which includes zero-based budgeting is off to a solid start in 2018, it has yielded approximately $500 million of cumulative cash savings on a year-to-date basis. Most of the incremental cash savings realized in the second quarter related to network activities and are reflected in the lower total capital spend. The program remains on-track to deliver against our goals over the four year period. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased year-over-year driven by the strength of our revenue performance and operational efficiencies realized across the business.","Finally, we are making significant strides in honoring our commitment to strengthen the balance sheet. We substantially reduced net debt within the quarter and the business is generating strong cash flows as we prepare for the upcoming launch of 5G.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to discuss our strategic priorities.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you, Matt and good morning everyone. First, let me say that it's a great honor to be named successor to Lowell, and I'm humbled by the opportunity to lead this great company. I'm looking forward to being part of leading the digitalization era into the more technology advanced market in the world which will have significantly positive impact on consumers, industries and our society for decades to come.","During my tenure with your Verizon I've been actively involved in setting the strategy and priorities for the company alongside Lowell, the board, and the rest of the leadership team. We have a laid our focus on execution on the fundamentals, we're positioning the business of future growth, maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation, and driving sustainable financial performance for long-term value creation. We remain committed to announcing our network leadership position, strengthening our customer relationship, and driving efficiencies throughout the business. Verizon has assets in place to develop and provide the most advanced next-generation network which we called Verizon's Intelligent Edge Network. We are positioned for growth in the current generation and we are leading the way to fully capture the significant opportunity that lies ahead in the transition to the fifth generation of wireless services.","We continue to be the clear leader in 4G performance driving further innovation, growth opportunities and implementing new network capabilities that will further enhance our customer's experience. We have made the strategic invest in millimeter way [ph], spectrum that enable ultra-wideband 5G services. Our fiber [indiscernible] would build out on the way in over 50 markets outside of our higher ILEC footprint that will allow us to take full advantage of the many used cases that will come to bear in 5G. Our Intelligent Edge Network design allows us to realize significant efficiencies by utilizing common infrastructure [ph] in the core and providing flexibility at the edge of the network to meet customer requirements. Our Oath and IoT assets will provide a platform for us to participate in the use cases that 5G will enable. We're rapidly approaching the launch of our first use case for 5G with a roll-up of residential broadband services. As you know, Sacramento and Los Angeles are two of four initial commercial launch market and you heard Lowell earlier announce Houston few minutes ago. News and updates on our full [ph] market will be provided soon.","Residential broadband is here the first of many use cases for 5G that will be deployed on our multi-use network. Progress is well on the way across all of the use cases and we remain focused on providing 5G mobility in 2019. I'm super-excited for the future, we're on the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution and we have the assets in place to take full advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead.","Now I will turn the call back over to Brady so we can get to your questions.","Brady Connor","Thank you, Hans. Brad, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.","John Hodulik","Lowe, first I'd like to say congrats on your retirement and your career at Verizon, it's been really -- I've really enjoyed working with you over the years. And also quickly for Hans, it will be great working with you as you take the reins going forward. So Lowe, during your tenure as CEO you've really -- Verizon has really stuck to it's core competency of wireless network leadership while other companies have moved to diversify into adjacent areas. How confident are you that this is the right path? And as we look ahead to 5G deployment and adoption, do you believe that Verizon can sort of widen the gap and create a sustainable advantage versus other carriers [ph]? Thanks.","Lowell McAdam","I think your strategy is based on the assets that you have in your portfolio and where you think you can go with a high degree of success. We talk about competing to win, we don't want to play to play, we want to play to win. We've looked at the things that we've done, network leadership is at the core, it's part of the values of the company, every individual here is proud of what we do on network leadership; and we've stayed close to that core, branching out though into things like Verizon Connect and Oath is a very logical near progression for us, and we see the advantages that will strengthen the core going forward. If I look at the things I'm proudest of, it's the things that you mentioned that we've done and pushing the envelope on 5G and 4G are some of those.","I also love to say a little bit with a smile on my face, I'm glad we didn't follow a lot of the things the analysts and the bankers told us we had to do and that's put us in a position now that Matt outlined where we've got a strong balance sheet, we've got a clear strategy, and I think we are going to put a significant distance between us and the competition; and the first mover on the network generation changes usually gains a significant amount of market share, and with the assets that we have we think we're in that position with 5G.","Operator","The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery","I also wanted to share my best wishes to Lowell, good luck with your retirement. Good to hear the news about Houston; you've talked about a $30 million plus opportunity for the residential broadband, can you just help us think about the pacing of that? How are you thinking about the initial timing of the rollout? How many markets we'll see in terms of pops covered over the next 12-24 months? And then on the mobility side, you're starting to talk about that a bit more, we've heard some of your competitors talk about how many markets to launch this year; how rapidly do you think you're going to roll that out? And is that all going to be microwave or you're going to use some lower balance [ph] for the mobility 5G? Thank you.","Hans Vestberg","So when it comes to the fixed wireless access, so as I said in the beginning, we will have an initial commercial launch of four markets this year, that's going to be based on our sort of software that we developed in the beginning calling TS [ph]. We are preparing the whole network with Intelligent Edge Network to be ready to launch 5G based on the and\/or [ph] standard that is coming out right now; and vendors -- and again, equipment manufacturers and OEMs are preparing right now. So we will be ready as soon as that has the majority to be released to our customers; so that they will come back when we'll go for the full 30 million households which is our own ambitions that we have explained before. So that's where we are on the fixed wireless access.","On the mobility, we do the same. Remember the Intelligent Edge Network is a multi-use network, so it's a same rate base station that is going to provide our fixed wireless access as mobility. So we are and as I said before, I mean we are now in deployment on fiber in more than 50 cities. So we are preparing everything to be ready for the majority of the equipment and the software's as well as having the CPE and handset market ready for launching those products, and right now that's the ambitions we see in 2019, we have not named the cities but as you can here we are deploying in 50 markets with fiber sales [ph], and I think that's an important point of it. So that's where we are and we will come back and give you updates all the time on the new things we're doing and today we're now launching the third city here in Houston, we're super excited over that; so we'll continue to flow all the information on what we're doing on 5G.","Simon Flannery","And when should you launch the first of the Sacramento, LA, Houston? Is that going to be in the third quarter or more likely the fourth?","Hans Vestberg","Good question. Well, as we say -- we say that in the second half of 2018; so we promise we will come out and tell you as soon as we know exactly the date.","Operator","The next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick","Hans, can you talk us through what's happening on the CapEx side to move towards the lower end of the guide; are you doing less this year than you expected or just getting more for it? And where are you in the shift of spending and focus from macro towers to more fiber and small cell? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","I think this is a great question; remember when I came in -- we decided together with Matt, Lowell and the whole management team to actually flip the whole network to the -- sort of the horizontal Intelligent Edge Network. And I also experienced there were two important factors where we did that; one, we wanted to deliver new type of services based on a horizontal network, especially the ones coming from 5G and we want to see some of them coming up very shortly. The second was that we also could be so much more efficient with new technologies in multipurpose equipment. At the same time we put in the new process for capital efficiency that Matt and I are sharing, and I think that's what you're seeing right now; we are actually doing much more than before when it comes to deployment. Then as we say here, we are already deploying 5G things at the moment, we're preparing all the network for it, so that's embedded in the numbers that you see.","At the same time we also are making a big shift in our whole spending; I mean if I look what we spend in 2017 in the capital result CapEx than in 2018 it's very different; so we're also making shift at all time but this is nothing that we're limiting, we used our more efficient of using our capital and my engineering team are very happy with the investment that we're doing at the moment. So I think that we are also -- as you said, we are moving over to much more small cells than making bigger towers and macro cells. And I will say, if you go back a couple of years ago our -- majority of all our investment was on macro towers and today the majority is on densification with smaller cells. So we have shifted dramatically over the years and I've only been part of it now for more than one year but I've seen how the engineering team is responding to the new way of working and setting up the whole new network structure. So that's what you seen in the figures.","Philip Cusick","If I can follow-up; anything you can tell us given that efficiency about where 2019 CapEx might be upward or downward from 2018? Thank you.","Matthew Ellis","We'll stay consistent with what we've done in the past where we'll talk about 2019 we get closer to that but I think we've been pretty consistent in our commentary that -- look, we expect CapEx to be reasonably consistent and as we [indiscernible] is to accelerate any spend on 5G as we see it but it's little too early in the process to get there yet. I'll just remind you as Hans said, a lot of the spending that we've been doing around densification supports both 4G and 5G. So the network really is in a great position to be preposition for us moving into 5G here without it requiring a significant step change in total spend. We've done this before, has moved from one generation of technology to another, and keeping total CapEx spend fairly consistent and we're confident we'll do that again.","Operator","The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.","David Barden","Matt, could I just ask some questions on the finance side, just on the lower tax guide -- could you talk about the reasons why that is and is that flowing through to the cash flow side of the equation, and do we need to address that in the free cash flow number as well? And then the second one is, could you talk about -- I think as we've done historically, some of the changes in the union contracts forthcoming -- how should we think about that impact on the cost structure, I know you gave us about 20% margin in the wireline side for this year but is that -- did those negotiations give you some window in potentially having some upside in that margin number in the wireline business? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","I'll start with the tax question. So, as you look at the first half of the year the ETR [ph] was impacted certainly by tax reform but we had a couple of one-timers in there, especially related to the pension contribution we did in first quarter that you wouldn't see necessarily flow through to the second half of the year, so that's why we're guiding towards the lower end of the 24% to 26% range for the year as a whole. In terms of it flowing through to the cash flow; you know, I would say certainly you should expect cash taxes to be positively impacted this year by tax reform. We didn't have that in the first quarter because we had no scheduled payments; as you know, second quarter we had the first of two scheduled payments for the year and so started to see those flow through, expect to see lower tax rate flow through to our cash tax payments in the rest of the year and that's certainly behind the commentary that we gave around the ability to strengthen the balance sheet this year.","So expect to continue to see the benefit from the lower tax rate. I'll let Lowell answer your question around the new union contract.","Lowell McAdam","David, we're really pleased with the relationship that we've built with the union. During the last contract we get together at the senior level very frequently, we've been able to deal with some issues that had been thorns on the side for both, the union leadership and members, as well as the company. So when we decided to attempt to get a contract literally a year ahead of expiration -- that was a major change in our relationship, and I would like to thank the union leadership for the way -- the approach that they took during this. As far as your financial projections; I would say just continue with the projections that you've seen, we do have increases and contributions and that sort of thing but it's not a significant change to the bottom-line trajectory that you've seen the way it was after our last contract. But the beauty of all of this is now the management and all of our employees can focus on our customers and deploying 5G and deploying fiber, and they can all focus on work and their families and the customer instead of getting ready for a strike; and so we're very, very pleased about this outcome.","Operator","The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Thanks. And I'd also like to extend my congrats to Lowell for a distinguished career, and to Hans for the opportunity that lies ahead. I was hoping I could ask about postpaid ARPA; that metric has been under pressure for the last several years although it's shown a lot of stabilization recently. And even though you don't breakout phone ARPU intrinsically, we all know that it was phone ARPU that was causing that pressure as subs moved into EIP, and more recently into the unlimited plans. It seems like the EIP transition or the unsubsidized transition is fully behind us, I'm not entirely sure we are in the migration to the new unlimited plan; so I guess I was just kind of hoping you could talk through the drivers of postpaid ARPA going forward. Do we still have any headwind on the phone side, is that becoming a tailwind? And then of course you've highlighted you are seeing a lot of other devices including wearable's come into your accounts? Are we starting to get to the point where that's becoming a meaningful positive driver on ARPA as well? Thanks.","Lowell McAdam","As you look ARPA, you're right that the transition to the device payment plans is essentially complete, the year-over-year difference in terms of the percentage of the base unsubsidized pricing is now in single digits as far as a year ago it was much more significant; so that shows up in ARPA. The other good things in the ARPA though is -- you continue to see the demand for our products and services, so we continued in the quarter to have our customers step up in terms of the plans they are on, whether that be from a metered [ph] plan to unlimited or even within our unlimited plans that we offer. And then we continue to see increases in connections per account whether that be wearable's or additional phones on the account; those things are coming through to ARPA and you see the impact there on service revenue overall.","So certainly ARPA is stabilizing and we think as we continue to offer the right plans to customers and we continue to give them the opportunities to add additional devices to their plans that it's an area where we can continue to help drive revenue growth going forward.","Brett Feldman","Have you broken out how many of your customers are on unlimited plans? I apologize if I missed that.","Lowell McAdam","We have not. As we said previously between unlimited and our Verizon 2.0 plans where customers have the ability to control over Edge, that would be significantly above 50% and certainly the number of customers unlimited continues to grow but we haven't broken that out at this point but it's becoming certainly a larger and larger percentage at the base.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.","Michael Rollins","First on the strategic side; as I listened to the management commentary over the past year -- is the underlying goal for Verizon to become a leading provider of broadband in the home and on the go across the country? And if this is the direction how long would it take and how much can be driven by internal investments versus possible M&A? And then just one thing on the business trends; postpaid phone were at the industry level has risen more than twice the rate of population growth, do you have any thoughts on what's driving this change and the sustainability for postpaid phones at this new level of growth? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","Maybe I can start with the network question that you had on broadband. I think when I look into the assets we have and I've been now working here for quite a while; I really like the assets we have and the ones we're building, that will give us the opportunity to be much larger, broader than providing and I think the announcement that we did today that we now are having using it as well and we will continue without communication on the new cities we are going to deploy on; 5G gave us that opportunity. But we need to remember when we talk about 5G -- 5G is an access technology, there is so much more you need to do to actually have it, when I look what we are doing all the way from the data center with fiber unified transport, multi-service routers, they are all way -- I see that this is a big undertaking but we are in the midst of it and I've said a couple of times before -- I mean we have been onto this Intelligent Edge Network right now for quite a while and we see the benefits and we see the opportunity that is great.","So you're right, of course it's going to take time to have it across the country but as I mentioned, we're already now deploying fiber in 50 cities. So we will come back and give you more color to it but I think we are preparing the network to be really using the networks and levering the efficiency markets; so that's for us a very important piece of it.","Matthew Ellis","On the postpaid phone, you know we continue to see consumer demand there. And we believe certainly we'll give customers the opportunity to get on the nation's best network and we have the right price plans, we see good things happen there; so I can't comment in terms of the industry volumes overall but we certainly continue to see good consumer demand and we expect to continue to have postpaid phone net growth going forward, and we'll see how that plays out across the rest of the industry. One other comment I'll just add on the network side is, in addition to the broadband pace -- as we've talked about the strategy, it's -- once you have that pace what we -- the services that we can provide above that connectivity layer are also very important as we go forward, and we think we're in a great place to be able to deliver on that too. So hopefully that helps your questions, Mike.","Lowell McAdam","And Mike, I think I'd just add one thing; it's funny when you're at this point in your career you get to look back and you see an awful lot of similar questions but just asked in a different way; I remember when we brought Verizon together back in '99 and we had about 20% market penetration on postpaid and there was no smartphone and people were saying, where is the industry going, you can't possibly get anymore penetration than you've gotten. And at that point I pointed to areas like Sweden, Hans's home country that was at 50% penetration, and we're -- see we've got all sorts of headroom and now we're over 100% penetration and you see wearable's, and with 5G, and Hans mentioned this, and I mentioned it in my opening remarks, you're going to see so much more penetration on all of the different business applications that are going to change people's lives.","I really don't think much about postpaid or smartphones or any category you want to look at as an opportunity for future growth, there are so many things that we have literally 0% penetration on today that are going to be big businesses five years from now; that's why I'm so excited to see the way we're positioned and the leadership teams philosophy around dealing with customer pain points and providing on the products that they're going to need that will be indispensable five years from now; so that's my perspective on that.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett","Good morning, and let me join the parade of people saying congratulations to Lowell, it really has been a pleasure and also congratulations to you, Hans, I look forward to your great success. Let me ask a strategic question about video if I could; you've discontinued go90 in the quarter, there have at least been press reports about -- at least some discussion about how you move forward with Oath and whether Oath addressable advertising might actually be more successful outside the company instead of inside the company. I wonder if you could just talk about the role that you see video playing -- and now that you've had some time to play around with some of the different strategies around video and addressable advertising, and then as part of that if you could specifically comment on the situation in the press reports about Oath that would be helpful.","Lowell McAdam","Let me deal with those in reverse order there Craig and then I'll let Hans come in and put a period on it. The questions around Oath -- I don't know where they're coming from. There is no intention of spinning out Oath in any particular format. We see the synergies that we expected to see and we see the future that we had hoped for. Matt talked about in his remarks the integration efforts that are going on, they are on-schedule, and so we see no reason to do that and there's no credible report out there that are otherwise in my view. So I'd be clear about that.","On the video side, look that is the major driver of traffic that we see on the network today; we only expect that to go up overtime. But we're not fans of linear but I'm not trying to criticize anybody else's strategy here, it's just the fact of the assets that we have and the investments that we want to make, it's much better in our view to do digital; so we're -- as we've always said skating to where the puck is going, so that's where we're focused. I was very heartened by our time in Sun Valley two weeks ago, Hans went and we met with all of the major content providers, the sports leagues, healthcare, education, gaming, all of those segments and every one of them when they know what is going on with 5G, and especially, the latency certainly along with the capacity but when they see the latency their eyes light up about what's possible.","So my view is, and I know Hans shares this -- we've developed these strategies together, he has always been one of my go-to-guys over the last five years to see where the industry is going but it's our belief that we're positioned perfectly to have the partnerships that we need to be successful; we're not going to be owning contents or we're not going to be competing with other content providers, we're going to be their best partner from a distribution perspective and I think that makes great sense for the company going forward.","Hans Vestberg","And I can [indiscernible], I've been around now for quite a while, both as leading this but I've been seating together with Lowell, the management team, and the board on the strategic decision we've done and I'm fully onboard on all of them. And when I look at the assets we have, I'm really happy with them and I'm encouraged to see what we can do with them both, leverage them. And we also are going to get more of the synergies that Lowell talked about all of them [ph], and just talking about the Oath, for example; I mean today with the massive confidence we have in Oath when it comes to AIML [ph] and we are in the transformation of our network to virtualization that's a great synergy and creating a lot of newer possibilities for us on the front and we're constantly working how we can actually leverage our assets on our sort of the Verizon side and Oath side and we will continue to find those ways forward.","So I feel good about the assets we have and I agree with Lowell that -- and we can partner with anyone and again, we are betting on that, we're going to have the best network, Intelligent Edge Network, we want to have a great 5G, the best; and of course, we can attract partners that we can work with and I think that is the model that we have and that we can continue to develop. And I see only opportunities when we go to 5G when you can build to connectivity platforms and applications, and sort of define where you're going to play in that or where you're going to have partners. So I'm feeling encouraged about the assets we have and what we can do with them.","Operator","The next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo.","Jennifer Fritzsch","Can I just explore the wireline CapEx component -- it's down about $500 million from the first quarter and yet I hear you're doing it 50 fiber [ph] cities. Can you talk Matt maybe about the -- should we begin to see that wireline portion of that CapEx ramp as this fiber build comes together? And then I guess what does that mean for what I'll call traditional wireless spend? And then just separately on millimeter ways background, we do have an auction coming up in November, you guys have a lot of spectrum here; can you comment on interest if that might be part of your focus from the fall [ph]?","Matthew Ellis","So on the CapEx side, certainly as you look between first and second quarter you got timing in there; but as we build out fiber and as you say, we mentioned the 50 cities outside of the ILEC footprint where we're deploying fiber today -- you'll see a blurring of the line of the CapEx between the segments, so obviously that fiber build shows up in our wireline segment but the largest customer for that build is the wireless piece of the business, so this is part of densifying the network, prepositioning the network to not just excel in 4G but also be ready for 5G, especially using millimeter wave spectrum as you mentioned. So I would expect to see a continuation of those spend but the total CapEx number as I said earlier, you should see consistency there, and as you -- what you're seeing is the continued evolution of our CapEx from one generation of technology to the next, and fiber build out is a key component of that. So you should expect to see a continuation of those trends and as part of the Intelligent Edge Network that will deliver 5G, and we're excited about it as we go forward.","And I'll let Hans talk about millimeter wave.","Hans Vestberg","When we think about data usage of our network we usually talk in a couple of different ways in order to define what we need, and first of all we have the choice between densifying and deploying on more spectrum, I think that the last round of Oath spectrum we decided to densify and I think that is now paying out very well for us. Secondly, looking to all new type of technology and features coming out in a network that can optimize everything from carrier engagement, etcetera. And lastly, we of course look into what spectra we need to have; that is putting us in a very disciplined way how we use these three type of assets when we decide what to do in order to have the best return-on-investment. Of course, we are looking into any auction that's coming up and see how that fits in in that pattern of decision-making with these different type of options, so we will look into that.","However, we're also feeling pretty good about the position we have on millimeter wave right now; but again, we will look into if there are any holes we need to feel in this process but again, it will be in that discussion all the way from densification, looking into new features on the technology, and then looking into what spectrum is needed, and then we have the disciplined approach to our return-on-investment.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Nicknam [ph] of Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","One, on 5G, what are you hearing from your larger commercial enterprise customers in terms of demand for specific use cases? I'm wondering if that can facilitate any sort of acceleration in your pace of builds heading into next year? And then secondly, maybe for Matt on tax reform, you talked about using the benefits this year at least to strengthen the balance sheet; how should we think about optimal leverage for the business today? And how do the uses of access cash and tax reform benefits -- how do I potentially evolve into 2019?","Lowell McAdam","Let's start with the 5G and enterprise; you're right, when we think about the eight different currencies that 5G is going to explore or we'll have -- I think that enterprise is the receiver [indiscernible] when it comes to latency, security, launched throughputs and all of that. We are in constant dialogue with our enterprise customers to see how we can build new type of services with them, and of course, we were building the Intelligent Edge Network and here we have the definition of Edge, how we do a specific slice for an enterprise, and that could be private 5G network with low latency or something like that. So we see that as a great opportunity, there are some features if I be little bit deep on technology that come out on the next revision of the N or 5G technology which is on the sick revision 16 [ph], that will be even more important for our enterprise customer. But again, we are building these as we speak and we have dialogue with all our enterprise customers to see that we are actually innovating together with them, new type of service where you sort of doing your real-time enterprise based on wireless which haven't been done before. So I think we are very far on our innovation and exploration in this area and I see great opportunities in it.","Matthew Ellis","On your question around tax reform and certainly flowing through the cash flow and the capital allocation; look, the capital allocation we've talked about this numerous times and we are focused on being able to invest in the networks, providing a return to our shareholders, we know the dividend is important and we've increased the dividend for 11 years in a row now, and we've also said we want to strengthen the balance sheet and get back to those pre-Vodafone credit rating profile, and certainly tax reform helps accelerate our ability to do that, that's our focus for 2018. You saw good progress in the first half of the year, not just on the debt paydown but also -- when we say we strengthen the balance sheet we include what we did with the pension contribution as well; so we're making good progress there, too early to give specific views on 2019 but certainly as you know, tax reform will help us get to those leverage profile's quicker than we would have done otherwise and look forward to updating you on 2019 when we get closer to it.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Matt. Brad, we have time for one more question, let's go and take one more please.","Operator","Your last question comes from Tim Hurrian [ph] of Oppenheimer.","Unidentified Analyst","Do you still think you're going to be able to use wireless customer data in terms of location and usage to do more targeted advertising -- and if so, kind of the timing on that? And then secondly, it does seem like wireless and wireline networks are converging; I'm just curious, how do the unions kind of feel about this? Do you have the flexibility to kind of really converge these networks in a timely basis? Thank you.","Lowell McAdam","Okay Tim, thanks for the question, and I'd just say to all of you that asked questions today, thank you for your best wishes. First, on customer data, our hallmark on this Tim is transparency; we don't want to use data though -- unless customers know how we're using it. And so far we've been able to do a broad data analysis and target our advertising not based on individual customer data but overall data. And I think that anonymous usage -- we're very clear with customers about, and it's certainly got a lot of value to the old facets. On the convergence side, we're honoring the contract within the footprint and we're very open with the union about what we're doing, and we're very clear that areas that we manage outside of the union contract will stay clean as we go forward. So again, transparency is important to us, we think we can do exactly what we need to do without causing any footfalls and we're open about it; so we don't view that as a hindrance to our strategy going forward.","Brady Connor","That's all the time we have for questions today. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back over to Hans for some closing comments.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you, Brady. And I would like to close this call with a few key points as I prepare to start my tenure as CEO of Verizon but I have to start by thanking Lowell for a fantastic journey and the fantastic job you have done, and you're going to be here in the transition and I'm really grateful for that. And yesterday like this when we're in the field, here in Houston, meeting employees, investors, we're meeting partners, and of course the city -- I think it shows the relationship you have built over the years, and handing that over to me and the team I think is enormous. So I have to chime-in [ph] towards everybody, as I said, it's a fantastic journey you've had Lowell.","And coming back to the first half of 2018 where we've achieved solely financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace, and we are -- we're pleased where the business is positioned as we start the second half of the year. And we remain focused on the core strength of developing superior customer relationship and building the next-generation network for long-term growth, and I've talked about Intelligent Edge Network and the importance for our business, and I'm pleased to see where we're all with that.","We're also committed to our strategy, and prior [ph] just led by investing in our network, leveraging the assets across all of Verizon, using platforms such as Oath to further monetize data and video consumption, maintaining disciplined capital allocation process and creating value for our customers and shareholders. We're confident in our ability to execute on our strategy, and we're positioned to take full advantage of the many opportunities that will take shape as we lead the evolution into 5G. As we say at Verizon, we don't wait for the future, we build it.","Thank you for time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect."],"21389":["Verizon Communications, Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Eunice. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Matt goes through the results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of $1.07 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax gain of about $1.8 billion. This net gain consists primarily of the sale of certain data centers to Equinix.","We also incurred pre-tax severance charges of $607 million and acquisition and integrated related charges of $152 million, primarily in connection with the closing of our acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets, which we previously disclosed. The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $458 million, or $0.11 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.96 in the second quarter, compared to $0.94 a year ago. As a reminder, last year's adjusted earnings per share included $0.07 from the impact of the work stoppage.","Also, our consolidated results for the second quarter included one month of data center operations that we sold to Equinix on May 1, 2017, and about two weeks of Yahoo operations. We have posted unaudited historical wireline segment results, which recast the segment for the impact of the sale to Equinix on our website.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter of execution. First, we invested in our 4G network leadership position, resulting in a sweep of third-party network performance surveys for the first half of 2017, while prepositioning for 5G services. Second, we delivered solid wireless operational performance and financial results in a competitive environment with an increase in both postpaid and prepaid accounts. Third, we successfully completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets to scale our media business.","Network leadership is the central element of our strategy, and we are continually investing in our network to extend our leadership in 4G capacity growth with densification using small cells, which includes expanding our fiber capabilities. As we prepare for the network of the future, we announced the acquisition of Straight Path for $3.1 billion, which we expect will close by the end of first quarter 2018. Straight Path complements our spectrum portfolio and positions us to lead and further drive 5G technology and its ecosystem. We have begun the precommercial fixed wireless trials in eight out of the 11 markets and have our first batch of customers on this technology. As we have previously highlighted, we will have trial results later in the year, and I look forward to sharing them with you.","We had a strong quarter, adding and retaining wireless customers as the momentum from the launch of our unlimited plans was sustained throughout the quarter. We delivered a strong wireless operational performance that reflects customer demand for our high-quality network in a highly competitive market. Finally, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets and immediately began executing on integration plans that we've been working on for over a year. We are confident in the execution of our strategy, which we expect to drive profitable growth, generate strong cash flows, and return long-term value to our shareholders.","Let's go deeper into the second quarter operating performance at the consolidated level, followed by wireless and wireline results, media and telematics progress, and network and technology updates.","Now on to slide 6. In the second quarter, total operating revenue was in line with last year. On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and acquisitions, consolidated revenue declined 2.0%. The primary driver was the decrease in wireless service revenue, which was consistent with our expectation. On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.2%. We remain focused on improving our overall cost structure through operating efficiencies across network, distribution, and care. As we shift more transactions toward a digital model, we can improve the customer experience and further enhance operating efficiencies.","Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide 7. Our operating segments continue to generate substantial cash flows. During the first half of 2017, cash flow from operating activities totaled $9.9 billion and included a net after-tax discretionary pension contribution of $2.1 billion. Our high-quality cash generation is driven by the diverse base of wireless and wireline customers. Our ongoing asset-backed securitization program provided $2.9 billion of cash, which flows through the financing section of the cash flow statement. The impact of the transition to device payment plans and on-balance-sheet securitization should approach a steady state around the end of 2017. Thereafter, the sequential impacts will primarily reflect seasonality of new device launches. As a result, we expect the working capital headwind to subside in 2018.","For the first half of the year, capital spending was $7.0 billion, which was in line with last year. On a year-to-date basis, our reported free cash flow of $2.9 billion includes the discretionary pension contribution net of tax of $2.1 billion, which flowed through our cash flow from operations. In addition, our free cash flow does not include proceeds from asset-backed securitization, which was introduced in the third quarter of last year.","Our balance sheet is solid and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $117.5 billion of total debt, which comprised of $109.6 billion of unsecured debt and $7.9 billion of on-balance-sheet securitizations. We have not changed our capital allocation plan or our expectation for cash availability, and we remain focused on having a strong balance sheet with improving credit metrics while continuing to invest in our businesses and returning value to our shareholders.","Now let's move into reviews of the operating segments, starting with wireless on slide 8. In a highly competitive wireless environment, we delivered a strong operational performance, protecting and expanding our high-valued postpaid customer relationships while balancing profitability. With a clear and comparable offer, our value proposition highlighted the strength of our network, resulting in industry-leading customer retention and improved new demand during the quarter as our offer appealed to customers in underpenetrated segments.","Wireless operational performance was sustained throughout the second quarter, building on the customer momentum at the end of the first quarter with improvements in both sequential and year-over-year net phone add performance. Net phone additions were 358,000, compared to 86,000 in the prior year. Smartphone net additions were 590,000, versus 336,000 last year. Postpaid net adds totaled 614,000, including tablet net adds of 2,000 and other connected devices of 254,000, led by Verizon Wireless retail home devices. We added 64,000 postpaid accounts versus a loss of 83,000 last year, and we grew our postpaid account base for the first time in the past six quarters.","Our postpaid phone churn reflects customer demand for network quality and reliability, while pricing provided choices to meet customer needs. Postpaid phone churn not only continued recent trends below 0.9% but also established a new low in the LTE era at 0.70%. Total retail postpaid churn of 0.94% was consistent year over year and down 21 basis points sequentially. Total postpaid device activations were up 3.0%, of which 82% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.6%, up from 5.4% year over year, and was 43 basis points higher sequentially. During the quarter, 6.2 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Prepaid net adds of 19,000 were up year over year and sequentially due to our stronger value proposition.","Let's turn to slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability. Total wireless operating revenue declined 1.9% in the second quarter as compared to a 5.1% decline in the first quarter. Service revenue declined 6.7% versus a 6.1% decrease in the previous quarter. This trend was primarily due to the lost overage revenue driven by plans introduced during summer of 2016 and the introductory unlimited offer. As we discussed during our last earnings call, we expected weaker year-over-year service revenue through the first half of the year, primarily due to line access and overage revenue trends.","At the end of the second quarter, about 59% of our accounts have tools that offer customers the ability to self-manage their usage experience. During the second quarter, we experienced an improvement in the rate of decline in line access revenue, as we now have roughly 75% of the postpaid phone base on unsubsidized plans. We expect this trend will continue which, combined with adding new accounts and migrating customers to higher access points, will mitigate the lost overage revenue. Therefore, we believe the service revenue trend has flattened, and we expect that there will be an improving trend in the second half, and we should exit the fourth quarter inside a decline of 4.0%.","In the second quarter, equipment revenue increased 16%. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 77% in the quarter, as compared to approximately 76% in the first quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan at the end of the quarter. Our wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 45.8%. The movement in the service revenue trend will also positively impact wireless EBITDA margin.","Let's move next to our wireline segment on slide 10. Total wireline revenue on a reported basis grew 1.2%, including the recently acquired XO operations. On an organic basis, wireline segment revenue decreased 2.8% compared to a decline of 3.2% last quarter. This shift in the wireline revenue trend towards fiber is growing. Organically, fiber based products grew more than 3%, which supports our plans to further invest in fiber. Our emphasis on delivering value to all business customers, from the very small to the large enterprise, was recognized recently in a leading third-party study. More importantly, we won the large enterprise business award for the second consecutive year in the same study.","Consumer markets revenue increased 0.6%, driven by Fios Internet activity. Consumer Fios revenue growth of 4.1% was consistent with the past several quarters. During the quarter, we launched Fios Gigabit Connection in certain markets, which offers symmetrical speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. In Fios Internet, we added 49,000 customers. Fios Video results were pressured due to softer secular demand for traditional linear video, given growth in the over-the-top offerings, as well as competitive promotional activity. Fios Video losses were 15,000 in the quarter. For the second quarter, Enterprise Solutions revenue fell 4.1% on an organic basis, which was due to persistent trends in our legacy products and pricing compression in the marketplace. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was down 3.5%.","Partner Solutions revenue declined 6.8% on an organic basis, while the revenue mix towards fiber has been trending higher. Within business markets, fiber revenue is expanding, driven by Fios broadband demand, offset by continued pressure in legacy products. On an organic basis, revenue declined 4.9% and improved slightly sequentially.","On a comparable basis, the second quarter wireline EBITDA margin was 20.8%, compared to 13.3%, which included the work stoppage, last year. Sequentially, wireline EBITDA margin was down 120 basis points, primarily due to lower revenue from Enterprise Solutions and Partner Solutions and an increase in operating expense as a result of leasing data center space related to the sale to Equinix.","Let's move next to slide 11 to discuss our progress in new businesses, starting with media. On June 13, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets. Upon closing, we launched Oath, which is a combination of AOL and Yahoo brands, serving approximately 1 billion unique monthly users globally, and currently represents about $7 billion in annual revenue. We have been planning the integration of AOL and Yahoo for the past year and immediately began executing on integration plans upon closing. We expect to realize over $1 billion in cumulative operating expense synergies through 2020.","We are in the very early stages of leveraging the scale of the combined assets to distribute and monetize content through programmatic advertising across our Sports, Finance, News, and Entertainment properties. These properties will provide unique advertising opportunities to targeted global audiences. Organically, AOL's revenue net of traffic acquisition costs was consistent with prior year's results in the quarter. As the integration progresses, we will provide additional information on the Oath business. Organically, IoT revenue, including telematics, increased approximately 20% in the second quarter. Telematics revenue was approximately $220 million in the quarter.","Let's move next to slide 12 to discuss network and technology. We consistently invest in our wireless and wireline assets to ensure that we have capacity, reduce the cost to serve, and to preposition the networks for the future. Our value proposition to our wireless customers is to provide a full network experience including reliability, coverage, and speed. We are on our wireless network plan to deliver the industry's best overall experience for our customers.","Our network experience continues to be recognized by multiple third-party studies as the industry leader. Since the launch of unlimited, two of these studies have reconfirmed our network leadership in overall performance, including speed and voice quality over LTE. As expected, the introduction of the unlimited pricing plan increased the LTE network usage as our customers enjoy the experience of consuming more data throughout the day on the industry-leading wireless network. We are confident in our network and have been engineering the network based on a long-term integrated plan to extend our high-quality experience while expanding our value proposition to customers. We remain focused on delivering increasing capacity over the long-term, utilizing a three-pronged approach: first, network features; second, densification; and, third, spectrum. Let's discuss each of these in detail.","First, we are methodically deploying LTE Advanced features to increase capacity on our network resources and align with the timing of smartphone introductions that can take advantage of these features.","Second, small cells are playing a vital role in creating capacity. The densification efforts have been a focal point of our network strategy over the past several years. This density also creates increased spectral efficiency and offers the best wireless experience.","Finally, with nearly all of our network traffic now on the 4G LTE Advanced network, we are utilizing just over 50% of our low and mid-band spectrum portfolio for this network. We expect to use more of our PCS spectrum for LTE and are just beginning to redeploy 850 megahertz spectrum in certain markets. In addition, we are deploying AWS-3 and will start to add unlicensed spectrum later this year. Our spectrum deployments in conjunction with multicarrier aggregation technology are enabling us to increase network capacity. Our overall wireless network integrates features, densification, and spectrum to enable a step function increase in wireless network capacity over the long term.","Fiber is a critical element in transforming both wireless and wireline networks to reduce costs and expand future capabilities. To enhance this strategy, our recent announcements to secure fiber demonstrates our commitment to increase our multiuse fiber footprint and build fiber deeper into the network. On the 5G wireless front, we are up and running in eight out of the 11 precommercial fixed wireless broadband trials on the millimeter-wave spectrum. We have the first batch of customers on the network. We will have trial results towards the end of the year that will give us valuable insights for commercial deployments.","Let's move next to slide 13 to review our strategy for future growth. We are executing on our plan to lead in network, preserve and grow our customer relationships, and expand our presence in digital media and telematics to deliver fundamental results while allocating capital to continue to invest in our operations and return value to our shareholders. We delivered strong wireless operational performance and financial results in a competitive environment. We evolved our wireless value proposition while driving profitable growth and reconfirming network leadership based on third-party study results. We expect that we will create incremental capital and operational efficiencies that result in additional cash generation.","Our 5G strategy is progressing for fixed and mobility use cases, standards, spectrum resources, and fiber investments. Now that we have completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets and introduced the Oath brand, our media business is focused on the integration plans, and we'll look to increase engagement on our platforms. In telematics, we see additional growth opportunities with our Fleetmatics and Telogis assets. We remain confident in our strategy, which puts us in a strong position to compete today and into the future while delivering long-term value to our shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Thank you, Matt. Eunice, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. One moment, please, for the first question. Your first question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research","Hi, good morning. Two questions if I could. One, I'm curious if you could delve a little bit further into the competitive environment. Last earnings call you provided a perspective of the how net adds and gross adds flowed over the quarter. I was wondering if you could do the same thing just so we could frame what was driving the improvement in your performance this quarter on the phone add out of the equation. And then secondly, just on 5G, if you can give us an update where you are with the trials and maybe if you have an update on the economics that you're seeing from those deployments. Thanks.","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the question. So on the competitive environment through the quarter, I would say we saw it \u2013 outperformance in the quarter was pretty even. You saw the churn number; we came in at 0.70%. That certainly contributed to the net adds and shows that once we had a comparable offer out there against the competition, I mean, by being unlimited where the other guys are unlimited. Even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high-quality network experience that we deliver, and we saw that throughout the quarter.","So even as we headed into the back end of the quarter and the competitive environment picked up and some of the other offers that came out there, whether that be large bounties to switch carrier or offering free service, our performance in the back end of the quarter was consistent with where we saw it in the first part of the quarter. So we saw a great result from customers on both the gross adds side and the loyalty side once they had that comparable offer to do. So very excited about how that played out.","As we head forward, second quarter is typically, seasonally, the low quarter for churn. So while we certainly expect churn to continue to be at low levels, we'll see if we get a normal seasonal uptick as we go forward. But from a competitive environment standpoint, I think we showed that we competed throughout the quarter without having to put any aggressive promotions in place in the market at any time during the quarter.","In terms of 5G, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, we now have the trials up and running. It's going to be later in the year before we start to see results out of those trials. And then, in terms of the business model and economics that may come of that, it will be driven by the results we see from the trials. So too early right now to be more definitive on that, but we're still confident that we'll have a commercial product in market during 2018 and look forward to providing more details on what's coming out of the trials and the overall economics that we see when we get into the latter part of the year.","Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research","Thanks very much.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Okay, thanks, Mike. Eunice, next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys, thanks. First, can we talk about your small cell rollout? Where are we in the path of that? I know it's a multiyear effort, but how far are we into the small cell rollout and densification? And, second, can you talk about the competitive environment in video and broadband? As you add up the OTT trends and traditional video losses, do you see an acceleration in cord cutting, or does it just seem like customers are spreading out among more video service providers? Thanks.","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Phil. Good morning. So on the small cell rollout, we're exactly where we planned to be. I mean, our capital plan for the year, we're right on where we planned to be at the start of the year. And we are now \u2013 I would say we have small cell builds in all of the top metro markets at this point, and that's one of the reasons we have the network performance that we've had. We saw confirmation of that as recently as yesterday with another one of the third-party surveys that proves that during the first quarter of 2017, even once we were on unlimited, our network performs better than anybody else's, and that's in large part due to what we've been doing for the past number of years on small cell densification.","I know you hear a lot of other people talk a lot about small cell densification now. Remember that we've been doing that for a longer time period than anyone else, and that's why we're in all of the top metro markets. And we will continue to do that. That will be a continued part of our network capacity plan. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we have the long-term network plan that's based off continuing to deploy the spectrum that we own against the LTE network, densification, and the LTE tools that are available. So densification continues to be a very important part of our network plan.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there a point, Matt, at -","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","From a competitive environment (28:09) in the broadband and TV space, I think what you saw is we had a continued strong performance on the broadband side, but we also see the ongoing secular trend around video. So we continue to add high-quality broadband customers and will continue to compete on the video side, but certainly we do that in the face of the secular trends that are ongoing.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there a point, Matt, at which the small cell densification effort sort of starts to slow down in a few years, or is this a constant effort for the next three, five years?","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","I think it continues. It's not just around 4G, as we've talked in the past. As we see 5G being deployed on millimeter-wave spectrum, that's going to require a small cell deployment, and so as we put the densification in place of 4G, we're doing it in mind knowing that we've got the 5G that will be using the same dark fiber in other assets. So the densification activity will continue here for a good number of years.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Matt.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Eunice, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. Matt, maybe can we get some more color on a couple of the forward-looking sort of items you gave us on the wireless side? First on the service revenue. It was down 6.7%, but you said that it would start to sort of flatten in the second half. And then the 4% sort of year-end exit run rate. Can I assume we're looking at something around 6.7% for the third quarter and then improvement, something in the sort of 5% range for the fourth quarter? Just if you could put some color there.","And then some similarly on the margins. You said as the service revenue improves we'd see some improvement in the margins. Total margins in wireless have been down a little bit in the first half, you know in each quarter. Are you sort of suggesting it'll be down less in the second half? Or do you think that as we see the improvement into the year, obviously, there's some crosscurrents with the new phone, but could we get back up flat or even positive comps on the margin? Thanks.","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, John. So on the service revenue, I think consistent with what we said earlier in the year, we see second quarter as being the low point and the 6.7% for 2Q will become something better then in 3Q. And in my prepared remarks I believe I \u2013 you heard me say that we'll be inside of negative 4% in the fourth quarter. So in terms of how do we get there, we talked about that 75% of the base in second quarter was on unsubsidized pricing. That compares to 53% a year ago. So there's north of a 20-point movement from second quarter last year to second quarter this year.","As you get into the back half of the year \u2013 I'll use fourth quarter as an example. Fourth quarter year-ago, that number was 67%. This year, that number is going top out in the upper 70s. So we're at 75% now. We'll get up to, let's say, 77%. That will only be a 10-point delta in the fourth quarter year over year. So that pressure that's come from taking customers from the subsidized model down to the unsubsidized pricing is starting to wane, and really the second quarter is where we reached the point, we've got essentially the vast majority of the consumer base now on unsubsidized pricing.","And then overage revenues also being, obviously, part of the story here over the past few quarters, first with the introduction of the price plans last year that had the Safety Mode feature and then bringing on unlimited. As we said, we now have 59% of accounts on one of those two plans. Overage was actually down 34% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. Now represents a low single digit percentage part of total service revenues. So we're working through that headwind. We'll work through that headwind a lot faster. And so, as I say, based off that, I am very confident we'll be inside negative 4% in fourth quarter, and by the time we get on this call a year from now and our comparison is against this year being 75% on unsubsidized pricing, we'll be having a very different conversation about the service revenue trajectory next year.","And then on margin improvement, as you know, service revenue is the highest margin component of our business, so as the trajectory on service revenue improves, the trajectory on margin will improve as well.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Matt.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Eunice, next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys, thanks a lot. I guess two if I could. I just wanted to follow up on that service revenue question, Matt. I mean, the math kind of suggests that by fourth quarter your service revenue will actually be growing from where it is in the second quarter. And I wonder if you could kind of talk about the inputs to that expectation in terms of kind of what you expect from a competitive pricing environment, promotions with the iPhone, et cetera, relative to that mix shift that you've been talking about, as you kind of go past the price down cohort and you move into this group of people that are kind of more pricing up. If you could talk about those two dynamics as kind of the inputs as your base case, would be helpful.","And then the second question, if I could, would be on the media segment. I mean, if you could kind of elaborate a little bit more on what is that thing growing at today and what will it look like in the future? I guess we've talked about maybe turning down the search business and how that business might transform over the next six months or year, would kind of be helpful to kind of understand what that unit is going to look like. Thanks.","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, David. Thank you. So the inputs to service revenue. Really as you think about that trajectory changing, when you've got growing accounts, growing net adds, when you see the continued improvement in the delta on the non-subsidized pricing and as we work through the overage, all of that will combine to a much stronger trend as we go forward from where we have been.","In terms of the impact of any new devices coming along, look, we assume that we'll see something later in the year. We typically have very strong results when we have new devices come out because when customers get a new device with new functions, they want it on the best network, but we'll see what happens there. And certainly would expect that to be accretive to the overall revenue story.","But our guidance for the year doesn't require any major uplift as a result of that. And then the media side, look, I will say it was very early in the process of integrating those two businesses. As we said, the revenue of AOL less TAC was flat year over year in the quarter. Tim and the team are just getting started integrating those two businesses. They're about 45 days in at this point. The integration is going well, and I look forward to being able to provide more color and commentary about exactly what they're seeing as they go forward. But as you heard Tim say a couple of months ago, the goal here is to grow this to north of $10 billion in revenue by 2020, and nothing that's happened since we closed has changed our view on that.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks, Matt.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Eunice, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. A question for Matt. And if I'm reading your guidance correctly, it seems like you effectively reiterated your outlook for the year, including what implies roughly a flattish EPS trend. There were a few moving parts this quarter. You did the Equinix data enter deal, and I think that may have been slightly dilutive to earnings. And, of course, you completed the acquisition of Yahoo. So I was hoping maybe you could just unpack your outlook for the full year and maybe let us know the extent to which those transactions may have been accretive or dilutive to your trends for the balance of 2017. Thanks.","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Brett. So the guide, if you look at the language on the revenue side, we said we'd be reasonably consistent on an organic basis. So as we think about that, we would remove out anything that wasn't in the business for all of 2016-2017. So certainly the impact of those businesses have been having about $0.02 a quarter on EPS, so when I think about the guide going forward, it's on an organic basis. Still feel very confident organically we'll be in a consistent place to where we were a year ago, and then we'll bake in the impact of the various acquisitions as we go forward.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So does that imply that it's actually additive to your full-year outlook? (37:25)","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","As we get into each of those businesses, certainly from a revenue standpoint they are additive to the outlook. From an earnings standpoint, some of those businesses have an initial pressure as we integrate them, but not material to the earnings outlook.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then just a different question. As we think about unlimited, and you were talking about doing more digital customer interactions and customer care, have you already started to see a benefit there? In other words, as your customer base has moved to unlimited plans, is that cohort contacting you less frequently? And could this be a real area of offset to some of the overage that you're losing on the top line?","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. I mean, certainly with customers on unlimited they have fewer reasons to call. But we continue to want to improve the customer experience, and when customers can do things by themselves through a digital channel at the time they want to do it, that increases overall satisfaction, and it certainly allows us to improve the efficiency of the business. So we're continuing to do that, and we think unlimited certainly helps us do that as well.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Eunice, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi, thank you. Matt, I wonder if we could return to the network densification conversation you had a few moments ago. Can you talk about how you think about the trade-off specifically between acquiring more spectrum and network densification, and from an economics perspective, and has that shifted at all inside of Verizon? I mean, my sense is you're much different than a year or so ago. You spend less time talking about new spectrum acquisition. Is that a fair characterization?","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Look, we continue to look at that trade-off. It really comes down to taking a view on the most efficient way to add the capacity that we need, and we've talked for two or three years now about the fact that we believe based off of the valuations that spectrum have reached in some places, it's more efficient to densify. And certainly the costs of densification, just like with any technology, have come down to some degree since we started densifying with small cell. So the overall analysis we do hasn't fundamentally changed. Look, we continue to add spectrum from the secondary markets, too. So when spectrum is priced at the right level, we continue to be active in that space, too. And we just look at the relative economics between densifying and adding spectrum. But densification has proved to be a very effective way of adding capacity into what places we need to and from a cost efficiency standpoint as well.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks, Matt, and if I could just ask a quick follow-up. I'm going to risk putting words in your mouth, but is it fair to say that you still believe, broadly speaking, that network advantage is still possible and within reach for Verizon with the network densification strategy?","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Look, I think the results speak for themselves on this one, Craig, and whether it be the third-party results that you've seen, again, just in the last 24 hours. But even in an unlimited world, the third-party results clearly show that Verizon has the best network. And then when you look at our subscriber metrics for the quarter, once we were on a comparable basis, we saw record low churn down 0.70%, and we also saw a strong net add number. So the idea that network differentiation doesn't matter to customers \u2013 quite frankly, the results from our base show that that's not true and customers do value the benefit of a differentiated network experience even when it's at a premium pricing, which is where ours is. We wouldn't get those results if a better network experience didn't matter to customers. Clearly it does.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Eunice, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys, thanks. Matt, maybe just a little deeper on the churn that we saw in the quarter \u2013 obviously a very strong result there. Is it an impact from more EIP customers and sort of the equipment balances keeping people steady? Was there anything you guys were doing with respect to protecting the base with maybe proactively moving to unsubsidized without the EIP payments? And then just following up again on the guide on service revenue, what's the more important driver here for the year? Is it handset additions maintaining sort of a positive posture, or is it the ARPA starting to turn? Or, obviously, it could be a combination of both.","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So on the churn, look, there's no magic in here. It's not that we've got more customers on EIP or we've been doing things behind the scenes to protect the base. It's around the quality of the experience. And customers see that quality of the experience, and they want to be on that experience rather than something else. So we're very, very happy with that number there, and it's just a reflection of what we give customers.","In terms of the guide on service revenue, I think the biggest piece that you have in there is the continued migration of the base to the non-subsidized pricing plans. In the back half of the year, the year-over-year comps are against higher numbers there versus the first half of the year, and that's going to drive improvement in service revenue. Certainly net account growth is an important contribution, but I think just, though, the movement of the base and in unsubsidized, that's the trend we've been talking about, and we certainly see that ahead of us.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","And, Matt, maybe just a quick follow-up on thoughts on towers. I know one of your \u2013 your biggest competitor, I guess, is looking for alternatives. Are you guys also evaluating some of those things?","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","We continue to look at all ways to manage the network at the most efficient pricing that we have, whether that be how we talk to towers or all the other resources we have in front of us.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great, thanks, Matt.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Eunice, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you for taking the question. Matt, if I may, on the spectrum side, I know you've talked much about densification, but you did mention other spectrum sources. It looks like there's going to be a 3.5 gigahertz auction possibly next year. And it seems like Verizon's done much lobbying for that effort. In your spectrum kind of wish list, is it fair to say you're probably more focused on higher-band spectrum at this point? Or if you could comment on that.","And then second, if I may, on the One Fiber initiative, it's certainly early to call 2018 CapEx, but do you still feel comfortable that, with the fiber plans you've laid out, or some which we know about, some we probably don't, that that really won't be a huge increase in the CapEx lever next year? Thanks.","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Jennifer. So on the spectrum wish list, look, we're very confident in the portfolio of spectrum that we have, certainly in low band and mid-band, and we have a significant amount of spectrum still to deploy against the LTE network. We'd certainly be interested in the 3.5 [gigahertz] and look forward to that coming forward, but as I say, we're very confident in the spectrum that we still have to deploy.","From a CapEx standpoint next year, look, it's too early to get into the guide next year, but as we think about how we deploy fiber and so on, that will be part of the plans, and we'll share those as we get towards the latter part of the year and certainly into January, when we provide the full-year guide.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Okay. Jennifer, thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning. Matt, you talked a little bit about some of the pressures in the video business from over-the-top. How is Verizon thinking about that opportunity? Is there a case for you to have your own over-the-top product to compete? And how do you think \u2013 I know on convergence you've typically been conservative, but we're seeing a lot more of these converged wireless plus over-the-top offerings. And maybe just touching, then, on M&A and what your interest is in potentially owning more content to have some exclusive product for your customers. Thanks.","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Simon. So on over-the-top, look, nothing to say. We're always looking, but we'll continue to evaluate what we need to do to be competitive in that space and if it needs to be part of the portfolio or not. From a convergence standpoint, again, we're very comfortable with the product offerings we have today, and if there is more convergence, we certainly believe that will take place on our networks, and we'll be effective as being part of that.","And then from an M&A standpoint, look, we're very comfortable with the assets we have today. If there's an opportunity to add something that accelerates the strategy at a reasonable price, we will. But we think we have the assets we need to be effective at this point in time.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Eunice, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could touch upon sort of that network focus and the most efficient means to build additional capacity. When we think about your fiber footprint, you folks have certainly augmented it via acquisitions as well as some of the announcements that you've made to build out capacity. Where does it stand at this juncture in terms of not just the fiber footprint itself, but having the right type of fiber assets to deploy 5G? And how do you expect to augment that capacity going forward?","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. So as we think about the fiber we need for the business, certainly we need more going forward, as we've discussed in the past. The way that we're going to add that capacity will be probably through a combination of buying fiber that already exists if it's the right type of fiber. We can build fiber, and we can certainly lease. And we were doing that on top of some of the assets we already own, and add in the XO, those fiber metro rings earlier in the year gives us the base on which we will continue to do some of that. So fiber will continue to be very important the higher we build the network, not just for wireless but also various wireline applications, including Smart City deployments. So more to come there as we go forward.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful, Matt. And then just dovetailing on the prior commentary on over-the-top, just want to try and put those comments that you had made in terms of evaluating options with some of the comments that seem to have been made previously about you folks putting together an offering. I mean, has that changed in terms of timing or what your strategy is for over-the-top?","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","I'd say there's no change to our strategy at this point in time.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Excellent. Thanks very much for the incremental color.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Great. Eunice, we'll take one more question, please, and then we'll wrap up.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great, guys, and thanks, guys, and congratulations on a good quarter. Matt, the unlimited side, and incredible impact here, do you think this is sustainable? Are you seeing any slowdown at all? Maybe \u2013 I'm not sure if you said on the call \u2013 what percentage of your base are on unlimited or maybe a flow share.","And then not to pound you on wireless margins, but it sounded like you kind of expect them to trend up for the next several years, not just for this quarter. Do you think we can get back to, on a consolidated basis, the type of margins we saw last year or even better than that? And I guess just lastly how do you balance out the growth in subscribers with the margins that you're generating which are still, obviously, industry-leading? Thanks.","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Tim. So, look, I absolutely think the trend on unlimited is sustainable. Once we gave customers that clear and comparable offer, we see the value of our network and our offering compared to what else is in the marketplace. And, look, we'll see how the marketplace evolves going forward. But we're very confident that we will be competitive as that happens.","From a margin improvement standpoint, look, as service revenue trends improve, we would expect that to flow through into margins. And then also we continue to have ways to take cost out of the business and improve efficiencies in the business, too. So you should think about that as you think about how we go forward in the wireless performance.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Okay, great. And with that, I'd like to just turn the call back over to Matt on this busy earning morning.","Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. We remain confident in our strategy of investing in our networks while maintaining and expanding our high-quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We are well-positioned to compete in the current environment while leading the industry in the 5G ecosystem with our strong network assets. We have the opportunity to do the things at scale while delivering value across our portfolio in order to generate shareholder value. We look forward to the opportunities ahead of us and are confident in our ability to execute our strategy.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks, Eunice. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Brady Connor, who will be assuming my role as the Head of Investor Relations later in the fourth quarter.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.","This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides enduring our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Matt goes through the results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the third quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss of about $620 million, primarily associated with early debt redemption costs of $454 million and acquisition and integration related charges of $166 million retaining to Yahoo and other acquisitions.","The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $374 million, or $0.09 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.98 in the third quarter, compared to $1.01 a year ago. Included in our EPS is a $0.01 impact due to the natural disasters in Texas and Florida during the quarter.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. Let me by start by reviewing the progress on our strategic initiatives before getting into detailed results. The cornerstone of our strategy is to provide our customers with the best network experience available. We are steadily investing to advance our 4G LTE leadership and actively building the network of the future.","Our network performance leadership was evidenced by a sweep of third-party surveys for the first half of 2017 and a network's resiliency during the recent hurricanes and wildfires. We delivered solid operational and financial performance in a competitive environment. We grew our retail postpaid and prepaid wireless bases with new unlimited data options and maintain strong customer retention.","Service revenue trajectory also improved as expected. Our wireline results were consistent with the past quarters despite ongoing consumer video headwinds throughout the industry. Demand for a high quality fiber based products remains strong. Our Oath team's integration of AOL and Yahoo is ahead of our internal expectation.","We are confident in the execution of our strategy to drive profitable growth, generate strong cash flows and produce long-term value for our shareholders. The board of directors demonstrated our commitment to return value to our shareholders when they declared the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase last month.","We will start by reviewing the third quarter segment operation performance, followed by a progress update on our new businesses, a walkthrough of consolidated results and finally network and technology updates.","Now onto the wireless segment on Slide 5. Our wireless business delivered another strong quarter of operational performance in a highly competitive environment. We grew and retained high value postpaid customer relationships profitably. In August, we expanded our postpaid unlimited data plan to include a lower price access entry points, which provides consumers with more choices to experience the leading 4G LTE network with confidence in our networks we are now addressing a larger market with Unlimited.","Given our clear and comparable service value proposition, momentum continued in the quarter. Smartphone net adds were 486,000 versus 242,000 last year. Total postpaid net additions were 603,000 included [four] (Ph) net adds of 274,000, 91,000 tablets and 238,000 other connected devices led by wearables. We added 30,000 postpaid accounts versus a loss of 107,000 last year.","Total retail postpaid churn was 0.97% for the third quarter which improved by seven basis points year-over-year. postpaid's phone churn was 0.75% and was the main driver of the improvement in total postpaid churn. Postpaid device activations were nearly 9.8 million of which 82% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rates was 5.5%.","During the quarter, 6.1 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Prepaid net adds were 139,000 for the quarter with an increased focus on the smartphone value proposition. Additionally, we have recently expanded our offering to allow families the flexibility to combine different prepaid plans at a great value.","Let's turn to Slide 6 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability. Total wireless operating revenue declined 2.4% in third quarter as compared to a 3.9% decline a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, service revenue declined 5.1% versus a 6.7% decrease in the previous quarter. sequentially service revenue increased for the first time in 12 quarters.","The key drivers of overall improvement in service revenue include increased access revenue through customer migration to higher access points. New account formation and the tail end of the transition of customers to unsubsidized pricing. We now have approximately 78% of the postpaid phone base on unsubsidized plans as compared to 60% a year ago. We expect the service revenue trends to continue to improve in the fourth quarter and to exit the year with a decline of less than 4% year-over-year.","In the third quarter, equipment revenue increased 5.5% due to a higher device payment plan take rate. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 77% in the quarter, which is consistent with the prior period. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the fourth third quarter to increase seasonally due to heightened consumer equipment activity.","Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance at the end of the quarter. Wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.2%, up slightly sequentially and up from 44.9% a year ago. In the fourth quarter, we expect the improvement in service revenue to flow through wireless EBITDA margin partially offsetting pressures in highest seasonal volume, advertising expenses and promotional activity.","Let\u2019s move next to our wireline segment on Slide 7. Total reported wireline revenue grew 1.1% including XO operations and data center divestitures. On an organic basis, wireline segment revenue decreased 2.7%, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Our fiber offerings continue to gain share and grow revenue partially offset in a decline in legacy copper products.","Consumer markets revenue increased 0.9% driven by Fios Internet activity. Consumer Fios revenue grew 4.6% including the impacted two markey Pay Per View events during the quarter. Verizon was recognized by a leading third-party study as the top rated residential internet provider for customer satisfaction in the Fios footprint.","Fios Gigabit Connection, which launched earlier this year continues to gain traction offers symmetrical speed of up to one gigabit per second. We added 66,000 Fios Internet Customers in the quarter. Fios Video results were pressured due to the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings, as well as competitive promotional activity. Fios Video losses were 18,000 in the quarter.","Enterprise Solutions revenue excluding XO, decreased 5.0%, while growth in fiber based products continues. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was down 5.3%. Partner Solutions revenue declined 3.9% on an organic basis, which is an improvement over prior period. Within business markets, fiber revenue is increasing, driven by demand for Fios broadband products.","On an organic basis, total revenue declined 5.8% year-over-year. On a comparable basis, the third quarter wireline EBITDA margin was 21.1%, compared to 20.3% a year ago and up 40 basis points sequentially driven by ongoing costs control measures.","Let\u2019s move next to Slide 8 to discuss our progress in new businesses, starting with media. During the quarter, our Oath team has been executing on more than 20 integration work streams. We are positioning the business for the future, locking in early synergies and setting out a roadmap for the next several years with the expectations to realize $1 billion in operating expense synergies through 2020.","With the addition of Oath, Verizon's addressable market has expanded from millions of wireless and wireline customers to about one billion global content consumers. We are combining the best aspects of AOL and Yahoo to create a uniform and integrated platform to drive engagement and consumer value.","Oath revenue is $2 billion for the quarter, we will provide additional information on Oath in future quarters as we progress through the integration phase. Telematics revenue was over $220 million in the quarter including Fleetmatics and Telogis. Total IoT revenue on an organic basis increased approximately 13% in the quarter.","Let's move next to Slide 9 to wrap up with our consolidated results for the quarter. The solid segment results in the quarter and addition of new businesses drove improvements in the consolidated top-line reported results. In the third quarter, total operating revenues were higher by 2.5% on a reported basis. On a comparable basis, excluding divestures and acquisitions, consolidated revenue declined to 2.3%.","Similar to recent quarters, the primary driver was the year-over-year decrease in wireless service revenue. On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, adjusted EBITDA margins was 36.7% up slightly from prior year's margin of 36.5%. We are focused on driving profitability through cost and capital efficiencies across our business. As Lowell announced in September, we have targeted $10 billion in cumulative cash savings over the next four years.","Let's turn now to cash flows in the balance sheet on the Slide 10. We had a strong quarter of cash generation supporting our consistent capital allocation program and returning value to shareholders. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $17.2 billion including working capital pressure primarily due to the $3.7 billion of device payment plan receivables.","Year-to-date capital expenditures were $11.3 billion with the sequential with a sequential increases in the quarter driven by increased spending in wireless, supporting growing network demand, while prepositioning for 5G. We expect full-year 2017 capital expenditures to be at the lower end of the guided range of $16.8 billion to $17.5 billion.","Free cash flow from the first nine months of the year totaled $5.9 billion, which included a net after tax discretionary pension contribution of $2.1 billion. In addition, our free cash flow does not include proceeds from asset backed securitization which we initiated in the third quarter of last year.","we did not executing an asset back securitization during the third quarter, but have generated $2.9 billion year-to-date from our ABS borrowings. Over the last few days, we completed our third public ABS transaction this year to $1.4 billion.","The impact of device payment plans and on balance sheet securitization is expected to approach a steady state by year-end, reducing working capital headwinds during 2018. We anticipate working capital fluctuations throughout the year due to seasonality in wireless equipment volumes.","We ended the quarter with the $117.5 billion of total debt, comprised of $109.6 billion of unsecured debt and $7.9 billion of on balance sheet securitizations. Our near term unsecured maturities are modest at $2.3 billion through 2019. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business.","Let\u2019s move next to Slide 11 to discuss our network and technology. Our industry leading wireless and wireline networks are the cornerstone of our strategy and we consistently invest to ensure that we have capacity to serve growing demand technology to reduce the cost of serve and a network position to lead the industry into the future. We continue to win awards in third-party studies, a test to combination of coverage, speed and reliability.","Based on the confidence in our network, we broaden to unlimited options to offer more customers and unmatched unlimited experience on the best wireless network. As expected, the introduction of unlimited pricing plans has increased the LTE network usage across various busy timeframes and geographies as our customers enjoy the experience of consuming more data throughout the day.","We are more affectively utilizing existing network capabilities and service plan features to handle the increased traffic without interrupt in the quality of the customer experience. Just over 50% of our available low and mid-band spectrum portfolio is being used 4G LTE.","Network reliability and resiliency are critical elements to our wireless network, we are thankful and proud of the work performed by our employees during the tragic natural disasters in Texas, Florida and Northern California, who ensured they are first responder and all of those effect who were able to relay on our network in the time of need. We maintained a high level of performance through our planning, network redundancy and rapid response despite wide spread power outages.","Although, we are not a wireless network operate in Puerto Rico, we have offered assistance to the local carriers and government officials as they work to recover from unprecedented hurricane damage. We are steadily investing in the network of the future, which we called a Verizon Intelligent Edge Network.","This network has many components the lead to a multi-use software driven network upscale. It goes from the wireless or wireline access networks to intelligent distributed computing platform to a highly automated software enabled core network. This architecture enable by a dense flexible radio network with deep multi-used fiber that we have been building for years.","As we seen new use cases, this Intelligent Edge Network architecture will meet the new types of application demand. We will leverage these in [HART] (Ph) network capability such as latency, throughput and security to create network slices that will be tuned to the specific needs of each application.","Our pre-commercial 5G fixed wireless broadband trials are continuing, live customer experiences on the network provide key data and learnings that will give us valuable insights for commercial deployments. We are on-track to share trial results later in the fourth quarter. Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G industry standards and the ecosystems are fixed in mobile. Global development is accelerating based on our work alongside industry partners for multiple used cases.","Let\u2019s move next to Slide 12 to review our strategy for future growth. We are confident in our strategy to drive future growth while delivering near-term results. We are laying the foundation for the network of the future, while maintaining a strong lead in 4G LTE coverage, capacity and reliability. Our focus is on preserving and growing our customer relationships, while expanding our presence in digital media and Telematics.","The execution model is to deliver strong fundamental results, allocate capital to our networks, maintain a strong balance sheet and return value to our shareholders. Our wireless value proposition is evolved to allow more customers to experience unlimited wireless plans on the best U.S. networks. We produce solid operational and financial performance across the business in a competitive environment while investing in our best-in-class networks and driving near-term cost efficiencies.","Our long-term strategy is to change people's lives by delivering the promise of the digital world while leading the industry and innovate for future technological application. 5G provides a path for growth with fixed and mobility use cases with 4G interoperability. The 5G ecosystem is progressing with [standards] (Ph) and technology development and we are prepositioning our network with fiber investments, spectrum resources and cloud architecture.","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so that we can get to your questions.","Michael Stefanski","Thank you Matt. Eunice, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the Question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Simon Flannery","Great, thank you very much. Good morning. Matt, you mentioned the $10 billion cost reduction program. Could you just give us a little bit more color around some of the buckets on that and how should that layer through the next four years. and then on Unlimited, any updated stats on what percent of your base or what percent of your new customers are taking that plan and obviously since you changed it to the two or the three plans who's taking the lower rate plan versus the higher is that splitting more towards the higher ARPU plans. Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks Simon and good morning. So on your first question around the $10 billion books, Lowell announced that last month, since then we have put a dedicated team against that and we are starting to get around that work. It's a little early to get into some of the specifics of the timing of when you should see that, but in terms of bucket that's going to come across.","Really think about all of the all parts of the business are in focus here, whether that\u2019s the network, whether that be distribution and care and even to obviously the shared service parts of our business and across the complete supply chain.","We are going to take a deep look across the whole business and identify areas where we have the opportunities to significantly improve the efficiency on how we operate the business. As we get further into that program, we will share more specifics overtime both on where the savings are going to be realized from and also the expected timing, but I think we are off to a good start with it.","In terms of your second question around Unlimited and the new price plans. I would tell you that between Unlimited and the Verizon 2.0 that we introduced last summer, we now have approximately two-thirds of the base on planned where they could control their over expense. And so that's up as you would expected from where we were a quarter ago and that's obviously a significant part of the base now has the ability to do that.","The mix is as expected between the two plans, we are not going to go into the specifics of each of those. I would tell you though that in the third quarter what was - we saw as we expected the migration of existing customers from data bucket plans to Unlimited plans shifted to where on average they were stepping up in revenue from their bill prior.","And as we expected, we knew that initially we would see optimizes who had the opportunity to move to Unlimited and save money, we saw that in this first quarter as we introduced those plans. In the second quarter, we continue to move through that by the end of the quarter essentially that was flat that customer\u2019s migrated over. And then in the third quarter, we got to the point where the customers migrating over actually increasing and you saw the increase in [indiscernible] sequentially from 2Q to 3Q for the first time in three years. So we are seeing good progress there.","Simon Flannery","Great. Just one quick follow-up. Any impact then on 2018 or is it really going to be ramping through 2018, so the impact is more 2019, 2020 from the 10 billion.","Matthew Ellis","You will see some impact in 2018, but it\u2019s a cumulative number over those four years, but absolutely, we will see benefit in 2018.","Michael Stefanski","Simon, thank you. Next question Eunice.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Hodulik","Great. Matt, couple of questions on the wireless sort of the growth and profitability. First on the upgrade, saw a low number in the third quarter. As you guys look after the fourth quarter do you think that changes and maybe bounces back a little bit, like maybe won\u2019t see as much seasonality you typically do, we are basically trying to get a sense whether it\u2019s sort of a lack change in the technology or just customer at this point waiting for their turn to come out?","And then related to Simon\u2019s questions, you saw sequential growth in service revenue for the first time in a while this quarter and it sounds like these trends are sort of inflecting. So could you guys return to sort of year-over-year growth sooner than the third quarter next year given those underlying trend you are seeing in ARPU? And related to your comments about margins, does that mean that we might not see the typical downdraft in margins, we typically do in the fourth quarter given the flow through effects that you mentioned?","Matthew Ellis","Yes, thanks John. So as you mentioned the upgrade rate in the third quarter was a little lower than we have seen in past years. I think what you are seeing there is difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we have historically seen. Obviously Apple is part of that with splitting the new devices between the eight, which came out in 3Q and the ten which comes out in 4Q.","But also on the Android OS side of the house with having the new Google device coming out this month as well. I think you are going to see more of \u2013 we would expect to see a shift is some of the volumes versus typically from 3Q to 4Q. So look as we get into the holiday season some of those new devices come out, we think, we will see strong demand and look if you are paying a $1000 for a new handset you are going to walk not to be on a good network. So we are very confident that we will get more than our fair share of that activity when it comes through in the fourth quarter, but obviously, we will wait to see exactly how that plays out.","In terms of the sequential revenue trends and as you highlighted, we were up in service revenue from 2Q to 3Q. That was in-line with our expectations as we discussed on the last call. As you start to see combination a number of factors. We have largely migrated the consumer base to unsubsidized pricing, it was 78% in 3Q, 75% in 2Q. So that transition is largely done and so you are no longer seeing as much of a headwind from the reduction in the line access fee. And as I mentioned, we are starting to see step up and migrate is over.","In addition to that, we increased the number of accounts for the second quarter in a row, so you got the total volume in the business up as the rate we are getting from customers going up too. So as I said in the script, we expect to be inside of 4% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, and as I have said previously, I expect that we will get to service revenue growth during 2018.","In terms of your questions around margins, it's a little too soon to say where they will play out in the fourth quarter. Obviously as we are now on unsubsidized, we don't have the same subsidy headwind, but we will see what the environment is like in the fourth quarter competitively and we will respond as necessary. So we will see where that shakes out between now and the end of the year.","John Hodulik","Great, thanks Matt.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks John. Eunice, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you can maybe unpack the improvement you continue to see in postpaid churn, particularly phone churn. You obviously have a much better visibility into your customer base and than we do. So for example, to what extend do you think that this is a structural improvement in churn as a result of customers moving into Unlimited plans and other plans where they can control their overage. To what extent do you think it might just be that the seasonal pattern of device launches has been moved a bit and so it could see it moved back to prior levels as we go through that cycle.","And then just as an extension of this question of this question. Some of your competitors have been looking to lower churn by including free or just deeply discounted streaming video products as part of their bundles. I'm curious whether that's something that you think would make sense for Verizon as well. Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks Brett. Look I would say as I look at the churn number, we have always had a good churn number, it's obviously 0.75 continues to trend that we saw in the second quarter and really continues the trend since we saw mid February when we launched Unlimited. And as we said at the time, the key driver of launching Unlimited was to protect our pace of customer which we think is the best and most valuable set of customers in the industry.","So look there is a number of things that go into that, but I would tell one of the biggest thesis is the network experience that Verizon customers have, they get to see that they understand the reality of our network experience versus some of the others and so we saw that with some of the recent natural disasters that customers on our network understands that when things really matter Verizon is a network they want to be on. So that continues to be key part of it and I believe we can continue to have very good churn without necessarily the bundle in other aspect into the core offering.","Brett Feldman","Is it fair to say that you would expect on a seasonal basis going forward. So for example, this fourth quarter you still think you might do better than you did a year ago even if there is an uptick in devices and maybe industry wide churn.","Matthew Ellis","You mean to better year-over-year [indiscernible] number?","Brett Feldman","Yes.","Matthew Ellis","Yes, I think look we have seen that since we launched Unlimited and we had a clear and comparable offer in the marketplace. We have demonstrated that our customers prefer being on Verizon rather than moving somewhere else and I have no reason to believe that will change in the fourth quarter as we go forward. So very confident that we will see that trend continue.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks Brett. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","David Barden","Hey, guys. Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I guess just a couple. First, Matt, you kind of highlighted the impact of divestitures and acquisitions on the revenue line which was about a 5% swing versus the reported numbers. Could you maybe walk that down through EBITDA and then to earnings with respect to all the different moving parts year-over-year?","And then second, Lowell was pretty widely reported as talking about working on a content type of program or partnership or acquisition as you worked into the back part of the year. Could you elaborate a little bit more on kind of what the goal is for that project and maybe how it ties to your plans for launching your own over-the-top video products? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Yes, so I will start with the second one there. So with respect to Lowell\u2019s comment around content and potential deal for usage rights. I would say, we are continuing to work that particular transaction Lowell, when he made that common expected it would be done by now. Unfortunately it just taken a little longer to [indiscernible] fully expect to see something there as we move forward.","In terms of the over the top, really nothing new to add versus what Lowell said last month. Look this is a space what we think there is an opportunity for us to play, we think that makes sense for us to play in that space, but we don\u2019t want to launch just a me too type product. So we are continuing to look at what makes sense for us to launch something that\u2019s differentiated in that space, probably around live programming, but how and when we launch something will be TBD.","In terms of the, your questions around the M&A side. Obviously the revenue line, we brought Yahoo and you brought XO and those brought revenue on day one, when you close a transactions or same thing with the Telematics businesses as we closed in the back half of last year, but initially especially the Telematics businesses and Yahoo not significant.","The EBITDA or EPS line maybe a little bit of pressure, the EPS line if anything about $0.04 on a year-to-date basis. And then they also bring depreciation and amortization, which is why there may not a huge amount of pressure at the EBITDA line, but as you move down the income statements of operating income and EPS, we see a little pressure this year. As we expand those businesses going forward we expect them to contribute in the future.","David Barden","Great. Okay, thanks.","Michael Stefanski","Eunice, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Rollins","Well thanks for taking the question. Two if I could. First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the three to five year view for wireless. Can you just help us understand the Verizon\u2019s expectations with the investments you are making, the technology that you are deploying? How investor should think about top-line growth over a more extended period of time?","And then secondly, if you could delve into a little bit more detail on some of the businesses you have acquired in over the last couple of years. In terms of Oath and Telamatics and how should investors think about the growth of those businesses over the next couple of years as well on the top-line especially? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Yes, thanks Mike. So look, as you think about the while this business going forward and obviously I\u2019m going to talk specifically about our views on 2018 and so on. We will have those discussions when we get to January. But you think of the business overall, we are very confident with where seeing the growth start to migrate to we talked about the trends in service revenue, the fact that we should expect those to get back to positive during 2018 once we have worked through the transition fully from subsidized to unsubsidized pricing.","We think it will continue from there, we will continue to add net adds to the business based of the quality of the network. And then the network will continue to expand the capabilities as we transition to 5G and we think that will give us other opportunities to expand the wireless business going forward.","So we are very confident in the future trajectory of the business there and obviously as we think about three to five year view, the overall GDP is going to play into that. But as I think about 5G and what it\u2019s going to do for the business going forward, and then as I think about the new businesses coming in, and contributing as we expand those and then continuing to work on the cost side of the business as Lowell described last month. I don't think that you're going to recognize the business five years from now versus where it is today.","Michael Rollins","If I could just follow-up on that point, the wireline business is something where you upgraded significant amount to fiber, but you also have some copper, you're competing for a full - bundle in a lot of your market, but you're smaller relative to some of your video competitors. Have you thought about doing something different in the wireline business in terms of the way the footprint will look, whether it's through 5G or other investments in the wireline business or other strategic options for that assets.","Matthew Ellis","Yes, so there is a lot in that question Mike. So look fundamentally as you think about the wireline business you're thinking about really two assets there, you have got the legacy copper business which continues to have a secular declines across our set of customers, whether that the consumer, enterprise, small business whatever.","And then you have the fiber side of that business where we see continued growth and demand. And that's just not within the [indiscernible] footprint, its more international sales. So if you think around we have had the Ultra-Long-Haul backbone for a number of years now, earlier this year we expanded that with the XO acquisition which added fiber metro rings in the 45 of the top 50 markets. We obviously have significant fiber in the Northeast corridors, we have been building Fios over the last 10 years.","So you should expect to see the fiber side of the wireline business continue to grow and become more relevant and then as part of that you have got the convergence of the network between the fiber network and the wireless network as we [indiscernible] 4G and preposition for 5G. So as we go forward here we think that the combination of those networks is incredibly important.","Michael Rollins","Thank you.","Michael Stefanski","Mike thank you. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.","Craig Moffett","Hi, thanks. First Mike, I just wanted to say congratulations on a terrific career in IR and thank you on perhaps all the help you have given us and Brady congratulations on your new position as well. I wanted to ask about consolidation, because it's obviously the top - and from what Sprint and T Mobile has said, we could see an announcement as early as next week. Can you talk about how you think a Sprint, T Mobile merger will change the competitive landscape and would you argue to the SEC and [indiscernible] in favor of approving a transaction like that?","Matthew Ellis","Yes Craig, look I would tell you, there is a lot of various rumors and so on around the industry overtime around various M&A activity and I\u2019m not going to comment on other people\u2019s businesses. I would tell you, we have the right set of assets to compete irrespective of the industry structure and that\u2019s what we are focused on and I\u2019m very confident in our ability to be successful however things play out with other people?","Craig Moffett","Thanks. Could I ask, since there\u2019s not much to say on that topic, one separate question then? Could you update us on the 5G fixed wireless broadband trials, what you are seeing and how that informs your expectations for what you are going to do in 2018?","Matthew Ellis","Absolutely. So we will have more specifics on that later in the quarter and we will get the right folks talking about that. But I can say the trials are going very well and we are getting a lot of good experience using the millimeter wave spectrum and some other things we are seeing whether it\u2019s a fact that we can deliver service without needing line of sight, whether it\u2019s think about MDUs and the number of floors we can deliver service to being more than we expected.","We have experienced delivering service in MDUs above 20 floors, which is more than we thought it would be going into the trial. So a number of good things coming out of the trials, we will get back to all of you later in the quarter with more specific details on the results of the trials and what that means for 2018, but nothing has change about our intent to launch the fixed wireless broadband offering during the course of 2018.","Craig Moffett","Okay, bye guys.","Michael Stefanski","Thank you. Next question please Eunice?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Michael McCormack","Hey guys thanks. Matt, in the prepared remarks, you talked about over-the-top and some of the video pressure that we have all been hearing about a lot more recently. How do you guys look at that? When you look at the customers leaving you, is it leaving just the video piece of it and maintaining the broadband connection or are you just seeing a shift to different providers generally?","And then secondly, the spread between those making device payments in wireless versus those that are on unsubsidized plans, how many of those in your best estimate are people that actually were making a payment plan to you guys, pay off the phone and are opting into sort of a lower price point instead of upgrading the phone?","Matthew Ellis","Yes, thanks Mike. So look on your first question. There is really nothing new here to us in terms of the trends we have been seeing over the past few years around whether it\u2019s cord-cutting or [cord-nevers] (Ph) or whatever else. In fact, we have spoken in the past two or three years ago, we really started to speaking about this and the fact we said the traditional linear TV bundle is not long-term sustainable and you saw our reaction to that when we launched some of the different plans that we launched at that point in time.","But so, we are not surprised by what we are seeing around the TV, but I would tell you what is important, when you move to over-the-top for your video entertainment, the quality of that broadband connection becomes more important than ever and if you want a quality broadband connection Fios and fiber to the home connection is the best option out there. And we continue to see strong numbers on the broadband side of the business as a result of that and we are very confident that the Fios Internet offering will continue to be very strong in the marketplace.","As I think about the spread between the unsubsidized and the subsidized payments. Look, what you have here is you do have customers who were on subsidized pricing, get to the end of two-year contract and they then move to unsubsidized pricing and not necessarily getting there through upgrading to a new device and do a net on device payment plan.","But that migration as we say is largely completely now have 78% of the base which meets virtually all of the consumer bases now on unsubsidized pricing. So as we go forward here the gap between the this year and the last year number will get narrower and narrower. And that's what is going to help drive the service revenue trajectory improvement as we go forward here.","Michael McCormack","And Matt I'm sorry just quickly on the hurricane issue, you guys called out the one penny impact. But anything with respect to volumes in wireless that may have been even better as the hurricanes might have?","Matthew Ellis","Certainly we had in both Huston and Florida, we have period of times when our stores were closed and certainly that\u2019s an impact. But we also saw good volumes as soon as those stores reopened, customer realizing in times like that you want to be on the best network and so we saw an uptick as soon as those stores reopened.","And I have to get credit to our teams, whether it be on the network side and all the things they did and also our teams in the distribution side of the business, getting those stores open incredibly quickly after those storms, they did a fantastic job.","Michael McCormack","Great. and congratulations Mike and Brady.","Michael Stefanski","Thank you Mike. Eunice Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Jennifer Fritzsch","Great, thank you for taking the question. Matt if I may, I just wanted to ask on fiber we have all been brought up to be believe fiber is really expensive to deploy. And yet we see you coming into the lower end of your CapEx range. I'm not asking you for guidance on 2018, but are you seeing some savings with these XO properties. Are you deploying those laterals yet, or is that going to be more kind of a 2018 event?","And then if I also just could ask on the other element of 5G spectrum. I think [indiscernible] you feel comfortable with spectrum might that not even sit in the spectrum auction. Can you talk a little bit of how you as you look at your inventory are you feeling comfortable still with what you have? thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Yes, so I'll answer the spectrum question first. We believe that we have a great portfolio of spectrum. As you look at the 4G network only approximately 50% just over 50% of our spectrum portfolio server in that network today. We have got additional spectrum assets that will serve that network in 2018 whether that the [Refarm] (Ph) and 850 and PCS or whether it would be put in the AWS-3 to work.","And additionally as you move into the 5G world, we look forward to closing the straight path transactions and the XO spectrum transaction as head into 2018. So we are comfortable with our spectrum positions. As we think about future auctions we will wait to see what is in there or make assessments at that time. but very comfortable with the portfolio we have today.","And as obviously as we think about added capacity to the network we have more than spectrum as the tools available to us as we go forward, and we have talked about the different technology and architecture tools with LTE Advance and all the different pieces in there. We continue to be able to add capacity as we move to more software defined networking and those type of tools and in obviously densification.","And that densification based of having more fiber available in the network. So to get to your first question, we continue to deploy fiber and we will continue to do that as we head into 2018 as you say I'm not going to talk to 2018 CapEx at this time, but you should expect to see us continue to be deploying fiber around the country as we go forward to service both wireless but also customers across the rest of our businesses and getting into IoT applications as well.","Michael Stefanski","Jennifer thank you and Eunice next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks very much. I was wondering if I could build upon the prior questions around your spending trajectory. If we think about this lower-end CapEx target for the year, how should we consider the outlook against that backdrop of investment? Clearly, focusing on network quality is a clear focus for you folks. I\u2019m just trying to unpack the commentary a touch, whether it\u2019s a shift in some of the spending priorities that\u2019s taking place that\u2019s enabling you to get to the lower end? Are we seeing inflection with the benefits from software-defined networks flowing through the business at this point? Or anything to that effect, Matt?","Matthew Ellis","Yes, good question, thank you Amir. So as I think about the CapEx for the year and where it\u2019s coming in towards the lower end of the range. That\u2019s still going to be around 17 billion of spend, so certainly not in significant number. Some of this is just a timing of the activity with the network teams between 2017 and 2018l. But look, I would tell you that the key thing here and you talk about has there been any shift in priorities and I would say absolutely not.","The priority to continue to invest in the network whether that\u2019s adding capacity for the networks today or pre-positioning the network and being at the leading edge of building the future network technologies, that priority is unchanged and as we had into 2018, you will see that we will continue to spend to continue to do exactly those things. So no major change there, as we head into 2018, more spending on fiber as we pre-position for 5G and continue to make sure we have the leading network.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks a lot, and one follow-up, if I may. In touching upon that 5G commentary, in recent weeks, we have seen some notable developments around the broader ecosystem, in particular the announcement with Qualcomm to accelerate the global 5G standard in millimeter wave spectrum. It seems like mobile 5G, in terms of its availability, is now being pulled forward. Is that going to affect the type of services that you plan to offer? Could we see mobile 5G a bit earlier than anticipated here? Any color to that effect would be great.","Matthew Ellis","Yes. So I think we were very proud to be part of that announcement with Qualcomm earlier this week and really what you are seeing there is as we have talked about now for the past two to three years. We said if we put our shoulder behind 5G development. We think, we can accelerate versus some of the timing of safety place. And in fact, there were some people who were saying they didn\u2019t even think 5G was going to be real and if you be able to use millimeter wave spectrum.","So we have demonstrated that by our effort so far, we have brought the ecosystem together, we have push forward the timing of standards coming forward and not surprised by any of that at all. It\u2019s exact as we expected. In terms of the timing of mobile 5G, it\u2019s certainly not a 2018 activity.","But you talk about does it change our view on the types of services we will be able to offer, absolutely not. We have seen a wide range of services that we will be able to offer on 5G has - why we have been so excited about it, quite frankly and while we put our shoulder behind get in the ecosystem to move faster on this than they otherwise would have been and we look forward to being in position to offer those services in the years ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks very much for the input.","Michael Stefanski","Thank you and Eunice we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Horan","Thanks guys. And just upon the CapEx again. Matt are you seeing any benefits from kind of the [SDN] (Ph) in terms of pricing of equipment. And can you just talk about as you move to 5G. should we think about CapEx stepping up a couple of billion dollars a year? there is a lot of articles in the press over the last couple years that it might talk close to $20 billion $50 billion to build out a nationwide 5G network. Any color around that would be great.","Matthew Ellis","Yes so thanks Tim. So in terms of benefits from SDN and so on, let me show as you not just SDN but also network function, virtualization it does allow the value of some of the hardware you put in the network to change overtime, and how you operate network moves more to the underlying software there. So I think we will see those trends as we continue to expand the network.","In terms of deployment of 5G, I think some of the people who are estimating those numbers are getting ahead of themselves and it\u2019s just too early to tell. So as we have more visibility into the timing of spend around 5G we will share that with you, but it's way too early at this point and I'm not going to comment on those estimates.","Timothy Horan","And then just lastly on the $10 billion of expense reduction. How much of that do you think you'll reinvest and maybe growth in the business. I guess how should we would be think about the longer term margin trend over the three to five year period?","Matthew Ellis","Yes, so as you think about the money, really wants to be generate those savings it becomes part of the overall pull. But I'm excited about the opportunities that the teams are developing to grow the business going forward and it's important that we make sure that we have the resources in the business to invest in those things. and we can't be investing in those things if we have inefficiencies in the core business to that point in time. So we just think it's a responsible thing to do to make sure that we constantly look at the efficiency of the business and look forward to generating those savings and discussing that more with you in the future.","Michael Stefanski","Tim, thank you and before we end the call I would like turn it back to Matt for a few closing comments.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks Mike. I would like to close the call with the few key points. We remain focused on our strategy to invest in our networks while expanding our high quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We are well positioned to compete in the current environment while leading the industry into the next generation of technology with our strong network of assets. We are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and to generate long-term shareholder value.","Finally before I close the call today, I want to personally thank Mike for this commitment and the support he has given to me and many others throughout his career of Verizon. And we wish him all the best in the future. We will also like to welcome Brady Connor to the IR team. I have known Brady for several years and he will be a great successor to Mike in addition to the IR team.","Thank you for your time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect."],"21400":["Verizon Communications, Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Marley. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. GAAP reported earnings for the quarter were $1.04 per share compared to $1.01 per share in the second quarter of last year. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of this year. The second quarter of last year included $0.10 per share from a gain on the sale of Spectrum, so on an adjusted basis EPS growth was 14.3%. Adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter excluding this prior-year gain was 6%.","Through the first half of the year, earnings totaled $2.06 per share compared with adjusted earnings of $1.76 per share last year. However, as we've consistently pointed out, last year's adjusted EPS would've been about $0.07 higher on a non-GAAP illustrated basis if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for the entire first quarter. On this more comparable basis, the adjusted EPS growth rate for the first half of this year was 12.6%. Beginning this quarter, we are reporting Wireless equipment revenue and Wireless cost of equipment in our consolidated statements of income.","In our Wireless segment, we are reporting the cost of equipment and the cost of service, which were previously combined as cost of service and sales. Prior period detail at both the consolidated and Wireless segment level is included in the financial and operating information schedules on our website. I would also remind you that our Wireline results include the operations that we agreed to sell to Frontier. This will be the case until the transaction closes, which is on track for the first half of 2016. As we pointed out last quarter, the assets and liabilities associated with these operations have been classified on the balance sheet as held for sale, and as such, we are no longer recording depreciation expense.","For the full year, we continue to estimate the earnings benefit to be about $0.12 to $0.13 per share. The acquisition of AOL, which we announced in mid-May closed on June 23. Our balance sheet at June 30 includes the AOL assets and liabilities. Our income statement for the second quarter does not reflect any results of AOL operations for the last seven days of the month due to immateriality. The AOL results of operations will be fully included in the third quarter.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to compete effectively and execute our strategy, which is focused on providing consistent network reliability and a great customer experience. Once again we delivered strong financial and operating results with double-digit growth in earnings and strong cash flows.","We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investment provides the foundation for innovative products and services for future profitable growth. We are committed to building the business for the future through a disciplined capital allocation model that we outlined almost two years ago and continue to execute.","Through the first half of this year we have invested approximately $18 billion in Spectrum licenses and capital for future network capacity. We also invested more than $4 billion to acquire new capabilities with the AOL transaction, which supports our long-term video strategy. In addition, we returned more than $9 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. The $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program was completed in early June, resulting in an overall reduction of 101.6 million shares.","We facilitated these initiatives while keeping our leverage ratio essentially unchanged and remaining on track with our deleverage plan. On the execution front, we had a strong quarter of quality connections growth and profitability in Wireless. We had more than 1.1 million retail postpaid net adds, which included 321,000 net phone additions. We also had very strong customer retention with postpaid churn of 0.90%, down four basis points year-over-year. This was our lowest churn rate in three years.","Total Wireless revenue grew 5.3% and EBITDA increased by 9.1%. Our EBITDA margin on both service and total Wireless revenue expanded on a year-over-year basis. Our Wireline results were once again highlighted by growth in the consumer market, where revenues were up over 4%. Our segment EBITDA margin expanded modestly on a sequential and year-over-year basis.","Now, let's get into our second quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on slide four. Total operating revenue was $32.2 billion in the quarter, and if we exclude the prior-period revenues from the public sector business we sold last year, the comparable growth rate would've been 2.8%. Consolidated top line revenue growth continued to be driven by Wireless and FiOS usage.","We believe that future revenue growth will come from video and the Internet of Things at both the network and platform layers. Over the past several years we have been investing in these platforms and positioning ourselves to capitalize on these new sources of growth.","In terms of video, we will introduce our mobile-first OTT video product in late summer. As you know, we have already announced some initial content partners. Our acquisition of AOL further enhances our video strategy through its digital media and advertising platform capabilities, a portfolio of content brands with a domestic average of about 190 million unique visitors per month, and its loyal e-mail subscription customer base. We are excited to have the very talented people of AOL on the Verizon team and look forward to their contributions to our success.","As far as Internet of Things, we think that the transportation, healthcare, and energy industries in particular present great opportunities for us and we are very active fostering innovation in these areas. We are very well-positioned to capitalize on these new growth opportunities and we will continue to develop business models to monetize usage on our network and at the platform level.","Within our current results, new revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics continue to emerge and grow. These revenues totaled approximately $165 million in the quarter and about $320 million year-to-date. We continue to be focused on reducing our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies while improving the overall customer experience. Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.8 billion, up 6% on an adjusted basis, and our EBITDA margin expanded by 110 basis points to 36.6%.","Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide five. As highlighted a few minutes ago, our capital allocation model is disciplined and consistent. The priorities are to invest necessary capital in our networks to stay ahead of demand, return value to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. The cash flows we generate enable us to execute on this investment strategy, pay competitive dividends and deleverage to further strengthen the balance sheet. In the second quarter, cash flows from operations were $8.7 billion. Through the first half, cash flow from operations totaled $18.9 billion but included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring.","We also continue to securitize wireless equipment installment receivables and received about $1.2 billion in cash proceeds in the second quarter. Free cash flow for the first half of the year excluding the tower proceeds totaled $8.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.5 billion in the quarter and $8.2 billion for the first half of the year. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. We ended the quarter with $113.7 billion of gross debt, net debt of $110.7 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5 times. As I said earlier, our deleveraging plans remain on track.","Now, let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide six. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability, and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. As I said earlier, total Wireless operating revenues grew 5.3% in the quarter to $22.6 billion. Service revenue of $17.7 billion declined 2.2% while equipment revenue increased to $3.9 billion, up nearly 62%. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3%.","For customers who select device installment plans, lower service pricing is exchanged for higher device payments. Equipment revenue, which is largely recognized upfront, is much higher than in the subsidy model. Service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more customers choose unsubsidized devices, and equipment revenues will continue to increase with installment plan adoption. Customer demand for device installment plans has increased. The percentage of phone activations on installments grew to 49% in the quarter compared with 39% in the first quarter and only 18% a year ago. Phone activations on device installment plans totaled $4.7 million in the quarter, and we now have more than 14 million customers on these plans, representing roughly 16% of our postpaid phone base. Looking ahead, we believe that the percentage of phone activations on installment will continue to increase and will likely be around 60% in the third quarter.","In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 9.1%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 56.1%, up 580 basis points. The EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue expanded to 43.9% in the quarter, up from 42.3% a year ago.","Now, let's turn to slide seven and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 109.5 million total retail connections. This does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.2% to 103.7 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.8 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 3.9 million but were down year-over-year due primarily to lower tablet volumes. As I highlighted earlier, we had a very strong customer retention in the quarter with postpaid churn improving both sequentially and year-over-year to 0.90%.","One of our priorities this year was to improve customer retention and we are doing so with a disciplined approach focusing on high value customers. Our retail postpaid net additions of more than 1.1 million were nearly twice the net additions in the first quarter. The quality of the net adds remained very strong with 842,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter. Postpaid phone additions totaled 321,000 as net phone adds of 588,000 were partially offset by a net decline of 266,000 basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 852,000 in the quarter and net prepaid devices declined by 126,000.","Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on slide eight. Total postpaid device activations totaled 11.3 million in the quarter, up nearly 2%. About 85% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We ended the quarter with 70.1 million smartphones in total and our smartphone penetration increased to approximately 81% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise approximately 73% of our retail postpaid connections base. As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continues to drive increased data and video usage.","Approximately 87% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network and overall traffic on LTE has essentially doubled in the past year. About 7.2% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. The quality of our phone base continues to improve as we add new 4G customers and upgrade our basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices as part of our retention efforts.","In the past year, our 4G smartphone connections have increased by 17.8 million or about 40% to 61.6 million. We still have a sizable opportunity remaining with roughly 16 million basic phones and about 9 million 3G smartphones in our postpaid connections base.","We also have a profitable growth opportunity with tablets as they provide good value through increased data consumption and lower churn rate at the account level. We ended the quarter with 9.6 million tablets in our postpaid connections base, so overall penetration is still under 10%. In terms of capital spending, we continue investing for the capacity to further optimize our 4G LTE network and position the network for the future. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.1 billion in the quarter and $5.5 billion for the first half of the year, about 4% higher on a year-to-date basis.","National studies consistently rate Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent reliable performance. Currently, our 700 MHz and AWS-1 spectrum bands, which represent approximately 40% of our license spectrum portfolio are utilized in our LTE network. We are just beginning to reform 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G to 4G LTE in select markets representing the next phase of spectrum to be deployed to serve our growing LTE usage.","Our network densification plans, which includes small cells, DAS nodes and in-building solutions are on schedule. In New York City we are well into our deployment and continue to scale and develop a healthy pipeline. Downtown Chicago is another large urban market with small cell densification plans well underway consistent with what we outlined on our post-auction conference call.","Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on slide nine. In the consumer business, FiOS continues to be the driver of our positive revenue trends resulting in revenue growth of 4.5%. Mass markets which includes Small Business, grew 3.2%. FiOS now represents 79% of consumer revenue. In the second quarter FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8% driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products and higher pay-per-view sales due to the prize fight in early May.","Our FiOS Quantum broadband service continues to scale and with a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, 64% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75 megabits speed tier where 23% of our consumer FiOS customers currently subscribe.","In broadband we added 72,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.8 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.4% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 25,000 in the quarter. In FiOS Video, we added 26,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.7% penetration.","We had strong customer interest in our Custom TV offering. More than one third of our FiOS video gross adds this quarter opted for a Custom TV package. And we also saw a migration demand from existing customers. We will continue to work with content providers on this new product, which so far is ahead of our expectations. While adoption of Custom TV may initially have a negative impact on revenue growth, it should improve profitability.","In the second quarter, we experienced a slowing of FiOS customer growth, which we attribute to triple play offer changes at a time of increased competitive intensity. We have since made some promotional adjustments and our exit rate sales volumes have shown improvement. We are focused on the continued evolution of our Wireline network. In the second quarter, we converted 51,000 copper customers bringing our first half total to 98,000. As I have previously noted post-conversion, we experienced significant improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower cost to serve.","Our agreement with Frontier for the sale of Wireline assets in the non-contiguous states of Florida, Texas, and California is also part of our network evolution as it will enable us to better focus our efforts on the highly dense markets in the Northeast. We are working closely with Frontier to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and assure a seamless transition. We are making progress and remain on track to close the transaction in the first half of 2016.","Let's turn to slide 10 and cover Enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the second quarter lower Enterprise revenue declined 6.4%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure the revenue decline was similar to the first quarter.","Declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continued to outweigh growth in the newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in applications.","In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4.5% in the second quarter, which was better than expected due to some nonrecurring items. We expect continued price compression, technology migration, and other secular challenges to pressure wholesale revenues, which we expect to decline in the 5% to 6% range for the full year.","Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2.2%, which included some FX pressure. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.5% in the quarter, up 10 basis points. We are very committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. The Wireline head count was down 10% year-over-year, and we continue to strive for gains in operational efficiency. As I said, we are far from satisfied and we will continue to work on our cost structure. Capital spending in the Wireline for the first half of the year totaled $2.2 billion, down 19%.","Let's move next to our summary slide. We've had a good first half of 2015 delivering strong financial and operating results with double-digit growth in earnings and strong cash flows. As always, we continue to invest in our networks and platforms to position us for future growth. We are very focused on developing new products and services in mobile video and the Internet of Things. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and become more meaningful in the future. Our acquisition of AOL will be a key piece in our over-the-top mobile video strategy, accelerating our capabilities in digital media and advertising.","We are confident in our ability to sustain profitability. Consolidated EBITDA for the first half of the year was up nearly 6% on an adjusted basis and our EBITDA margin expanded 90 basis points to 37%. In terms of consolidated revenue outlook, we expect third quarter revenue growth to be higher than this quarter. For the full year, our consolidated revenue guidance is for growth of at least 3%. These growth estimates exclude revenue from AOL, which will become part of our results in the third quarter. We continue to target overall capital spending in the range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion in 2015.","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Fran. Marley, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two, if I could. Fran, could you kind of give us a little bit more color on the change in the revenue guidance for the year? Obviously what's different between when you were expecting 4% versus 3%? And then obviously what the moving parts are to get accelerated revenue growth in the second half?","And then I think the second question would be, for the markets reacting to something today, I think it's the sequential movement in the ARPA or the ARPU. And obviously there's lots of moving parts in there. There's the impact of EIP. There is the impact of mix change. But I think the market is also trying to see through those and figure out what the net movement is in terms of people pricing themselves up in the buckets and generating more ARPU versus some of the givebacks and the competitive pressure we are seeing inside the system at Verizon. If you could give us more color on how the net is moving on pricing inside the base, that would be helpful. Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Good. Thanks, David. So at first on the revenue guidance. So, look, I mean coming into this year we set a priority that we said we would protect our base, and I think if you look at the results of the first quarter and the second quarter, the churn speaks for itself, with four basis points improvement from the first quarter year-over-year and then the second quarter year-over-year with the 0.90% being the lowest churn rate in the last three years that we posted up.","In addition, some of the other changes in the assumption fact is the take rate of Edge. I would tell you we never anticipated that Edge would accelerate as much as it has, and looking forward into 3Q being at 60%, that's much higher than we had anticipated but the market has moved us there. And quite honestly it's getting more and more confusing at the frontline so this really translates into simplicity for our customers in choosing the Edge plan, and that's where the market has gone, so that's where we need to compete. And then finally, from an upgrade perspective, going back to protection of our base, we're up 800,000 upgrades year-over-year. So more people are selecting the new price plans when they get a new handset, and that puts us on the Edge which obviously generates more equipment revenue and puts pressure on the service revenue. And coming into this year we knew that service revenue would dilute. We're seeing more dilution than we anticipated because more customers are selecting that Edge plan.","But I think just a couple of things to keep in check here, because when you zero in on one metric, you're walking away with the wrong impression as to what's happening in the overall P&L. So first off, we generated growth in revenue of 5.3% in Wireless this quarter. So if you look at the first half of the year, that's $2.5 billion of revenue growth just in the first half. You annualize that, that's growth that's bigger than some Fortune 500 companies generate in the full year of revenue. So this is still a very healthy business and it goes to what the overall industry is as well. So there's a lot going on in the industry to generate more usage in the future.","So if you look at the IARPA which is the installment plus the revenue per account we're up 2.3%. So if you just focus in on the service revenue, of course that's going to dilute year-over-year, but I think you have to step up and look at the overall financials of Verizon Wireless. In addition, if you look at the connections, we're up 4.3% year-over-year in connections and we're also up in accounts. So when you look out to the future you're adding accounts, you're adding devices, that's also going to be more usage on the network. And obviously the whole future of the industry is based on generating more usage on the network so that people want to use more. And we know from a fact that more people are consuming more video on wireless today than they were a year ago. So that's all part of the strategy.","You look at tablets, we're still less than 10% of the base in penetration of tablets. That's still another growth area for us. Then you look at Internet of Things. Internet of Things is still in early stages for the entire industry. There is more and more devices coming out that's going to generate revenue in the future. And then of course, if you just look at Verizon, we have the whole AOL and OTT launch, which we'll get to. We just launched Custom TV in Wireline, and that in itself will also put pressure on the top line.","So if you think about the Custom TV package, customers are now only paying for what they want to view, and we're only paying the content providers for what our customers want to view. So what you're seeing is you're seeing a decrease in revenue, but you're also seeing a decrease in content cost that actually improves the profitability. So again, I think if you step back and you look at the entire portfolio of what's going on, I think you walk away with a very different conclusion than if you just look at the ARPU because we know that ARPU is going to get condensed with the new EIP plan. So thanks, David, for the question.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Fran.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning. Fran, you talked a bit about productivity and cost initiatives earlier. Can you just update us on the steps you're taking to offset the dilution from the divestiture to Frontier next year? And perhaps in the context of that you can just update us on the union negotiations? I guess that deadline's coming up here shortly. Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks, Simon. So on productivity and cost, look I mean we've been at this now for three years and our VLSS program, Verizon Lean Six Sigma program continues to generate savings. I mean if you just look at Wireline year-over-year down almost 8,000 employees from a year-over-year basis and still generating the great customer service and the volumes that we have there.","So that speaks to the efficiency that we're getting both in the network efficiency side, reduction of over time, and of course as the industry matures now you're looking a lot of houses that already have an ONT on the side of the house. So it's less labor because you're just activating the house that now doesn't really need much of a truck roll to go to it. So there's a lot of efficiency there.","In the Wireless side, a lot of concentration around self-serve and customer service centers. And then we go to structure around the Wireless unit. So we're still on that whole productivity cost routine and we still believe that we have a very full runway in front of us and you're going to continue to see us take cost out of this structure.","If you just look at year-over-year on cash cost alone, if you look at our revenue growth versus cash cost we're really maintaining cash cost at a very slow incremental increase. So that speaks to the efficiency that we're driving through all of our initiatives.","On the Frontier side we still have \u2013 we're expecting to close this transaction towards the end of the first quarter. So we still have about 8 months to 9 months of planning activity. We're well on our way, and I think what we've done in the past speaks for itself as how we'll address this in the future, and obviously I'll talk more about this as we get closer. But we are still designing those plans. Obviously you know Dan Mead is leading that team and he is very diligent in what he's doing to prepare us for the separation of that unit and getting our cost within alignment to offset the stranded cost perspective.","On the union side of the house, just as we know there are in total 27 collective bargaining agreements covering about 38,000 people in nine Eastern states. We began formal negotiations on June 22 and to jump start the negotiations, the company put forth a comprehensive offer on the table, which included wage increases and changes to current contracts to help us manage our cost and increase our flexibility to better serve our customers.","Simply stated, we will need to monetize at our legacy contracts to better position us to compete in the digital age. Given the level of change we are seeking with respect to benefit cost management as well as work rules, our expectation is that the negotiation process will take some time. As you know, it is not unusual for negotiations to continue well beyond the expiration date of the contract, which is August 1.","We intend to work through the process until we achieve a new agreement that addresses the needs of our business and preserves the high quality of our jobs for our employees. So I think, David (sic) [Simon], as far as that goes, that's probably all I'm going to say around the union negotiations. It's early on and we still have a lot of work to do.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Marley, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. I guess, Fran, if you could start on expanding on Custom TV, any update on discussions with programmers there? And are people sort of \u2013 it seems like people are taking smaller packages than they would've otherwise. What's the average number of add-ons and any particular favorites that people are either walking away from or going to? And then second, just a housekeeping issue. I wonder if you can detail for us the impact of AOL on the P&L, just sort of rough numbers on the different areas and how you're going to report that going forward. Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks, Phil. So on Custom TV, I mean obviously we know we were paving the path for a new venture here to give customers what they wanted. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on any litigation matters currently in effect with Disney and ESPN as everyone knows that we're being sued on the contractual arrangement there. So I'm really not going to talk about that. But look, I mean we continue to have a great partnership with Disney and ESPN and we will continue to work through that disagreement in our business relationships.","And I will tell you, if you just look at the over-the-top product, I mean ESPN is participating with college sports in that product. So we will continue to work with ESPN and the lawsuit will take its own course of action. And again, we believe we're in our contractual rights to offer what we're offering.","From a customer selection perspective, I will tell you this has certainly exceeded our expectations. As we saw through the quarter once we launched this, we saw the uptake rate increase. As I said in my prepared remarks, over a third of the customers now coming in are selecting a Custom TV package. I will tell you that as far as the number of genres that they take, it's less than what we anticipated but they are selecting based on their own favorability and I'm not going to get into who selects what and how many we're doing there.","But I will tell you that it is, it will put pressure on the top line but it obviously is going to improve our profitability here from a programming standpoint. So we will continue to work through that. The other thing I wanted to mention on just the growth metrics of FiOS here. As you know, given the disputes that we had in Custom TV, we also were blacked out from many content providers in advertising this product during the quarter. And in two of the biggest markets, both New York and Philadelphia, we were unable to advertise the Custom TV package for approximately 45 days until we worked through that.","So that also contributed to some of the slower growth in FiOS because it took us out of market for that period of time during the quarter. And then of course in addition to that we had the Time Warner Cable separation of the merger, which both entrants came back into the market pretty competitively. So that put some pressure on this as well but even with that, we saw some great progress with the Custom TV package.","On the second piece Phil of AOL, there is nothing included in AOL from a P&L perspective this quarter. We closed it at the end of the quarter. It was totally immaterial and from a cut off perspective it just wasn't materially enough for us to include. However, we did include the opening balance sheet. We've done a preliminary assessment on the fair value of the assets that we acquired. We had an independent third-party do that on a preliminary basis, and that is included in the balance sheet.","So you'll see goodwill has increased for the acquisition as well as our customer list because there was value assigned to the subscription business of AOL. But from a P&L standpoint, there was no revenue or expenses included this quarter. That will be included for the first time in the third quarter and at this point, we will be including that in our overall corporate results for the remainder of this year. And then as I said before, we'll have to wait to see where we go with this \u2013 whether we include it as a separate viewable or we disclose revenues or how we're going to do that in the future, and I don't have an answer yet on that piece. So we'll wait till first quarter and entering into 2016 to give you more of a view into what happens going forward.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Fran.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Marley, next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, and thanks for the comments on the retention efforts. Just as a follow-up to that, you've seen your churn rate in postpaid decline year-over-year for two quarters now. Do you have conviction you're going to be able to see your churn rate sort of stay at a low run rate for the balance of the year in light of your focus on it? And then just you noted that you are still planning on launching the mobile video service this summer. Are we going to see the full rollout this summer or is it going to be something that's going to be phased in over time and just along those lines, where are you with the adoption or the penetration of your multi-cast devices? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks, Brett. So look, first on churn. We've made, as I said coming into this year we were really going to concentrate on protection of our base and I think we've shown that. If you just look at, and we don't really disclose this but if you just look at our basic churn rate, we've seen even double what we've seen in the overall churn rate improvement, so we are maintaining those basic phone customers and converting them into a 4G LTE smartphone device and we're seeing really good progress on that. And that's part of the $80 price point that we have in the market. It's been very, very successful for us in the retention of our customer base. But speaking on the churn piece, I just want to caution everybody, be careful because there is seasonality in the churn. So generally third quarter is a little bit higher than the second quarter but we do believe that we will still be able to improve on a year-over-year basis.","As far as the over-the-top launch, we are absolutely going to be ready to go by late summer. It won't be the full entire of everything that we contemplate within the product set. It'll be an initial launch and as the year goes on, it will progress. So more to come on that but as you know, we have signed up a number of content providers, sports channels, DreamWorks, AwesomenessTV, Vice Media, Scripps, and of course we can't leave out the AOL content that's coming with the acquisition including HuffPost and TechCrunch. So we have a very good lineup. This is a lineup that is really around all live type news clips and sports and events, so very different than what anyone else is bringing to the marketplace. So more to come on that this summer from Marni and Tim Armstrong and his team who now owns this product set.","And then on the multicast, again, as we go through this, all the phones that we sold in the fourth quarter have the capability of multicast other than the 6 and the 6 Plus, and we continue to feed the market with those multicast devices and I can't speak to exactly what the next iconic device will have in it so we'll have to wait to see what that comes out with but this will continue to grow over the next year to have a proliferation of units in the marketplace to make this matter as we continue on with our OTT launch.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the color.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question please, Marley.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks, and good morning. Two questions for me. Fran, first just a housekeeping item. I'm wondering if you could disclose the receivable amount for the equipment installment plan that you sold, both current and noncurrent at the end of the second quarter. And then more strategically, can you talk about how important the Wireline business is for the health and profitability of your Wireless business and how important it is or isn't to keep those two businesses together over time? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Michael. So first off on the receivable, we're fairly flat because keep in mind that we continue to securitize the receivable that removes that receivable from our books. So it's consistently flat between $2.5 billion to $3 billion so it really hasn't changed much. On the overall Wireline perspective, look, I mean, we've sold the three properties in the South, Texas, California and Florida because they were islands to us, very difficult properties to operate from our scale perspective. There's still a lot of copper in those footprints and Frontier does a much better job with that and strategically it just didn't fit for us.","But, look, I think if anyone was to enter the broadband market the East Coast would be the first place that they would go. I mean we have an incredible footprint that stretches from Washington DC up through Boston. The broadband connection to those homes along with our Wireless product and the population of that segment is critical to us and it is a strategic asset for us to continue to market and launch with our Wireless product and over the top is going to feed into more of that as we go in here strategically. So right now, Lowell and I sit and we're very satisfied with the portfolio of assets we have. From an enterprise space, that enterprise asset is very critical to our enterprise customers, both from a Wireless and a Wireline perspective, so they're important relationships to us.","So right now, I mean I'm not saying that if someone didn't come in and take a look at the assets \u2013 as we've always said, we're open to anything. But right now, strategically we are very satisfied with the asset portfolio we have and it's strategic to us. So right now we're content with what we have.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Fran, maybe just a quick comment on margin pacing throughout the year now that we have more Edge uptake, just how we should be thinking about that typical fourth quarter seasonality?","Second, on the Wireless side, anything on your radar with respect to leasing plans? And then just finally on the enterprise piece, I know you mentioned pricing and the competition there. Just trying to get a sense for, is there something going on that's incredibly irrational? Or is it just a byproduct, more competitive in certain areas? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks. So, Mike, on the margin pricing, look I think that the financials speak for themselves and of course we'll get a lot of flavor around how EIP helped the profitability and all this. Bit again, as Mike and I have continued to say, if you look at total revenue and the total EBITDA margin, that kind of neutralizes out the impact of the EIP and you see that we're increasing this year-over-year.","And even if you look at Wireless margin at 56% in this quarter, even if you normalize out the EIP benefit, you're still over 50% margins for that business. So I think it speaks to itself of the \u2013 we continue to be an \"and\" company. We're going to grow and we're going to generate the profitability and we're going to do this in a very disciplined manageable approach. And we've said that we felt that coming into the year that we would hold our margins given all the competitive pressures, and we're still on track to do that.","So I think the margin itself speaks for itself. And from a seasonality standpoint the one thing I would say going back to the change in the revenue guidance is, as we look out into the fourth quarter, keep in mind fourth quarter last year was an unusually very high volume quarter that generated a lot of equipment revenue, and the bulk of our sales were still in the equipment subsidy model. And that hovered around the new 6 and 6 Plus that came out. I just don't see that the next iconic device is going to be substantially different and therefore, I don't see that \u2013 and this is just me speaking, I don't see the volume there in the fourth quarter that we had last year from a total iconic change of the 6 and the 6 Plus. So I think that will also benefit us from just a margin perspective.","On Wireless and leasing plans, look this is \u2013 the leasing plan is just a fancy way to do installment plans. But of course you get another accounting benefit by putting assets up on your books and being able to amortize them below the EBITDA line. So at this point, we have no plans to do any type of leasing arrangement.","And then on the enterprise side, look, as I've said before, 2015 would look like 2014. I still do see some glimmers of hope here especially in the government sector where we're starting to sign some large contracts. But as you know in this business, I sign a large contract today, it takes me at least 12 months to implement that before I start to see the revenue benefit. So I'm looking that there could be some positives here going into 2016 on the enterprise side. Obviously it's being impacted by FX right now.","But this is a very competitive environment with thousands of players who have niches. We do very well on the security side of the house. We're doing well in the data center side on the whole cloud services. But these revenue streams are just not large enough to offset the price compression that we're seeing in IP. But again, I see some glimmers of hope in IP, where maybe it's starting to stabilize again and if that happens then we should see some improvement. But right now it would be a cautious outlook from me.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, Fran.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. First on the Edge take rate, Fran, how high can this go over time? You gave the guidance for 60% next quarter but do you see a time where in the not-too-distant future you could phase out subsidized plans and move all towards these Edge plans? And then the other number that stuck out was the lower churn. You talked about some of the efforts to lower churn. Do you think you can maintain this level of sort of below 1% going forward? Thanks.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, John. So on the Edge take rate, look, I mean this is where the market has gone. If you look at all the advertising in the market, it's around the access point, and this is where we're at. So I think that where we're going to end up here is you'll never get to 100% overall because of corporate accounts and so forth. They're not going to take an installment type plan. So I don't think we ever get to \"100%\" in our base.","But from a consumer standpoint, yes, I could see us getting to where we're more heavily, very heavily concentrated on the installment side of the house, and quite honestly as I said from a frontline perspective it'd be much easier for them to just sell one product. So simplicity is important to us. So you're going to see us, as we gradually move through here, that the market is moving us there so we're eventually going to get there.","From a churn perspective as I said, I think with all the programs we have going, we're making very good progress in our base. Our customers are loyal. You've seen us running our new ads and some of our customers are coming back to us because they were dissatisfied with where they went. So I think that this all proves to again, the basis of how Verizon Wireless has been successful and will continue to be successful is the quality of our network, the consistent performance that our network gives to our customers, and the breadth of that network across the United States. So that's really what it comes to and as I've said before, the number one reason a customer leaves you is because of quality of the network, price is number two.","So the quality of the network still is overwhelmingly more important than price, not to say that customers are not price-sensitive but we think that we can continue to be very competitive and protect our high-value-base. So yes, I do think that we'll continue on this track.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Fran.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Marley, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much and good morning folks. I'm wondering if we could switch gears a little bit in terms of the network investment strategy here, Fran. We start to hear things coming out of Washington \u2013 600 megahertz seems to be like pushing for early 2016 start. First of all, how do you think about the timing on the reality of that happening and how should we think about your strategy around the need for low band spectrum? And then sort of a bigger picture question here, I mean, clearly focus remains on providing a compelling network experience from your side particularly if I think about your CapEx investment and shifting towards Wireless. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about some of the technology evolutions that you folks are embracing. Clearly when we speak to folks sort of in the push to small cells perhaps some of the software defined networking at (51:35) which we haven't seen from any other players, and stuff along those lines to really try and optimize the network throughput, any additional color would be most helpful here?","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So thanks, Amir. So on the networks side as far as the incentive auction goes, yeah, the FCC is now saying that they're going to hold the auction first quarter of 2016, probably at the end of the first quarter of 2016. As you know, they had a meeting on July 16 where they were going to set the rules but that actually got postponed. So we'll have to wait to look at what the auction rules are and decide whether we're going to participate at the appropriate time. The only thing I would say is based on the AWS-3 auction, hopefully the \u2013 we have some lessons learned on what we shouldn't do with a multi-billion-dollar companies giving favorable treatment so we'll have to see where these assessments come out.","As far as our strategy here, the need for low-band spectrum for us is not a great need. As you know, we build out our LTE on the 700 megahertz which is contiguous across the United States, which is a competitive advantage for us. We then launched our AWS-1 spectrum for capacity and now we're in the process of revamping our 1900 PCS. So the key here is to keep in mind that of our licensed portfolio, only 40% of our licensed portfolio supports LTE and 87% of the data traffic is now running through LTE. So if you look at our 1900 megahertz, the yet to be deployed AWS-3 which we bought and will be deployed over the next probably 2.5 years out and then our build strategy, which we came out of the auction within Chicago and New York, we have plenty of capacity to deal with the ramping of what we believe will happen with our OTT product and the continued pursuit of volume in the industry.","So our buildout is on track. We do not necessarily need low band spectrum but that doesn't mean that we would not participate in the incentive auction. Again, we'll have to wait for the rules to come out but obviously we are continuing down the track that we set on coming out of the AWS-3 auction. So at that point we'll have to wait to see what happens with the FCC.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Amir, thank you. Marley, we have time for one more question and if you could queue that up, I appreciate it.","Operator","Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Fran. Following up on Amir's question on spectrum, in the past you have said you would consider a longer-term lease agreement with a potential partner. Is that still the case? Or given your recent comments just now about capacity, what are your current thoughts on any sort of longer-term lease agreement?","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah thanks, Jennifer. Well, I always say you never say never, right? So look \u2013 I mean, we're open to any options, but as far as the leasing of spectrum goes, as I said before, in order to protect the viability of our network and our planning and our capital allocation, this would have to be almost a lease in perpetuity so that you could never be held hostage by anybody because once you deploy a spectrum in your network, if somebody turned around 10 years from now and said, I think I'm not going to lease that to you any more, that would be detrimental to your business, and you can't just \u2013 you just can't let that happen. So I guess under the right terms, and conditions it would be something that we could look at, but I would tell you I think that's very, very difficult given the asset that you're leasing here.","So I think that's the perspective, and we're concentrating on our build. The one thing I didn't answer on Amir's question was SDN, and we're into that. I mean, obviously, LTE in itself is a software-developed network and it gives you the scalability of giving richer network experiences, and our team is working on that and we've been working on that for quite some time. So there's a lot of things that will bring efficiency to the network. I mean, there's CRAN out there. We are in the initial \u2013 obviously 5G is being talked about in the industry, of course Asia is involved in 5G and of course we will start to get involved in the standard-setting around 5G. So there's a lot happening in this industry from a technology standpoint, so spectrum's important, it will always be important, but it's not the only tool we have in our toolbox. So from that perspective, we're concentrating on that strategy that we outlined coming out of the AWS-3 auction.","Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Fran.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey, Marley, thank you, but before we end the call I'd like to turn the call back to Fran for some final comments.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thanks, everybody, and again thank you for joining us this morning. I'd just like to end though at, through the first half of 2015 we continue to execute on the fundamentals, we position our business for the future and we always return value to our shareholders.","On a comparable basis, first half's consolidated revenues grew 3.5%, earnings grew 12.6%, cash flow from our operations was up 11.9%, Wireless revenues increased over $2.5 billion to just under $45 billion. We positioned ourselves for future growth, we acquired valuable mid-band spectrum in the FCC auction, invested $8 billion in capital year-to-date and made a very strategic acquisition in AOL. AOL acquisition greatly accelerates our digital media and advertising platform capabilities, which will become a critical element of our OTT strategy and our revenue growth for the future. We returned $9 billion to our shareholders through the first half of this year, $4 billion in dividends and $5 billion in an ASR program. We certainly look forward to a very positive second half of 2015 with confidence and our ability to execute our strategy and create value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. Thank you again for joining us today, and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator instructions.] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, senior vice president, investor relations.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with our chief financial officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning","Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be available on our website later today.","I would also like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.","This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.","Before Fran takes you through the details, I would like to make you aware of a non-operational item included in the quarterly results. For the second quarter, we reported earnings of $0.78 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include $147 million after tax, or $0.05, for the favorable effect of an interim actuarial remeasurement associated with one of our pension plans, due to settlement accounting.","The noncash credits were due primarily to an increase in the discount rate assumption used to determine our current pension liability. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.73, compared with $0.64 a year ago.","Our discussion of consolidated results and growth rates in this presentation exclude the effect of the nonoperational gain. In addition, the quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone. Our strategic investments in 4G LTE, FiOS, global IP, and cloud services continue to drive strong operating performance. We are executing well in these key growth areas.","Overall, consistent top line growth, along a strong focus on cost efficiency and profitably, resulted in double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share in the second quarter. In fact, we have posted double digit earnings growth in five of the last six quarters.","Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.73, up 14.1%. Year to date, adjusted earnings per share were $1.41, representing 14.6% growth. As you know, our strategy focus is on building networks and platforms as the foundation for innovation and growth.","Underpinning our success is the consistent investment in these networks and platforms, which position us to take advantage of growth opportunities in the rapidly evolving wireless and wireline markets for broadband, video, and cloud services.","Operationally, we are focused on increasing value by delivering products and services to customers in the most efficient and effective way possible. In wireless, our Share Everything plans are a great example. We have simplified decisions for customers, making it easy to add new devices and manage their shared data usage.","Our FiOS Quantum offer, where customers can upgrade broadband speeds themselves, is another example of improving service quality and increasing operational efficiency. Throughout the entire business, there are many examples where Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles are being adopted, and we are realizing efficiency gains in a number of areas, including customer care, supply chain, and system support.","As we move through the year, we are confident that successful execution in our key strategic areas will continue to drive incremental revenue and promote operating efficiency, resulting in sustainable growth in free cash flow and earnings.","Let me shift now to our second quarter performance, hitting a few highlights. Our wireless results were strong, once again effectively balancing growth and profitability. We added 941,000 retail post-paid connections, up nearly 40% sequentially. Service revenue grew more than 8%, EBITDA growth was up double digits, and our EBITDA service margin was 49.8%, solidly within our annual margin guidance.","We also had a strong quarter of customer and revenue growth in FiOS. Revenues were up nearly 15%, and we added 161,000 new subscribers in FiOS internet and 140,000 in FiOS video, roughly 20% more than we added in the second quarter last year.","In global enterprise, strategic services revenue grew 4.8%. Our consistent operating performance, together with disciplined capital spending, is driving higher free cash flow. Through the first half of the year, free cash flow increased by more than 20%, resulting in an improving return on investment profile for the entire business.","Now let\u2019s take a brief look at consolidated results, starting with slide four. Total operating revenue grew 4.3%, sustaining our solid top line growth performance. For the quarter, the increase in consolidated revenues, coupled with effective cost management, resulted in 11.8% growth in adjusted operating income.","On an adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA increased to $10.5 billion, and our EBITDA margin expanded by 90 basis points to 35.1%. Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments, starting with wireless on slide five.","We have emphasized that consistent investment in wireless drives our leadership in network quality, reliability, and the overall customer experience. Our commitment to 4G LTE covers a wide range of activities, including the securing of necessary spectrum, the allocation and deployment of capital for both coverage and capacity, our leadership in fostering a robust device and application ecosystem, and the success of our Share Everything plans in driving device adoption and stimulating usage.","Once again, our second quarter wireless results demonstrate the effective execution of this strategy. Total wireless revenues grew to $20 billion, representing 67% of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue. We sustained strong service revenue growth of 8.3%, making it the third consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 8%. EBITDA increased to $8.5 billion, and our EBITDA service margin expanded by 80 basis points year over year to 49.8%, representing another very strong quarter of growth and profitably.","Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at wireless revenue per account, beginning on slide six. Service revenue growth continues to be driven by increasing connections, smartphone penetration gains, and data usage. The simplicity and value proposition of our Share Everything plans is driving device adoption and stimulating higher usage, resulting in increases in both the number of devices and revenue per account.","During the second quarter, retail post-paid service revenue per account, or RPA, grew 6.4% to $152.50 per month. We have 35 million post-paid accounts, and the average connection per account increased to 2.7, up 5.5%.","Our Share Everything plans have been very successful. The plans have been available since June 28 of last year, and customer adoption has been very strong. In just one year, more than 36% of our post-paid accounts are on a Share Everything plan. The value proposition is simple and straightforward, and customers increasingly recognize the value of shared data across multiple devices.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on slide 7. As I highlighted earlier, we added 941,000 new retail post-paid connections, up from 677,000 in the first quarter, and about 6% higher than a year ago. We also added 97,000 retail prepaid connections, so our retail net connections totaled just over 1 million in the quarter.","As I stated on our last earnings call, we expect to continue to see sequential quarterly net add improvement in 2013. Total retail connections topped the 100 million mark in the quarter. Our industry-leading post-paid base stood at 94.3 million, and we have more than 5.8 million prepaid connections.","Our connections growth was driven by another strong quarter of gross additions. Postpaid gross adds of 3.6 million were up 14.2% year over year. The number of customer upgrades also increased by sequentially and year over year, with a postpaid upgrade rate of 7% for the quarter. We continue to expect that our annual upgrade rate will be about the same as last year. Our upgrades remain high quality, with 36% of customers purchasing a smartphone for the first time.","We also maintained a high quality mix within our postpaid net adds. We added 472,000 in the phone category. Of this total, 974,000 were smartphones, with the balance representing the decline in basic phones. We added 371,000 internet devices, including tablets. The balance of just below 100,000 included Home Phone Connect, Home Fusion, and other connected devices.","Our churn metrics continue to be market-leading. Retail postpaid churn was 0.93%. The sequential improvement was due primarily to an expected reduction in involuntary churn, as discussed coming out of the first quarter.","Next, let\u2019s turn to slide eight and take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations totaled 10.1 million in the quarter, representing both a sequential and year over year increase. We had a high quality device mix once again, with 88% of the activations being phones.","Smartphone activations totaled 7.5 million, and 72% of them were 4G LTE. The smartphone mix was fairly balanced; roughly 51% of the activations were iPhones. Our smartphone penetration continued to improve, and we ended the quarter at over 64%. We had another strong quarter for internet devices. Activations of these devices, which include mobile hotspots, jet packs, and tablets, topped 1 million again this quarter.","Adoption of 4G LTE smartphones and devices continued to accelerate. One-third of our retail postpaid connections are now 4G LTE, compared to just 12% one year ago. 46% of our smartphones, and more than two-thirds of our internet devices are 4G LTE. Currently, 59% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network, which is five times more efficient than the 3G network.","In terms of geographic coverage, we now cover 500 U.S. markets with 4G LTE, and have essentially completed our buildout by matching our 3G footprint. Our LTE network covers more than 99% of our 3G footprint, and when you include our rural America partners, LTE is available to about 301 million across the nation.","Throughout the rest of this year, we will continue to invest, adding capacity to our existing 4G coverage, ensuring that customers are receiving the quality and consistent reliability that they expect from our network and devices. I will cover our capital spending outlook in more detail during our discussion of cash flows.","Let\u2019s move next to our wireline segment, starting on slide nine. Our wireline investments and platforms, such as FiOS, global IP, security, cloud services, and machine-to-machine, enable us to deliver the services and leading-edge applications and solutions that customers want. As these services scale, they will become increasingly efficient, and will help improve our cost structure in the long run.","Total wireline revenues decreased 2% in the second quarter, as growth in FiOS and strategic services were offset by softer global enterprise and wholesale revenue from legacy transport services and CPE.","In terms of wireline segment margin, second quarter EBITDA increased to $2.2 billion, and the margin was 22.2%, up 80 basis points sequentially. We continue to believe we can improve the wireline segment margin in 2014. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the revenue components, starting on slide 10.","In the consumer and mass markets business, we continue to see positive signs, highlighted by sustained FiOS revenue growth. Consumer revenues grew 4.7%, driven by FiOS, which now represents 71% of consumer revenue. Our overall consumer monthly RPU increased 9.4% to more than $109, and we sustained a blended FiOS RPU at over $150 per month.","Two-thirds of our FiOS customers are triple play, which have a higher amount of recurring revenue per month. As I highlighted earlier, we had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In terms of broadband, we had 161,000 new FiOS internet additions and now have 5.8 million subscribers, representing penetration of 39%.","Overall, net broadband subscribers were a positive 45,000. In FiOS video, we added 140,000 new subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 5 million, which is over 34% penetration.","In addition to the customer growth and increased penetration, we are also gaining traction with our FiOS Quantum offers for higher broadband speeds. Sales of our FiOS internet product, at speeds in excess of 50 MB per second, increased during the quarter, and existing customers continue to buy up in the speed. At the end of the quarter, one-third of FiOS internet customers subscribed to Quantum, with speeds ranging from 50 to 300 MB per second.","We continue to make steady progress with copper migrations, increasing the number of service upgrades each quarter. During the second quarter, we converted more than 86,000 customers. Through the first half, our total was 169,000, so we are more than halfway to our target of 300,000 for the year.","This network evolution initiative is important for us as we reduce our dependency on older technologies. Aside from the maintenance expense savings, and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide customers the opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which could result in additional RPU over time.","Another positive result in the quarter was the steady improvement in our residential connection trends. Retail residential connections declined by 5.2%, compared with a loss of 6.6% at this time last year. We expect that continued strength of FiOS, the copper migration initiative, and the benefits of labor contracts and work rule flexibility will have a positive effect on wireline profitably this year.","Let\u2019s move to our enterprise markets next, on slide 11. In the second quarter, global enterprise revenue declined $184 million, or 4.8%. CPE sales, which were down 34% year over year, represented $162 million of the decrease. Excluding the decline in CPE, global enterprise revenue was down less than 1% on a year over year basis.","Strategic services, which now comprise 57% of enterprise revenue, grew 4.8%. In the second quarter, the continued decline in legacy transport services more than offset the growth in strategic services.","We continue to work through economic challenges in the enterprise space. Many of our customers are focused on improving their cost structure, which can result in reduced services with us. In addition, many customers continue to be cautious regarding new investment decisions.","Moving next to global wholesale, quarterly revenues declined $141 million, or 7.7%, due primarily to continued declines in the transport services. Again, our strategy is to better monetize our global IP and fiber network by driving a more efficient migration to next-generation Ethernet services.","In terms of profitably, while growth in the enterprise strategic services is improving the revenue mix, volume declines in the rest of global enterprise and wholesale continue to put pressure on wireline margins. Through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program, we are making good progress in our cost restructuring programs and retooling efforts, which we believe will improve our operating efficiency.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 12 for a discussion of our cash flow results. Our cash generation remained very strong. For the first half of this year, cash flows from operations increased by 12%. Free cash flow was up by more than 21%.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4 billion and were $7.6 billion year to date, up 2.5%. Wireless capital spending in the second quarter totaled $2.3 billion. Through the first half, wireless capex totaled $4.3 billion, 8.6% higher than last year.","As I noted earlier, we have essentially completed our initial LTE buildout by matching our 3G footprint. Throughout the rest of the year, we will continue to invest by adding capacity to our existing coverage as we begin to deploy AWS spectrum throughout the network.","In wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter and $2.9 billion year to date, which was down 5.9% from last year. Strong connections growth, driven by 4G LTE, and our Share Everything plans, has resulted in higher demand forecasts and a need for increased capital investment.","As such, we are increasing our full year capital spending outlook from flat at $16.2 billion to between $16.4 billion and $16.6 billion. We remain focused on improving investment returns and capital efficiency, and we continue to expect our capex to revenue ratio for the full year to improve, even with the additional investments in 4G LTE.","Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was just under $50 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. Let\u2019s summarize on slide 13.","Our second quarter results showed consistently good performance in the key strategic growth areas, so at the halfway point, the key year to date financial and operating metrics are strong: consolidated revenue growth of 4.2%; operating income up 15.6%; adjusted earnings of $1.41 per share, representing 14.6% growth.","In wireless, service revenue growth up a very strong 8.4%; average revenue per account up 6.7%; retail post-paid additions of 1.6 million, up 16.5%; EBITDA growth of 14%, and an EBITDA service margin of 50.1%. We are on track to deliver on our 49-50% margin guidance for the full year.","In wireline, consumer revenue growth of 4.5%, driven by FiOS growth of nearly 15%, 349,000 subscribers in FiOS internet, and 309,000 in FiOS video. We are on track to meet our 600,000-plus FiOS customer growth target.","Free cash flow generation is up better than 20% year over year, and our balance sheet remains very strong. All in all, a very good first half. We are now focused on continuing the momentum, which should result in a strong second half of the year.","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.","Michael Stefanski","Fran, thank you. Operator, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan ","Two around wireless. First, you talked about sequential improvements in adds in the third and fourth quarter. Given that Sprint\u2019s not going to be seeding a number of items into the market, in what\u2019s traditionally not a strong third quarter, can you help us see why you\u2019re more confident there?","And second, can you talk about how you expect margins to track through the remainder of this year? Given the upgrade comment you just made about being flat year over year, that\u2019s a little higher than I would have thought given the commentary, or the change for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about those?","Fran Shammo ","On the sequential third and fourth quarter, it\u2019s similar to the trend that we saw last year when coming out of the first and second quarter. We said we would sequentially continue to see growth in the third and fourth quarter. And again, this is around what we expect the roadmap to be on additional device launches throughout the third and fourth quarter.","But the momentum that we have, and you see that momentum coming out of second quarter, and I\u2019ll talk more to that in a second when we get to the margins, we continue to see this high-quality subscriber coming onto the wireless 4G LTE network, and we don\u2019t see that changing at this point.","From a Sprint and porting ratio, I won\u2019t get into specific individual carriers, but again, pretty consistently positive with all carriers from a porting ratio perspective.","On the margin side of the house, I think we have to put this in perspective. Again, we are fully engaged on the 49-50% guidance that I gave to you in the beginning of the year , and if you look at the first half of the year at 50.1% for the first half and coming out of this quarter at 49.8%.","And I think you have to look at what\u2019s behind that. So if you look at, on a year over year basis, just between the quarters, we improved our profitably by 80 basis points. In that, if you look at that, we moved 7.5 million smartphones. 1.6 million of that was additional smartphones over last year. And then if you just look at the 4G devices, we moved 3.1 million more 4G devices this year than we did a year ago.","And in that, if you look at the service revenue growth of 8.3%, that\u2019s up 100 basis points over where we were last year. So you can see the quality of these adds, and if you take what we added in the quarter of nets, with 472,000 net phone, it\u2019s a pretty good indication of what we\u2019re going to drive from a margin perspective.","And then if you look at the network side of this, with 4G LTE, we now have 33% of our customers on that network, 36% of our customers on shared. We had a growth of 5.5% in the connected devices. And I\u2019ve said that our growth is really dependent on two things. Number one, the 4G LTE network, and as people move over there, the usage of stimulation drives them into higher tiers from a tier perspective on the shared plan.","And then of course the second piece is, as they get on the shared plan, they start to connect all these additional devices. And you can see that with the continued momentum of our internet category and some other things that will be coming to market similar to what we did in the fourth quarter last year as for the camera.","So, combination of all these. I am very confident that we will continue on the margin track that we set out at the beginning of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs ","Fran, there\u2019s been obviously some buzz around Verizon investing in Canada. Maybe you can help us in terms of where you see the opportunity. Is this tied into a roaming footprint? Is it tied to maybe serving your own enterprise customer base? Or is there sort of a consumer retail presence you might have in mind tied to this?","And then second question, on FiOS, very good volumes in what\u2019s generally a seasonally weak quarter. You talked about the 600 plus, that it seems like you have the opportunity to maybe be meaningfully above that result. I\u2019m just wondering, does what you\u2019ve seen in Q2 give you the opportunity to maybe set the bar higher for the year?","Fran Shammo ","On Canada, again, let me emphasize this is really an exploratory exercise for us. As you all know, they\u2019ve delayed their spectrum auction until January.","So, again, we continue to just look at this market. I think it\u2019s everything that you said that we\u2019re kind of looking at. If you look at the population of Canada, about 70% of that population is between Toronto and Quebec. That\u2019s adjacent to the Verizon Wireless properties. Again, if you look at the spectrum auction, it mirrors up exactly what we launched here in the United States on the 700 MHz contiguous footprint.","So we\u2019re looking at all these, but obviously some of the cautions here are the regulatory environment, a foreign investor coming into the Canadian market and what does that mean? So again, cautiously looking at it. Not ready to make any announcements today. And we continue to explore and have discussions, but at this point it\u2019s just really an exploratory exercise.","On the FiOS volumes, again we put a lot of effort around continuing the superiority of the FiOS product. Bobby and his team have done a great job in and around the FiOS Quantum offers and a lot of the stimulated growth that we see here is coming from the Quantum offers that we have, and upgrading those Quantum offers to the 50 and 70 MB per second services.","So look, we set a target for 600,000. Obviously if we can exceed that target, we will. We\u2019re ahead of that target, but I will tell you that the third quarter, again, is always a seasonally challenging quarter for us from a move perspective. So let\u2019s continue on the track that we are, and if we can overdeliver, we will, but we\u2019ve set the target at 600,000.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.","John Hodulik - UBS ","Quick question on wireline and then wireless. First, on wireline, Fran, in your prepared remarks you mentioned a couple of issues driving wireline profitability, that you see some improvement. I just wanted to see if I could get a little clarification. Are you talking about the year over year trends for the whole year? Or just the second half? If you could just sort of fill in the blanks for us, that would be great.","And then secondly, on the wireless capex increase, can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving that? Is it more 4G devices? Is it more usage per device? Or is it maybe the competitive environment and what you\u2019re seeing from other carriers? What\u2019s really driving the change there?","Fran Shammo ","So in wireline possibility, look, we set the bar that said our margin would be flat year over year. Going into obviously in the third and fourth quarters of last year, compared to what we think we can do this year, and coming out of the second quarter, I think in the back half I have to improve the profitability in order to continue to make that guidance that we set out at the beginning of the year that said we would be flat on a margin basis. So I think we\u2019re on course to do that, and mathematically, the profit has to get better in the back half of the year in order to sustain that guidance.","As far as the capex on wireless goes, there\u2019s a couple of things here that are driving this. If you look at, over the last three quarters, the growth that we\u2019ve had, the number of 4G devices we\u2019ve moved, and if you look at just the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, we\u2019ve added 6.2 million more 4G devices on the 4G network than we had a year ago, from just an overall sale perspective.","So when you look at that and you look at the usage, currently 59% of the data traffic is now running on the 4G network. And that\u2019s being driven by 33% of the base. So again, from just a growth perspective on the top line, we\u2019ve always said, again, that as customers move into shared, and they realize the viability and speeds, and the consistency of this 4G network, it\u2019s going to drive them to use higher usage. And if you look at where video\u2019s going in the future, obviously that\u2019s going to continue the proliferation of the usage on this network.","And we look out two years ahead of where we think our curve is going to be, and given the past success we\u2019ve had, and the usage patterns, and the amount of 4G devices that we\u2019ve already moved, and the roadmap that we see coming, we need to accelerate really the capacity that we previously thought. And it\u2019s really all to drive what customers want.","So the incremental investment will more than pay for itself on top line growth, from what I see. And again, this is really a shift in our capital discipline between wireline and wireless. And we\u2019re going to maintain our lead on the most reliable, consistent 4G LTE network. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the increase for the capex.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley ","Other wireless service revenues were very strong, up about 20% year over year. I imagine you\u2019ve got some MBNOs and maybe roaming and other stuff. Perhaps you could just comment on the drivers of that and the sustainability of that.","And then on the enterprise side, you talked about continued cautious behavior and cost focus. Do you see any signs of a second half pickup? I think there\u2019s some better news on unemployment and generally macro trends improving in the second half. Are you seeing any of that? Or is it pretty much static from your point of view?","Fran Shammo ","On the other wireless revenue, obviously what\u2019s included in that other wireless revenue is our reseller base. I don\u2019t like to refer to them as MBNOs. That\u2019s a bad word for me. But on the reseller base, it\u2019s really driven from the prepaid providers that we have on that side of the business.","And again, coming out of this quarter, we did a fairly substantial number of net adds there. And again, our prepay strategy is between what we sell on the retail side under our own brand, and we had a positive quarter again this quarter, with 97,000 net adds.","But we also drive the, if you want, the lower-end market through resellers, and mainly through the relationship with Walmart, through Tracfone. So that drives a lot of volume, and that has been good revenue growth for us.","The other things I would tell you, though, is that in addition to that, obviously roaming is in there, machine-to-machine , which we don\u2019t really talk about much. We\u2019re gaining a lot of momentum around machine-to-machine, and that is driving incremental revenue, albeit very low individual unit per subscriber type revenues, but again, as we start to gain momentum and sell hundreds and hundreds of thousands of these types of devices, that\u2019s going to contribute to those revenues and contribute to the overall growth of wireless. So that\u2019s the component of that.","On the enterprise side, look, I understand the unemployment is there, but it\u2019s not large enough and steady enough to give me confidence that something\u2019s going to turn here in the near future. And again, if you look at the enterprise space, mainly what everybody is focused on is cutting their costs.","And obviously when we talk about cutting costs in enterprise, they come to us and figure out how they can reduce their spend with Verizon and have us give them solutions that help them reduce their spend. And of course we\u2019re happy to do that, but it does cause some top line pressure.","And also, I think, again, the uncertainty of what\u2019s going on around the government sector, is twofold. Number one, a lot of this pressure in enterprise this quarter, if you look at the decline of 4.8%, over 60% of that was in the government sector for us this quarter. So there is a big impact from the sequestering activity and the pullback from both the state and local governments, and also within the federal government.","As I look forward, though, the uncertainty around this tax situation, and if you think about it, we\u2019re now midway through the year, it\u2019s highly unlikely that we\u2019ll get tax reform this year. So again, we\u2019re faced with another cliff at the end of the year if congress does not extend the tax provisions that are currently on the books for another year.","So hopefully they\u2019ll do that soon and put some of the uncertainty to rest, at least until the next 18 months, until we can get to all the difficult issues around tax reform, which as you know we have a lot of subgroups working in Washington to help and give suggestions on how to get this done. But that\u2019s going to take some time.","Again, it\u2019s hard for companies to say we\u2019re going to invest in new technologies and new things, when we\u2019re not certain what the future of the tax laws hold for the books and records. So I still don\u2019t think anything\u2019s going to change drastically from where we are. And as I said before, at least from where I sit, the best we can hope for is a flat performance, and if you take CPE out of the equation this quarter, we\u2019re at a [0.8%] decline. So that\u2019s probably about where we\u2019ll be, zero to slightly decline, or slightly positive is kind of where I\u2019m at at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research ","Could you just give us the update on the net debt calculation for Verizon Wireless? And then with respect to the business, I think the metrics that you threw out there on the LTE network implies about 1.8 more usage on the LTE network versus the 3G network. And I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit more, and maybe give us a sense of what the usage trends are for your customers. And as they move into the shared data plans, if you could give us a sense of that kind of stimulus that you\u2019re seeing on the consumption front.","Fran Shammo ","On the update of the net debt for wireless growth, that is $10.1 billion, and net debt is $9.7 billion. And as you know, we did a distribution at the end of June of a total of $7 billion out of the partnership to both of the owners. And also, just to keep in focus here, we have about $1.5 billion of wireless debt coming due in the fourth quarter of this year and another approximately $3.5 billion coming due in the first quarter of next year, and we plan to pay that debt off at that point in time.","On the LTE network, you\u2019re right on. Obviously what\u2019s happening is as people come from the 3G network over to the 4G network, you can see that incremental usage, whether it\u2019s a smartphone or a jet pack or a dongle. And as they start to share all this data, the video consumption is increasing year over year and quarter over quarter.","Others in the industry have put out their projections of usage over the 4G data, if you look at some of the things that people have printed, and the escalation that the future holds from a data consumption standpoint as we start to move into more symmetry between in the home and out of the home content. We don\u2019t see that slowing, so again, yes, we do see an incredible jump when someone moves from 3G to 4G and the usage that they have on their smartphones and other devices. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura. Your line is open.","Mike McCormack - Nomura ","Maybe just a comment on wireless margin. I know you\u2019ve got the sort of 49-50% expectation for the full year. Last year the fourth quarter had very high volumes that sort of really dragged down margins a bit. Are you getting comfort that the new upgrade policy should have a muting impact on that? And then just secondly, on FiOS competition, maybe just some comments regarding the triple play pricing environment out there, and also how well you\u2019re doing in the [MDU] market.","Fran Shammo ","On the wireless margins, obviously, again, we\u2019re very confident around the 49-50%. As far as the fourth quarter of last year, you have to keep in mind it was the first quarter that there was a free iPhone on the Verizon Wireless network, and we won\u2019t have that repeated this fourth quarter. Now, that\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t see increasing volume. And again, I continue to say that we\u2019ll see incremental net adds through the third and into the fourth quarter.","But from a margin perspective, if you look at just year over year and the amount of volume we\u2019ve moved, we actually ate through all that volume and improved the profitability of this business. And that goes into managing the entire business.","So from an upgrade policy standpoint, some other things that we\u2019ll be launching. You probably saw Verizon Edge and some other options that we\u2019ll have on payment plans for our customers to acquire a smartphone. All of these things considered, we are very, very positive on the margin progress and the profitability progress of Verizon Wireless and the continued growth of Verizon Wireless.","Mike McCormack - Nomura ","Just on the Edge comment, is that something that you\u2019re hearing your customers actually demanding, the sort of equipment financing option?","Fran Shammo ","If you look back, we were the first carrier to launch LTE technology, we were the first ones to launch the shared pricing around LTE technology. We launched in the fourth quarter of last year an installment pay plan on tablets. That was something that our customers were asking for. We delivered that to them.","And at that point in time, we started to look at it, and I said we were looking at other options for smartphones. We\u2019ve done a lot of focus groups in the last six months. We\u2019ve done a lot of market research. And yes, our customers are asking for another option.","Twofold: Number one, we have a lot of customers on the technology edge that want to be able to upgrade sooner than they would under our historical legacy subsidy model, if you will. And we have other customers who quite honestly don\u2019t want to pay up front for the large cost of the phone. They\u2019d rather pay over time.","So I\u2019m not going to get into all the details of Verizon Edge, I\u2019ll let Wireless do that, but that\u2019s something that our customers have been asking for, and I think we have a differentiated plan to launch to the market and Verizon Wireless will have more to say on that.","Going back to your other question on triple play and MDU, obviously we continue to gain momentum here. Look, this business has always been competitive around the triple play, but I think what\u2019s differentiating us right now is the superiority of our product with fiber into the home.","And as you get that fiber into the home, I think what customers are realizing, and we see this with the copper to fiber migration, when they move, and they see the speed that they can get on their internet capacity, we\u2019re seeing customers upgrade.","And what I\u2019ve said is we\u2019re seeing our legacy copper customers, who we have migrated over to the FiOS network, they are paying between $10 and $15 more in RPU a month after about 60 days on our network, because they\u2019re upgrading freely into that 30 and 50 MB per second.","So that\u2019s really what\u2019s differentiating us in the market. We will continue to advertise around that superiority, and I think that momentum will carry us into the third and fourth quarters.","Mike McCormack - Nomura ","Just a quick follow up on the FiOS side. Is there a point at which you guys are going to migrate to an all-IP video network?","Fran Shammo ","Obviously we\u2019ve already started that with the copper to fiber migration, but that\u2019s going to be quite some time in order to deactivate the copper switches and take all that plant and equipment out. We have the plans to do that, but that\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to be done within this year or next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo ","I did want to ask about prepay. With AT&T doing [AIO] and now with Leap\u2019s purchase and Cricket in the fold, and T-Mobile and Sprint obviously having their own brands, is there any interest on your part in launching an independent prepay brand under Verizon, separate from Verizon?","Fran Shammo ","I think from a prepay perspective, we are very happy with how we approach this market, between our own prepaid product, which obviously you\u2019ve heard me talk about in the past, which is just strictly on our 3G network. We do not offer prepaid on the 4G LTE network.","And as I said, we will become more aggressive over time in the prepaid market on that 3G network. Because again, as we look at the 3G versus the 4G, and we move 3G customers into our 4G network, we want to make sure that we keep that 3G network as full as possible, because when you think from an investment return, we\u2019re not investing any more in that network, and the fuller we can keep that network without detrimenting the service, the contribution margin of that network is very, very high.","So prepaid is really the pillar of how we will continue to utilize that 3G network, so you\u2019ll see us become more aggressive around that when we need to be. You saw us change some pricing in the last two quarters around prepaid, and that has stimulated some growth for us.","And then as I said previously, our other path is through resellers for the lower end market. I don\u2019t see the need, at this point, to do a secondary brand around the Verizon Wireless network. We have built our brand around the quality, the reliability, a superior network. I don\u2019t think that a secondary brand helps our overall brand at that point.","The other thing I\u2019ll say is I\u2019m not going to comment on anything around the AT&T deal with Leap, but I will put to bed the rumors out there that Verizon Wireless may be interested in that asset. And [hear me], we\u2019re not interested in that asset.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank ","I\u2019m not going to ask you about Leap, but that deal is spectrum-driven, and you guys have indicated that you\u2019re starting to deploy your AWS-1 spectrum, and maybe that\u2019s happening a little sooner than we thought, although you\u2019re seeing network traffic ramp very quickly.","I\u2019m just curious if you can maybe give us a status update on your spectrum portfolio. Do you still feel like you have sufficient spectrum to get to the next auction? Do you still see an opportunity to buy spectrum in the market right now from other carriers? And have you started to think about maybe some supplemental solutions, for example maybe revisiting wifi, as another way to put capacity into your network?","Fran Shammo ","Around spectrum, we did our AWS deal last year, and that put us in a very good spot for our 4G LTE strategy. We started to launch AWS last year. We started to preposition that. We are accelerating the positioning of the AWS based on my comments before around the usage around wireless. But again, we are very comfortable with our spectrum holdings, and we are in good shape for three to four years.","Obviously we will participate in the auction with the FCC targeted for 2014 around the broadcast licenses. That\u2019s something that we will participate in. But we are not under any spectrum pressure.","If you look at our frequencies, and the way we deployed our CDMA spectrum, we can actually take very small slivers out of that CDMA spectrum and reallocate that to our 4G LTE spectrum on a needed basis. And that\u2019s where we get into this balancing act between the 3G network and the 4G network.","But we are very satisfied with our holdings for the next three to four years. Obviously we\u2019re always opportunistic in spectrum acquisition, and we do actually buy spectrum every quarter. You probably don\u2019t see it, because we do little markets here and there.","But look, we\u2019re always opportunistic, but at this point, we\u2019re satisfied, and there\u2019s nothing out there at this point other than the auction that we\u2019re concentrating on.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank ","And on wifi, anything new there maybe involving your cable partners?","Fran Shammo ","From a wifi perspective, obviously we always like people to offload when they\u2019re in their home on a secured wifi network. You\u2019ve heard me talk before about wifi networks are not secure in the public domain. They have a purpose for us in certain instances around major sporting events and so forth, but our customers are very concerned about their privacy and security. That\u2019s why they ride the LTE network as much as they do.","But we do want offload in certain circumstances, and so that does relieve some of the spectrum. We obviously, just from a utilization standpoint, for people that are in their homes, it\u2019s not good and efficient to run off the LTE network. They should shift over to their wifi network in their house. So we do encourage that, but again, not major, massive, public wifi is interesting for our customers, at least at this point in time, from a security standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Just following up a little bit on that, Fran, I was wondering if you could give us a status update on the activities and development that\u2019s going on inside that joint innovation entity with the Comcast group, and what progress, if any, is being made on some of the digital content rights stuff?","And then I guess second would be kind of along those lines. Could you elaborate a little bit on your relationship with NFL, and kind of some of the strategy behind that content relationship and if that\u2019s the beginning of a series of potential new moves to acquire content?","And if I could, just one quick last one, I noticed the strategic services sales and enterprise were a a little over 6% growth year over year last quarter. They kind of slowed down into the 4% zipcode this quarter. I know overall enterprise has been fairly soft, but strategic services has been kind of a core strength. If you could kind of address that slowdown, it would be helpful.","Fran Shammo ","Around our joint venture with the cable companies, obviously our [unintelligible] solutions team has been working and defining consumers as to what they want both in the home and outside the home.","And obviously what we\u2019re learning is the 4G LTE network plays a very critical role in that. We continue to work with them. We have expanded into 968 Verizon Wireless stores across the U.S., and we have about 2,500 indirect locations, the marketing material, and we continue to showcase these types of products.","But I will say that as we continue to work through this, it\u2019s hard for Verizon Wireless to sell a cable product outside of the FiOS footprint, because it\u2019s new. And it\u2019s hard for the cable companies to sell a wireless product outside the footprint, because of the distribution channels. So as we continue to work through this, we\u2019re gaining some momentum here.","But I think the one last point from all this is we\u2019re obviously very focused on the content rights. And you come into the NFL agreement, and the NFL agreement we think is just a new way of how content rights can be delivered into the wireless segment. And obviously our strategy is around both type of multicasting a live sporting event, and you saw our comments that the 2014 Super Bowl will be a multicast type event to our wireless customers.","So that\u2019s really the breakdown of the wall between what can be delivered in the home and out of the home. And obviously we now have the rights to take some of the NFL live games out of the home and deliver them on the mobile devices.","From a content standpoint, this has to develop, obviously, over time. The other point here around content is we are starting to see where we\u2019re getting inquiries from content providers that they may want to pay for their content rather than having the consumer pay. Those models are still being worked, but we\u2019ll see where that goes. But I look at that as the old 1-800 number, where the actual vendor pays for the usage, and not the customer. So we\u2019ll see how that strategy develops over the course of time.","As far as our strategic services go, we continue to have good momentum in our strat services as we refine exactly what we\u2019re doing. We have very good momentum in the Terremark and the Hughes platforms, and around our cloud services.","The slowdown, quite honestly, has been around our PIP exercise, and that is growing, but it\u2019s more a price compression within the industry. So we\u2019re facing some of that going forward. And we knew we were going to face some price compression around PIP, and we have to accelerate on the other strategic services to outpace that.","So, other than that, we have good momentum on strat services.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And just to clarify, PIP is?","Fran Shammo ","IP-based solutions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Seitz of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Tom Seitz - Jefferies ","Can you just give us an update on your expectations for VoLTE?","Fran Shammo ","We\u2019re still on course for VoLTE. We will start testing and have our first handset in the market at the end of the year. And then we will probably commercial launch sometime next year. But again, as I\u2019ve said in the past, the critical piece for us is that we have to make sure that our 4G LTE coverage footprint from a VoLTE standpoint equates to our 3G footprint, because the VoLTE call is not backwards compatible with the CDMA network. So when you establish a call on VoLTE, within our network, if you move outside of the LTE network, you will have a hard drop on that call. And obviously that\u2019s not something that our customers would expect from a premium provider like Verizon Wireless.","So we\u2019re taking our time here. We will thoroughly test this. But we are on track to commercially launch sometime in the first half of next year. And then taking that out, as I\u2019ve said, at the end of next year, we are on track to have our first only LTE handset to be able to provide to the marketplace as well. So we\u2019re still on track with our VoLTE strategy, but it is a critical one for us to make sure that we get right when we launch.","Tom Seitz - Jefferies ","So the implication, though, then, is that the 4G network is going to be essentially everywhere that the 3G network is by sometime in the first half of next year?","Fran Shammo ","The 4G network is everywhere. As I said in my opening remarks, 99% of the coverage of our 4G network is equivalent to our 3G network. But now we have to go back in and fill in that capacity to make sure that from a voice call perspective, it will hand off, because voice is different than the data piece. So we just have to make sure that a customer who is on 3G today, when they go to VoLTE, they would see no difference in their service from 3G to 4G.","Tom Seitz - Jefferies ","Could I just follow up on Dave\u2019s question? There were press reports that ESPN was considering subsidizing mobile video consumption. And you sort of alluded to that as well. How soon do you think we\u2019ll see a material third party payer model? Is it this year? Is it next? Is it a couple of years out? Can you just sort of frame the timeframe of what you\u2019re thinking about?","Fran Shammo ","I think the big barrier right now is how does the content provider get the value of how many people watch their content on a mobile device to be able to go back to their advertisers in order to monetize that content? And right now that\u2019s where the barrier is, and we\u2019re working on that. But until that get solved, I think this model will be slow at this point in time.","Now, slow to come, I\u2019m thinking maybe next year. But it\u2019s certainly not any time in this year that that model will break through. Because they have to recognize the benefit back to their advertisers to be able to monetize that content into our network.","But it is something that\u2019s being discussed. They realize that the linear model will not work as it does in TV in the wireless market. You can\u2019t assume that someone\u2019s going to pay $8 a sub on 100 million subs, so that model does not work. So we are looking at other models, but the barrier is how do you measure everything to get back to the advertisers for the perceived value on that content?","Operator","Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","Just on the capital expenditure front, on the back of this capital expenditure rise for the year, I wanted to ask how we should think about the capital intensity of the business going forward. It does seem as though your competitors are healthily ramping their efforts to try and improve service quality. Do you feel as though you\u2019ll need to continue to put your foot on the gas in order to maintain the quality of your network?","Fran Shammo ","Well, let\u2019s put this in perspective. We\u2019ve moved our consensus by $200 million to $400 million, so this is not a huge step up in our capital spend. We just wanted to make sure everybody realized that we were going to accelerate some of the 4G LTE.","But as we\u2019ve said in the past, and if you look at our results through the first half of the year, we continue to really be disciplined around the capital investment across our businesses, but also within the wireline segments. So you see that come down year over year. We expect that trend to continue. So that will offset some of the pressure that we may see on the wireless side.","So I don\u2019t anticipate that there\u2019s going to be any major accelerations, but again, it\u2019s too soon to tell where we\u2019re going to come out in \u201913. I\u2019ll talk more about that in the coming quarters, but right now the focus is on this year and it\u2019s between $200 million and $400 million increment.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays ","If I may, we\u2019ve clearly seen a pickup in terms of your shared data plans. I think you mentioned that it\u2019s more than 36% of your subscribers that are on these plans. I was thinking from a strategic perspective, as we\u2019ve seen increased promotional activities by some of your competitors to try and wean subscribers onto their networks, do you feel as though this is a potential mode in terms of protecting your subscriber base from some of these more aggressive pricing plans that are available in the market? Should we expect to see more promotional activity to try and ratchet this sort of percent of subscribers on shared data plans up in the coming quarters?","Fran Shammo ","This industry has always been an extremely competitive industry, and obviously some of the promotions around unlimited have been there for the last year, when we launched share pricing. And we continue to take market share, we continue to grow our revenue very strongly.","So look, I mean, Verizon Wireless will do one thing very well. They will compete very well in the market, but we are a balanced company. We will compete, grow revenue, grow profitability, and grow our subscribers.","And at the end of the day, customers make choices not really just on price, but the quality of the network, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve built our brand on. So quality of the network, consistency of the network, the reliability of the network, the value that we provide to our customers through these shared plans.","And again, will we do promos here and there? Of course. As I said before, we\u2019ll launch the Verizon Edge, which will give our customers yet another choice of how do they want to enter onto the best network there. So I think the key here is give our customers choice, and continue with what we\u2019ve built our company on, which is the strongest network.","Operator","Our last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Tim Horan - Oppenheimer ","Two questions on wireless. Fran, you talked about the fact that your LTE network is enabling you to attract a higher quality customer, which has clearly been the case for a long time with your network. But do you have any evidence on that on maybe credit scores? Are you finding with what you\u2019ve done on LTE and the shared data plans, are you attracting higher credit quality scores, maybe losing lower quality score customers?","And then secondly, on the shared data plans, can you maybe talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of customers needing to increase their data buckets or many customers bumping up against headroom? Or do you expect to see an acceleration of that in the next year? Or is it more like two to three years out?","Fran Shammo ","On the high quality, obviously we give a lot of our customers choice of various price plans and how to enter into our superior network. And of course credit scores have always been a component of that. I won\u2019t really get into how we differentiate the credit scores, but obviously you can see that from the growth that we have and the revenue growth that we have, this is not a major issue for us. And we watch this very closely, but we\u2019re gaining customers across all aspects of the business, let\u2019s just put it that way.","Shared data plan, as far as acceleration of data usage, again, what we see, and if you\u2019ve experienced this yourselves, we continually communicate with our customers throughout the month as to when they get to their usage, and then when they get up into that 90%, we give them the ability to upgrade through their phone to the next tier.","And we see some very good results from that. Customers are upgrading when they need to. So, again, based on our trajectory of data usage, especially with where we see video going, we continue to see that the uptake in the shared plan will continue, the usage will continue to accelerate, and our revenue growth will be reflective of that.","Michael Stefanski","That\u2019s all the time we have for questions. But before we end the call, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Fran for some closing comments.","Fran Shammo ","Thanks, Mike. I just want to leave just a couple points of emphasis here. Our strategic investments and operational execution drove strong financial performance in the first half of this year. But while we are pleased with the overall performance, we obviously know we have more work to do.","We are committed to driving shareholder value by continuing to execute our strategy and improve on the fundamentals of the business. We are focused on delivering superior customer service and providing the best portfolio of products, along with the most reliable and consistent performing network. Our focus is to capture incremental revenue growth in our key strategic areas while we also transform our service delivery and cost structure.","As always, we will continue to be very disciplined around our capital investments, investing in those platforms for the innovation and the growth of the future. Through this strategy and execution model, we expect to drive incremental cash flow and earnings growth, both in the second half of this year and into the future.","Thank you again for joining us, and everybody have a great day."],"21392":["Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call April 24, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Brady Connor - SVP, Investor Relations","Matthew Ellis - EVP & CFO","Analysts","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Philip Cusick - JPMorgan","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs","John Hodulik - UBS","Michael Rollins - Citi","David Barden - Bank of America","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson","Jennifer Fritzsch - Wells Fargo","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","Scott Goldman - Jefferies","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]","Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any questions, you may disconnect at this time","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brady Connor","Thanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are now available on our website.","This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides enduring our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","As of January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting standards that will impact the way we record certain transactions going forward, and some that will require recast of historical information. These new standards include ASC 606 for revenue recognition, changes related to the presentation of pension items on the income statement and updates for the cash flow reporting of restricted cash and collection of receivables with off-balance securitizations. We plan to recast the 2017 Form 10-K following the filing of our first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q to address the adoption of the pension and cash flow reporting standards that require retrospective treatment.","Before Matt goes to the results, I'd like to walk through a few items. For the first quarter 2018 we reported earnings of $1.11 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items I would like to highlight.","Our reported first-quarter earnings include an early debt redemption charge of about $249 million and roughly $107 million of acquisition and integration costs primarily related to Oath. The net impact of these items after-tax was approximately $266 million, or $0.06 per share.","Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.17 in the first quarter compared to $0.95 a year ago. Included in the differences approximately $0.21 due to the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard. On a comparable basis, adjusted earnings per share before the impacts of tax reform and revenue recognition was up 1.1% year-over- year.","Next, I'd like to discuss the revenue recognition standard impact on our results. In order to provide additional clarity regarding the impact of the revenue recognition standard on our quarterly results, we have included the table on slide four that illustrates the effect across the business.","The impact of the revenue recognition standard resulted in a reduction of wireless service revenue, offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue, as well as the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments.","For the remainder of this call, we will discuss results excluding the impact of the accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods unless otherwise noted.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Brady. Good morning, everyone and, thank you for joining us today. Let me start with a recap with our priorities of 2018 which we laid out earlier this year. We are laser focused on executing on the fundamentals, positioning the business of future growth and delivering sustainable financial performance for long-term value creation.","We are enhancing our network leadership position, strengthening our customer relationships and driving efficiencies throughout the business. The cornerstone in our strategy is to provide customers with the best network and user experience. As reflected by our strong customer loyalty.","We have again been recognized by RootMetrics as the best overall network outright for reliability, speed, data and co-performance for the ninth straight reporting period.","As streaming video has become the primary driver of data usage, Verizon stands alone in providing the leading performance of video delivery. Recently, our wireless network was recognized by another third-party as having the best video success rate and the largest percentage of video streaming in high definition across the industry.","Through our investments in spectrum, including millimeter wave, deployments within fiber network architecture and expansion of software defined networking capabilities, Verizon remains the clear leader in 4G and has the assets to provide the broadest, fastest and most advanced next generation network in the world.","The demand for our fiber-based products continues to accelerate. And our Intelligent Edge Network design gives us the ability to meet customer needs of broadband to mobility services, an environment where quality of connection matters more now than ever before.","In addition, the evolution of our Intelligent Edge Network architecture provides the flexibility and efficiencies to offer increased capacity and throughput, low latency, unmatched reliability and enhanced speeds.","We have started the year with strong momentum and have delivered solid financial performance, including consolidated revenue growth, led by continued progress in the wireless business.","It has now been a full year since we launched our original unlimited plans, and the offerings have evolved to provide value and choice for customers. We will continue to mold our compelling value proposition and provide the quality of network and user experience that customers demand.","In an unlimited wireless world, we are driving revenue accretion thorough increase in the number of customer relationships and deepening the participation within our existing base by adding more devices and services. In addition, we are pre-positioned in the network to further enhance wireless growth opportunities with next generation technologies.","Our 5G deployment is progressing as planned. We are quickly approaching the initial launch of our residential broadband service later this year, which will be the first use case of a broader 5G strategy. We are driving the ecosystem for future growth across the entire array of 5G services.","With regard to our Oath business, we are deepening the engagement with our user base, creating opportunities for further monetization in the future. Consolidated EBITDA increased as we leveraged our scale into operational efficiencies thorough business excellence initiatives. Our disciplined capital allocation model allowed us to strengthen the business, while investing in our networks of future growth and long-term value creation.","Let's dig deeper into the first quarter operating performance with a consolidated level, followed by Wireless and Wireline results and our Media and Telematics businesses.","Now onto slide six. Consolidated revenue was $29.9 billion, excluding the impact of Oath and divested businesses, an increase of approximately 3.2%. The primary driver was solid performance in the Wireless business with improved service revenue results, as customers enjoyed unlimited access on the nation's best wireless network.","We are on track to deliver low single digit percentage consolidated revenue growth on a reported basis for the full year 2018. On a consolidated basis excluding special items, first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.8%, which was down 70 basis points due to higher wireless equipment revenue and the inclusion of Yahoo in this year's results.","Adjusted EBITDA increased by $0.5 billion due to steady improvement in operational efficiencies and increased penetration across our high quality customer base. With that, we are on track to realize low single digit percentage growth in adjusted EPS in 2018 before the impact of tax reform and revenue recognition.","Let's turn now to slide seven, to review cash flow results and the balance sheet. In the first quarter, cash flow from operations totaled $6.6 billion, up $5.3 billion from last year. This was primarily driven by stronger operational results, lower discretionary pension contributions and as we have previously communicated, the reduction of working capital headwinds from the completion of the device payment plan portfolio transition from off-balance-sheet to on balance sheet financing.","As part of our commitment to strengthen the balance sheet and providing financial flexibility to grow the business, we made a discretionary pension contribution of $1.0 billion to improve the funded status of our pension plans. As a result, we do not project to have any mandatory pension contributions until approximately 2026.","Total capital expenditures were $4.6 billion in the first quarter, up $1.5 billion over the prior year. We maintain our 2018 guidance range for capital expenditures of $17.0 billion to $17.8 billion. We expect capital expenditures to be more evenly distributed throughout 2018 than in previous years.","Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $2.1 billion, up $3.8 billion. We ended the quarter with $119.1 billion of total debt, comprised of $109.0 billion of unsecured debt and $10.1 billion of on balance sheet securitizations.","Total debt was up $2.5 billion year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in our asset-backed borrowings of $3.8 billion. The total debt balance is expected to decline as we begin to realize that cash benefits of tax reform later this year.","Now, let's move into reviews of the operating segments, starting with Wireless on slide eight. Total Wireless operating revenue increased 4.7% to $21.9 billion in the first quarter.","Service revenue performance produced solid results in the quarter driven by customer step ups to higher access plans. The quality of our overall customer experience and value proposition, as well as our measured approach to promotional activity in a highly competitive environment.","On May 8th of last year, we used a chart on the lower half of the slide to communicate the impact of unlimited on service revenue trajectory and our expectations for future trends to improve. We are pleased to report that service revenues for the quarter was flat versus the prior year. We saw year-over-year improvement throughout the quarter with service revenue turning positive in the month of March.","We now have 81% of our post-paid phone base on unsubsidized plans compared to 72% for the same period last year. On a reported basis, including the revenue recognition standard, service revenue was down 2.4%. We expect the momentum in the service revenue trajectory to continue and we are on track for growth to turn positive on a reported basis around the end of the year.","Equipment revenue increased 22.1% driven by the mix of higher priced handsets and increased activations. Approximately 49% of post-paid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance at the end of the quarter, similar to last year.","Our Wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.3%. This represents an improvement of 120 basis points driven by the strength of our service revenue results and ongoing focus on operational excellence throughout the business.","Let's now turn to slide nine and take a closer look at Wireless operating metrics. First quarter is seasonally the lowest volume period of the year coming off with a holiday retail season. Overall, we gained 260,000 post-paid net ads, consisting of phone losses of 24,000 and tablet losses of 75,000, offset by 359,000 other connected devices primarily wearables.","Smartphone net additions to the quarter were 220,000, as customers looked to connect their sophisticated devices to the best wireless network in the U.S. Our unlimited offerings continue to provide a compelling value and overall customer experience that has led to post-paid phone churn of 0.80% for the quarter. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of customer attention at 0.80% or better.","Total retail post-paid churn of 1.04% decreased year-over-year. Total post-paid device activations were 2.3% higher than the prior year of which about 80% were phones. In a seasonally low, we had 5.0% of our retail post-paid base upgrade to a new device, down from 5.2%.","During the quarter, 77% of phone activations were on device payment plans. Prepaid activity in the quarter reflected a total net loss of 335,000 devices, of which 261 where basic phone losses.","Let's move next to our Wireline segment on slide 10. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment decreased 1.8% for the quarter, as growth from our high quality fiber-based products was more than offset by secular pressures from legacy technology shifts, trends from cord cutting and pricing pressures in a highly competitive environment.","Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.7% primarily driven by legacy core revenue declines. Fios consumer revenue increased 1.2% driven by the growing demand for high quality broadband service. The mix shift away from triple-play bundles pressured revenue trends, but the margin impact was largely offset by the corresponding reduction in content expenditures.","We added 66,000 Fios Internet customers on the strength of our high speed fiber offerings, as customers seek the best broadband experience. Fios Video losses of 22,000 were indicative of a continued secular trend for cord cutting on the traditional linear video bundle.","Excluding the XO acquisition, enterprise solutions revenue decreased 4.2% in the quarter, driven primarily by declines in legacy products and pricing pressure in the market that more than offset growth in demand for fiber based services. On a constant currency basis, the year-over-year decline was 5.7%.","Partner solutions revenue decreased 0.4% with our XO. We see fiber demand as the main driver for future growth opportunities within this segment. In business markets revenue declined 5.7% [ph] without XO. We have good trajectory with our fiber based services, but these are offset by declines in legacy products.","Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 20.4%. We continue to benefit from operational efficiency gains, but steady increases in content cost and secular pressures within legacy technologies remain headwinds.","Let's now move on to slide 11 to discuss our Media and IoT businesses. The integration of the Oath assets is progressing well. Accelerating our mobile first strategy and positioning us at global reach and future growth in premium content distribution and programmatic advertising capabilities across our key verticals.","As expected, Oath gross revenue decreased sequentially about 13% from the fourth quarter to $1.9 billion due to seasonally lower display advertising volumes. Our organizational integration was largely completed in 2017, and the focus in 2018 has now shifted to streamlining platforms and products, unlocking cost and revenue synergies on the way.","During the quarter, we achieved a full integration of the legacy AOL and Yahoo video supply-side platforms into a unified platform and go-to-market strategy. This positions the business of future growth, as we establish our role as a value added partner for advertising customers.","In the Telematics business, as part of the ongoing integration of the Fleetmatics and Telogis acquisitions, we have created the new Verizon Connect organization. Total Verizon Connect revenue was $234 million in the first quarter. Total IoT revenue, including Verizon Connect was up approximately 13%.","Let's now move to slide 12 to review our strategy for future growth. We are confident in our strategy of laying the foundation for future growth, while maintaining a strong leadership position in 4G LTE coverage, reliability and capacity.","The execution model remains unchanged in terms of delivering strong financial results, allocating capitol to position the business for future growth, while strengthening our balance sheet and returning long-term value to our shareholders.","Our Wireless value proposition is allowing more and more customers to experience unlimited service on the best network in the United States. We exited the quarter with strong momentum and produced operational and financial performance in a highly competitive environment, while investing in all our businesses and driving cost efficiencies.","Last year we announced our goal to drive $10 billion in cumulative cash savings throughout the business over the next four years. Our business excellence initiative, which includes implementing zero-based budgeting has already yielded positive results in the first quarter, realizing approximately $200 million of savings thorough process improvements, work streamlining and automation. The program is on track to deliver against our goals over the four year period.","In addition to the operational improvements in the business, the benefits from corporate tax reform will be realized throughout the remainder of the year, which will provide additional flexibility and enable us to execute on our commitment to strengthening the balance sheet.","We are pre-positioning our networks as fiber infrastructure, spectrum resources, and the rollout with our Verizon Intelligent Edge Network architecture. We are excited about the initial commercial launch in our 5G residential broadband offering later this year, as the first slice of a multi-use asset.","We are on the forefront of innovation that will drive the full suite of services and used cases that will be delivered by 5G technologies. We have successfully completed our 11 city 5G pre-commercial trials where we demonstrated propagation over 2000 feet from the node on millimeter wave spectrum.","We have moved into the commercial deployment phase for the residential broadband launch in the second half of this year. Deployment of commercial nodes on our own fiber asset is underway in the initial markets. And earlier this month, we performed successful end-to-end 5G data sessions in these locations using commercial equipment that will be deployed from the launch later this year.","The ecosystem for 5G is progressing with advancements being realized around global standards and technology developments. Progress is being made at the state and city level to drive sustainable economics around sell-side deployment, creating the pathway to better serving in their communities.","Millimeter wave spectrum enables a whole new array of services that will be delivered through ultra-wideband 5G technologies. We are well-positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities that 5G has to offer.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Brady, so we can get to your questions.","Brady Connor","Thank you, Matt. Brad, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer section. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead","Simon Flannery","Thanks a lot. Good morning, Matt. I wanted to follow up on the 5G broadband rollout. When do you think you'll give us more visibility about the three to five markets, the timeline around when you're rolling that out, how many homes?","And then related questions, I think you said pre-standards. When do you think the standards-based CPE will be available so you can really scale this? And then finally, what's your video strategy here? Are you going to have an OTT offering to the bundle with the broadband product? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Good morning, Simon. Thank you for the question.","Simon Flannery","Morning\u2026","Matthew Ellis","So in terms of the timeline for the three to five markets, as we said earlier this year, and when we made the announcement in November 29, those - all of those markets will launch in the second half of this year.","So we announced at Sacramento will be one of those cities and the other cities will announce as we get closer to launch date. But we are very much on track with being in a position to launch each of those cities later this year.","As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are in the process of deploying assets in each of those markets and look forward to bringing that service to consumers in those markets in 2018.","As you mentioned, the launch this year will be on our proprietary standard, and this gives us the opportunity to get a product out in the market before others and to demonstrate that millimeter wave does exactly the things that we said it does. But obviously over time, we want to move to the standards-based CPE, and we expect to be getting that CPE based off of the NR standard, probably in 2019.","Look, what I would I say is the network is being pre-positioned to be able to launch 5G as soon as customer equipment is ready, whether that be in-home CPE for residential broadband or weather that be handsets with 5G mobility. We'll be ready as soon as equipment is ready on the global standard.","And in your final question was around a video strategy for the residential broadband launch. So that's - we've got that underway. We continue to look OTT options, and as we've said previously, we're not looking to launch a need to product, but certainly expect to have an overall product offering to consumers in those three to five markets that will be compelling to meet their needs","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you.","Brady Connor","Brad, I think we're ready for the next question.","Operator","The next comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. You may go ahead.","Philip Cusick","I wonder if I can follow up first on my question from January about your target leverage. Has the Company come up with a way to think about leverage under the new tax regime, especially with no cash pension obligations for the next eight years?","Matthew Ellis","Yes. So Phil, we continue to look at the - our goal to improve leverage. And really to get back to that pre-Vodafone credit raiding and we've had plenty of conversations at the rating agencies around that and how our leverage looks in a post- tax reform world.","But look, we're in a great position as we demonstrated this quarter. We grew the EBITDA side of the business. And then as we talked about as the benefits of tax reform from a cash basis later this year, we'll see improvements in the debt side of it.","So we're on track to improve the leverage and look forward to - not too distant future as we're having that conversation with the agencies about the timing of being in a position to get us back to where we want.","But I think if you look historically where our leverage ratios were on an adjusted basis, when you adjust for the sellco ownership, you have a fair idea of where we're trying to get to. So there is a few points of turn to go, but not a massive amount.","Philip Cusick","Okay. And if I can follow up on Simon's question as well. As some carriers and vendors are pulling back from 5G. How has Verizon's thinking evolved in 5G this year? Thank you.","Matthew Ellis","Yeah. We continue to be very excited about the opportunities that 5G has. I don't think in the U.S. we've seen people pulling back from 5G at all. In fact, I think you have seen a lot of very bullish commentary. So we will be launching the residential broadband later this year. We're on track with that.","Certainly happy to have the assets in place to do that, whether that be - what we've done with the network over the past few years, as we have densified the network, putting more fiber out there, which really pre-positions us to deploy 5G, gaining the 28 and 39 gigahertz spectrum that puts us in a position to be ready to deploy when the equipment ready from the OEM.","So we are very bullish about 5G. We think there's tremendous upside, whether that be residential broadband, whether it be mobility. Really the most exciting pieces as you get into the new use cases that don't exist on the current technologies around IoT, B2B type applications. So we are full steam ahead on our 5G deployment.","Philip Cusick","Thank you.","Brady Connor","Brad, we're ready for the next question","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. I'm actually going to follow up on what you were just discussing. When we talk to investors about 5G and we talk about the fixed use case, I think they all understand the addressable market and it's just a matter of how effective the product is going to be.","But when we talk about mobility - and, as you noted, many of these use cases don't exist yet - are you comfortable accelerating capital investment into developing a mobile 5G network without visibility on those use cases? And if not, is there going to be a point where we might see an inflection in CapEx higher where you see that forming?","Matthew Ellis","Good morning, Brett. So I don't see us having a massive acceleration in CapEx. As you heard, we reiterated our guidance for 2018. That guidance of 170 to 178 [ph] is the same range of actual spending we've had over the past four years. So what investors should have grown accustomed to seeing for Verizon is consistent total capital spend on a disciplined methodical manner. But the items within that spend evolve over time as the technologies evolve.","So this year we've already started spend on 5G. The spend on those three to five initial launch city's began earlier this year, so that's ongoing. You should expect to see spend in additional cities be underway by the end of the year, so that we're in a position to launch additional geographies in 2019.","But that's within our current CapEx guidance. And as we look forward, we continue to believe that we can deploy the network within the typical range. If we see an opportunity to accelerate because of the market, we're not afraid to do so, but it will be based off of the opportunity we have in the marketplace.","But this really comes back to the design of the network over the past few years, by identifying the 4G network we've put a lot of the infrastructure in place that we need to deploy 5G, especially using millimeter wave spectrum.","So we don't see this as being a massive uptick. This is not the same thing as when we adopted 4G and went from a CDMA based 3G network to the 4G LTE network. This is a very different network rollout. And I think you will see that in the CapEx as we go forward.","So look, as you mentioned the different revenue buckets. We're very comfortable that certainly the mobility bucket gives us the opportunity to deepen our relationship with our existing customer base and look to grow that base.","Residential broadband is an existing market that we have opportunity to grow share in. And then the new use cases at lower latency and higher throughputs and the ability to connect many, many more device is to each individual node will create significant upside as well. But this is a multi-use asset that we think will have a strong return over time.","Brett Feldman","And just to be clear, your comment about capital intensity during your 5G upgrade, you were referring to both the fixed and mobile components of it? That was not unique to the fixed employment?","Matthew Ellis","It's the same deployment. I mean, we are not building a 5G network for residential broadband and a different 5G network for mobility. We are deploying a 5G network that will have multiple revenue streams off of it.","So we're very excited about the ability to do that. And in addition to have a multiple revenue streams, we are using a lot of existing assets we have in the field already today.","Brett Feldman","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Brady Connor","Brad, let's take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.","John Hodulik","Okay, thanks. Matt, obviously a lot of changes going on in the media space. And one of your largest competitors, AT&T, is investing in traditional media assets while you guys have focused more on new media platforms. Are you seeing anything that would change your view on that approach or any value created by combining through your distribution assets with what you see in the traditional media world? And has your guys' thinking on that evolved over time? Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Yeah. I mean, certainly it has evolved over time, but it is very consistent with what we've said earlier this year, at this point in time as we look at the ecosystem, we're very comfortable with the approach of making sure we have distribution rights to digital content.","And you saw that with the NFL deal, the NPA deal, and I would expect to see us continue to add to that portfolio of digital rights, to distribute across various Yahoo platforms, other platforms as we go forward.","So look the content space is evolving rapidly. And we think the best approach for us at this point in time is to be the independent distributor of rights out there. And we're very comfortable that we will be very effective doing that. So, no major change in terms of our approach from when we spoke on the earnings call 90 days ago.","John Hodulik","Okay, but just a quick follow-up. But the possibility of you guys making a more profound investment in traditional media assets like networks, whether they be cable networks or broadcast networks, should we think of that is still off the table or subject to change as we see things evolve in the media landscape?","Matthew Ellis","Yeah. I would certainly say not at this time. When we look at the landscape out there, its evolving very fast. And I am not going to say never on anything, but I look at it right now in a foreseeable future, I don't see that being the right time to jump in.","So we are pursuing the strategy that we've discussed. We're going to continue to add content to the Oath platforms, bring some of that content across our other distribution, whether that's wireless or Fios and we think there is significant runway to that strategy and we'll continue to monitor the broader ecosystem.","John Hodulik","Okay. Thanks, Matt.","Brady Connor","Brad, let's take the next question please.","Operator","Your question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Rollins","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two if I could. First, just cost-cutting that the $10 billion program generated about $200 million so far. Can you discuss the pacing of cost-cutting prospects for the balance of 2018? And also it's been you know, about a year since [Technical Difficulty] unlimited. Can you discus what the current consumption of data traffic [Technical Difficulty] smartphone and how you keep [Technical Difficulty]?","Matthew Ellis","Hey, Mike, you are breaking up the last part of that question. I think you are talking about unlimited and data consumption. Can you clarify the back part?","Michael Rollins","Yes, if you could just talk about the consumption of smart phone users and how it's impacting network quality.","Matthew Ellis","Yeah, absolutely. So look, I will tell you we have seen significant increase in data usage. As we move to unlimited, as expected. We also saw a change in where that usage was taking place, as the busy hour of the day changed, and also the geography where that changed.","So we've seen that increase level off. We are still seeing year-over-year increases, but not the same levels that we saw after we launched unlimited. And it's got back to more normal growth rates.","But you asked about what we're seeing in terms of quality across the network. And I just come back to all of the own data that we use ourselves from testing our network and others out there and what we see from third parties. And our network continues to be the standard by which all others are measured. And that has continued to be the case even after we launched a 5G.","So when we launched 5G we said that we had spent a good amount of time making sure that the network was ready for it. I believe the performance over the past 12 months has demonstrated the fantastic job that our network team has done, meaning, as we moved into an unlimited world and we saw data usage increase, we continued to deliver the high quality of service that people expect from us.","So I expect that to fully continue. But the network is performing incredibly well and we continue to add capacity. And so we're in great shape there.","Your first question around cost cutting. So 200 million approximately so far this year. As we continue to move forward, will have additional savings kick in as well. Certainly the ones that require deeper amount of process change will come in later in the quarter of the program than some of the other ones.","But we - you should see it more back end loaded. I think it will be reasonably even throughout '18 and then you will see some of the structural changes kick into a greater degree over the back half of the four-year program. But we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far, but we really just started and there's a long way to go.","Michael Rollins","Thanks very much.","Brady Connor","Brad, let's take the next question please","Operator","Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.","David Barden","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess the first one, just another cadence question, Matt. I guess last quarter you gave us the heads up about the seasonal weakness in the Oath business in the first quarter. And I think relative to wireless EBITDA outperformance and wireline EBITDA kind of in line, it seems like Oath and related corporate initiatives were maybe a little bit of a weak spot. Could you paint the picture for how that relatively sizable segment now might track over the course of the rest of 2018?","And I guess the second question would be related to the business market related aspects of tax reform. Have you been able to see any economic effect on your business, business as a result of tax reform, kind of those conversations changing kind of the outlook brightening? Anything related to that would be helpful. Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. Good morning, So Look, I'd like to tell you, I have seen a significant change in the level of demand from our enterprise customers. But look it's really too early.","I think if we look at it from our own IT department, they were not immediate because we got tax reform turning around and doing significant changes in their IT spend and their telco spend. So we'll see if that picks up as the year goes on, but nothing significant in the trajectory so far in that group.","In terms of the cadence through the year, I think we said on the last call that we expected Oath to be down seasonally or sequentially from 4Q to 1Q just with the seasonal change in advertising volumes, and we certainly saw that, the results came in as we expected.","So really from this point forward, we should expect to see a sequential improvement from what we saw in the first quarter, really for two reasons. One, you just got the seasonality impact that builds throughout the year. And then secondly, we're getting the underlying platforms integrated between the legacy AOL, the legacy Yahoo platforms.","And so when advertisers come into our business going forward, they can come in thorough one platform rather than the multiple platforms they come through today. So as we get the rest of that integration work completed, it will make us easier to do business with them, we think that will show up in the results.","But that's an ongoing exercise, and I don't think we'll really start to see that until really the back end of the year. And so as we head into '19 where the momentum should be significantly different than it is today. So hopefully that gives you a little insight there.","David Barden","Thanks, Matt. And if I could just do one quick follow-up, maybe related to John's question on media appetite. As you knit these two businesses together, the idea was to have the third biggest scale digital media platform in the world maybe. And do you feel like you've accomplished that goal and that you're getting the benefits of that scale? Or is incremental scale something that's necessary to really get you to the next level?","Matthew Ellis","Yeah. We have the scale today. That was why the Yahoo acquisition made so much sense. It got us to around a billion monthly active users. So now the challenge for the business is to deepen the relationship with those customers.","Look, if we grow the number of monthly active users, that's great. I'd be very happy to do so. But the biggest opportunity for us is to deepen the relationship we have with those consumers.","We do that by bringing additional compelling content such as NFL, NPA across those assets. And you saw what we did with those properties, and more to come there. And then once you use content like that to get them on the platform, you have other content there that keeps them on the platform. And when we keep them on the platform, that gives us the opportunity to increase the attractiveness to our advertising partners.","So you will see us focused on increasing the engagement with the base that we have, but we have the scale that we need to be successful in that business.","David Barden","Great. Thanks, guys.","Brady Connor","Brad, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Moffett","Hi. Matt, I know you talked about not a strong level of interest in media, but it was widely reported that you at least looked at it and put in a bid for the Fox asset. So I guess if I think about assets that are for sale, you are at least looking at Fox. It sounds as though there's maybe some spectrum coming from - whether Intelsat or Dish Network always out there. And then you've also talked about your balance sheet objectives.","Can you roll all that up for us and talk about how your priorities - how you would rank your priorities across spectrum, other operating assets or balance sheet reductions? And then - and just one quick nuance in that, your Fox bid was reportedly all stock. Would that suggest that you would not be willing to add leverage for a big acquisition?","Matthew Ellis","Yeah. So, good morning, Craig. Look, I'm not going to comment on any specific M&A rumors. That's not been our policy and I'm not going to start now. But let's talk about content in M&A in general. So I have commented already this morning that we've certainly are comfortable with the approach that we have around content across the Oath platforms and other parts of our business. And we are very focused on executing against that.","M&A to us is tool to help execute our strategy. If M&A allows us to accelerate the execution of our strategy at a value that provides a return, is something we look at. But it has to be consistent with the strategy and it has to have value.","We don't operate in a vacuum. Lowell and I have to be aware of activity and opportunities around us and we have an obligation to make sure we understand those. So we keep an eye on everything going on in the ecosystem.","But when we do M&A, it's because it fits with the strategy. And if you look at the past year, the only significant transactions we did, whether Yahoo, XO and Straight Path, they very clearly accelerate our strategy, whether that be around adding the necessary scale to our media assets as we just talked about just a couple of minutes ago, or pre-positioning our networks for being continuing the excellence in 4G world and also being in a position to succeed in 5G, whether that's adding fiber through XO or adding the spectrum assets through XO and Straight Path. We put ourselves in a position where we are in a - where we can execute our strategy and compete and generate value for shareholders over the long-term.","So I wouldn't necessarily want to prioritize what's the most interesting thing for us to look at. We are very comfortable executing our strategy on a mostly organic basis, if the right opportunities come up, we take a look at them. The vast majority of things we look at don't create value and therefore we pass on them because that's the responsible thing to do to create long-term value.","The strength in the balance sheet is important to us. The position in the business for long-term future growth that creates value for shareholders is also very important. And I think we've balanced those things very well over the past few years, and I expect to continue to do so","Craig Moffett","That's very clear. Thanks, Matt.","Brady Connor","Brad, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jennifer Fritzsch","Great. Thank you. Two if I may. Just on the service revenue guidance, you achieved it excluding the new accounting recognition ahead of schedule and I guess two questions. Why the guidance still for midyear? Could you continue to see it in the second quarter?","And then secondly, is Comcast MVNO service revenue included in that line? I think some are wondering if that's why we hit it ahead of schedule. Thanks","Matthew Ellis","Yeah. So let me answer the last one first there. I mean, yes, certainly our service revenue includes all service revenues related to connectivity to our network, whether that be our post-paid, whether that be prepaid, or MVNO. Those service revenues that we generate from operating the network.","But I would not so say that any of those pieces fit them. And within the wholesale side of our business, in addition to the MSOs obviously TracFone's there by far the biggest part of that business for us to date.","But look, when you look at why we got there this quarter, I think it's predominately because of our post-paid business continues to do well. You see continued to add 220,000 smartphones. The network continues to perform well, churn is very low, and that is driving the service revenue trajectory.","As we described last year, we continued to add connections to our account, continue to deepen the relationship with our base, and that allows us to continue to grow the post-paid component of service revenue.","Jennifer Fritzsch","Great. Thanks, Matt.","Brady Connor","Brad, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much. And good morning, folks. I was wondering if I could build upon Jennifer's prior question in terms of thinking about the cable operators. If we think about your guidance, what is your expectation around competition from the cable folks with regards to their wireless services?","And any sort of potential while reciprocal competition that may come from some of the incumbent players? Just trying to get your understanding of the lay of the competitive landscape over the next several quarters as some of these services ramp.","Matthew Ellis","Yes. So look, as these services have started, it's pretty much been as expected in terms of the volumes that we've seen. So I would expect there to be continued competition in the marketplace. I think some of the activity you saw in the first quarter is a result of that, and I think that you saw we had a disciplined approach to that activity in the quarter. And you should expect that to continue.","We will be very focused on maintaining our high quality base of customers, and we will do the things that we need to in a responsible fashion to do so. But look, anytime you add the additional players to the space, that has the opportunity to increase competitiveness, but that's baked into our plans for the year.","In the grand scheme of overall volumes, the amounts of activity coming from the new in MVNO's is still relatively small and we would expect it to be that way. But look, as they get traction that will bring in more traffic to our network that we can monetize as well. So we're happy with that side of the equation too.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks, very much Matt. And then, if I may, a quick follow-up in thinking about your 5G strategy. You folks have laid out a case in terms of the millimeter wave solution ramping better than anticipated from a tech perspective. And clearly your multiuse fiber infrastructure is creating a foundational layer to upgrade with lower capital intensity or without the requirement for accelerated capital intensity.","But how should we think about mobility? Is there a need for a coverage layer of spectrum - an additional layer of spectrum in order to launch 5G from a mobility standpoint? And given some of the options available, whether it is 3.5 or any other option available, how should we think about your strategy to deploy mobility on 5G?","Matthew Ellis","Yeah. So, thanks. We can launch 5G mobility on our existing assets. And - but as we look forward, we have over our history continue to add spectrum to our overall portfolio. If there's opportunities to do so at a reasonable price, we would certainly do so again. But we are comfortable that we can launch 5G mobility with the assets we have.","5G mobility will be initially very much heavily focused on urban areas. And we have the assets in place there, and we will be ready to launch that as soon the OEMs of handsets available with 5G chipsets in them.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much for giving the multi-color.","Brady Connor","Thanks. Brad, we're ready for the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Goldman of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Scott Goldman","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up to that question and one earlier as well. Matt, as you look at - you've talked a lot in the past about your ability to meet capacity with the spectrum you have, as well as the incremental tools around MIMO and 256 QAM and so forth. But it looks as though we are heading for a couple years of maybe a few auctions coming out of the FCC in terms of millimeter wave, the CBRS, the C band.","Can you just talk about your potential level of interest in acquiring more millimeter wave on top of what you have already acquired through Straight Path and XO or perhaps those lower 3 GHz plus bands there?","And then just a follow-up on a question earlier. You talked a bit about the trajectory of Oath from a revenue perspective going forward and a bit about the scale there. Just wondering how we should think about what the margin profile of that revenue looks like both in 2018 and perhaps as you get two or three years out into that business. Thanks.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Scott. So look, we have participated in numerous spectrum auctions over the years. And there is also been auctions that we've either chosen not to participate in or that we have participated only in certain areas, such as the AWS [indiscernible] auction.","We are very comfortable with the spectrum assets that we own as we move into the 5G world. But at the right price, spectrum is interesting. But as you've seen on 4G, there are multiple ways for us to add capacity to our network. And weather that be densification, whether that be more spectrum or weather that be deploying the evolving technologies, we take advantage of all of those things, and we look to add capacity.","And overall, the service that our customers get, at the cheapest possible way, and over time that's evolved. But we will certainly take a look at any auction that comes up, and if it makes sense for us to participate, we will. And if it doesn't, then we'll - we have other avenues to continue to deploy our networks and meet the needs of our consumers.","On Oath, as you talk about the margin profile there, as they add to the revenue base, we should see the margin profile of that business improve, certainly in the latter part of this year, and then as you get into '19 and '20.","But the capital intensity of that business is very different from our network businesses. And so you should expect a different margin profile there, certainly lower than you see within wireless.","But when you net out the lower capital intensity with the margin profile, the intent is to certainly have a compelling return on investment.","Scott Goldman","Great. Thanks, Matt.","Brady Connor","Hey Brad, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your last question is from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Securities. You may go ahead.","Mike McCormack","Hey, guys. Thanks. Matt, just maybe a couple of follow-ups here. With respect to the competitive landscape, I know obviously you want to maintain your best customers, but what's the overall philosophy on positive handset adds? How important is that you Verizon? And as you think about the next few quarters coming up, the appetite for you guys to get perhaps more promotional to get back to positive on that?","On the cable wireless stuff, and maybe you can't share much, but any sort of early takeaways on the type of customers that are opting into that? And anything you can share with respect to usage patterns would be great? Thanks,","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Mike. Look on the cable - the type of customers, I don't think we're seeing anything particular there in terms of being one type of customer or another. But I'll let the cable guys give you more color on that as they see fit.","The usage that we're seeing from those customers is as expected. So you know, nothing significantly different from what we see from the rest of that base.","You asked about the competitive landscape, and look, so we had 220,000 positive smartphone adds. Phones overall were slightly negative, but that's not unusual for first quarter. We've seen that the past few years and I think when you see the year as a whole, you see that become positive as momentum builds through the year.","I see no reason to believe that this year will be any different. We will be measured and disciplined in terms of our promotional response to the marketplace. But we've been very successful at maintaining our base.","You see the churn numbers again very strong four quarters in a row at 0.80 or better. So we are maintaining that base. We deepen our relationship with our base in terms of the number of connections. And then we certainly look to add new accounts. And I think we've been successful doing that.","We have more accounts now than we had a year ago. And when you are increasing the number of accounts and you're increasing the connectivity with existing accounts, that's a good approach and we will continue to be focused on doing that and growing revenues and growing margins. So that nothing really changes in 2018 as we think about how we're going to approach the wireless market.","Mike McCormack","Matt, I'm sorry, just a quick follow-up on that percentage of customers that are on unsubsidized versus those that are making a phone payment, that delta continues to be pretty wide. But can you just give us a sense for how much of that is bring your own device versus proactive retention versus phones that are paid off?","Matthew Ellis","Yeah. Look, as you see the elongation in the ownership cycle, you're going to see that - you know, the fact we have 81% of the base on unsubsidized pricing, but only about 49% have an active loan. As people pay off the device and they keep their devices longer than just two years, I expect you know to see that delta in that number.","We've seen some level of BYOD, but that has leveled off over the past couple of quarters but we expect that to continue to be part of that delta as well. But it's actually been a pretty stable relationship over the past two or three quarters as we've largely completed the transition of the base from subsidy to the device payment model.","Mike McCormack","Great. Thanks, guys.","Brady Connor","That's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn it over to Matt for some closing comments.","Matthew Ellis","Thanks, Brady. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. During the first quarter we achieved solid financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace. We started the year with strong momentum in our business and expect the trend to continue as we progress throughout the year.","We remain confident in our strategy and priorities led by investing in our networks, creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a discipline capital allocation model and creating value for our customers and shareholders.","We are positioning the company for long-term growth and taking advantage of the full array of opportunities in the 5G era, which is now upon us as we move into the next cycle of growth in the industry. We are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and focused on building the best network for the future to produce long-term value.","Thank you, for your time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.","For the fourth quarter of 2011, we reported a loss of $0.71 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include a noncash pension and benefits charge of $5.6 billion on a pretax basis. This mark-to-market adjustment related to our current year asset returns, discount rate and mortality assumption changes in our pension and postretirement plans. This adjustment is in accordance with the accounting policy we adopted a year ago, which requires us to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur and not smooth the effects over a longer period of time. ","Adjusting for $1.23 per share of nonoperational items, fourth quarter EPS was $0.52, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS to $2.15. The comparable adjusted EPS in 2010 was $2.08. ","With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.","Francis J. Shammo","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone and happy new year. Before we get into the details, let me start with a few summary comments. We finished the year very strong, creating value for our shareholders in 2011 by generating a total return of 18.2% through a combination of stock price appreciation of 12.1% and our dividend payments. Our stock price appreciation outpaced our peers, as well as the S&P, Dow Jones and broader indices. For the fifth consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase, indicating their confidence in the sustainability of our business model, cash flows and our improving earnings profile into 2012 and beyond.","In 2011, we also made some smart investments for the future growth and improved profitability. While very disciplined in our approach to capital spending, we continue to invest in networks and new technologies, which will be the platform for accelerated growth. ","On the strategic front, we made some moves that will significantly improve our competitive position. These include the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch in the cloud computing space, several agreements to purchase additional spectrum, joint efforts around innovation with a number of partners including the cable companies and, of course, our continued leadership in the rapid development of the 4G LTE ecosystem. ","We also renewed our focus on delivering solutions to customers and the markets we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business, wireless, FiOS, Strategic Services, the cloud, digital media and our global high-speed IP network. Our recently formed Global Enterprise solutions organization will strengthen our ability to provide fully integrated customer solutions. ","In addition to making these investments in our future, 2011 was a great year of solid execution. We posted record revenue growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in adjusted revenue growth of 6.2% for the full year, a significant acceleration from just below 2% growth in 2010. In addition to our strong revenue results, our sharp focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate a number of cost pressures, driving an increase to consolidated EBITDA of more than $950 million. ","We also had a strong year in terms of cash generation with $13.5 billion in free cash flow. 2011 was an impressive year on a number of fronts, giving us tremendous confidence about our long-term growth prospects.","Now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter, starting with a few highlights. ","As I just noted, we had a very strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter. Our 7.7% year-over-year growth was easily our highest quarterly growth of the year, and in fact, the highest quarterly growth since the formation of Verizon 11 years ago. In wireless, we had our best quarter ever in terms of smartphone sales, 4G LTE device sales and customer upgrades, along with the most retail gross adds in the 3 years. We lead the industry in retail postpaid connections and our 1.2 million postpaid net adds this quarter demonstrates that we continue to gain market share. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 195 markets covering more than 200 million POPs, with increasing customer awareness of its superior speeds, capabilities and new high-quality devices.","4G LTE is really taking hold. In addition to record device sales in the quarter, we are seeing a high-level activity at our innovation centers in Waltham and San Francisco. We currently offer about 20 4G LTE smartphone and data devices, and at CES, we announced 2 more mobile hotspots now called Jetpacks. Three smartphones: 2 for Motorola and one from LG and the Samsung Galaxy Tablet. Clearly, the Verizon 4G LTE network is becoming the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a strong indicator for us looking forward.","In Wireline, our revenue mix continues to improve, with FiOS representing 61% of our consumer revenue and enterprise Strategic Services making up 51% of our Global Enterprise revenue in the quarter. We effectively worked through the numerous challenges of the third quarter to restore Wireline segment profitability. Wireline EBITDA increased to $2.4 billion in the quarter, resulting in a 23.8% EBITDA margin, in line with where we ended the second quarter. Now that we are back on track, I am confident that we will see Wireline margin expansion in 2012. Again, a strong finish to a solid year, making us very confident about our growth opportunities in 2012 and beyond.","Let's turn to Slide 5 next. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 7.7% year-over-year, resulting in adjusted annual growth of 6.2%, solidly within our 2011 guidance range of 4% to 8%. Reported earnings for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were a net loss of $0.71 per share due to the significant noncash charge associated with our pension and postretirement plans. The largest component of this actuarial true-up, has to do with our discount rate assumption, which was 5.75% at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, this rate is adjusted to an estimate of the yields of high-quality long-term bonds, which was determined to be 5%. ","Another part of this true-up relates to our return on pension assets. We assumed an 8% ROA at the beginning of the year and we came in at 5% for the year. There were also adjustments required based on mortality assumption changes. Excluding non-operational items, we earned $0.52 per share in the quarter, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS result to $2.15, up 3.4% from a comparable $2.08 per share in 2010. ","Coming out of the third quarter, we indicated that we were on track to meet our 2011 earnings guidance of 5% to 8% growth. Earlier this month, I indicated that a very strong December resulted in higher-than-expected wireless device sales, which sets up well for 2012 but resulted in us falling a little short of our full year EPS growth target by $0.02. I would also remind you that our $2.15 adjusted result included $0.05 of negative impact, primarily from the storms in the third quarter. So from my perspective, an adjusted EPS of $2.20 is a more logical starting point for you when considering our 2012 earnings growth potential.","Let's turn next to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 6. Our free cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year was once again a combination of strong cash generation and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures for the full year totaled $16.2 billion, representing a decrease of 1.3% from 2010. In addition to being lower than the prior year, the $16.2 billion was favorable to our guidance of $16.5 billion. ","Our capital efficiency has improved steadily and was below 15% for the year. With the heavy investment cycles necessary to transform our business largely behind us, we would expect our CapEx to revenue ratio, which is already at a historical low, to continue declining based on disciplined capital spending and improving revenue growth trends. ","In Wireless, capital spending in the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion, bringing the full year to $9 billion, an increase of 6.3%. The incremental spending in 2011 was a combination of 3G capacity requirements, driven by the Apple iPhone and the continued rapid expansion of our 4G LTE network. ","In 2012, we will continue to migrate traffic from our 3G EV-DO network to 4G LTE, thereby freeing up 3G capacity and improving our capital and operating efficiencies. ","In addition, we will continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation and our target is to have 4G LTE coverage similar to our 3G coverage by mid-2013.","In Wireline, capital spending was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $6.4 billion, a decline of more than $800 million or 12%. The decline in spending was driven by lower FiOS build-out cost, as well as efficiency gains from investing in newer technologies. ","From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year in a strong financial position. Total debt was $55.2 billion and net debt was $41.8 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. As a reminder, the previously announced $10 billion Verizon Wireless cash distribution will occur next week. ","Let's now move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7.","Our Wireless business had another impressive quarter of growth, particularly with regard to retail customer activity. Total revenue grew to $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Retail service revenue, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, grew 7.8% year-over-year, which is a 90-basis point improvement in growth over the third quarter. ","Total service revenue in the quarter grew 6.4% year-over-year, up from 6.1% growth in the third quarter. Within total service revenues, growth was impacted by year-over-year declines in roaming and wholesale revenue, which collectively amounted to roughly $140 million in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we expect to see less impact on year-over-year growth rates from these factors as we move through 2012.","Total data revenue grew to $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 19.2% year-over-year. Data now represents 41.6% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continued to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4 billion in the quarter, up more than 34% year-over-year. Messaging revenue, which makes up about 30% of total data, grew nearly 4% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. ","Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 8. We ended the year with industry-leading total connections of 108.7 million, up 6.3% from 2010. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market with 87.4 million connections, driven by demand for our unmatched portfolio of 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices. Retail net adds of 1.5 million in the quarter were the highest we've seen in 3 years. Within retail, 1.2 million were postpaid and 252,000 were prepaid. Within the postpaid net add mix, 1 million were smartphones and 400,000 were Internet data devices. The remaining being the net change in basic phones. Of particular interest, more than 700,000 of these net adds were 4G LTE smartphones or data devices.","In retail prepaid, fourth quarter net add growth was equally distributed between tablets and phones. This quarter marks the first time in 2 years that prepaid phones, excluding tablets, had positive net adds. This is due to the success of our $50 monthly unlimited prepaid phone offer, which we put in place on a national basis in mid-September. ","Postpaid device sales, which include both gross adds and upgrades, were significantly higher this quarter, driven by the Apple iPhone 4S, as well as the increasing popularity of our 4G LTE smartphones and Internet data devices. Retail postpaid gross adds totaled 3.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% sequentially and 7.6% year-over-year. The percentage of postpaid customers upgrading this quarter moved up to 10%.","The continued demand for our wireless products is not only driving growth in connections and revenue, but also strengthening our industry-leading customer loyalty metrics. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent once again, with retail postpaid churn of only 0.94%, an improvement of 7 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2010. ","Now let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at our smartphones and retail postpaid ARPU metrics.","As I said, we had a record quarter in terms of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 44%. A year ago, smartphone penetration was 28%. We have made very good progress in 2011. 70% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones, a solid increase from 60% in each of the last 2 quarters. ","During the quarter, we activated 4.3 million Apple iPhones and sold 1.6 million 4G LTE smartphones. In addition, we sold roughly 700,000 4G LTE Internet data devices. As I said, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum. ","Shifting now to ARPU. Retail postpaid ARPU was $54.80 this quarter, up 2.5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid phone ARPU exceeds $56, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Postpaid Internet devices have an ARPU of just under $49, which was down 11% from a year ago. This decline was mainly due to a strategic price change we made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We made this pricing move to expand the market, given our expectation that the superior capabilities of 4G LTE will generate more demand and increase data usage on these devices. We did expand the market in 2011 with approximately 3.8 million unit sales, which included mobile hotspots, USB modems and tablets. We now have about 7 million subscribers with these devices, representing about 8% of our retail postpaid base.","While the unit growth of these devices is diluting our overall retail postpaid ARPU at this time, fourth quarter revenue growth from these devices was 10% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to making a positive contribution to top line growth, the greater efficiency of our 4G LTE network means that this data revenue is also generating higher margins and driving improved profitability. ","Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10.","2011 was another strong year of industry leadership in terms of margin performance and cash generation. With the introduction of the Apple iPhone and numerous 4G LTE smartphones during the year, we indicated last January that margins would fluctuate in certain quarters depending on new device rollouts and sales. ","Looking back on our quarterly margin performance in 2011, shows this to be the case, with strong sales in the first and fourth quarters pressuring EBITDA. As I mentioned, the sales volumes in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations but, obviously, will create more opportunity for growth in 2012.","Our strong performance in terms of customer additions and market share gains, coupled with increased smartphone penetration, drove increases in retail service revenues and accelerating phone ARPU. In addition, our intense focus on cost efficiency is clearly helping to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies. Our industry-leading customer retention has also helped the margin and performance, which is a testament to the quality and reliability of our network and to the overall customer experience. ","Verizon Wireless continues to be the industry leader. And with another year of impressive overall performance, we've built great momentum heading into a new year, expecting to sustain our strong growth and profitability. ","Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $10.1 billion, a decline of $150 million or 1.5% year-over-year. With the full year Wireline revenue totaled $40.7 billion, down 1.3%. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 1.3% year-over-year, driven by FiOS revenue growth of 18.2%. In Global Enterprise, fourth quarter revenue also grew 1.3%, driven once again by Strategic Services, which increased 14.7% year-over-year. As I've said, Strategic Services, which include Terremark are growing portion of our revenue mix, representing 51% of total enterprise revenue in the fourth quarter.","From a profitability perspective, the fourth quarter Wireline EBITDA margin recovered nicely from the challenges of the third quarter, increasing 240 basis points sequentially to 23.8%. ","Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance, starting with mass markets on Slide 12.","Fourth quarter revenue for mass markets increased 0.7% on a year-over-year basis. Consumer revenue, which represents a majority of this category, grew 1.3% in the quarter. Consumer ARPU steadily increased throughout the year and is now more than $96. I would also highlight that our residential connections trends continue to improve. We lost 183,000 retail residential connections in the fourth quarter, representing the 7.3% decline, compared with the loss of 303,000 or 9% in the fourth quarter of last year. ","In broadband, we added 201,000 FiOS Internet subscribers in the quarter, increasing our subscriber base to 4.8 million and penetration to 36%. By adding in our 3.9 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.7 million broadband connections, adding a net positive 98,000 broadband connections in the fourth quarter. ","In FiOS Video, we added 194,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.2 million and increasing our penetration to 32%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 3.5 million customers are triple play and FiOS ARPU increased in the fourth quarter to more than $148 per month. In terms of our deployment, we ended the year with 16.5 million premises passed, adding just over 900,000 in 2011. We had 13.6 million homes open for sale for Internet and 13.3 million for video.","From my perspective, 2011 was a very good year for FiOS, both operationally and financially. For the full year, FiOS revenue grew 20% to $8.3 billion. Looking ahead, our focus will once again be to increase penetration, drive market and wallet share gains, realize more efficiency from a cost perspective and expand margins. ","Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise.","Strategic Services continued to drive the year-over-year improvement in Global Enterprise revenue, led by very strong growth in advanced services such as managed network, call center, IP communications and our cloud offerings. In the fourth quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 14.7% year-over-year, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services outpaced the decline in core Enterprise Services. Terremark revenues were up about 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter and roughly 18% year-over-year.","Within our Global Enterprise solutions, we are focused on shifting our product mix to higher gross service offerings and we continue to gain traction here. In less strategic areas like core voice, data and hardware, we've continued to look for ways to improve overall margin profitability. One example is our deemphasis on sales of hardware or CPE, particularly drop-ship equipment that is not part of an overall enterprise solutions bundle. ","During 2011, hardware sales were down roughly $340 million on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter alone, hardware revenue was down $147 million or 21.6% year-over-year. Looking at the services revenue component of Global Enterprises reveals a more positive growth trend. In the fourth quarter, Enterprise Services revenue grew 2.7% year-over-year, excluding Terremark, which was not part of our results a year ago. If Terremark was included, the rate of growth would've been higher but would not represent a true baseline.","In Global Wholesale, revenues in the fourth quarter declined 7.6% year-over-year due primarily to declines in voice, where we continued to experience secular pressures and lower volumes, offset in part by increases in certain data services. Our deemphasis of certain nonprofitable International Voice routes created downward pressure on revenue, but did contribute to improved wholesale margins. ","Let's move to Slide 14 for our 2011 wrap up.","We had a strong finish to a very solid year in 2011, giving us great momentum and confidence heading into the new year. Wireless, FiOS and Enterprise Strategic Services all contributed to significant improvements and adjusted revenue growth, where we moved from just under 2% in 2010 to more than 6% in 2011. These revenue improvements and our focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate various cost pressures throughout the business, creating solid growth in earnings and strong free cash flow, supported by our disciplined approach to capital spending. ","On the strategic front, we made a number of investments that have improved our competitive position and differentiated us in the marketplace, setting the stage for future growth and improved profitability. I believe investors recognized our progress in 2011, as our stock price appreciation and competitive dividend generated a total return to shareholders of 18.2%.","We enter 2012 with great confidence in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, you will see a renewed focus on delivering solutions to all of our customers and the markets that we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business. Our Global Enterprise solutions organization is just one example, highlighting a more integrated approach in how we develop and deliver customer solutions, including a vertical industry focus into areas like education and healthcare as examples. ","Another example is the way in which we are managing our top multinational accounts in collaboration with Vodafone where this makes sense for both companies. In terms of our acquisition of AWS spectrum from SpectrumCo, we are looking forward to closing the transaction after review by the Department of Justice and approval by the FCC, which we anticipate by midyear. We are also making progress in our additional agreements with the cable companies subject to the DOJ's expected review. ","Just last week, Comcast and Verizon announced that we are offering each other's products and services in Seattle and Portland as our initial markets. We expect to launch in additional cities in the coming months.","We have great momentum in Wireless and we expect to build on that strength, driving further penetration of smartphones and furthering our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets and effectively capture pent-up demand in multidwelling units and new markets. And in the enterprise space, we are clearly gaining traction as the leading global provider in the information technology solution space. The integration of Terremark and the addition of CloudSwitch have significantly improved our competitive position, giving us a unique set of capabilities to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure. ","Another key focus area will be to continue to drive operating efficiencies across and throughout the entire business. With the formation of our operational excellence and process transformation organization, reporting directly to Lowell, we are devoting dedicated resources to examining all costs and processes including product rationalization, back office operations and system consolidation. The upshot of our ability to execute and capture these incremental revenue opportunities and operating efficiencies will be an increase in the cash flows of the business. ","As I've said, the heavy investment cycles of the first 10 years of Verizon are largely behind us, and we have transformed ourselves into a company very well positioned in the growth markets of the future. We have the platforms, we have the people and we have the capabilities. We are poised to build on the strong foundation we have, accelerate the momentum we've achieved, further increase investment returns and create significant shareholder value in the years to come.","With that, I will turn the call back to John, so we can get to your questions.","John N. Doherty","Thanks, Fran. Brad, let's open it up for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","If we could just start with the -- or stay with the 2012 outlook. Last year, Fran, when you gave the 5% to 8% earnings growth, you also suggested that, that could double in 2012. Is that still the right range as we look forward here? And then turning to postpaid ARPU, you had a big quarter in terms of smartphones and Internet devices. Based on what you're seeing now, how do you expect those sort of growth trends on the postpaid ARPU side to progress, maybe in the first quarter and an outlook for 2012, if possible?","Francis J. Shammo","First of all, on the 2012 outlook, so let me start here. Actually, John and I are doing this call remotely from our Innovation Center up here in Waltham, which is just a pillar of how we're going to accelerate our growth in the future. As of many of you visited this facility, you saw the innovation of the products and the services, which I believe are pioneer in the industry of developing these types of solutions that will increase our revenue from a machine-to-machine perspective and everything that is going to be driven over our LTE network, which we believe we are a market leader in. So if you take the Wireless asset and then the FiOS asset and you look back at to what we said back in January of 2011, when Lowell and I first stood on this stage live, we stated that we had a year of execution in front of us and we ha certain targets that we wanted to hit. And I think that coming out of this year, I would say that my position has not changed from where I stood on that stage. So growth opportunities for the future, I believe, are there. As I said in my script remarks, I believe that the $2.15, as you look at it for 2012, should be a baseline of $2.20 as you project our growth out. But I would reiterate that my position from January has not changed as I sit here at the end of this year. Going on to postpaid ARPU growth, I think, if you look at this, we continue to grow our ARPU growth. I think that from an overall perspective, if you break that down, we had our phone ARPU grow to an all-time high of 4%. Now if you look back, that was 3.3% in the second quarter. That went up to 3.7% in the third and now sitting at 4% overall. So you can see that the smartphone penetration is accelerating that phone ARPU growth. As we've talked in the past, the Internet category has some dilution in it. So year-over-year, we're down 11% and this is reflected back when we changed our prices back in October perspective. So on an ARPU perspective of Internet devices, down 11%, but overall revenue growth from that category as we said, we did this to expand the category. And again, this quarter, we were up 24% year-over-year in the amount of Internet devices we added and we continue to have our strongest quarter of the year. So we are executing on the expansion of that category. So year-over-year, the actual revenue is up 10%, even though that there is some dilution in the ARPU side. So I think, John, to answer your question, I'm extremely positive and I stay with what I've said coming out of the third quarter. We continue to see that we can accrete our ARPU into the future of 2012.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe a couple of questions just related to Wireline margins. Fran, you talked about continued improvement into 2012, and I'm just wondering if you can help us with the baseline for that comment. Is that meant to be improvement off the 23.8% exit rate? Or is that a sort of general 2012 versus 2011 comment? And then related to that, can you just help us think through what the bigger drivers of improvement would be and if that includes any sort of benefit from the labor negotiations?","Francis J. Shammo","So the 23.8% coming out of the fourth quarter, what I would say is, we are very, very confident that through all of the things that we were doing on Wireline. First, start off with FiOS and our continued penetration there and we continue to gain market share in every market. New York continues to be our highest growing market there. So FiOS is a critical component to the growth of the Wireline on a top line basis. The other strategy that we've talked about a little bit in the past is the strategy of migrating our copper plant over to the FiOS plant, now that we have substantial FiOS passing prems, where there is also copper. So what you're going to going to see this year is a very strategic initiative that we go out and we look at areas, where there are chronic copper problems and we start to transform them onto our FiOS network. And the math would say, if there is a chronic problem that we have to visit more than 2x a year, the actual financial benefit of us transforming that to FiOS pays for itself within that year. So we will strategically start to go in there. What that brings is, that brings an enormous expense savings to us from just an overall operational plant perspective. That's one big component. The second is, obviously, with the new organization of Enterprise, we believe that with the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch, we continue to grow that top line. As I said, Terremark had an outstanding quarter, sequentially up 10%. That came out of a September all-time high booking. That will continue into '12 because, obviously, those bookings don't book all in the same quarter that you sell. In this business, it takes 6 to 12 months to record that revenue. So I think we're continuing to expand on our cloud services bases, which also helps top line revenue for Wireline. And then you get into the cost initiatives, which continue to really be a focus of the whole business unit. So from a foundational standpoint, what I would say is this, on a linear basis, you will see us increase Wireline margin. Will we have some setbacks here and there? Obviously, in the first quarter, we have a lot of tax resets and so forth. So from that perspective, you may see us decline a little bit in the first quarter. But from that point, we will accelerate and continue to overall improve the Wireline margin of the business. Now on the improvement side, I would tell you that we continue, from a labor negotiation standpoint, we continue to negotiate at the table. Obviously, as I said before, we expect that we need to reconfigure the cost structure of our Wireline business. And that gets to the heart of the healthcare and the pension benefits of the Wireline representative and employees. So our position has not changed, we will continue to negotiate in good faith with the union. And we'll report out when those negotiations are ended and where we end for that contractual period.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fran, that's helpful. If I could just ask for one clarification just on the prior sort of EPS commentary. You said nothing's changed from your January position. I'm just -- the clarification, I guess, would be the interpretation around the January position because the math of it would tell you, 5% to 8% growth and then double that, so 10% to 16% growth. But then the separate interpretation was double the rate of 2011 growth. So are you saying you're comfortable in doubling the rate of 2011 or you're comfortable with the original 10% to 16%?","Francis J. Shammo","Yes. It's more of, I'm comfortable with where we said we would be in January of '11. So my position has not changed.","Operator","Our next question will be from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Very strong results, obviously, from the iPhone, we've seen it across the industry. You talked about a very strong December. How should we think about Q1 versus Q4? Is this a product that's going to continue to have legs into the first quarter of the year? Or do you think the first quarter is going to be a more normal quarter as we'd had in, say, the first 9 months of the year. I'm including this sort of original iPhone launch? So any trends, I know it's early in the year, but anything -- how we should be thinking about Wireless margins in Q1? And then staying on wireless, you noted that there was some pressure on other service revenues from wholesale, roaming, I think that you lost your Telematics customer. Can you just give us a little bit more color about -- around that and what's going to sort of make that better in 2012?","Francis J. Shammo","So from a Wireless margin perspective, here, look, I think I'd look at it this way. You talked about one product, I talk about a whole portfolio of products. So if you look at our LTE lineup and just to give you some numbers. We sold almost 15 million Android-based products, and if you do the math for the quarter, it's about 10.8 million iPhone products. So they're both extremely significant to our portfolio. If you look at LTE, we're coming out of the year with almost 18 devices on our network and we will add 6 more in the first quarter of this year, leading us to 24. So I think that the way we look at it is, our momentum coming out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter and, obviously, the first quarter will be more of what we saw in the first 3 quarters because, obviously, the fourth quarter is always a much higher volume quarter just because of seasonality. So I would think that, Simon, on this one, what I would say is this: is we have a proven track record in Wireless that we both drive profitability and growth. And I would expect that in 2012, we will get back to and continue to improve on the Wireless margins. So if you look at what we did in the third quarter, going back, we had an iPhone in our portfolio. We had 3 quarters under our belt with a very real large lineup of 4G LTE devices, and we produced the highest margin in Wireless in the history of the Wireless business at 47.8% margins. So, I guess, what I would say to you is, is that we will strive to continue to improve on the Wireless margins, not only on the top line growth perspective, but we also in the last 2 years trimmed out almost $3 billion of cost in our Wireless business. So again, I think the focus will be to improve and continue to grow, as well improve on the profitability of the Wireless margins. On the wholesale side, there are 2 things happening. Obviously, I reported out that the third quarter, that with the sale of the Alltel properties, we knew that AT&T would be moving that traffic off of our network, which they did. And then in the reseller base, I think it's very important to note that the resellers that we have contracts with are mainly prepaid resellers. And as I've said in the past, as this has declined in the last couple of quarters, we have an issue with us which is, I will only enter into agreements that are win-win for both. And right now, the market is at a point, where I'm not going to compete on the wholesale rates that are in the marketplace. Although this is an extremely important channel for us and we continue to work with our highest resellers, we do have a shift mix in the reseller base. So we added 371,000 net reseller adds, but some of this is a mix change going into lower, what I would call, live source-type offerings and more universal service fund-type offerings, so they carry a lower ARPU than some of our historical prepaid voice resellers would. But overall, the profitability of this is still very substantial. But I also think it's important to note that as we attack the prepaid market, we performed and launched our Unleashed product which, coming out of the third quarter I said, and was very optimistic, that this would be the first quarter that we showed positive net adds in that product space and we actually did. So from a net perspective, we had net adds in prepaid for the first time in, at least in the past 2 years. So we are starting to gain momentum in the prepaid market, both through the reseller channel but also through our unleashed channel. So I think that's what you can continue to see. So that's for the wholesale roaming side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe let's talk about CapEx to start. You talk about better efficiency in the slide deck. So with the revenue rising, should we think about that as being sort of flat? And then also on the cash outlay side, can you talk about cash taxes in 2012? Do you expect that to be sort of in line with the GAAP taxes or maybe a little higher as bonus depreciation starts to slip away?","Francis J. Shammo","So from a CapEx perspective, coming out of the first half of this year, I stated that we would have very strong management of our capital expense as we continued to build out the EV-DO network and the capacity required to carry the iPhone on the 3G network from a capacity standpoint. And I think you've seen that Verizon Wireless has managed this extremely efficiently by moving higher end Internet devices off of the 3G network onto our 4G network. And just one other note is, in the fourth quarter, all of our Internet devices sold, 100% of those adds, were all on the 4G LTE network. So I think from a CapEx standpoint, what I would say is, I would not expect any change here from a disciplined capital spending coming out of the back end of 2011 going into '12. And as I said, we will continue to improve our overall CapEx-to-revenue ratio. So I wouldn't expect you to see anything differently than what we've executed on through 2011. As far as cash outlay, from a cash tax perspective, as you know, the bonus depreciation is Safe Harbor for 2012. So there really is no additional cash tax from the bonus depreciation and, obviously, there's still a lot of things that we're looking at for 2012 from a bonus depreciation discussion down in Washington, of an extension of that, possible overall corporate tax restructure. So we look at those things. But I will tell you, that even without that, we continue on a very complex organization of taxes for federal purposes, continue to strategize and continue to think of how we best utilize our structure to make sure that we have as minimal cash outlay as possible from a cash tax perspective. The only thing I will highlight from a cash differentiation for 2012 is the pension plan contribution, as I talked about. This will go from $400 million up to $1.26 million for '12, and those contributions will be made more or less smoothly through the year, but the first and the third quarter will be around $400 million and then evenly in the second and fourth quarters. So that really is the only change from what I would expect from a cash outlay. The only other thing I would say is, as our profits continue to increase and we grow bottom line, obviously, our cash taxes will increase with them.","Operator","Our next question will come from Timothy Horan of Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'm just trying to understand, Fran, your comments on LTE. Maybe what you're thinking on market share and on the pricing for LTE. It's clearly expanded the market, but maybe when do you think you'll have the ability to go out and raise prices for LTE. And I'm not sure if you gave the numbers, but what percentage of LTE subscribers are new to Verizon and maybe how does that compare with the iPhone? And lastly, it just seems like LTE is just a huge advantage this year. Do consumers really understand it? Is the advantage really going to be pressed with all the new devices that you have coming out? And just how you're thinking about LTE versus your competition for this year, which it seems, it was the year you'd be able to capture a lot of the high-end subscribers off your peers?","Francis J. Shammo","I think that just from an overall market perspective, obviously, we believe that we are, without a doubt, the market leader in this innovation pioneering of the technology of LTE. We have now over 200 million POPs covered, which exceeded what our original plans were to achieve 185 million POPs. And as I said, we initially told that we would have 3G and 4G coverage about the same by the end of 2013, and we have now said by mid-2013, we'll have that coverage fulfilled. So, I think, from just an overall leadership position and a market position, I think we're in great shape. From a pricing perspective, obviously, we did the fourth quarter promotion, where we said we doubled your allowance coming, so that we would have more enticement of people looking at the 4G product. And as you can see, we had our all-time high of 4G devices moved, of over 2.4 million devices in the quarter moved, from that strategy. So I think overall pricing what I would say is this, I think you'll see more movement on device pricing than you will on overall service pricing. We'll have to see what the competitive marketplace holds for this. But I think that from just an overall perspective, LTE will be a market leadership for us. And it's not only around just the retail market, but we can't lose sight of the machine-to-machine market. And obviously, I said, I was sitting up here in the innovation lab, there is a lot of technology and innovation that's going to come out around an automobile, around healthcare, around energy conservation that really will leap bound anything that we see currently in the marketplace today. So I think that from a machine-to-machine perspective, we continue to see growth in our adds quarter-over-quarter, and I see that continuing through 2012 and have a market leadership position there.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citigroup.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First, could we just get an update on Verizon Wireless debt and cash at the end of the quarter? And then secondly, could we just get a deeper dive on what's happening in the improvement in Global Enterprise revenue? What are the products that you find are really helping the Strategic Service revenue growth? And then, are you also seeing less headwinds on -- those downward pressures on the legacy side of Enterprise?","Francis J. Shammo","So from a Verizon Wireless perspective, they're going to end the year at $12.3 billion worth of cash on the balance sheet. They have $11.6 billion of debt, so they're actually in a surplus position of $700 million. For 2012, they have about $1.6 billion of maturities coming that will be paid down. And as I said, within the next week, we will have a $10 billion distribution to both of the parents there. So that's the situation of the cash and the debt on the Wireless side. From an enterprise perspective, I think that it's critical here, just overall, with this organizational structure that Lowell has set up with the Enterprise Solutions Group. It is key for us because, I said before, as we approached our enterprise customers, we still had a delineation between a wireless solution and a wireline solution. And now that the organizations come together with the product rationalization that I talked about, it's going to be critical for us to present one solution to our customer end-to-end. And that really, I think, will elevate where we are today just from an overall strategic services position. But to get to your question, Mike, about exactly what are we selling. Obviously, cloud services, the acquisition of Terremark, the addition of CloudSwitch, the opening of the NAP center in Amsterdam, the expansion of our S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil data center which quite honestly, up to the acquisition of Terremark, Verizon really never played or had a position in Latin America, so this is a very high growth area for us. So I think, one, absolutely around the cloud, but also the convergence of cloud and what that brings to -- from an overall enterprise mobility standpoint and the integration of that cloud and that mobility solution when you look at machine-to-machine and cloud and what that can bring to an enterprise customer in a vertical solution set. So I think you're going to see more and more around cloud, but machine-to-machine. And then obviously, around our IT and advanced communication offerings. But there also is a differentiation as to what we sell here in North America versus what we sell outside of North America. And as I said before, outside on international, again, this quarter we grew our international enterprise base by an excess of 9%. So even with all of the pressures you see around the world, we continue to grow. Now, obviously, that's because of our low market share in those markets, but continued growth for us. And as we expand internationally, I think you'll see more international growth out of us, especially around the cloud services. And as I said, the collaboration of Vodafone where it makes sense. So I think there's a couple of different facets there, but I am very -- I have a very good outlook for our Enterprise revenue growth going into '12, even with the continued stabilization of the economy and we have not forecasted much growth there but stabilization would be a key. And if there is growth there, then I think we are even more optimistic on our Enterprise growth.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo.","Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered but just on FiOS, nice growth there. I know you said it's going to be a large part of the revenue contribution in Wireline next year, or this year rather. Can you just comment on the pricing you're seeing there and the competitive environment specifically with the cable players?","Francis J. Shammo","Yes. I think this is extremely important because as I've said before, I know folks are saying that we're overly competitive in pricing. But what I would say is, that the pricing has not actually changed and if anything, if you look at it, there was a price increase in 2011. And there will probably be some more price increases in 2012 as we go here. But I think the differentiation we have here is, we have a superior product in FiOS. It is taking hold in the marketplace. We are seeing, as I said, New York is our highest growing market. This past year, we crossed a milestone in Virginia. We passed 40% penetration on our video services. You can see we had a good quarter on broadband connection in FiOS. And I think if you look at the line loss that we set at 7.2%, you can see that, that strategy of the chronic, we started that in the fourth quarter of this year a little bit. You can see that we are starting to convert copper voice customers onto FiOS. So continuing to grow and hold on to that declining revenue stream of the legacy products. So I think, overall, FiOS will continue to play a very important strategic role in the future of Wireline. We will compete vigorously with this, even with the agreements that we entered into with the cable companies. If you look at the innovation agreement, that innovation will come into FiOS. And being a superior product already, that innovation will add what we can bring to the consumer base from an overall perspective. So I think, overall, I'm very optimistic on our FiOS penetration for 2012.","Operator","Your last question will come from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two, if I could. Just first, Fran, going back to the Wireless pricing equation. You guys have had, I think, a comfort level with your products' status relative to others, pricing it at a premium. We saw a price hike a year ago from Sprint. We saw an overall kind of refresh of pricing from AT&T recently. You have talked about the introduction of new family plan prices. If you could kind of elaborate a little bit on how the pricing lever can be used to kind of grow ARPU in 2012, that would be helpful. And then second, the Wireline revenue side would probably have grown in aggregate, if it weren't really for the kind of other segment, which kind of fell off in 4Q. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on, on what's going on there and what the outlook for that is in '12?","Francis J. Shammo","So, David, just to follow up, you're talking on the wholesale side of Wireline?","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sorry, on the -- there's consumer, small business equals mass markets, then Strategic Services and other, which was 1.94 down from 1.99 in 3Q.","Francis J. Shammo","Okay. All right. Very good. Thanks. So from an overall Wireless pricing equation, I think that we are the market leader. We set our tier pricing structure when we launched our 4G network. And as I've said, the way we positioned our 4G tier pricing was that based on our future view of where usage would go, we saw that we had opportunity from a tiered structure and the proliferation of video through the LTE network that we would grow our revenue streams. And that's what we're seeing just from an overall tiered pricing structure. As we continue to mature this, we have said that we are looking at family data plans, if you will, and we continue to look at that. And obviously, the play there is, is to make sure that it's a win-win for the customer and a win-win for us from an accretion standpoint. So we continue to work that. But I think that it's important to note that we are a premium-priced product, but we will win in the marketplace just like we did with Unleashed even though that, that's priced $10 above the market. We now see that there are niches of people that want to be on the best network in the world. So I think that will continue to be our strategy, and we'll see here as 2012 goes. As far as Wireline goes on that, I think wholesale, we continue to see pressure on the wholesale side of the business just from a legacy voice. And as we transform this business from a legacy voice business to a data business, continue with our fiber to the cell program, which we are building out for various wireless carriers. This continues to be very good business for us, but not quite enough to offset the voice loss. So I think we'll continue to see pressure in there going into 2012. As far as the other category, this is legacy MCI 108 traffic, call collect-type traffic, which will continue to decline. It's not something that's strategic for us and we'll just really move that as a cash cow at this point, and that will continue to decline. So overall, the focus here is on the consumer Wireline margin, the Enterprise portfolio and then also the wholesale portfolio.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.","John N. Doherty","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.","Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.","I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.","This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.","I'd like to state that all quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Also, there were no special items of nonoperational nature included in our reported results for the first quarter, of either this year or last.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.","Francis J. Shammo","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our first quarter results. On our last earnings call in January, I talked about the confidence we have in our ability to benefit from the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. Our focus will continue to be on execution, striving to capture incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. With the results of our first quarter, we continue to execute and deliver on the guidance we gave back in January of 2011 and reaffirmed earlier this year. We remain as confident in the direction of our business now as we were then, and we continue to deliver strong results.","Earnings per share were $0.59, up 15.7% over first quarter last year. In Wireless, we saw a sharp acceleration of growth in retail service revenue and postpaid ARPU, driven by increased smartphone penetration and higher data device adoption, resulting in increased usage. This top line growth, combined with effective cost management, resulted in a very strong service EBITDA margin. Consumer retail revenue growth also continues to improve, driven by another solid quarter of FiOS performance. Our broadband net adds were the highest we have seen in nearly 3 years.","We had an extremely strong quarter of cash generation. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion is more than 3.5x the amount generated a year ago. The first quarter is normally the lowest quarter of the year, so we expect to see increasing free cash flow levels going forward. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were down more than 18% as our disciplined approach is resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business.","Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4. Our consolidated results show strong growth this quarter. On the top line, our growth trends continue to be very positive, coming from all strategic areas, most notably, Wireless services. This quarter, overall revenue growth far outweighed the increase in operating expenses, resulting in double-digit operating income growth of 16.7%. Consolidated EBITDA grew to $9.2 billion, and our margin expanded to 32.7%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and 210 basis points sequentially.","Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. Our free cash flow this quarter increased $1.7 billion, driven by reduced levels of capital spending and an 18% increase in cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $3.6 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $800 million compared to last year. Our overall capital efficiency continued to show steady improvement. We expect our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio to decline for the full year based on improving revenue trends and disciplined capital spending.","In Wireless, capital spending in the quarter was $1.9 billion, which was lower by $850 million or 31% from the first quarter last year. You will recall that at this time last year, we were spending more to meet 3G capacity requirements in connection with our initial launch of the iPhone. As we move through the year, you will see a continued focus on migrating traffic from 3G to 4G LTE, which will drive additional improvements in our capital and operating efficiency. We will also continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation.","In Wireline, capital spending was $1.5 billion this quarter, about 5% higher than the first quarter last year. This increase is due to timing, strategic spending in enterprise and some copper-to-fiber migration within our residential customer base.","Our balance sheet remains very strong. You will recall that the $10 billion cash distribution from Verizon Wireless was paid this quarter. We used our proportionate share and part to pay down commercial paper and to redeem a maturing bond. As a result, total debt declined by $3.6 billion since the end of last year. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.3x at the end of the quarter.","Let's now move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless business had an impressive quarter and a strong start to the year, posting accelerated growth in service revenue and our highest retail postpaid ARPU accretion in 3 years. Total Wireless revenues of $18.3 billion grew 8.2% and now represent about 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue. Retail service revenue growth accelerated to 8.9%, 110 basis point increase in growth from the fourth quarter and the highest growth rate we've seen since early 2009. We are seeing strong revenue growth from multiple postpaid sources: Smartphones, tablets and Internet devices. And retail prepaid revenue grew strongly again this quarter, up 17.3%.","Total service revenue grew 7.7% this quarter, 130 basis points higher than the growth rate in the fourth quarter. Total data revenue of $6.6 billion grew 21.1%. Data now represents nearly 43% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continues to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4.3 billion in the quarter, up nearly 36%.","Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 7. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market, driven by sustained demand for our 3G and 4G LTE handsets, tablets and Internet devices. With the unmatched service quality of the nation's largest and most reliable wireless network. We have an industry-leading $93 million retail connections, 88 million postpaid and 5 million prepaid. During the quarter, we added 734,000 new retail net connections, 501,000 postpaid and 233,000 prepaid.","Before we discuss postpaid in more detail, I'd point out that within the prepaid net adds, 138,000 were tablets. About 60% of the prepaid tablets this quarter were 4G LTE. Within the retail postpaid category, gross additions were just over 3 million, down about 12% from a year ago. We believe this decline is both seasonal and a function of the timing of the new device launches last year. Our porting ratios with all carriers are favorable, and our postpaid churn metrics remain excellent. Although the first to report, we are confident that our 501,000 postpaid net adds is a strong result.","Postpaid device sales, both gross adds and upgrades, totaled about 10 million this quarter with 8% of our postpaid base upgrading devices. In addition to smartphones, we are also having great success in the Internet device category, which includes tablets. This quarter, we sold 765,000 4G LTE Internet devices, which is more than last quarter. We are the market leader in this space as mobile hotspots or Jetpacks, USB modems and tablets represent 8% of our retail postpaid connections. I would also point out that 62% of our active tablet base is postpaid.","Next, let's turn to Slide 8 and take a look at our smartphone and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. We had another strong quarter of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 47%. 72% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones. We sold 3.2 million Apple iPhones and sold 2.1 million 4G LTE smartphones this quarter. We sold 500,000 or 30% more 4G LTE smartphones this quarter than we did in the fourth quarter.","Consistent with prior quarters, about 20% of our smartphone sales are gross adds or new to Verizon, and the rest are upgrades from our existing customer base. Within these upgrades, 42% are customers buying a smartphone for the first time, representing incremental recurring data revenue. This is a significant point of differentiation and a strength for us.","Retail postpaid ARPU was $55.43 this quarter, up 3.6%. This is a big acceleration in accretion over what we experienced in 2011. Growth in retail postpaid phone ARPU accelerated to 4.9% this quarter and now exceeds $57.","Postpaid Internet device ARPU was about $48 this quarter, a decline of 8.7% from last year but an improvement from an 11% year-over-year decline last quarter. Although postpaid ARPU for Internet devices is less than for phones, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year revenue growth driven by increased unit sales. We already have a majority share in this important category, and we continue to expand the market for devices, which enable higher usage. We also expect more network efficiency as an increasing percentage of data traffic moves to our 4G LTE network.","Let's turn to Slide 9, as I'd like to spend a few more minutes talking about the strength of our 4G LTE leadership. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 230 markets and more than 200 million POPs, covering over 2\/3 of the country. Throughout the year, we will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network by mid-2013. We are seeing increasing customer awareness of the capabilities of 4G LTE and a growing recognition of the superior performance of smartphones, tablets and Internet devices on the Verizon 4G LTE network. Third-party comparisons of our 4G LTE network performance compared with others generally ranks us highest in terms of consistency of access, performance and speed, with better average download speeds and significantly higher average upload speed.","In addition to our network deployment and coverage advantage, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum. In the first quarter, we sold 2.9 million postpaid smartphones and Internet devices, a 22% increase over the fourth quarter. The vast majority of devices we have for sale are 4G LTE. We now have a total of 8 million 4G LTE customer connections, representing 9% of our postpaid base. Of note, about 2\/3 of these are smartphones. We remain very pleased by our 4G LTE progress. The Verizon 4G LTE network has become the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a very positive indicator for us looking forward.","Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. In the first quarter, we generated $7.1 billion of EBITDA, which is an increase of 14.2%, and expanded our service EBITDA margin by 410 basis points sequentially to 46.3%. Our margin performance is once again a testament to our ability to execute very well on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. The combination of accelerating service revenue and ARPU growth, and intense focus on cost controls and consistently excellent churn metrics are contributing to our industry-leading margin performance.","Going forward, we will continue to look at opportunities to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies and commissions. We have identified $2 billion of cost saving opportunities for this year, and we are on track to capture these savings. We also announced the $30 upgrade fee, which will go into effect next week.","Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. Total Wireline revenue declined $202 million or 2% in the first quarter. About 60% of this decline is a result of targeted product rationalization actions we have taken to improve the quality of our revenue mix. Within wholesale, I'm referring to our continued exit from unprofitable international wholesale routes and contracts. In Enterprise, it is our deemphasis on selling of drop ship hardware or CPE. And the other revenue line item, the majority of the 82 million decline this quarter was from nonstrategic products, which include the former MCI mass markets business, long-distance, local wholesale and calling cards, public pay phones and directory assistance. We are exiting the calling card and public payphone businesses entirely.","While the Wireline revenue decline was accentuated by these targeted actions this quarter, growth in the strategic areas continues to mitigate the more secular and cyclical declines in other parts of the business. As we have stated, we are taking a hard look at all of our product lines and rationalizing those that are not meeting our strategic and financial requirements. For example, going forward, we will no longer be selling high-speed Internet or DSL over copper in areas where FiOS is available.","From a profitability perspective, first quarter EBITDA declined by $148 million year-over-year with 100 basis point decline in the EBITDA margin to 22.6%. The decline is due to several factors, revenue declines in less-strategic products and first quarter cost pressures like higher OPEB accruals, increased active benefit cost and escalators in certain content contracts. We have targeted price actions planned to help offset certain cost increases, which will contribute to our overall profitability goals this year. I remain confident that we will achieve EBITDA margin improvement for the full year, and we continue to be very focused on improving the long-term profitability of the Wireline business.","Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance starting with mass markets on Slide 12. As a result of the scale of FiOS and increased penetration, consumer ARPU has continued to steadily increase and is now over $97, up 8%. In addition, our residential connections trends continued to improve. We lost 205,000 retail residential connections in the quarter, representing a 6.8% decline year-over-year compared with a loss of 289,000 or 8.6% at this time last year. In the first quarter, we delivered strong broadband growth, gaining a total of 104,000 net subscribers. With a 193,000 FiOS Internet additions, we passed the 5 million FiOS subscriber mark and increased our penetration to 36.4%.","More than half our FiOS customers already use 20 megabit speed or higher. And with more devices like tablets, game consoles and smart TVs connecting to the Internet at home, demand for higher broadband speeds is on the rise. Later this year, we plan to introduce a series of higher speed packages that will further differentiate FiOS as the nation's fastest Internet service and allow us to continue to monetize our investment in the FiOS platform.","In FiOS Video, we added 180,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.4 million and increasing our penetration to 32.3%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 68% are triple-play, and our FiOS ARPU now stands that more than $148 per month. Our focus continues to be on increasing FiOS penetration, realizing additional operating and capital efficiencies and expanding margins.","Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise. Strategic Services continue to drive the overall positive growth in Global Enterprise revenue. We continue to post double-digit growth in application services like managed network, data center, security, cloud and IT infrastructure. Within the IP layer, private IP and Ethernet services are contributing to the growth.","In the first quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 11.6%, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services did outpace the decline in core Enterprise Services but not to the same degree.","As you might expect, we are experiencing some short-term revenue pressure from Europe and foreign-currency. In addition, our deemphasis on sale of hardware was worth about $43 million on a year-over-year basis. Growth in services revenue was 2.3%. Looking ahead, we do expect our enterprise business to contribute more to the overall Wireline revenue growth and profitability.","Our strategic repositioning of Verizon Enterprise Solutions has better aligned our strength in high-growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. Our acquisitions of best-in-class assets like Cybertrust, Terremark and CloudSwitch, combined with our industry-leading 4G LTE and global IP networks, gives us a unique platform of assets to provide comprehensive, integrated solutions to enterprise organizations.","In Global Wholesale, revenues in the first quarter declined $181 million or 8.9% due primarily to declines in voice and local services. As I said, we continue to take targeted actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts, to improve the quality of our revenue mix during this period of secular decline and lower volumes. Partly offsetting these declines were continued growth in certain data services, most notably, fiber-based Ethernet.","Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, we had a solid start to the year, and we remain confident in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see and our key strategic growth areas. We are on track with our plans, and we expect to continue to deliver strong results going forward. Our focus will continue to be on execution, striving to capture incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. Our success in stimulating top line growth and capturing cost savings will enable us to mitigate certain secular declines and cost pressures.","In terms of recent news, yesterday, we announced plans to conduct an open sale process for all of our 700 megahertz A and B Spectrum licenses in order to rationalize our Spectrum holdings. We acquired these licenses as part of the FCC auction 73 in 2008. The sale of this license is contingent upon the close of the purchase of the AWS licenses from SpectrumCo, Cox and Leap Wireless. These transactions are at varying stages of review by the FCC and the Department of Justice and are expected to close by mid-summer.","In closing, I'd reemphasize that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the investments we've made, further improving investment returns and creating significant shareholder value in the years to come.","With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can get to your questions.","John N. Doherty","Thanks, Fran. Brad, let's open it up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fran, a couple of questions. First on the Wireless ARPU, very healthy uptick in the retail postpaid growth rate. Can you help us think through prospects for further improvement in the rate of growth from here? And then second question just on Wireline margins, I think the reset in the first quarter was a bit larger than most of us had initially expected sort of going into the process. You talked about confidence in improvement from here. Just wondering how should we think about the pacing of this through the year? Would you expect it to be fairly linear and show up in the second quarter results or is this more back-end loaded, maybe contingent on a union contract?","Francis J. Shammo","So let's start. These are 2 actually big questions, and that probably will result in larger answers than you would expect. But on Wireless ARPU, let's start out with the fact that I think as we started out in 2011, we said that we had a path to accelerate the growth of our revenue. We came out of the fourth quarter, I reiterated my confidence on that projection. And as I sit here today and I will continue to reiterate that we are confident that we will continue to accelerate our growth in this category. And it's going to come from many, many different areas. So you have to keep in mind, number one, our smartphone penetration is at 47%, which means that there are 53% of our phone customers that are still on a basic phone. So we still have a lot of roadway here from a basic to smart upgrade. And as you know, 42% of our customers this quarter went from a basic phone into a smartphone category, so that is accelerating the growth. In addition, as you heard on the script, our Internet device category is starting to stabilize a bit, and we expect that to continue to go throughout the quarter on an ARPU basis. As last year, we reset prices, we expanded the category, so the growth of that category is expanding for us, but we knew we had some short-term ARPU pressure by the price resets that we launched into the marketplace. But that set us up for our 4G LTE launches. And as you saw, we had a stellar performance on a number of devices that we moved on our 4G network this quarter. So that's a couple of things. I probably could go into a lot more detail around our data sharing plans, our commercial launch of Fusion and if we want to get to more discussion on that, we can. But we are very, very confident that we are on a path to continue to accelerate the growth of our ARPU. On Wireline margins, just a couple of things here, too, to talk to. So number one, we did have the FiOS-to-copper migration, which impacted our short-term results but we've talked that this is a strategy that we're deploying. It is better for us long-term to get most of these customers off of our copper network to our FiOS network. As you saw that we are -- stopped selling our naked DSL in FiOS covered area and we started to convert a number of customers in this quarter over to our FiOS network from a voice perspective. Now a couple of things here that this will launch, number one, we will see a long-term benefit in our repairs and maintenance decrease over time. We will also get the upsell capability to start selling these voice customers on better speeds of FiOS and better experience. And also then into the linear TV product that we have to offer. And what we're seeing is the minimum number that we converted last year during our trials, we're starting to see a 30% sale upgrade on those customers, but it does take us 3 to 6 months to convince those customers to upgrade. So this is a longer-term type strategy. In addition, going into the future, you're going to see, you may have already saw, that we are starting to do some price-ups in strategic areas. We've also started that in April but over the next 2 quarters, we're going to have several priced-ups in our FiOS packages. In addition, we're going to rebundle certain of our packages to better bundle our content in order to make it more profitable based on the Tier that you picked for us. The other thing is that there's other revenue streams coming from down the pipe like home monitoring control that will contribute to the overall ARPU of our FiOS platform. We also have a very disciplined cost structure in place. As you see that, we declined our SG&A expense year-over-year. In April, we also had another ISP [ph] to our represented employees, which we had a number of people take. So we've already taken off 1,100 people from payroll since the quarter has closed. We are taking other measures around the consolidation of our back office operations, as I've talked to in the past. You see that we are exiting some of our unprofitable or low-margin businesses, which will help us in the future. And then, of course, the union contract and we can talk more about that. But obviously, the business needs a cost restructure and that's what that is about. So I'll stop there, I'm sure we'll have some more questions here.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fran, is there any way you could quantify the copper-to-fiber sort of incremental cost in the quarter?","Francis J. Shammo","At this point, we're not going to disclose that. It did result in some incremental capital for prepositioning and then it did the result in some expense for us. But actually for this quarter, it was not a big component of the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First, just 2 quick ones. First, on, I guess a follow-up on the Wireless side. You saw 260 basis points of annual margin improvement in the first quarter. And now talking about accelerating ARPU growth and like you said, the $30 that gets started gets tagged onto upgrades in May. I mean, is that a decent number or, I guess, why shouldn't we expect that kind of year-over-year increase in margins or maybe even better as the $30 starts to flow-through? And then, second of all, maybe on use of cash, could you remind us what your target leverage ratio is. We're at the, I guess, 1.3 now given that debt pay down. As we look out to next year and we're modeling another dividend, obviously you don't want to chat and you don't want to sort of look that far out, but I'm just trying to get a sense for the use of cash as we go forward?","Francis J. Shammo","Okay, so, on the Wireless margin expansion. I guess there's a couple of things here that are important. Number one is, as you know, we have been on a 2-year track here to reduce expenses in our Wireless unit. And over the last 2 years, we've taken out about $3 billion of expense. This year, we have another target of $2 billion. So I know that everyone is focused in on the subsidy model, but as I've said, that's just one line item in our P&L, and it takes managing the entire business to be an efficient business. And I think that Wireless has done a really excellent job on reduction of cost and creating more efficiency within the model. And that's what's driving the margins, beside the ARPU increases that you see in the revenue growth. And as we stated last year coming into this year, that our goal was to get back to our third quarter level of last year's margin and then continue to grow from there, and we're putting in all those actions to do that. As far as the $30 upgrade fee, I'll remind everyone that we started back in 2010 on a strategy to start to take out some of the lucrative promotions we had around upgrades by deleting the New Every Two program, limiting the amount of early upgrades that we allowed. And now the implementation of the $30 upgrade fee, which we were the last carrier to implement. But it's important, too, for the overall profitability of the business, and the experience that we expect to have within this business. So I think there's a number of actions that Wireless is taking to continue to focus on the ARPU expansion and then the margin expansion because we like to do both at Verizon, we grow and we expand our margins. And then as far as the use of cash here, on a targeted net debt-to-EBITDA. It's more important that I think we're comfortable with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. This will improve over time as we continue to delever in certain areas where we think it's reasonable to do. You saw us take the proceeds of the Wireless dividend this quarter to pay down some debt that was maturing that was high-interest debt that, quite honestly, didn't make sense at this time to refinance in any perspective. So we will continue to manage our cash. Important, our dividend policy is extremely important to us, and Lowell and I have said very strongly that we will continue to the policy of our dividend. So I'll stop there, and we'll go on to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You talked about the Wireline margins and I think there was a question about the union contract. Could you give us an update on where you stand and the ability -- if it's just been moved forward and get progress, some agreement over the coming quarters? And then on Wireless adds, you had I'm sure the best in the industry, but overall, we expect the industry to be flat to down on postpaid. Do you sense this is just a lull post the iPhone 4S launch last quarter? Did to see a sort of a pickup sequentially through the quarter, any thoughts about how the rest of the quarters pan out in terms of Wireless versus Q1?","Francis J. Shammo","So first let's talk about the union contract. So look, I think it's safe to say that as we entered into this new negotiation, we knew that this is going to be an extremely difficult negotiation. We have said very strongly that we need cost structure within the Wireline business. Obviously, if you look at the profitability of this business over the last 5 years, it has decreased. And this cost structure is not palatable going forward. So we need to some concessions, we need health care contributions. We need some pension revisions. And look, were not asking for things that have not already been given to other companies. These are not new issues. They've already been given to some of our peer companies. So we are standing strong. We need this cost restructure in order to build on the profitability of our Wireline unit. The other thing is, look, we've invested over $24 billion into this unit on the FiOS platform. And in order for us to be competitive with our competitors of cable who don't have these very lucrative benefits and average salaries of $90,000 with an incremental $50,000 of healthcare and pension on top of that, we need some cost restructure here. So look, this is a hard negotiation. It took one of our peer companies over 500 days to get to where they were, 3 years ago in some of these breakthrough issues. So we continue to negotiate. We continue to put proposals on and we'll see where we go, but we knew this was going to be a long haul. And with my comment of improvement of Wireline margins, it's all built in those comments. On the Wireless adds, I think we're extremely pleased with the growth of our Wireless business on an add basis. If you look at, though there's going to be other categories that drive the growth of Wireless in the future, as I said, we will be launching our data share plan in mid-summer this year. We believe that, that plan, the way we have it designed, will enable our customers to easily connect other devices to that plan. And I think that as we do more connections, you notice that we did not disclose total connections. As I've said that machine-to-machine is becoming a more complicated device and connection of the way the plans are built, so it's not important anymore of total connections. It's more important of our revenue increase based on the customers that we're growing. I think that if you look at our Fusion product that we just launched in certain states, our trials are going very well. The customers' experience is extremely strong. We had a target of 10 million homes that we're going to launch to in May, of this year, when we commercially launch. And that we'll build to, as we build out the 4G LTE footprint to a target of 34 million homes. We believe that's a growth engine for us in the future. Then we have tablets, we have prepaid. This is the second quarter in a row where we've grown our prepaid base with our Unleashed product. And in the next week or so, you're going to see us add in a smartphone to our prepaid product on an $80 price point with 1 gigabit of data. So there's a number of actions that we're taking. If you think about the third ecosystem and then also the cable partnership that we also just launched some new markets with Time Warner cable this past quarter, Kansas, Ohio and Carolinas. So we've continue to expand. I think we have a growth rate test to increase adds on a full year basis here, and we're on that track.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMC.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So 2 questions, we'll see how I do. So first on the prepaid, tablets were up little bit, and I wonder if you saw a little bit of a drag even though from the timing of the iPad launch and if things have got a little better since things -- since that's come through? And then second, we've been getting a lot of questions about your ability to control iPhone subsidies. And maybe you can help us out a little bit. It seems like the way you control costs, some [indiscernible] raising upgrade rates, some sort of pushing back on timing rather than cutting down on the actual subsidy of that device, is there a level of control you have on those subsidies over time or are you pretty much stuck with the way things are priced today?","Francis J. Shammo","So first on prepaid tablets. It's a great point. We did see a slowdown in the beginning of the quarter on the anticipation of the iPad 4G LTE device coming to market. And as you know, that was only about 2, 2.5 weeks of product in the marketplace. And we saw significant volume previous to any volume that we had previously seen on tablet sales. So I think that going to the second quarter, that volume will continue. So yes, there was a little bit of a downward demand in the beginning, waiting for the new iPad to come out. So again, I think we're off to a good start. We sold 390,000 tablets in the quarter. And as we said, bulk of them were -- 60% were increase in tablet sales year-over-year. So I think going into the future, tablets will continue to be a very strategic segment of our business. On the Apple iPhone, look, I think as I've said before, we look at every individual handset, we have a broad portfolio. We manage it by handset-by-handset and manage our subsidy and again, that's just one aspect of our P&L. And this is just a nature of this business that's grown from the beginning of the industry that we subsidize handsets. I do think though it is important that there is a third ecosystem that's brought into the mix here. And we are fully supportive of that with Microsoft, and as we said that we created the Android platform from beginning. And it is an incredible platform today that we helped to create. And we're looking to do the same thing with a third ecosystem. So that's how I think that we plan to go into the future here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Real quick. Could we just get an update on the net debt at the Wireless level? And then taking a step back, could we get an update on what's happening in enterprise with the VDMS strategy that you're trying to rollout and then anything else in terms of demand that you're seeing on video and how that's helping your enterprise business?","Francis J. Shammo","So on the net debt for wireless, we have gross debt of $10.9 billion, cash on hand of $4.4 billion, so net debt is $6.4 billion. On the enterprise, VDMS, think we're making great progress with the new organization and the umbrella organization that John Stratton has over both Wireless and Wireline from an enterprise perspective. We have gone very deep into verticals. We see that there is, and if you paid attention to Lowell's remarks here recently at the healthcare forum, we see a lot of healthcare opportunity and are engaging in a lot of partnerships to extend what we think is a really good product set on the reduction of overall healthcare costs in the nation, but also to deliver some really neat innovation-type ideas into the future of healthcare and how we manage that from an enterprise perspective. As far as overall growth of the segment, we did see a decline this quarter in Europe. It was not expected. Just to give you some baseline here, last year, our European market was growing on average about 13%. It contributes about $450 million of revenue per quarter. We saw that drop to flat this quarter. So there was a drastic pullback in our European market. We don't believe that, that is long-term. We think that that's more of a short-term issue. We already started to see some increased bookings here exiting the first quarter, but that probably won't turn into revenue for 3 to 6 months. As you know, this industry is a longer-term type recording from the time that you get an order. But I think this is a short-term issue for us, but it did put an impact on our overall growth. Now having said that, our cloud services and our strategic nature of our security are those portfolios are growing well. Our overall cloud portfolio grew by 17% quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. So I think we're making progress in the area that we want to make progress in, but again, the portfolio rationalization is also creating a drag here. And as we continue down that path, we will lose some revenue in those less-profitable platforms that we really want to discontinue investing in, but it's for the betterment of us and betterment of our customers to move them to a more highly innovative platform. And then the last thing, of course, is the development and launch that we did last June of our VDMS platform, and we will be launching our next phase of that come this June, and we expect to see some growth revenue acceleration from that platform as we go here. So there's a number of things that John is implementing that I think will contribute. As I said in my script here, the -- contribute of the future growth of the overall Wireline, revenue top line and margin growth.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And Fran, if I could follow up one more thing, what pushed Verizon Wireless over the edge to put the Spectrum up for sale? Can you just address a little bit of the background to yesterday's announcement?","Francis J. Shammo","Yes, so thanks for that question and I think this is an example where people write articles where they don't have facts. So let's talk about the facts. So number one, I think Verizon Wireless has shown over time that they are very, very good stewards of Spectrum and efficient Spectrum. And we are responsible and efficient owners of the Spectrum. And as a company policy, we will not hoard the Spectrum. Now when we bought this back in 2008, obviously, we did not have the foresight to know that we would have an opportunity to acquire AWS Spectrum from the cable company. And if you look at our Spectrum holdings, we purchased the 700 megahertz, which is an extremely efficient and this is where we built our LTE platform on. And then we had the AWS spectrum in the East, which was very efficient from an overbuild perspective on capacity of our LTE platform. And now with the deal that we have with SpectrumCo, we believe that is the most efficient for us to utilize and build out our LTE platform. So hence, the lower 700 megahertz A and B does not fit as nicely into our Spectrum holdings as it may for others. But we think it's the prudent thing to do, to sell these licenses off to the rest of the industry for the benefit of their customers and to enhance their ability to build out 4G LTE. So I think we would say that we're being good stewards. This has nothing to do -- we did not just wake up yesterday and decide we were going to sell Spectrum because we ran into a roadblock at the FCC. That is continuing. We have facts that say the 180-day clock is going and that we are still very confident that we will get approval for the AWS acquisition from SpectrumCo. But just the 2 other points I want to make here is, number one, this is contingent on us getting the a getting the AWS Spectrum approved because, obviously, we would need this spectrum if that's not approved and again, we think it's the right thing for the FCC and maybe a standard for them to use in the future of how Spectrum should be allocated out and sold and efficient ownership and protocols. The other thing is I think there were some articles written that this is going to be a fire sale. This is nothing near a fire sale. We bought this Spectrum back in 2008. We've had carrying costs, and we will be prudent to our shareholders to make sure we get the return our investments. We know what the value of this Spectrum is in the free market, and obviously, we're going to an auction to allow many different parties to participate through a third-party auctioneer. And look, if we don't get the price that we think is a fair price, then we won't go through with the sale, and that's at our discretion. So I think there's some important facts and I'll stop there.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just maybe a couple of follow-ups. Just first, Fran, on the AWS Spectrum approvals, is there a level of divestitures that the FCC could come up with that will be a deal breaker from your perspective or is just getting kind of any magnitude of an AWS deal done sufficient? And then with respect to the Wireless margin, you're targeting $2 billion of cost cuts, I guess, for the year. If you could kind of share with us where we wound up after the end of first quarter on that? And then the last one, if I could, is just, could you kind of give us an update on what, if any, results have you been able to generate from your partnership with the cable companies on the selling of a joint product that have been material to the business?","Francis J. Shammo","So first on the AWS approval, I think that we're exactly where we expected to be. The conversations are going exactly the way we thought. I'm not going to speculate on caps or what we would do, what we wouldn't do and I think what I'll say is, look, we're exactly where we thought we would be and I think we'll close this transaction by mid-summer. On the $2 billion Wireless cost cutting ideas, I think we've shown that we are very good executioners on the cost-cutting routines of $3 billion in the last 2 years. The $2 billion is a combination of a variety of things. You saw the announcement of some call center rationalization. Obviously, part of this $2 billion is to work on the reduction of our subsidies, and you saw -- you're already seeing some of these plans go into action with our upgrade feesand some other things. So there's a wide wrath of cost-cutting initiatives that Dan, me and his team are executing on. And right now coming out of the first quarter, we're actually right on track where we expected to be. And then lastly, on the cable companies, obviously, we're still in a trial mode. We're working out the kinks. We launched a couple markets here with Comcast up in Seattle and Portland. We just launched a couple of new markets with Time Warner cable. So I think it's too early to talk about this one. The agreements are still in front of the DOJ and the FCC and we continue to cooperate with them. And we'll wait till the transaction closes and get up full to speed and then we'll talk about that.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Fran, 2 questions, if you don't mind. On the enterprise business, on the core business, could you just give us maybe a little color around -- it sounds like you're seeing volumes are fine and you haven't really seen a pickup in competition. But obviously, these peripheral legacy products are in decline. I just want to make sure that's kind of what you're saying. And maybe, did you see any seasonality in core enterprise that you see maybe lower sales in December and that's kind of picked up. I know you kind of talked about Europe a little bit, but maybe just here in the U.S.? And then I just have a CapEx follow-up.","Francis J. Shammo","As far as enterprise goes, look, I think the enterprise business is in our Strategic Services area. It's steady as she goes. We're growing that portfolio. And look, any time ago through a massive restructure like John has implemented at VES with going into more of a vertical-type segment, you're going to have a little disruption within your frontline sales force and I think we saw that. But that was like a 60- to 90-day interruption and I think we're getting back on pace and we expect enterprise to start to get back on their feet here going into the second quarter and through the year. And as far as the core side goes, the core is just steady as she goes. It's a declining business. People are moving away from the legacy voice and long distance and moving more into the IP technology. And this is where we have several of our customer [indiscernible] still on the legacy core platforms that we need to move off of so that we can stop investing in those platforms and get them to something that is more innovative and more efficient for them as a company as well. And I don't think they're surprised with the conversations that we're having. So I think as we go here, this will be a steady course. And as we said before, our goal is to be a gross national product-type growth here, GDP plus type organization. So I think that's we're striving for and that's what's John is striving for as well.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So just on enterprises, sounds like you're really trying to accelerate the conversion over. How much longer do you think that would take?","Francis J. Shammo","Well, I think this is going to be some of these legacy-type platforms. This could be a 2-year transition.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then CapEx, is flattish a good number for the full year versus last year? I know even with a decline it was a percentage of revenue at a fairly healthy pace given what we're seeing in Wireless.","Francis J. Shammo","Yes, I've said that the guidance would be -- we wouldn't give specific guidance but flat is a good guidance.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike McCormack of Nomura Securities.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Fran, could you just make a comment on the ARPU side? Obviously, pretty strong performance on the wireless ARPU. But it looked like voice, the headwind on voice sort of became less of a headwind this quarter. Pretty good improvement on the rate of decline. Is what you're seeing there, whether it's people just not pricing that down anymore or what behaviors the consumers are showing you? And then just a couple on the housecleaning side, on Wireless D&A, looks like it was down sequentially. I was just wondering if there was a change in assumption there? And then on the Wireline margin commentary, the better year-over-year I'm assuming that's on a reported basis.","Francis J. Shammo","Yes, so Mike, just a couple of things here on the voice and text messaging. Our messaging revenue actually grew 4% again year-over-year. So we're not seeing what others in the international market have seen. And again, it all comes down to the way you package the bundle and we still have a majority of our customers taking a bundled package of voice and text along with their data plan. So we're starting to see that -- that starting to flatten out perspective. But look, I mean, we keep our eye on this, and with 4G LTE and VoLTE coming at the end of this year into next year, there will be additional opportunities to convert more revenue from our voice products as we launch into more, if you will, IP-type videoconferencing and so forth. As far as Verizon Wireless depreciation and amortization, look, at the beginning of every year, we have a policy that we look at our asset base and reevaluate all of our estimated lives on all of our asset bases. And sometimes make decisions to accelerate and sometimes we make decisions to reevaluate the lives that we have in a certain asset. And we've done that this year as we do every year, and in Verizon Wireless, there was a life extension on our entire EV-DO platform. But this is nothing unusual that we normally don't do. And so that's the answer to that one.","Operator","Your last question will come from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just to come back to the CapEx statement. In order for your CapEx to be flattish over the course of the year, it would seem like the spending would have to pick up a little bit in Wireless. First of all, is that the correct conclusion? And if so, what would be behind that? And then the second question is to clarify a statement you made about margins. Fran, you mentioned sort of getting to the third quarter of last year Wireless EBITDA margin, that was just inside 48%. Is that a point you think you can achieve once again at some quarter during the year or is that actually a full year target for Verizon Wireless?","Francis J. Shammo","I mean, as far as -- these are both guidance-type questions so I'm not going to get into the specifics of them. So look, we said we'll be flat at CapEx and let's leave it at that. I'm not going to get to the individual components or quarter-by-quarter. And then on the Wireless margins, I've said that, look, our goal is to get back to our 3Q margin and we'll strive to get there.","John N.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. To ask a question, press star, one on your touchtone phone. If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing star, Q. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. ","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks Carlos. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the investor relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. ","This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Fran goes through our results, I\u2019d like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported earnings of $1.32 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I\u2019d like to highlight. ","Our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities included a pre-tax $3.2 billion credit which decreased our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment, which was primarily non-cash, was caused by an increase in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality assumption tables, and the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015. We also incurred pre-tax expenses of $613 million primarily related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. On an after-tax basis, these two items amounted to a net $1.6 billion or $0.40 per share.","Additionally, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $254 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis, this gain amounted to $158 million or $0.04 per share. Excluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.89 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.71 a year ago, or a growth of 25.4%. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $3.99 compared with $3.35 in 2014, an increase of 19.1%. On a non-GAAP illustrative basis if we assumed 100% wireless ownership for all of 2014, the adjusted earnings per share growth rate was 16.7% year-over-year.","As a reminder, included in our wire line results are the operations from the three states that we agreed to sell to Frontier, which we expect to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016. We recognized a benefit of $0.13 per share for the full year due to these assets being classified as held for sale. Additionally, the operations of AOL have been included in our consolidated results since third quarter of 2015. Prior period results do not include AOL.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.","Francis Shammo","Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and happy new year.","Entering 2016, we are confident in our three-tier strategy of leading at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, developing new business models through global platforms in video and Internet of Things, and creating certain opportunities and applications and content for incremental monetization. Our execution model enables us to compete effectively in every market condition and build our capabilities for future growth and profitability as an innovator in the digital-first mobile world in 2016 and beyond.","As we reflect back on 2015, we demonstrated a balanced performance in a dynamic competitive environment. We delivered quality growth and strong financial performance in our operating segments while improving our strategic position and returning value to our shareholders. Overall, our full-year adjusted earnings per share grew 19.1% and free cash flow increased to $18.8 billion, excluding tower proceeds, which enabled us to invest and return value to our shareholders.","Fundamental execution on our strategies is the priority within our segments. In wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability with sequential improvements in postpaid growth and net adds, as well as net phone additions. Postpaid net adds totaled 1.5 million for the quarter and 4.5 million for the year, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Net phone additions were 449,000 for the quarter and 1.1 million for the year. Customer retention was also a highlight with postpaid churn of 0.96%, down 18 basis points for the quarter. For the year, churn was also 0.96%, which improved 8 basis points from prior year. Total wireless revenue grew 4.6% for the year and our EBITDA margin expanded.","Our wire line quarterly results were highlighted by Fios revenue and customer growth. Additional enterprise and wholesale revenue slightly improved sequentially while we reduced costs. Overall, our full year wire line segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 30 basis points.","We remain committed to consistently investing in our networks for the future. Our 2015 investments have positioned us for growth and allow us to maintain our network leadership position, as consistently acknowledged by third parties. Wireless densification enables us to add capacity to manage the growing trends of video consumption and the demand required for the Internet of Things, as well as prepositioning us for the future 5G technology. We invested in AWS-3 spectrum during the year, acquiring spectrum covering 480 markets for a total value of $10.4 billion. ","We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. We are committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. During 2015, we announced the divestiture of certain wire line properties to Frontier and intend to use the proceeds to pay down debt. We monetized the majority of our remaining cell towers and we were able to return value to shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase of $5 billion. We have returned more than $13.5 billion to shareholders during the year, including dividends.","As we disclosed in September, our board of directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our board approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows. ","We remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame, so overall, a strong, balanced 2015 which provides operating momentum and lays the foundation for the future.","Now let\u2019s get into fourth quarter and full-year performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5.","Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $34.3 billion, an increase of 3.2% including revenues from AOL. We are pleased with AOL\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter, which does have some seasonality from advertisers. For the full year, we added $4.5 billion to our top line, representing growth of 3.6%. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 0.5% for the fourth quarter. Excluding both AOL and prior period revenues from the public sector business we sold in 2014, the comparable full-year revenue growth rate was 2.6%. This was below our revenue guidance due to lower wireless phone activations, primarily upgrades, and a less than projected take rate on our device installment payment program in the fourth quarter. ","Historically, our consolidated revenues have been primarily driven by growth in both customers and consumption in wireless and Fios. The change in the wireless commercial model from an equipment subsidy model to a device installment payment model increases the revenue sensitivity to wireless equipment volumes. We continued to manage through the transition to the device installment model.","We remain committed to our Verizon Lean Six Sigma processes on improving the customer experience while increasing our overall operating and capital efficiencies. The focus on increasing efficiencies has enabled us to sustain a strong earnings profile as we manage through the revenue transformation in the wireless and wire line segments.","Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $46.6 billion in 2015, an increase of 7.7%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 35.4%, which expanded 130 basis points from 2014. ","Let\u2019s turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. In 2015, cash flows from operations totaled $38.9 billion. This total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to tower monetization transaction, which is non-recurring. Free cash flow for the year excluding the tower proceeds totaled $18.8 billion. ","We have been successful in selling selected device installment receivables in the private securitization market to finance the device payment program and manage working capital. In the fourth quarter, we continued to sell device installment receivables and received about $2.7 billion in cash proceeds. For the full year 2015, we sold a total of $9.4 billion of device installment receivables resulting in total net cash proceeds of $5.9 billion at year-end. We expect to continue to sell these receivables in 2016. Given the success of the device payment program, high credit quality of our customer base and retention history, we are exploring further diversification of funding sources.","Our capital spending was consistent with our guidance of around $17.5 billion to $18 billion for the year. In total, capital expenditures were $5.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.8 billion for the full year, up 3.4% from 2014. Our balance sheet is strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the year with $110.2 billion of gross debt, net debt of $105.7 billion, and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.3 times.","Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments, starting with wireless on Slide 7. In the wireless business, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows are driven by our high quality retail postpaid customer base. Total wireless operating revenues grew 1.2% in the quarter to $23.7 billion. For the full year, operating revenues total $91.7 billion, representing growth of 4.6%. Service revenue of $17.2 billion declined 5.6% for the quarter and declined 3.1% for the full year. Equipment revenue increased to $5.4 billion, up 28% for the fourth quarter, and grew 54.4% for the full year. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing, and that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases. ","The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to 67% in the fourth quarter compared with about 58% in the third quarter and about 25% in the fourth quarter of last year. The fourth quarter take rate accelerated but was below our expectation of 70%, which contributed to equipment revenue growth that was lower than expected. We expect the first quarter take rate for device installment to be above 70%. ","During the quarter, 7.6 million phones were activated on device installment payment plans. We have about 25 million device installment phone connections in total, representing approximately 29% of our postpaid phone base. Overall, more than 40% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing.","In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 18.9%, and approximately $39 billion for the full year, an increase of 10.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 52.9%, up from 42% for the fourth quarter. The more meaningful measurement is EBITDA as a percentage of total wireless revenue, which expanded to 38.4%, up from 32.6% in the prior year. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin increased to 55.3%, up from 48.5%, and our EBITDA margin on total wireless revenue was 42.5%, up from 40.2% in 2014. ","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. We ended the year with 112.1 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.4% to 106.5 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.6 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.6 million for the fourth quarter and to 16.4 million for the full year. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.96% in the quarter compared with 1.14% a year ago, an improvement of 18 basis points. We are very focused on improving the customer experience, starting with the network, simplified pricing, and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service call-in rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction. ","Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.5 million were high quality, with the sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 906,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 713,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 449,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 960,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 157,000. Full-year net adds of 4.5 million included 3.3 million 4G smartphones and 3.5 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones, and non-tablet internet devices.","Let\u2019s now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.4 million in the quarter and 46.6 million for the full year. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the year with 73 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to 84% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 79% of our retail postpaid connections base. Growth in 4G device adoption is driving increased data and video usage. Approximately 90% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network, and overall traffic on LTE has increased by approximately 60% over the prior year. About 8.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, which is up sequentially but down from just under 10% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.3 billion in the quarter and $11.7 billion for the full year, up 11.5% from a year ago.","We continued to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry\u2019s highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum, and further successfully densifying urban markets. National studies recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader, leading in categories of overall performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance. These are the performance metrics that matter to the customer.","Improving the cost structure of our wireless segment is a priority. In the fourth quarter, we restructured our wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. We will continue work on our operating model on an ongoing basis and are confident that we can improve efficiencies, as we have done in the past.","Let\u2019s move next to our wire line segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, Fios remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents 80.4% of consumer revenue. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 2.6% and for the full year grew 3.5%. Mass markets revenue grew 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 2.4% for the full year. Small business, which is included in mass markets, experienced declines of 5.6% in the quarter and 4.6% for the full year. ","The change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory continues as customers right-size their existing bundles and core voice services decline. The demand for Fios broadband only is also increasing, while we are continuing to see a decline in linear video demand. Customers value having a choice in selecting linear video packages. We had another quarter with custom TV representing about one-third of our Fios video sales. ","In the fourth quarter, Fios total revenue grew 6.8% with consumer Fios revenue growing at 6.6%. This growth was driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. The increasing importance of the internet is evident as customers are requesting higher data speeds. At the end of the quarter, more than 70% of our consumer Fios internet customers subscribe to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher, and we have shifted our introductory offers to 50 megabits. We are also seeing an increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds. ","As I highlighted earlier, Fios internet subscriber growth remains strong in the fourth quarter. In broadband, we added 99,000 net Fios customers for the quarter and 418,000 for the year, and now have a total of 7 million Fios internet subscribers representing 41.8% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 5,000 in the quarter.","In linear video, we are seeing slowing of market demand. We added 20,000 net customers in the quarter and 178,000 for the year, and now have a total of 5.8 million Fios video subscribers which represents 35.3% penetration. We are working closely with Frontier on the sale of our wire line properties in Florida, Texas and California and expect to close the transaction at the end of the first quarter of 2016.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale, as well as the wire line segment in total. In the Enterprise space, secular and economic challenges remain but we are seeing stabilization on a constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.3%, and on a constant currency basis was down about 2.1%. For the full year, global enterprise revenue declined 5.2% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3.5%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year. While this quarter improved due to seasonal impacts, we remain cautious on the wholesale business and believe that a 4 to 5% decline is more indicative of the underlying trend for the full year 2016.","Total operating revenues for the entire wire line segment improved to a decline of 0.9% in the quarter and down 1.8% for the full year. The segment EBITDA margin was 24.2% for the quarter and 23.5% for the year, up 30 basis points for the quarter and the year. ","As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on margins and improving the profitability of the wire line segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning and are seeing improvements in productivity. We continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs, with some of the future savings depending on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.","As we close on the Frontier sale, we are confident that we will offset the stranded cost at a consolidated level and will report more details post-transaction. ","Capital spending in wire line was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $5 billion for the year, down 12.2%, which is consistent with our strategy to reduce our capital spending in the wire line segment.","Let\u2019s move next to Slide 12 for an overview of our three-tier strategy. During 2015, we delivered strong results and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in a dynamic competitive environment as we work through the transition of our wireless base from a subsidized equipment model to a device installment payment model, and ramped up new business models to generate incremental revenue growth into the future. Total revenue grew at 2.6% on a comparable basis, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.4% for the year. For 2015, adjusted earnings per share of $3.99 continued to grow at double-digit rates, even if you exclude the depreciation and amortization benefits we realized from the Frontier transaction. Cash flows from operations increased about 19.1% for the year, excluding tower proceeds, and free cash flow totaled $18.8 billion. We delivered more than $13.5 billion of value to our shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase and dividends. ","As I discussed in my opening, entering 2016 we are confident in our three-tier strategy. We are executing and delivering strong results today through our operating model by growing and serving our customers while driving cost and capital efficiencies. We are focused on building on our network strength and laying the foundation for global platforms and applications and content that appeal to all market demographics, especially the millennials. We refreshed our brand image around the Better Matters campaign to increase awareness of our differentiated strategy around the overall customer experience and to appeal to growing markets. ","At the network connectivity layer, we are investing in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry\u2019s highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of its new features. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum and further successfully densifying urban markets. We opportunistically purchased spectrum during the year to enhance our capacity and position us for the future. As we have done throughout our history, we evaluate spectrum opportunities in a disciplined manner, including the upcoming auction, secondary markets, and future spectrum bands that can be made available.","Leadership in 5G technology is another strategy to extend our premier network position. We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development, and appropriate requirements for next generation of this wireless technology. We will begin pilots in several locations throughout the year.","Our networks enable us to grow our business through new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things at the connectivity platform and solution layers. We are targeting the millennial opportunity in wireless video beyond connectivity. The acquisition of AOL and Millennial Media during the year added strong capabilities with global ad tech platforms and content to complement our digital formatting and content distribution assets. AOL is scaling its consumer and advertiser base globally and it is positioned very well to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends in mobile and video as we saw in the fourth quarter. We will look to further enhance our media asset capabilities. AOL\u2019s global capabilities and partnerships are instrumental to our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution and advertising platforms across all screens.","We believe there is a significant opportunity in using the programmatic platform with the data from the wireless customer base to connect consumers and advertisers in a very targeted and scaled way with relevant and engaging ad experiences while protecting individual privacy. The Go90 application that we launched in 2015 is one element of this broader video strategy that will allow us to capture and aggregate audience, deliver mobile-first content, and generate incremental revenue via advertising. As the application, which used our video platform, evolves and gains attention, you can expect new and exciting content, features and functionality like the NBA content we added this past quarter.","We are encouraged by the use of Go90, not only on the Verizon network but off of the Verizon network as well. During 2016, we expect to share more results around both the Go90 application and our video platform. ","Earlier this week, we launched FreeBee Data, a new sponsored data service. With FreeBee data, Verizon wireless subscribers can enjoy content on their mobile devices free of data charges, and it helps businesses drive engagement and revenue by providing a powerful platform for sponsoring mobile content. As we have been discussing over the past two quarters, we are offering custom TV for linear customers to provide more video choice. We will look to continue to refresh our Fios TV offerings to take advantage of this secular trend of video bundles with options and more choices to address the increasing over-the-top video trend. ","We are taking a leadership position in the Internet of Things. With our experience in networks, devices, platforms and applications, we have created an ecosystem that will foster innovation and scale globally above the connectivity layer to enable incremental growth. Our network leadership positions us to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both a ubiquitous mobile experience and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer. ","We are focused on the telematics and transportation vertical and launched our direct-to-consumer product, Hum, in the third quarter. We also announced our Connected City strategy, beginning with Savannah, and introduced a suite of developer tools, ThingSpace, to accelerate innovative applications to come to market. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, the pipeline for mobile Internet of Things capabilities was very prominent. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are growing with revenues of approximately $200 million in the quarter and about $690 million for the full year, a year-over-year increase of 18%.","Let\u2019s move next to Slide 13 for our 2016 priorities. Our strategy and priorities remain consistent for 2016. We will concentrate on growing our quality customer base in both wireless and Fios and build upon customer loyalty by providing the best overall customer experience. We remain focused on network leadership and developing new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things by leveraging our ubiquitous network in the United States and scaling our platforms globally. We are also committed to returning value to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet in addition to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by the 2018-2019 time frame.","As previously stated, Verizon expects full-year 2016 adjusted earnings to plateau at a level comparable to our strong full-year 2015 adjusted earnings due to the device installment payment model transition, completion of the Frontier transaction, and the ramping of new business models in video and Internet of Things. Additionally, we are targeting the following for 2016: a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with our full-year 2015 performance; consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion - this includes capital spending of approximately $150 million for the properties sold to Frontier, and a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million. In terms of income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35 to 36%.","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.","Michael Stefanski","Fran, thank you. We also recognize that there might have been some delay in posting our materials to our website. The issue, I think, is resolved, so we appreciate your patience.","Carlos, if you can open us up now for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from Mr. David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Stefanski","Carlos, if David\u2019s not there, then we can just move on and pick David up next.","Operator","Thank you, one moment, sir. ","David Barden","Can you hear me now?","Michael Stefanski","Yes, go ahead, David.","David Barden","There you go. Thanks for taking the questions. Fran, just as a housekeeping item with respect to the notion of a, quote-unquote, plateau, could you kind of band that for people? Are you trying to put a plus or minus 1 or 2% around the $3.99? Are you trying to say $3.99 or better for 2016, just so the Street can kind of get a sense as to where the real midpoint there is?","Second, obviously we had an extension in bonus tax depreciation last year. It\u2019s been something you\u2019ve been benefiting from. Could you kind of scope the size of the benefit you\u2019re going to get this year? And if I could, just one last one. You\u2019ve talked about how cord shaving has been important for the new customers coming into the Fios space. Could you talk about if at all you\u2019re seeing some kind of transition in the existing base to these skinnier bundles? Thanks.","Francis Shammo","All right, thanks David. So on earnings per share, we started this back, I think midyear in 2015 when Lowell and I started to talk about the plateau and the level comparable to 2015 adjusted earnings. The way to think about this is we ended 2015 at $3.99. There is $0.13 of depreciation benefit because of the Frontier assets being held for sale, so that really is a level set of $3.86. When we talk about plateauing, we\u2019re referring to the $3.99, so when you think about this, you\u2019re going from $3.86 from a jump-off point to $3.99, so the way I think about it is we\u2019re actually growing earnings in low single digits from 2015 to 2016 when you make that one-time adjustment, so we will grow through the benefit of the deprecation this year.","Some of the reasons for that, as I said on the last quarterly call, some of this is just math - moving the wireless transformation from the subsidy model to the device payment model, and of course the ramping of our new businesses which I\u2019ve been very clear in the beginning. These are like start-up businesses, and as with most start-up businesses, you have very large losses in the beginning until you can grow the customer bases and start to generate the profitability.","Moving into the bonus depreciation, yes, we will get a substantial benefit next year, but I want to be clear that you should not anticipate that our cash tax payments will decrease in \u201916. They will actually increase, even with this benefit, and a piece of that is because the profitability from a pre-tax income perspective will continue to increase. We\u2019re also still eating through the reversal of prior year bonus depreciations, so from a cash tax perspective you should expect our cash tax percentage to continue to increase closer to our effective tax rate. Now, not to the extent of the 35 to 36 guidance that I gave you, but it certainly will move from the low 20% we realized in \u201915 to the upper 20% in \u201916.","On the cord shaving piece, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are starting to see more and more customers coming into Fios on a broadband-only basis, so just a single play strictly with broadband. As far as our current base goes, we see a little bit of trending but not much. Most customers are depleting the voice side of the product and keeping the broadband and video side of the product at this point.","David, hopefully that answers your question. Let\u2019s move to the next one.","David Barden","Thanks.","Michael Stefanski","Carlos, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Simon Flannery","Thanks very much. Good morning, Fran. You touched briefly on the auction in your commentary. I know in the past, you\u2019ve made some of your interest contingent on some of the rules, which we have now. Maybe you could just think about how we should be thinking about sizing your potential participation, what you need here. There\u2019s been a lot of stories about potential asset sales over the months, most recently about data centers. Perhaps you could just talk about your philosophy now that you\u2019ve done the towers, you\u2019re doing the Frontier assets. Should we expect, or are you considering doing other significant asset sales over the coming year or two? Thanks.","Francis Shammo","Okay, thanks Simon. So on the auction, let\u2019s just--I\u2019ll keep this one short on the incentive auction because of a lot of rules around what I can and can\u2019t say at this point. We will participate in the auction, and I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Thinking about spectrum overall, I think we have to think about the 600 megahertz, which I\u2019ve talked about previously and how that fits to our portfolio. We think ahead to 5G - as we said, we\u2019ll be at the forefront and we are currently at the forefront globally talking about standards. We will be the first company to roll 5G out in the United States, and we\u2019re currently preparing for those field trials. ","The other thing I would say about 5G is we would hope that the FCC moves quickly to adopt the rules to facilitate 5G deployment. Think about 5G - it may not just be about mobility. It may be about other use cases, not just about mobility. ","Then when we think about the unlicensed opportunity, if you studied the Consumer Electronics Show this past two weeks, there were multiple manufacturers who were running side-by-side comparisons of unlicensed, if you will, LTE or unlicensed spectrum utilized by an LTE carrier right next to WiFi, and it absolutely showed no interference, which is some of the rhetoric out there. It actually showed that the comparability is it improves the WiFi performance by having a managed unlicensed within the LTE carrier. So again, this just goes to continuing to work with the FCC and having them see through the release and usage of unlicensed for the LTE carriers.","Then of course, we will continue to utilize the secondary market, as we do quarter in and quarter out, utilizing swaps which we just completed this past quarter. We\u2019re working on another swap that we\u2019ll complete in the first quarter, and also minimal buys in the marketplace with smaller holders. So that\u2019s how we think about the whole spectrum asset perspective.","On the sale of assets, as Lowell and I have continually stated, we will always look for opportunities. The data centers is an exploratory exercise to see if the asset is more valuable inside or outside the portfolio. I view that asset similar to the way we view towers - is there a way to monetize this asset that contributes value to our shareholders and gives us the capability to move that capital into higher returning assets for Verizon. There is no decision that has been made. This is an exploratory, and as we explore, if the numbers come out like it did on towers, then we\u2019ll execute on a transaction. If it doesn\u2019t, then we won\u2019t. So at this point, again, we will always look at opportunities to monetize the portfolio to the benefit of our shareholders.","Thank you, Simon.","Simon Flannery","Thank you.","Michael Stefanski","Carlos, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now open, sir.","John Hodulik","Thanks. Fran, I think the churn below 1% was obviously a bright spot for the quarter. Is that a level that you think you can maintain as you look out into 2016, given the competitive environment? Then you mentioned some continued pressure on the service revenues looking out. Can you talk a little bit about the components driving that and when you expect to see an inflection in that metric? Thanks.","Francis Shammo","Sure, thanks John. So one the churn rate, if you recall when we sat here a year ago and we entered 2015, we said a concentration of \u201915 will be to protect our customer base. That\u2019s exactly what we executed on throughout 2015, and the execution of that will continue in 2016. The focus will be customer satisfaction and satisfying our customer base so they stay with us, and I think that\u2019s proven through our very low churn rate this fourth quarter, even with the rhetoric from some outsiders about how they\u2019re stealing customers. The churn rate does not reflect that, and port outs are down year-over-year. So we are doing what we said we would do around the loyalty. Customer satisfaction comes in here around our simplicity and being simple with customers so they understand what they\u2019re getting, and this goes to our loyalty base.","On the service revenue side, I guess the thing I would say on this is, again, this is really to math - math of shifting from the subsidy model with higher service revenue to a device payment model, where you get a break in service revenue but you pay full price for the handset model. As we said, we are through 40% of our customers. We\u2019re slightly higher than 40% who are now on that new pricing, so you\u2019ve already seen the impact of that. As I said last call, we believe the inflection point will happen at 50%, which we believe we will attain midyear. Coming out of the fourth quarter, though, we did see a slowdown in the take rate of installment sale, but we do believe that that take rate will accelerate back up above 70% for the fourth quarter, and we\u2019re going to announce some differences here, a shortcoming that will drive some of that behavior towards that.","As you know, we continue to allow our current base customers who upgrade to select whether they take device payment or subsidy, and what we saw in the fourth quarter was we had a higher percentage of our base stay on the subsidy model, which caused pressure on the P&L of wireless because of the subsidy take. ","So having said that, John, I think as we go through the year, we\u2019ll be able to give you more clarity here. The other thing I would ask you to take a look at is the [IARPA] metric, which if you look at third quarter, it went up by 0.2% and then the fourth quarter went up 0.9%, so you\u2019re already starting to see some of the underlying metrics starting to absorb some of the repricing. So I\u2019ll leave it at that for \u201916, but I\u2019ll come back to you as we break through the 50%.","John Hodulik","Great, thanks Fran.","Michael Stefanski","Next question, Carlos.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Phil Cusick from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Phil Cusick","Hey guys, thanks. So Fran, first just following up on John\u2019s question, with the current asset mix, and not just in \u201916 but beyond, is this still a business that can grow well above GDP, and how far do you think above? Second on custom TV, you\u2019ve said in the past that you\u2019re sort of pushing toward your minimums on some of your contracts. How should we think about that potentially impacting custom TV, or do you think you could reopen some of those contracts to let that percent go higher? Thanks.","Francis Shammo","Okay, thanks Phil. So the answer to the question is yes, absolutely, and I think we have to go back and start at the beginning on the whole top line growth story. So first and foremost, I think the foundation is our network, our strategy in densification, the use of fiber. Fiber is going to be critical with the densification, dark fiber. Ninety-two percent of our cell sites are already fiber-enabled, the other 8% are microwave, which probably won\u2019t get fiber. So when you look at it, almost 100% of our cell sites are fiber enabled and every small cell, 100% of every small cell we deployed is fiber backed. So this is in preparation of some of the future products and services that we are looking at in conjunction with both what Marnie has under IOT, Go90, but also for 5G.","If you look at customer satisfaction, this goes to a big component of the low churn and how we start to increase the value to the customer so that they are willing to pay us more for increased value. The quality base also goes to this.","So when you look at wireless, they grew 1.2% here in the fourth quarter. If you look at volume overall year-over-year, gross adds and upgrades were down 1.9 million, so if you just do the backwards math on that, that\u2019s in excess of a billion dollars of revenue that wasn\u2019t there this year, that was there last year. So when you look at it, the foundation of Verizon wireless is still very strong, and we believe that we can continue to grow the Verizon wireless revenue streams.","On wire line, Fios is still the foundation. It\u2019s now 80% of the overall wire line revenue. When you look at what we\u2019re doing, broadband, the pervasiveness of broadband, no one can match our symmetry on the up and downloads, so that\u2019s something that we have against our competition. We are preparing for the over-the-top model. Custom TV is one of those things that I\u2019ve said yes, it has a limited life, but you\u2019re going to see us refresh custom TV and continue to what consumers want, which is they want choice. They don\u2019t want to have to pay for bundles that they never use. Then of course, stability of the enterprise business also adds to this. ","Then you jump into our growth engines. If you look at AOL, AOL this quarter increased $300 million in revenue sequentially from the third quarter. It goes to the strength of the advertising model under AOL, which is why we bought them. Now, some of that is seasonal, but we believe that they will continue to have strong growth into 2016. ","Go90, which is still in its beginning stages, and I know we\u2019ve seen some external reports on the number of downloads in excess of 2 million, but the key to us is not the downloads. The key is viewership and it\u2019s around content, and we will continue to add content that\u2019s favorable to all generations of population. Obviously we have a lot of content there for millennials, but sports and music attain to a lot more than just millennials, so we\u2019re attacking all viewership with this product and we\u2019ll have more to say about that probably midyear.","Internet of Things, if you walked around CES, it\u2019s all about the digital mobile world, and we are in best position to capitalize on that with our Smart Cities, telematics, with the launch of Hum - we started that in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ve already seen that there are certain stores in the United States that can\u2019t keep the product within Verizon wireless. They\u2019re continually selling out of the product, and this is a recurring revenue stream. If you think about ThingSpace, this is really the adjunct to the Consumer Electronics Show where we\u2019ve opened up our platform. We now have over 4,200 developers working on that platform, and that\u2019s just since October 29 of this year. ","So yes, it was a transition year in \u201915. It will be a transition year in \u201916, but I am confident that with the strategies that we are taking, that we will absolutely be a GDP growth company post-2016.","Custom TV, we talked about that. We will refresh that here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements that we need to be in compliance with. Thanks Phil.","Phil Cusick","Is there a hearing that needs to happen at some point this year, or a trial?","Francis Shammo","Relating to ESPN?","Phil Cusick","Yes.","Francis Shammo","Look - this will go its course. They're a great partner of ours. We\u2019ll continue to work with them, and I\u2019m not going to speak to the actual lawsuit.","Phil Cusick","Thanks.","Michael Stefanski","Next question Carlos, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike McCormack","Hey guys, thanks. Fran, maybe just a quick follow-up on the [IARPA] question. How fast do you think equivalent revenue starts to ramp up here? I guess just thinking about the percentage of those customers making payments versus those that are on non-subsidized plans, is that gap--and there\u2019s probably some retention built into that, but I assume that gap can close over time? Just your thoughts around that, and then just a quick other question regarding towers. We\u2019ve heard a couple of your competitors sort of downplaying future tower needs and trying to bypass some of that cost. Just trying to get a sense for what you think as far as your needs for towers goes.","Francis Shammo","Okay, thanks. So in the [IARPA], keep in mind only 29% of our customers currently today are on a device payment plan, so they\u2019re actually taking the installment plan and paying us full price for the equipment, but 40% of our customers who fulfilled their subsidy contract have moved over to that pricing, so they are getting the discount, so we\u2019re absorbing that. As I\u2019ve said, once you get to that 50%, you should see that inflection point start to occur, and you\u2019re already starting to see some of that in the [IARPA] type metric.","So it\u2019s hard for me to forecast exactly what will happen here, but the forecast that I have is at 50%, you start to see an inflection point, and we\u2019ll talk more about that as we go through the quarters. ","As far as towers go, look - I mean, we continue to build macro towers but at a much slower rate than historically. Our focus is really around small cells, densified antenna systems in-building, but keep in mind that each of those small cells in-building and antenna systems all give fiber back to a main macro cell, so the macro cells still have an important role in how you deliver traffic into those small cells. So as far as building and creating new towers, that\u2019s at a much slower rate but the importance of the tower is still there.","Mike McCormack","Great, thanks Fran.","Francis Shammo","Sure.","Michael Stefanski","Carlos, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. Fran, you had noted had churn in upgrades, they were all lower year-on-year. It seems that across the sector, activity levels have been lighter than we might have thought, whether it\u2019s churn or gross adds or upgrades. Why do you think that is? Do you think that this is a temporary factor or do you think it\u2019s the new normal? Really, I guess the question is what do you think is going to happen in 2016?","Francis Shammo","Okay, thanks Brett. So look - 2014 was a unique year. You have a very different form factor come out from Apple, which drove a lot of traffic to that iconic device. You continue to have innovation from Samsung and LG, but we didn\u2019t have that huge change in the handset this year that we saw a year ago, so that, I think, affected some of the upgrade model. But you know, when you look at it, we still did about 1.5 million more upgrades in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter, so the volume of upgrades still increased, it just wasn\u2019t what it was a year ago. If you remember, I said coming into this way back in the second quarter, I said I did not anticipate that the fourth quarter this year would be in similar volume to the fourth quarter of last year, but if you go back to the previous years, I think you\u2019ll see similar lower volume years and then you\u2019ll have iconic devices come out, and it stimulates some usage case there.","So for \u201916, it\u2019s too early to tell yet, but I would think that we\u2019ll see similar trends that we did in \u201915.","Brett Feldman","Are you seeing any evidence that as customers move to installment plans, they actually keep their devices longer?","Francis Shammo","Well, for our base it\u2019s too early to tell because the first generation of them are just starting to mature. Until I get some real factual data on that, it\u2019s hard for me to answer. My own personal opinion here is that if you look at history, a third of your customer base upgrades every year. I don\u2019t see that changing, regardless of what plan the customer is on.","Brett Feldman","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Michael Stefanski","Carlos, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Mike Rollins from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Rollins","Hi, thanks for the opportunity. Just two questions, if I could. First Fran, if you could just talk about what Verizon was able to accomplish on cost-cutting in 2015, and how investors should think about that relative size in 2016. Second, as you look across your different business segments, are you seeing any changes in the macroeconomic backdrop or a risk of a recession? Thanks.","Francis Shammo","Okay, thanks Mike. So on the cost cutting, look - I think the last three to four years, we\u2019ve talked about this and we\u2019re an extremely disciplined corporation as far as costs go. With the launch of our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program three years ago, that continues to maintain momentum. We took out almost 30 million calls down from a year ago, so there\u2019s a lot of progress being made on self-serve. There\u2019s a lot of progress being made within our logistics system - I mean, this year alone we generated working capital benefits from how we handle our phone inventory. So you saw the wireless restructure this year, was the first restructure we had really since the inception of Verizon wireless. ","So as we go into \u201916, you saw us take that severance charge, and I would tell you most of that severance charge was related to headcount that is already completed in the fourth quarter, so entering into 2016 we continue on the path that we were on. We will continue to look at customer satisfaction, more self-serve options that reduce the amount of calls that we have to take from customers. So there is still a lot of work to be done around our cost structure, and if you look at wire line, as we came into this year, Lowell and I said we would improve the profitability of wire line. That came from all the cost reductions that John and his team achieved. So we will continue on that path, and I feel good about that.","As far as overall economics, I\u2019m not really seeing much of anything in the consumer spaces that we drive. I look at what everybody else looks at, and we\u2019ll have to wait to see what 2016 comes out, but I\u2019m certainly not going to predict any negativism there.","Mike Rollins","Thank you.","Michael Stefanski","Carlos, next question. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Moffett","Hi, good morning guys. Two questions, if I might. First, on Go90, can you update us a little bit on what the early results are and what learnings you\u2019ve had from Go90? Just given your comments about the roughly flat year-over-year EPS and the impact that Go90 might have on that, I think a lot of us have concluded that there\u2019s likely to be something significantly bigger coming this year with respect to marketing and content. Can you at least give us a timeline for when we might see those kinds of developments on Go90?","Francis Shammo","Sure, thanks Craig. So when I think about the whole portfolio - Go90, Verizon digital media services and AOL, obviously we just launched all these products, so there\u2019s a start-up. It was the first fourth quarter that we advertised these types of launches. You\u2019re going to see that continue through the four quarters of \u201916, which was not there in \u201915, so there will be pressure from these start-up companies. ","Our learnings on Go90 are very simple - we\u2019re looking at how many times individuals revisit the platform in one day, and we\u2019re starting to see some positives there where people will come in multiple times during the day, and that\u2019s important because that\u2019s what\u2019s viable to the advertising community.","So the whole basis here is we have to ramp viewership. I will tell you, internally we have surpassed what we thought we would have at this point in time. We have set higher targets for \u201916 because we need to build the viewership in a much quicker fashion. I think what you\u2019re seeing here from AOL is a very strong fourth quarter. Now, there is seasonality to that, but as I mentioned, I\u2019m looking for them to grow substantially in 2016. ","So I think when you put this together, I think the top line will start to reflect some of the things that we\u2019re looking for, but it will create bottom line pressure. These will not, especially Go90 will not be profitable product probably within a one to two-year horizon right now. When we launched it, we said two to three, but it\u2019s probably two years before that will become a profit contributor to the enterprise, but it will certainly build on the top line perspective. Right now, we\u2019re focused on viewership, not necessarily the profitability of the product.","So I\u2019ll stop there. As I said, we will come in with much more detail probably midyear and start to give you some viewership into exactly some of the results of Go90 and AOL.","Craig Moffett","And Fran, related to that question, if I could, on AOL, now that you\u2019ve had AOL for a while, there was some talk - and I think you directly spoke to the possibility of a Yahoo! or something like that, are there other assets that now that you\u2019ve had AOL for a while, you think make sense to expand that part of your business with?","Francis Shammo","Well, look - I think we\u2019ve been pretty open since we acquired AOL. We said that we would continue to add to that portfolio. We acquired Millennial, which we talked about. So yes, there are things that we continue to look at for fill-ins, if you will. The other one that you brought up, it\u2019s intriguing but there\u2019s really nothing to respond to at this point on that. So, look - we will continue to look at all of our options, as Lowell and I said. We will continue to look at opportunities externally and look at opportunities internally, and if they make sense for the shareholder, then we\u2019ll execute on those opportunities.","Craig Moffett","Okay, thanks Fran.","Michael Stefanski","Okay Carlos, time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question will be coming from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much. Fran, you had mentioned that you continue to look to monetize your handset receivables. I think in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned that you were looking at other alternatives. Perhaps you might be able to elaborate. We\u2019ve obviously seen your competitors look to other means and funding strategies to support their businesses, so any thoughts on the potential options you are considering would be most appreciated.","Francis Shammo","Sure, thank you, Amir. So just to refresh, we monetized or securitized $9.4 billion of receivables. We received gross cash of $7.2 billion. We obviously paid off some of those securitizations, so about a $5.9 billion net cash. So when you think about that, we absorbed about $3.5 billion within our working capital this year from the switch to the device payment model.","I will tell you that we have been talking to the rating agencies about different types of financing, and I will probably leave it at that at this point. But we will be looking at potential public markets as well as private markets, but we will stay with the securitization model as well. So we\u2019re just looking at very different alternatives to support the program going forward, because we do believe it will continue to grow in 2016. More to say on that when we come to a conclusion on that one, Amir.","Amir Rozwadowski","And then if I may, just one follow-up. You folks seem to be taking the lead with discussing a number of new bandwidth enhancing technologies, and you had alluded to this sort of on your prepared remarks around 5G developments and unlicensed spectrum. How should we think about your ability to bolster the carrier\u2019s capacity moving forward utilizing these types of developments, and ultimately do you believe there is a path to improving your capacity without actually having to broadly expand your spectrum portfolio at this point?","Francis Shammo","The answer to the question is yes. If you look at some of the small cell technology and also some of the technology that can be utilized at the cell site, I know there\u2019s a fancy name for it but I\u2019m not the engineer here, but it gives you the capability to be able to tilt antennas and turn antennas to where the capacity is. So if you think about football game Sundays and college games, we have the capability to utilize our current resources to increase capacity without any spectrum capacity. So there is a number of technologies that are coming. Obviously when we launched 4G, we said it would be five times more efficient than 3G. 5G is too early, but my suspicion is that we\u2019re going to see some similar benefits there from a capacity standpoint, which is one of the benefits of 5G. ","So yes, I think that if you look at spectrum, we are in a very, very good spectrum holding, as we said, with all my other comments around spectrum and how we utilize unlicensed along with what we bought in AWS and the repositioning of what we currently have on 3G over to 4G. So utilizing all of these items, we feel that we are in very, very good shape from a capacity standpoint.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Michael Stefanski","Okay, thank you for your questions. Before we end the call, I\u2019ll just turn it back to Fran for a few remarks.","Francis Shammo","Okay, thanks Mike. So look - 2015 was a year of significant change at Verizon, and even with all that change, we delivered a strong financial year, continued to invest in growing our customer base, invested in our networks, developed and expanded new businesses, and returned value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. 2016 will continue what we started in 2015. We will focus on execution and growth with our three-tier strategy and heritage. We will continue to build on a strong network and customer foundation. With our foundation, we will compete effectively in this dynamic marketplace. We will bring new products and services to market and continue to be the leader in the digital first mobile world.","We look forward to maintaining our positive momentum to create value for our customers and our shareholders, and I\u2019d like to thank you for joining Verizon today. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael Stefanski","","Thanks David. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I am here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.","Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be made available on our website.","I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.","The quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Fran takes you through the details of our quarterly performance, I would like to cover a few details about our reported results. For this discussion, let\u2019s turn to Slide 3. For the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.15 per share on a GAAP basis. Our reported results reflect a partial quarter with 55% ownership of Verizon Wireless in just over five weeks to full ownership. Since this transaction to acquire Vodafone\u2019s stake closed on February 21.","The weighted average common shares outstanding for the first quarter were 3,430 million. Given the issuance of 1,275 million new shares of Verizon as part of the deal consideration. The timing of the closing had no effect on our consolidated income statement for Wireless segment above the operating income line since we\u2019ve always had operating control of Verizon Wireless.","All of the post-closing effects of full ownership are below the operating income line. Our reported first quarter EPS of $1.15 includes several non-operational items that I would like to review. The first item is a gain on the sale of our minority interest in Vodafone Omnitel.","This resulted in a one-time after-tax gain of approximately $1.9 billion or $0.55 per share. This is a non-cash item as it was part of the transaction consideration. The next item is a non-operational charge related to debt redemption. During the first quarter, we announced a partial make whole redemption and a cash tender offer for various notes with maturities over the next five years and coupons of 5.5% entire. We regained $5.4 billion of notes through the make whole redemption and tender offer.","The associated net pretax costs were $923 million. After tax this resulted in a charge of $575 million or $0.17 per share. We also incurred interest in financing costs related to the wireless transaction. As we did in the third and fourth quarters, we are excluding these charges from adjusted results for the period January 1 through the February 21 closing.","These transaction costs total $411 million on a pretax basis resulting in an after tax charge of $260 million or $0.08 per share. Excluding the effect of these three non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.84 for the first quarter compared with $0.68 a year ago or growth of 2013.5%.","Adjusted EPS of $0.84 reflects 55% ownership of Verizon Wireless for the period January 1 through February 21 and full ownership for the remainder of the quarter. Of course, future quarters will include a 100% of the Wireless net income and access to all the Wireless cash flows.","For an illustrated non-GAAP view of adjusted earnings, assuming full ownership of Verizon Wireless for the entire first quarter, let\u2019s take a look at Slide 4. The elements for this illustrated view are based on the adjustments in the pro forma financial statements filed with the SEC for the periods ending September 30 and December 31 2013. We also review these transaction effects on February 24 call when we provided some guidance for items below operating income.","Adjusted EPS of $0.84 would have been $0.91 per share assuming 100% ownership of Wireless for the full quarter. Again, on a non-GAAP illustrated basis. The adjustments required to demonstrate this are relatively straightforward.","The 45% of Wireless net income attributable to Vodafone for the period January 1 to February 21 totaled $1.2 billion and would be added to adjusted earnings.","The transaction related cost for the same time period would be subtracted. Accounting for these effects, adjusted earnings would be $3.8 billion with an effective tax rate of about 35%.","The diluted shares outstanding that we use for this illustrated EPS calculation were 4,149 million shares, which assumes the newly issued shares were outstanding for the entire quarter.","In summary, the impact of having a 100% ownership of Wireless for only part of the first quarter was worth $0.07 of earnings per share.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.","Fran Shammo","","Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone. As I stated on our last few conference calls, we have great confidence in our ability to generate strong financial performance in 2014.","Over the years, our steady and consistent investments in networks and platforms have supported innovative products and services and fueled our growth. Our wireless and wireline networks will continue to be the hallmark of our brands and provide the fundamental strength upon which we build our competitive advantage.","Now that the Wireless transaction is behind us, we have the immediate financial benefit of earnings accretion from the deal and full access to the very significant cash flows of Verizon Wireless. As we have previously stated, we are targeting 4% consolidated top-line growth in 2014 with an expansion of our consolidated EBITDA margin.","The ingredients for success are unchanged, solid operational execution and a disciplined focus on meeting our financial objectives and creating value for our shareholders. With an eventful first quarter behind us, I\u2019d say we are off to a strong start.","We maintained our growth momentum and delivered excellent top-line and bottom-line results. While the timing of the Wireless transaction closing caused some reporting complexity, our $0.84 adjusted earnings per share represent a growth of 23.5% and would be even greater if we assume full ownership of Wireless for the entire quarter.","We have consistently delivered high quality earnings growth with double-digit increases in reported and adjusted earnings per share in eight of the last nine quarters. Our cash flow generation in the quarter was also impressive and we continue to invest in our networks and platforms.","Our Wireless results were very good with service revenue growth of 7.5% and a service EBITDA margin of 52.1%, an expansion of a 170 basis points. In FiOS, our positive revenue growth trends and scale drove a 6.2% increase in consumer revenue. Total wireline operating revenues declined 0.4% in the quarter which is our best result in nearly three years.","In terms of profitability, our EBITDA margin was 22.3%, up 90 basis points. Now, let\u2019s get into our first quarter performance in more detail starting with consolidated results on Slide 6.","Total operating revenues grew 4.8% in the first quarter continuing our consistent top-line growth trend and was our highest growth rate in the past five quarters. Top-line growth was once again driven by Wireless and FiOS. In terms of new revenue streams, machine-to-machine and telematics were still relatively small are beginning to emerge and make positive contributions with revenue growth in excess of 40%.","Our focus on operating efficiency and cost controls is enabling our ability to compete effectively and drive consistent profitable growth. In the first quarter, consolidated operating expenses grew 2%. Operating income growth was 15.1%. We have posted double-digit growth in operating income in eight of the last nine quarters.","Consolidated EBITDA grew 9.3% while our EBITDA margin expanded by 160 basis points to 36.7%. Let\u2019s take a look at cash flow results next on Slide 7. When looking at our cash flows, it is important to keep in mind that post transaction, we have immediate access to the full Verizon Wireless cash flows.","And apart from a contractual tax distribution in the second quarter for the stub period, we will no longer be making any cash distributions to Vodafone. As a result, the amount of cash available to us will be significantly greater this year. This is true for the simple reason that under the partnership structure, 45% of excess cash at Wireless would at some point be distributed to Vodafone.","As we discussed on our February 24 call, there will be some lack of comparability between current and prior periods in the statement of cash flows. In 2014, the cash flows from operations line will include higher cash payments for interest and taxes. The cash flows from financing section will have lower cash distributions to Vodafone and higher overall dividend payments to our shareholders due to the increase in shares outstanding.","In the first quarter, cash flows from operations were $7.1 billion, which included an incremental $1.3 billion of cash interest payments and $200 million of pension funding that we did not had in the first quarter of 2013. In spite of these additional uses of cash and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $3 billion in the quarter.","For illustrative purposes, free cash flow available to Verizon in the first quarter was more than $1 billion higher than a year ago assuming that 45% of the free cash flow at Wireless would have been distributed to Vodafone. Again, the point here is more free cash flow available at the corporate level than prior to the transaction even after higher interest payments and cash taxes.","Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $4.2 billion, up $548 million with all the increase in Wireless. With our 4G LTE coverage build complete, Wireless spending is now focused on adding capacity intensity to our existing coverage and utilizing our AWS spectrum to further optimize the network.","As we have previously stated, our estimate for total capital spending in 2014 will be in the range of $65 billion to $70 billion. In addition to the transaction closing, we had a large amount of financing activities in the quarter.","At closing, our gross debt was approximately $114 billion. Since then, we announced the make whole redemption and a tender offer did some debt restructuring and had $2.5 billion of notes mature. We ended the quarter with gross debt of just under $110 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times.","Our balance sheet remains strong and we have the financial flexibility needed to grow the business. Our priorities for cash utilization are unchanged. We will continue to invest in our networks, acquire Spectrum and return to our pre-transaction credit ratings profile within four to five years.","We do not need to execute any major acquisitions to drive our business model. We understand the importance of our dividends and our board of directors has shown its support by approving dividend increases in each of the last seven years. In terms of acquiring new spectrum, we will continue to be opportunistic.","Earlier this month, we signed agreements to acquire the wireless licenses of Cincinnati Bell along with some power lease. We will continue to look at the secondary markets and we will consider the opportunities in the upcoming FCC auctions.","Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 8. Our consistent investment in Wireless is the foundation of our success and drives our leadership in network quality, reliability and the overall customer experience. We will continue to build and expand our network advantage in 4G LTE.","Our focus is on deploying capital to add density to our network and deliver new services such as VoLTE and multicasting to enrich our customers\u2019 wireless experience. Regardless of what others claim, recent national surveys from widely recognized third-party organizations confirm our leadership.","Our own dry testing which we have been doing for years shows that we consistently deliver the best customer experience market-by-market and day-by-day across the United States.","Total Wireless revenues grew to $20.9 billion, up 6.9% driven by strong service revenue growth of 7.5%. We generated $9.4 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 11.3%. Our Service EBITDA margin in the quarter was 52.1%. There has certainly been a lot of investor attention centered on the effects of equipment monthly payment plan options for customers.","Let me be very clear and provide the financial impacts of our Verizon EDGE plans for the first quarter. As you would expect, the number of customer activations on EDGE increased sequentially and is also running ahead of our expectations. The estimated EBITDA benefit from the accounting treatment under these plans was worth about $165 million, which equates to less than 2% of total EBITDA in the quarter.","The benefit to our service EBITDA margin was approximately 90 basis points. While EDGE had a favorable effect on profitability, our results demonstrate that we delivered EBITDA growth and margin expansion over and above the benefits of equipment monthly payment plans.","Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on Slide 9. Service revenue in the first quarter was driven by 4G smartphone adoption and tablet growth and increasing data usage. In mid of February, we introduced our More Everything plan which provides more value through simplified data allowances and more choice for customers.","In addition, we revised our monthly pricing under Verizon EDGE for customers who buy their devices on installment payments. Last week, we extended this reduced monthly pricing to customers who are currently out of contract. These pricing actions improve the customer value proposition and will help drive further penetration of 4G smartphones and tablets and stimulate usage on our very cost-effective 4G LTE network.","Retail postpaid revenue per account or ARPA grew 6.3% to nearly $160 per month in the first quarter. The lower monthly pricing under the EDGE plans had a minimal impact on ARPA this quarter.","Going forward, continued EDGE adoption will likely have a greater impact on ARPA due to the shift from service to equipment revenue. Our reduced monthly pricing for out of contract customers will also affect the rate of service revenue growth over time. We ended the quarter with 35.1 million postpaid accounts and connections per account grew to 2.77 up 3.7% from a year ago.","More Everything plan adoption continues and we ended the quarter with 50% of postpaid accounts on these shared data plans. The majority of these accounts are in data tiers of 4 gigabytes or higher and usage continues to drive migration to the higher data tier.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 10. In the first quarter, postpaid gross adds totaled 3.6 million, up 4.1%, about 56% of our gross adds were smartphones and 33% were tablets and other internet devices.","Retail postpaid churn was 1.07%, up six basis points year-over-year. On a net basis, we added 549,000 new retail connections in the first quarter. Postpaid net adds were 539,000 and prepaid were 10,000. At the end of March, we had 103.3 million total retail connections.","Our industry-leading postpaid connections base reached 97.3 million and prepaid totaled just over 6 million. The first quarter postpaid add mix included 866,000 4G smartphones and a record 634,000 tablets. We also had 56,000 other connected device adds primarily home phone connects.","These additions were offset by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones resulting in a negative total phone net adds. Our postpaid upgrade rate was 6.5% in the quarter; more than 88% of these upgrades were smartphones.","Consistent with our plan to drive smartphone penetration and 4G adoption, about 1.5 million or 27% of our smartphone upgrades were from basic phones. More than 50% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G which we monetized through higher data usage and lower cost to serve.","Next, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and take a look at device sales and our progress on 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations which include both gross adds and upgrades totaled 9.9 million, an increase of 2%. We have 7.6 million smartphone activations, of which nearly 90% were 4G.","Smartphone penetration increased to 72% of our total phones. We ended the quarter with 61.3 million smartphones and about 64% of those were 4G. So we still have about 22 million 3G smartphones and a little more than 23 million basic phones in our base which provides us with a good opportunity to move customers upgrade 4G smartphones.","We had our best tablet quarter ever, activating 814,000 postpaid tablets, virtually all of which were 4G. This is more than double the amount from the first quarter last year and about 3% more than the fourth quarter.","Our postpaid tablet base now stands at 4.3 million, so again, we have a great opportunity to expand this category and generate growth in 2014 and beyond. Overall, 4G device penetration continues to steadily increase. At the end of the first quarter, 49% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G, up from 28% a year ago.","Data and video usage on our network continues to rise; currently about 73% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. We will continue to focus on expanding our network advantage, investing to add density and to optimize our 4G LTE network ensuring that customers are receiving the quality and consistent reliability they expect from our network.","Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets\u2019 revenue performance on Slide 12. In the Consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS.","For the last seven quarters, Consumer revenues have grown in excess of 4%. In the first quarter, Consumer revenues were up 6.2% mass markets which include small business grew 4.9%.","FiOS now represents about 74% of Consumer revenue and we are sustaining strong double-digit growth. In the first quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 14.6% driven by customer additions, pricing actions and quantum penetration. About 51% of our FiOS internet customers subscribe to Quantum which speeds ranging from 50 megabits to 500 megabits per second.","We continue to focus on adding quality customers and generating profitable growth. Residential broadband and video are very competitive markets and we continue to be disciplined in rational in our approach to customer acquisitions. In Broadband, we added 98,000 new FiOS internet customers in the first quarter and now have 6.2 million subscribers representing just under 40% penetration.","Overall, net broadband subscribers in the quarter were a positive 16,000. In FiOS video, we added 57,000 new subscribers in the quarter. Total FiOS video customers reached 5.3 million representing 35% penetration. We also continue to make steady progress with fiber migration.","During the quarter, we converted about 78,000 customers from copper to superior fiber technology. This network initiative is important as we systematically reduce our dependence on older technologies. We\u2019ve begun to see the benefits from a maintenance perspective in what was one of the worst winters in recent memory in the Northeast.","Aside from maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services which will result in additional recurring revenues.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 13 and review our overall Wireline segment revenue and profitability. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the first quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $164 million or 4.4%. Revenue declines in Legacy Transport Services and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer applications which are smaller in scale.","Strategic Services which include Private IP, Ethernet, Datacenter, Cloud, Security and Managed Services, grew 1.8%. This category includes some revenue from the public sector where we continue to experience revenue pressure.","In general, Enterprise customers continue to be more focused on improving their cost structure rather than investing for growth which creates top-line pressure for us. In our Global Wholesale business, quarterly revenues declined $108 million or 6.4%.","While we had healthy demand in Ethernet services in the quarter, it was not enough to offset the impact of technology migration, price compression and other secular challenges.","From an overall Wireline perspective, total operating revenues were down 0.4%, EBITDA was $2.2 billion, up 3.4% resulting in an EBITDA margin of 22.3% for the quarter. Our strategic investments in network technology enable us to deliver reliable and high quality services and solutions to consumers, small businesses and enterprise customers.","As we scale these key products and services, they will improve our overall revenue mix and drive further operating efficiency. We are focused on network operating efficiency through improvements in service provisioning and dispatch and repair rates. We remain confident in our ability to increase Wireline EBITDA and expand the margin in 2014. Our financial performance in the first quarter was a good start.","Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. We are off to a strong start with a 4.8% increase in consolidated revenues and a 160 basis points EBITDA margin expansion. We continue to post high-quality double-digit adjusted earnings growth and have a strong cash position with full access to growing wireless cash flow.","We are on track to achieve our revenue growth, margin expansion and capital spending targets for the year. We have good momentum in Wireless and expect to build on that strength driving further penetration of devices, and extending our leadership position in 4G LTE.","In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets, and continue to differentiate ourselves with the superior broadband products and are recently introduced FiOS Quantum TV service.","In the Enterprise space, we will continue to aggressively market key platforms, demonstrating that we have the unique set of capabilities to provide customer solution. We remain focused on cost structure improvements, to drive productivity and operating efficiencies throughout the entire business utilizing our Verizon Lean Six-Sigma principles.","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.","Michael Stefanski","","Thank you, Fran. David, we are now ready to take the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","","Hey guys, thanks. So I guess, if we \u2013 just talk about subscribers on both sides, churn up in Wireless leading to some handset share losses this quarter and FiOS softer, too. You seem to be responding to T somewhat with the Edge price cuts recently and allowing people to trade down.","How should we think about the impact to ARPA in 2Q and beyond from these trade-down effects? And then what about responding to cable on the FiOS side? Are you happy with the revenue ramp due to rate increases or do you try harder on subs as we go forward, too? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Hi, good morning, Phil. So, look, I think that, let\u2019s talk about the subs and the churn and then we can talk about the EDGE pricing. So, first off, I think if you put this quarter in perspective, coming into this quarter from the fourth quarter on the end of the first quarter call here or the fourth quarter, we talked about how we would take a very rational disciplined approach in responding to the competitive marketplace. And that\u2019s what you saw us do through the quarter.","Now having done that, through January and February we saw a lot of pressure around our basic phone customer base which is why we launched our low-end 4G price point on More Everything to give those basic customers a chance and a view into getting over to a smartphone on our 4G network and we saw the improvements through the month of March.","In addition, if you look at our tablet sales, we said coming into this year, that tablet would be a major growth trajectory for the entire industry and I think that\u2019s what you are seeing. You are going to see that this is a very underpenetrated marketplace and the more we drive tablets into our 4G network, the more revenue stimulation we create.","So we had one of the best tablet quarters ever even without the Christmas season from the fourth quarter. So, when you look at the churn, the churn was definitely impacted via the basic phone customer base. So, we actually had one of the best quarters ever adding 866,000 4G smartphones to our base and then another 634 tablets.","So the net effect of the loss was mainly within the basic phone base and some 3G smartphone customers which led us to then refresh our shared pricing to More Everything and then we also had to do some response to some of the EDGE pricing that the competitive marketplace offered in order for us to be competitive within those high-end data plans.","However, I think it\u2019s also important to say that these installment plans or EDGE plan is a very profitable plan to us. So as we manage the business through prepaid reseller, postpaid subscribers whether they go on a subsidy model or on an installment sale model, these are all accretive to the business and very profitable plans.","So, if you look at the ARPA, obviously ARPA since it does not include equipment revenue, the increase in the take rate of EDGE will definitely have an impact on that metric and do I expect the EDGE take rate to increase?","Yes, because, if you look at the first quarter, most of the EDGE products were sold through our direct channel and we will be expanding that to the indirect channels coming here at the very end of the first quarter, mainly in the second quarter.","So the EDGE take rate will increase, which will have an impact on service revenues and the ARPA metric. So, we will have to think about that going into the second quarter that's how report that. But again I feel very confident in coming out of the first quarter with 7.5% of service revenue growth and the ARPA growth.","Now, as far as the competitive pressures and some of the other moves we\u2019ve made, look, I mean, this goes back to when we first went to shared pricing, we said that it would be dilutive in the short-term but it would drive usage on our network and by moving to EDGE and out of contracts and it\u2019s a very small base of customers because you have to be on More Everything and include it in the base.","But obviously in the short-term, this could create some revenue pressure for us, but again it\u2019s moving these customers to higher daily usage plans which drive more usage which in essence drives more revenue. So the guidance we have given you, I stand firm on, because we\u2019ve considered all of this into our forecast.","So, I don\u2019t really anticipate changing any of that at this point in time. If I move over to the cable environment with FiOS and the net add, there were two really main things here that happened. First off, we did a price increase in the fourth quarter and every time we do a price increase, we always see some pressure in the churn in the following quarter.","But also we had probably one of the worst winters on record here and people did not want us in their houses to install FiOS. But I think a couple of things to point out. One is the competitive pressure from cable did increased in the first quarter.","\\We did not respond immediately because of the environment that we were dealing in weather. So we waited, we became more aggressive in March and I would tell you that exiting the quarter, our pipeline has grown and I have a viewpoint that the second quarter will be back on track from a net add perspective.","So, Phil, I\u2019ll leave it at that and hopefully that answers your question.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","","That helps. Thanks, Fran.","Michael Stefanski","Okay, David, let\u2019s take the next question please.","Operator","","And your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Great, thanks a lot. Good morning, Fran. Just to quickly follow-up on EDGE, have you had any change in your view about the \u2013 kind of the sell activity of the EDGE product? It seems like T-Mobile and AT&T are pushing these fairly broadly, and in the past you have sort of said you want to reserve this for your best customers. Any change there?","And then perhaps you could touch a bit more on the network. Where are you on the AWS rollout and have you solved all the congestion problems you were talking about a couple of quarters ago? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, Simon. So, first on EDGE, look, this is a customer choice. This is not what I want. It really comes into our customer choices and again, we are going to allow our customers to choose the right plan for them and if you look at the economics, it depends on what phone choose.","So, if you decide to take a free iPhone that\u2019s out in the marketplace today, you may be better off going on the subsidy plan for two years end up paying less over time than the installment plan.","If you decide to take a very high-end handset, then you may benefit by going to the installment sale. So, I think it\u2019s a personal choice. It also comes down to when do you think you are going to upgrade. If you are a customer that wants to hold your phone on for a two-year period of time or longer, it depends what plan you may choose. If you decide, you want to upgrade every year, then obviously the installment plan is the plan that you have to select.","So, this comes down to personal choice and again our sales forces is not compensated to drive traffic to any one sort of plan. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about customer satisfaction and treating our customers and the choices that they want. So, again, its \u2013 the way I look at this is, as we manage the business, these plans are all profitable plans to us. So it comes down to customer choice.","On the network side of the house, I think that, in my script, I was pretty deliberate on making some statements there about some third-party studies that were done in the first quarter and I think that speaks to itself as to where we are with our network.","We are through the congestion. The network performance is delivering what we expected to and as you see that in our CapEx spending, we are going to be more leveled this year. If you know historically, we\u2019ve always had more of a ramp from the first quarter to the fourth quarter.","We will be more leveled with that. So we are really concentrating on the density and the diversification of the 4G network, especially in the major cities and that\u2019s where we have deployed AWS and we will continue to deploy AWS throughout the year more into the smaller cities and into the rural markets, but right now the concentration is in the major cities like New York, San Francisco, Chicago et cetera.","So, Simon, that handles the question. Thanks.","Michael Stefanski","David, we can take the next question now.","Operator","","The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","David Barden \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","","Thanks guys, thanks for taking the questions. So, Fran, I apologize \u2013 I got \u2013 I have to ask one more on EDGE, too, which is that one of the things we saw coming out of the AT&T result was that there is really two parts to these installment plans.","One is the mechanical part of changing the accounting where you take some of the service revenue and you put it into equipment revenue and that's the relatively easy part.","Another part of the puzzle thought was that, if AT&T was very aggressive at pushing this pricing out to people even if they didn't take the installment payment plan because they felt like it was an immunization tool against incremental competition.","So, could you kind of share with us kind of what we should be expecting from Verizon in terms of not just how the EDGE program is going to unfold, but how you're going to use the EDGE pricing as a competitive tool if it all?","And then the second question, if I could was, on the Wireline margin side, a pretty strong margin, especially for 1Q, which historically has seen lots of headwinds for bonuses and FICA and other things.","So I was wondering if you could kind of maybe give us a picture of whether we can use 1Q as a starting point for some of the Six-Sigma improvements and stuff that you are working on for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","All right, David. Good, thanks. So on the mechanical side, look, I mean, this is a fairly complex accounting for the EDGE pricing. But really there is two main components to this. First is you book up the receivable, you record the revenue over the time, but the amount of revenue that you record is based on the residual value that you assign and the liability that you set up for that telephone.","And I would say that, our approach is going to be extremely conservative. So, we will probably be recording less revenue upfront under the installment sale, just so that we can get a feel for what the uncollectability is going to be over time.","How much value these phones are going to be worth a year or two years out depending upon how many phones hit the market at the same place. We do think that there could be some saturation effect in the outer years. So we will take a very conservative approach here on the accounting.","As far as the competitive environment, look, I am not going to speak for anybody else. I think, we\u2019ve shown, we will be rational and deliberate on how we respond to the marketplace. We are responding to our customers\u2019 requests.","This recent move that we made related to allowing out of contract subscribers to move over to the EDGE pricing, I believe is a good move for us because again it treats our customers the way they want to be treated and it is a retention tool for us. So, it will help to deliver a lower churn metric in the future. And it\u2019s up to them whether they want to move, we are not going to deliberately move our customers, it will be totally to their choice.","So, that's from a competitive environment. On the Wireline margin, I think that, at least everything Lowell and I had been talking about for the last two years is starting to finally come through on the metrics of Wireline.","And just a couple of things, I think in the past, I\u2019d probably be sitting here asking for a test based on the Northeast corridor storms for the entire winter and one of the worst winters on record.","And normally I\u2019d be sitting here talking about repair rates and how much expense we have to incur. And here we sit with all of the copper to fiber migrations that we have done over the last two years, we did another 70,000 plus this quarter. This is really starting to come in through the maintenance side, because fiber performance is much better during these weather conditions than copper performs.","So, I think that all of the Verizon Lean Six-Sigma segments and I told you I was very confident coming into this year that we could improve the Wireline margin on a year-over-year basis and I hold to that confidence because of the things that I see between Verizon Lean Six-Sigma and also because of the copper to fiber migrations that we\u2019ve been able to form.","In addition, of course, the good driver of revenue here is through our Quantum products and the uptake of our customers to the higher speeds and willing to pay more for those higher speeds and also the congestion in their houses because of the wireless devices they are running off of that Wi-Fi network really demand that fiber into the home that only FiOS can provide.","So, I think everything together is driving this. We can talk about the Enterprise segment but as I said coming into the year, I think that best we will look at what we did last year and I think that\u2019s where the position will be as we will probably not see any improvement in Enterprise in 2014. Thanks, David.","David Barden \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","","Great, thanks.","Michael Stefanski","David, let\u2019s take the next question.","Operator","","And your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Hey guys. Thanks. Fran, and just one thought on smartphones obviously becoming a bigger part of the base. Do you think smartphones are causing shorter handset lives, meaning as we look at adoption of EDGE or other EIP programs with smartphones needing to be upgraded more often. It's actually a better plan for the carriers and particularly for Verizon?","And then secondly on Enterprise, if you could just comment, you made some comments regarding the decline in revenue there, maybe rank order what you are seeing there with respect to technology change, pricing and then demand? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Okay. So, on the \u2013 look, I think it\u2019s way too early to tell yet how the impact of the installment plans will react on the upgrade rate. I mean, we\u2019ve been at this for years and the upgrade rate is pretty steady. You will have fluctuations based on seasonality, but coming out of the first quarter, we really didn\u2019t see any change in that.","But we probably really won\u2019t see the impact of early upgrades probably for another six to eight months. So, I think we are going to have to hold on what the expectation there is. But I think the other thing too though is that, just from an overall product set, you know, smartphones are, as I said coming into the quarter, are going to be a slower portion of the growth, I think for the entire industry as we go forward as the penetration grows.","So we look to those other facets of the tablets and machine-to-machine and then if you look beyond that with VoLTE and multicast giving our customers even additional features that could potentially drive more usage on the network. So that\u2019s really what the future holds for us. The smartphone category, I do believe that upgrades may increase with EDGE, but again I think it\u2019s too early to tell.","On the Enterprise side, look, I think what we continue to see here is that the United States is the highest corporate tax payer in the world and until we fix that situation, with all the discussions in Washington whether extenders will happen, won\u2019t happen, whether we\u2019ll get through tax reform or we won\u2019t get the tax reform, there is just too much uncertainty out there for enterprises to really lock down on where they are going in the future.","So, I think, this is where we are playing right now. The public sector is still a major drag on our results and as you know, we include the public sector in our enterprise results. And that's also now impacting the strategic services because they are also starting to cut and move away from some of the more strategic products.","So, I think, for this year, we just, we are satisfied with being flat with last year which is what I came into this year saying, and I think if we can resolve some of the issues and the uncertainties, and I think we are on a better path for enterprise. But right now, I think we are where we are.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Okay, Fran, just on the pricing situation, is that a competitive issue or is it just technology change that lowers the price points for the product sets?","Fran Shammo","No, look, we are extremely competitive and have a great product set in our Enterprise space and obviously if we get into the details, I mean, if you look at security and look at our cloud services, they are growing.","If you look at the huge Telematics platform, that\u2019s growing in the enterprise space, but then we have all this legacy voice and core and even within the IP products, you see the price compression happening on those products and each year it comes up for renewal you have a price compression.","So, some of it is competitive, but we are in an extremely competitive environment. But look, I mean, people are just cutting enterprises are still focused on cost structure. They are not increasing their investments, they are increasing their spends. So that\u2019s where we sit.","Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Thanks, Fran.","Michael Stefanski","David, let\u2019s take the next question.","Operator","","And your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research","","Hi, thanks, good morning. Fran, I was wondering if we could just take a step back in the Wireline business and just talk a little bit about the homes where you don't have FiOS. I think it\u2019s \u2013 and maybe you can give an update on a number, maybe roughly 8 million homes where you don't have plans to build FiOS.","What you do in those markets to stay competitive and to try to improve the financial outlook or is that a source of even possible asset optimization at some point? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Sure, Mike. Thanks. This could be a record quarter since you didn\u2019t ask me about net debt on Wireless. So that\u2019s a good thing. But, look, on the FiOS and the copper houses, so, within the FiOS footprint as we said, we now have less than 1 million homes left that are on copper. So we will continue to migrate them.","Outside of the FiOS footprint obviously, really we are taking two measures there. One is the Wireless portfolio and replacing some of that that old voice legacy copper voice with our LTE voice product that Wireless has been selling across the nation for almost two years now called Home Phone Connect. Within Wireline, they have a very similar product called VoiceLink which in essence is the same thing.","So we will try to replace that copper legacy with those technologies. But look, I mean, outside, this is kind of where you say it\u2019s you have to nurture it and harvest what you have and we know that we are not going to be able to compete with speed in that environment and we will continue to do the best we can.","Now, there will be certain areas, maybe another year or so, where we may look to extend the fiber a bit and include some small businesses which we compete extremely well in within the FiOS footprint and they are very profitable customers.","But beyond that, Mike, I think we are in harvest mode and we will continue to do the best we can with the technologies we have as alternatives for our customers.","Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research","","Thanks very much.","Michael Stefanski","David, next question.","Operator","","Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","","Okay, thanks, guys. Fran, just quickly back to EDGE if we could, can you give us a sense of what the take rates you are seeing on smartphone sales these days? I think you said that it increased with the change in pricing, but if you could give us some color there that would be great.","And then maybe the percentage of smartphones now that are on Edge pricing. And then maybe if possible, how that is going to evolve over time, especially now that you are moving some of the off-contract customers over to the new pricing?","Fran Shammo","Yes, thanks, John. So, as far as the take rate on EDGE, I would tell you that we were less than 15% in the first quarter from a take rate. I expect that to potentially double with the launch of this payment plan option within our indirect channel. I would also say that, it is going to become more and more difficult for us to separate out and give a normalized basis with and without EDGE.","And the reason I say that is, as we start to launch this in our indirect channel, you are going to get into all kinds of confusion of how the commission works, who bought the phone, who is doing \u2013 we will do the installment on that, but we may not have actually sold the phone to the indirect.","They may have bought it outright. So there is implications with how compensation will work. So although we gave you separate data here in the first quarter because it was easy, because it was just within our direct channel, I think that is going to become more complicated going out here.","So, from a take rate perspective, it\u2019s hard for me to tell what the take rate will be. But I do believe it will probably double into the second quarter with the launch of our indirect channel John. So that's really all I can talk about on the EDGE. It\u2019s too early for us to tell what the rate will be.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","","Okay, but in terms of the percentage of smartphones in the base that are on EDGE is it sort of mid single-digits at this point?","Fran Shammo","It\u2019s less than 2%.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","","Less than 2%, got it, okay. All right, thanks, Fran.","Fran Shammo","Thanks.","Michael Stefanski","David, next question.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Thank you very much. Fran, two areas I would like to touch on and this is sort of dovetailing on the prior question. You mentioned that EDGE penetration will increase, potentially doubling next quarter. I was wondering if you could give us how much of your earnings growth is attributed to sort of your expectations of rising penetration of EDGE?","And then secondly, now that you've fully integrated the contribution of the Wireless business from Vodafone, how should we think about the quarterly progression of earnings now that there is a larger portion of your revenue is coming from one \u2013 what may argue \u2013 one could argue is a less fluctuating wireless business, which may now include less contribution to subsidy costs if EDGE penetration rises? Thanks a lot.","Fran Shammo","Sure, Amir. Thanks, so on the EDGE and the contribution, look, as I just said to the previous question it\u2019s going to be very, very hard for me to start to separate this given the indirect channel.","Look, I think the guidance we have given, I stand behind the guidance that we\u2019ve given, we\u2019ll do our best to try to give some clarity in this going forward, but as I said it\u2019s going to be a cloudy environment and it\u2019s hard for me to sit here today to say, oh, EDGE is going to contribute X basis points of my profitability.","I just don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t know what the take rate will be. And I want to make sure we talk about take rate not penetration. So, it\u2019s going to be the take rate of new additions, not the penetration of the base. As far as quarterly earnings, this is a great question, because, historically, you would see more of an uptick in the second and third quarters.","And I think now that we have a 100% of Wireless, you are going to see a more consistent earnings per share for us going forward other than the fourth quarter obviously which is more seasonal.","So that has its own issues. But, I think you are going to see a more consistent first, second and third quarter and then the fourth quarter will have its own decline, because of the seasonality with that. So that\u2019s a good question and thanks for asking.","Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Thanks a lot for your incremental color, Fran.","Michael Stefanski","David, let\u2019s take another question please.","Operator","","And your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie","","Thanks, can you talk a little about the recent FCC regulatory comments regarding net neutrality and the broadcast auction rules; what your positions are on this and how you think this evolves over the next several months?","Fran Shammo","Yes, so, I know the FCC was issuing an order today on net neutrality. I have not had a chance to look at the order. We will be excited to read that order and then we can give our comments on that. So, unfortunately, being on the call, I have not seen it and been updated on that.","And as far as the auctions go, look, I think that, we are obviously preparing for those auctions. As I talked about in the beginning here with our gross debt, we are preparing our balance sheet and our financial wherewithal to participate in these auction is coming up.","And, look, as we continue to look at these rules, and work through these rules, we will continue to \u2013 behind the scenes if you will, work with the FCC to get the rules that we need.","But, it\u2019s an important step forward for the pool of spectrum available to meet our customer needs and we will certainly take advantage of what the FCC is working on as far as the auctions go.","Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie","","And when can we expect to hear more details about your video strategy? I think you said last quarter it would be soon. So, is it still soon or is it very soon?","Fran Shammo","Well, this is \u2013 Kevin, this is on the over-the-top type strategy or?","Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie","","Yes and just EdgeCast and VDMS and all of the aggregation of the intellectual property that you bought in the last 12, 18 months.","Fran Shammo","Yes, so, video \u2013 Verizon video, digital media services is ramping up. We are still in what we would call a dataset with a lots of content providers and testing the system and I believe as I said before that will \u2013 that revenue will start to ramp in 2014. So that\u2019s the first step in just putting content through and digitalizing that content potentially inserting ads into that content.","Obviously, we added the uplink and the EdgeCast assets to that and really that was in preparation to prepare for the over-the-top if you will. But I think it\u2019s still way too early to tell on the on queue acquisition obviously the first priority for us it IPTV.","But as you overlay that to the other asset sets, what I would say is, we are in a great position to take advantage of the marketplace when and if content starts to sort itself out from an over-the-top perspective. So, that\u2019s probably all we would say at this point in time on that one Kevin.","Michael Stefanski","Okay, David, we have time for one more question.","Operator","","Your last question comes from Joseph Mastrogiovanni of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Joseph Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Fran, if I could just follow-on to the last question, how should we think about \u2013 how you are thinking about splitting your budget between the AWS and the broadcast auctions?","Fran Shammo","Well, I think it\u2019s too early to tell. I guess, what we are focused on, or at least, what I am focused on right now is the AWS auction which we know will happen at the end of this year with attainment being sometime in the first quarter. So that\u2019s top priority and then we\u2019ll deal with the broadcast licenses after that within 2015. So right now, the priority is AWS.","Joseph Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Thank you.","Michael Stefanski","Okay, that ends our questions. So I\u2019d like to turn it over to Fran for some closing remarks.","Fran Shammo","So, thanks, Mike. So, look everyone, thank you for joining us this morning. And I think I would just recap that said, the first quarter for us was a great start to the year. We consistently invest and focus on the profitable growth to drive strong financial performance and revenue earnings and cash flow, we are focused on customer satisfaction.","Our proven ability to scale this business and drive operational efficiencies in order for us to deliver more value to our customers and compete effectively in all areas of our business. We continue to focus on our strategy to deliver the highest quality overall customer experience.","We listen to our customers, monitor the competitive environment and respond where necessary in a rational manner. We are very confident in our ability to execute and improve on our business fundamentals driving consistent customer value while delivering growth in customers, revenues, earnings, and cash flow.","We are very excited about the future of this industry. We are excited about our investment, the innovation curve that we are delivering. The customer satisfaction that we have and the delivery of value to our shareholders and to our employees, our more valuable assets. So thank you for joining our call this morning and have a great day.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tori. Good morning, and welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Lowell McAdam; and our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.","Thank you for joining us this morning. Given yesterday's announcement of the Yahoo acquisition, we expect this call will exceed an hour. As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website.","The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are an on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Lowell and Fran go through our strategy and these results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2016 we reported earnings of $0.17 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results included several significant non-operational items that I would like to highlight.","Our reported earnings include a noncash pre-tax loss of $3.6 billion, generated by pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to the re-measurements triggered by the new labor contracts, the transaction with Frontier, and settlement accounting. The overall impact after tax amounted $2.2 billion or $0.54 per share.","On the balance sheet side in the quarter, employees benefit obligations were reduced on a net basis by $1.6 billion, primarily driven by actuarial evaluations associated with the new labor contracts and the Frontier transaction, which were partially offset by the mark-to-market remeasurements and the assets transferred to Frontier. Year to date unfunded employee benefit obligations have been reduced by $1.9 billion.","We incurred nonoperational expenses of $1.8 billion in connection with the early debt redemption and tender offers. On an after-tax basis these charges amounted to $1.1 billion or $0.27 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $1 billion on the sale of California, Florida, and Texas Wireline markets to Frontier. On an after-tax basis the gain on sale amounted to $139 million or $0.03 per share.","Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.94 in the second quarter, compared with $1.04 per share a year ago, or a decline of 9.6%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of 2015.","Our adjusted results include the impact of the work stoppage, which at the consolidated level amounted to $420 million on a pre-tax basis, representing about $0.07 per share.","At the Wireline segment level, before consolidating intercompany transactions, the pre-tax amount was $489 million. As previously stated, we will not recapture the $0.07 for the impact of the work stoppage on full year 2016 earnings per share.","For purposes of comparability in the Wireline segment, the historical results of the operations that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016, have been reclassified to Corporate and Other. On June 28 we filed a Form 8-K, providing the recast on audited historical information for the past nine quarters, which can be accessed on our website. Additionally, prior-period results do not include the operations of AOL.","With that I'd now like to turn the call over to Lowell.","Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an eventful first half of 2016, marked with several strategic milestones. We continued to evolve our Wireless pricing model and customer interface. We closed the Frontier transaction. We made major moves in our network and reached new contracts with our labor unions, all while delivering solid results in a challenging environment. We will discuss all of these in more detail in a few minutes.","In addition, yesterday we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Yahoo's operating business for approximately $4.8 billion, a transaction that will make us an even stronger competitor in digital media.","With everything that's going on I wanted to take a few minutes at the start of this call to put these initiatives in context and tell you how we are strengthening our ability to realize our mission of delivering the promise of the digital world.","We have spoken to you before about our three-tier strategy. First, sustaining quality and performance leadership in all of our networks; second, in building new ecosystems around our broadband, video, and Internet of Things global platforms; and finally, monetizing our investments in networks and platform through applications and content. I'm very pleased with the progress that we are making across all of these fronts.","For us, delivering the promise of the digital world begins with network leadership, which has been the cornerstone of our brand since we formed Verizon in 2000. Our 4G LTE network consistently leads all external studies for quality and reliability across the country, even with the explosive growth of data usage.","Over the last 16 years we have grown from approximately 25 million customers using Wireless almost exclusively for voice services to more than 110 million customers using Wireless for mostly data services. In the second quarter alone network usage increased 44% over the prior year. To give you a perspective on traffic growth, we carry the same amount of traffic on our network in 1 hour today as we did in \u2013 10 plus years ago in 1 week.","In light of this growing demand we are continuing to invest in and evolve our Wireless network to provide the broadest, most reliable, and highest quality Wireless experience for our customers. This investment includes expanding the fiber front and backhaul to support Wireless network growth.","Verizon has been a leader in pushing the industry forward in every new generation of Wireless technology. With 3G we ushered in the era of Wireless data. By being the first to implement 4G LTE we changed the game for the delivery of Wireless broadband, opening up new opportunities for our customers and the industry as a whole. LTE is a growth engine for applications and devices across the ecosystem, increasing the productivity of our country. New players are entering this ecosystem every day.","To make sure 4G LTE can handle our customers' ever increasing demands, we are challenging conventional approaches to network architecture by deploying fiber to cell sites and densifying cells to handle the constant demand on the network in high usage areas.","We are also optimizing 4G with new techniques, like centralized baseband architecture, carrier aggregation, and core network virtualization initiatives, which provide operating, capital, and spectral network efficiencies. The balance has shifted away from building capacity exclusively through spectrum. We believe that 4G will be the base layer of our Wireless network for years to come.","Moreover, our approach to network architecture is also preparing us for 5G and shaping our thinking about future investment that will drive growth across all our business and ecosystem. You saw the first fruits of this strategy in April, when we announced our One Fiber strategy for the city of Boston. We will create a single fiber optic network platform capable of supporting Wireless and Wireline technologies and multiple products.","In particular, we believe the fiber deployment will create economic growth for Boston. And we are talking to other cities about similar partnerships. No longer are discussions solely about local franchise rights, but how to make forward-looking cities more productive and effective.","Our announced agreement to acquire XO Communications will also be a key part of this strategy, providing us with the deep fiber assets, including 40 metro fiber rings in major cities and millimeter wave spectrum in a significant part of the country that will give us a critical competitive edge.","Yesterday the SEC approved our lease arrangement with XO, so that we have a clear spectrum path toward 5G deployment, which like 4G, will be a game changer. I think of 5G initially as, in effect, Wireless fiber, which is Wireless technology that can provide an enhanced broadband experience that could only previously be delivered with physical fiber to the customer. With Wireless fiber the so called last mile can be a virtual connection, dramatically changing our cost structure.","I know we heard a lot of skepticism when we formed the 5G Tech Forum last fall, with critics questioning the need for moving so soon. But as we learned from our experience with 4G, being a first mover in developing the technology and nurturing the ecosystem is the best way to ensure that our customers benefit from its capabilities.","In our labs we're able to predict and model what a future home will look like, with multiple high definition TVs, laptops, tablets, and virtual reality applications served over a Wireless connection, delivered at speeds significantly higher than 1 gigabit per second. We are conducting field trials to see how the technology will perform using millimeter wave spectrum in terms of reach and propagation in real world conditions.","Mobile use cases, which will follow toward the end of the decade, will include massive Internet of Things scale and low latency services and applications. Trade associations are already accelerating their timelines for standards, which will be good for the industry. The ecosystem, including chipset, equipment, and device manufacturers, is aggressively adding resources to deliver handsets and low latency applications.","To date we have accomplished several key milestones in moving toward 5G. Along with our Tech Forum partners we completed radio specifications, which means that we can now test technical components for Wireless fiber services. We have ongoing technical trials in several markets to accelerate the pace of innovation. And we're strengthening our partnerships with carriers and OEMs to foster the development of a global ecosystem.","So we see the stars aligning very quickly when it comes to the 5G future. We have been very pleased by the partnership with the FCC to finalize the 5G spectrum rules. All of this keeps us on track to be the first carrier to deploy a 5G network in the United States, preparing us for a fixed commercial Wireless fiber launch in 2017 and laying the foundation to build mobility use cases later in the decade.","Through every generation of technology our fundamental principles remain the same: highest quality, consistent investment, customer value, and yes, superior execution. This dedication to network quality has created the best Wireless network in the world. Maintaining and extending that leadership remains the number one priority of the company.","With the other two tiers of our three-part strategy, we're developing the platforms, content, and applications that will drive usage on our network and monetize our investment in this world-class infrastructure. Let me review our progress in these areas, starting with video.","As you know, we've been building our video assets and capabilities for some time with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer.","At the heart of this video evolution are the changing ways in which younger consumers access their digital and mobile content. Over the past several years we have dramatically expanded the ways in which we can deliver content wherever and however the digital customer wants it, including: large and small bundles of linear content through Fios TV; new and better customer experiences for Fios using IP-based technology; over-the-top delivery of content; purchasing of AOL with its publishing and advertising technology and content; further enhancing AOL with the Millennial Media acquisition; introducing go90 and its vast library of digital content, not only for our Verizon customers, but other carriers' customers as well; developing a global video distribution platform for media companies to efficiently deliver high quality digital content; and finally, establishing a content joint venture with Hearst, through which we have invested in two leading digital brands for female and male millennials, namely AwesomenessTV and Complex Media.","We assembled a great team and strong assets under Marni Walden. Just over the past year since the AOL acquisition we have learned a tremendous amount about the video market and opportunities to grow in the future. Her team is focused on integrating these assets and driving profitable growth by attracting viewers through great content, which in turn attracts advertisers by increasing the return on their advertising dollar.","That brings us to Yahoo. We see tremendous opportunity in the digital video marketplace, which has an estimated addressable market of $180 billion by 2020. Today, that marketplace is dominated by two brands. Content creators and advertisers are hungry for alternatives as the market expands for both in-home and mobile consumption. Verizon intends to be a significant player in this space.","By acquiring Yahoo's operating business, we are scaling up to be a major competitor in mobile media. Yahoo's operations provide a valuable portfolio of online properties and mobile applications which attract over 1 billion monthly active consumer views. It also brings market-leading content, brands, and sports, finance, news, and e-mail into the portfolio. It expands our analytics and ad tech capabilities and enhances our competitive position and value proposition to advertisers.","We are already seeing enthusiasm from partners in sports, news, and finance to leverage this scale in the future.","Yahoo's operations complement AOL's business as well as our overall asset portfolio. The global scale, volume of customer analytics, and market reach of the combined assets will allow us to create long-term value in a less capital intensive manner.","We look forward to working with the very talented team at Yahoo. In the months ahead we will be focused on completing the necessary regulatory process, planning for integration, and closing this cash transaction early next year. Going forward, this acquisition will put us in a great position as a top global media company and give us a significant source of revenue growth for the future.","We are also building our growth capabilities in the emerging Internet of Things market by developing business models to monetize usage on our network at the connectivity and platform layers. We had another quarter of 25% growth in revenue from the Internet of Things, which amounted to approximately $205 million in the quarter and about $400 million year to date in 2016. We've also seen strong demand for our telematics products, including our direct-to-consumer product, hum, and see many opportunities to expand in the market.","In June we agreed to acquire Telogis, which will advance our fleet telematics connected solutions and expand our distribution relationships while we grow our global scale.","So as we are making tremendous strides strategically, John Stratton and his operations team are not taking their eye off the ball when it comes to operational performance.","I am pleased with where we stand as we reach the midpoint of the year.","In Wireless we've made significant progress in shifting away from the subsidy model, with 53% of our postpaid phone base now on unsubsidized price plans. At the same time, our churn metrics continue to be the best in the industry, which is a testimony to our high quality loyal customer base. Fran is going to cover more of that in a few minutes.","In Wireline we completed the sale of three properties to Frontier, which concentrates our Wireline assets in the Northeast corridor where we can further invest in fiber.","We also managed through a 7-week work stoppage, ultimately reaching an outcome that benefited our employees and our business. While the strike impacted the results in the second quarter, the new labor contracts will generate approximately $500 million of cash savings over the term of the contract. The contract benefits include workforce flexibility provisions that provide the opportunity to optimize processes and scale customer service centers to better align with the business needs.","Also, noncash benefit savings primarily related to retiree healthcare will be realized. We preserved the bargained-for caps on our annual obligation for post-retirement medical benefits, which when netted with other postretirement benefit changes reduced our unfunded employee benefit obligation by $4.7 billion in the quarter.","I'd like to thank our management employees for stepping in and serving our customers day in and day out during the strike. We are proud that our customer satisfaction results remained strong during this time, which demonstrates not only our planning but our commitment to placing customers first in our business.","I'd also like to thank the vast majority of our associates for the respectful way in which they conducted themselves during the work stoppage. We look forward to continuing to work with our represented employees to better serve our customers and create work environments that will allow all of our employees to grow professionally.","Overall, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost structure through workforce reductions and the new labor contract benefits that we just discussed. As always we're focused on driving efficiencies through our ongoing Lean Six Sigma program.","So as I look at the first half of 2016, I'm pleased with what we have accomplished in a fast moving, challenging environment, and how far we have come repositioning ourselves strategically for the next decade.","Now let me turn the call over to Fran to review second quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Lowell. Good morning, everyone. On a reported basis total operating revenue declined 5.3% in the second quarter. If we exclude the second quarter 2015 revenues from the operations that we divested and exclude this quarter's revenue from AOL, which was not part of our operations a year ago, adjusted operating revenue would have declined approximately 3.5% on a comparable year-over-year basis. AOL once again delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter.","In Wireless, service revenue as expected was pressured by the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans. Equipment revenue was also under pressure, due primarily to lower postpaid phone activations.","Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled about $11.1 billion and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% in the quarter, compared to $11.8 billion a year ago. As Lowell just reviewed, we are reducing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiency in our operations throughout the business, which will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future.","Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. Cash flows from operations were $5.4 billion in the second quarter. Through the first half of the year, cash flows from operations totaled $12.8 billion, which is down $6.1 billion on a year-over-year basis, driven by the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015, a change in our method of monetizing device payment receivables, and an increase in cash taxes.","Most of our device payment plan receivables originated in the second quarter were retained in contemplation of an asset-backed securitization transaction in the third quarter. This timing resulted in approximately $1.6 billion of working capital pressure.","Free cash flow for the first half of the year totaled $5.6 billion (sic) [$5.5 billion].","Subsequent to the quarter, we completed our first on balance sheet asset-backed securitization transaction with net proceeds of $1.1 billion, for which there was significant investor demand. Going forward, we expect to finance new device payment plan receivable originations with on balance sheet securitizations with a mix of bank transactions or public transactions. Public, or 144A, on balance sheet securitization as a funding channel provides several benefits, including diversification and lower borrowing costs with AAA ratings.","Favorable captive finance treatment from two credit rating agencies is an offset to the financial statement impacts of on balance sheet financing. The financial statements will reflect an increase in receivables as new loans are originated. And debt will also reflect new securitization financings.","Going forward, the cash flow statement will reflect securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. As a result, using on balance sheet financing will result in lower cash flows from operations, and therefore lower free cash flow, but will not reduce the cash we have available to run the business, as we plan to continue to securitize a significant amount of our receivables portfolio. We will provide additional disclosures on securitization in the third quarter.","Cash taxes are higher compared to a year ago, as certain benefits that we realized in the prior period did not recur. And timing of tax deductions for early debt retirements varied. Cash taxes will increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to the taxes that will be paid related to the sale of our Wireline operations, which are approximately $3.2 billion.","Our disciplined capital allocation model demonstrates our commitment to investing in businesses for the future.","Capital expenditures were $3.9 billion in the quarter and $7.3 billion for the first half of the year. While the first half trend is lower than expected due to timing and the strike impact in Wireline, we reiterate our full year capital guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.","We ended the quarter with $99.7 billion of total debt, net debt of $96.9 billion, and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2 times, which includes the liability management that we did in the quarter. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.","Now let's move into reviews of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Total Wireless operating revenues declined 4% in the quarter to $21.7 billion. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.4% for the quarter, an improvement from the year-over-year decline of 6.2% in the first quarter. Equipment revenue was $3.7 billion, down 4.1% due to lower activations.","Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.1 billion in the second quarter. While service revenue will continue to be pressured by the migration of our customer base to the unsubsidized price plans, the decline has flattened as expected, now that we have approximately 53% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We recently refreshed the Verizon plans to enable increased customer control. We believe the pricing plans are resonating with our customers, providing value and functionality.","As with any new pricing plan, we expect some account optimization early on. And we remain confident that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the fourth quarter of 2017.","The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 67% in the second quarter, compared about 68% in the first quarter. The take rate, which was lower than our expectations, was due primarily to a higher mix of business customers in our overall postpaid phone activations for the quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience. We recognize that new device launches could have an impact on take rate levels, but at this point it is too early to forecast any changes.","During the quarter 5.2 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total we have about 31.8 million phone connections activated on a device payment plan, representing about 37% of our postpaid phone base.","In terms of profitability we generated $10.3 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 3.8%. And had a segment EBITDA margin of 47.5%, up from 43.9% a year ago.","Now let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on Slide 8. Postpaid net adds, which does not include any wholesale connections, including Internet of Things, totaled 615,000. Overall, postpaid net additions declined sequentially, primarily due to increased tablet churn. Net phone additions increased sequentially to 86,000. We added 462,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were offset by a net decline of 250,000 basic phones. The remaining offset in phone net adds were 3G devices.","Tablet net adds totaled 356,000. All other postpaid devices totaling 173,000 were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being the primary driver.","Net prepaid devices declined by 30,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year, due to the impact of new pricing plans for our prepaid market. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, down from 3.9 million a year ago and flat sequentially. Retail postpaid churn was 0.94%, up 4 basis points from the prior year.","We continue to see strong retention in our phone base, which is being offset by increasing tablet churn, stemming from the free tablet promotions from 2 years ago. We expect the higher rates of tablet churn to continue throughout the entire year.","We ended the quarter with 113.2 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry leading postpaid connection base grew 3.9% to 107.8 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million.","Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations were 9.5 million in the quarter, down 4.3% sequentially and nearly 16.2% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 81% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activation. About 5.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. This represents a decline of 180 basis points.","Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. Consumer revenue declined 0.3% and mass markets, which includes small business, declined 1.2% on a comparable basis, excluding the properties sold to Frontier.","Fios total revenue grew 3.7%. Fios revenue was strong, even with the work stoppage and a high prior-year comparable pay-per-view fight event. The growth in Fios is driven by a higher customer base and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 11% of our Fios Internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater.","We continue to see the downsizing of our video bundles and increased appetite for our custom TV package, which represented nearly 40% of Fios video sales in the quarter. Fios subscriber growth was impacted by the work stoppage in the second quarter. We made significant progress on working through the backlog of new installations in June and expect to return to a normal run rate in the third quarter.","In Fios video net customers declined 41,000 in the quarter. Fios Internet net adds were negative 13,000. And net broadband subscribers decreased by 83,000. Fios Video penetration was 34.6% in the quarter, compared to 35.5% in the prior year, representing the decline of 90 basis points. Fios Internet penetration was 40.1% in the quarter, compared to 39.8% in the prior year, representing an increase of 30 basis points. We believe we have an opportunity to further penetrate the markets we serve.","Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.4% in the second quarter, due to technology transitions and pricing pressures. In the second quarter global enterprise revenue declined 3.3%. And on a constant currency basis the decline was about the same. In our global wholesale business revenues declined 4.1% in the second quarter. Trends in our enterprise and global wholesale businesses remained consistent with prior periods.","Wireline segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was 14%, which includes the impact of work stoppage, compared to 18.7% in the prior year. The pre-tax financial impact of the strike in the quarter was $489 million on the Wireline segment.","In terms of improving the overall margin, we made improvements in cost structure by optimizing our workforce and expect benefits from the new labor contracts to be realized during the remainder of 2016 and in future years. Wireline capitalized labor expenditures slowed in the second quarter as we prioritized maintenance and repair activities over new installations during the work stoppage. We expect capital spending levels to increase in the second half of the year as we return to normal operations after the work stoppage.","Let's move next to our summary slide. As expected, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We are focused on executing operationally, strategically and financially to deliver results today and prepare the business for future profitable growth. In the first half of the year in Wireless we added 1.3 million postpaid net customers and stabilized our Wireless service revenue declines. In Wireline we completed the sale of the operations in California, Florida, and Texas and negotiated new labor contracts which will have benefits into the future. We continue to be the network leader in the markets we serve. And we are setting the business up for growth.","In our new businesses we enhanced our Video and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. We are very excited about the work that has already been done, the integration of assets that we are beginning to do, and the acquisition of Yahoo to accelerate our Video platforms.","As we enter the second half of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute and drive results. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations. Full year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage, consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full year 2015, consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion, a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million, and our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35% to 36%. We also expect GDP-type growth in consolidated revenue for the full year 2017.","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Fran. Tori, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. One moment, please, for the first question. Your first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks and good morning, guys. Maybe quick \u2013 couple quick questions for Lowell. Lowell, first of all, could you give us an early look at the synergies that you see coming with the Yahoo transaction? And with it behind you now, do you feel that you have the assets you need to execute on the new media strategy? Thanks.","Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, good morning, John, and good morning, everyone. I understand there were lots of rumors about me announcing a big reorganization of the company, so I'm sorry to disappoint you. But I think we have some pretty exciting things to talk about here.","First, on Yahoo synergy. Look, certainly as we went into the auction process, we had a very good idea of what the synergies could be. I think probably we were the only significant bidder that had synergies. So we have a good idea, and we've heard numbers bantered around that are in the ballpark.","But my view on this, John, is we now enter a phase where post the auction diligence, which is certainly limited, we can go in and talk to management and see a much greater depth of information. And we'll validate our plans and make our decisions. So I think as we get closer to closing, which we expect will be either at the end of the year or early in the first quarter, we'll announce those numbers. But they're meaningful, let me just put it that way.","On the \u2013 do we have the assets we need? Certainly yesterday when Marni [Walden] and Tim [Armstrong] did their public interviews, we're extremely excited about the assets that Yahoo has in the area of sports and finance and email and news. And you match those up with AOL, we've just made an exponential leap in capabilities here.","But I'll give you the answer that I always give you, John, when we talk about capital. And you say, well, are you finally done expanding and are you going to reduce your capital? And my answer always is, I hope not. Because if we do, then we're standing still. And this is such a dynamic environment, we should be looking for additional things to meet customers' needs.","And I fully expect that when Tim and Marissa [Mayer] put their heads together, we'll have a long list. And we'll be disciplined as we always are. And they'll be good investments that'll drive us to take a larger share of this growing market.","So there's been a lot made of, oh, are we going to challenge Google and Facebook in this process? I just say, look, we plan on being a significant player here. The market is going to grow dramatically. We're a small player today relative to them. All we need to do is take more than our fair share of the growth of the market and this will be a success for us. And we certainly expect to do better than that.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, John. We appreciate the question. Next question, Tori?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Fran, I think you were one of the early ones to talk about elongating handset cycles. I think what we've seen so far with three companies reporting is very low upgrade rates, relatively low switching, but also low adds, low churn. To what extent do you think this is a typical sort of pre-iPhone lull? Or do you think we're in a new environment of more subdued activity going forward?","And in particular as you think about your growth, you talked about the ARPU stabilizing and service revenues returning. But you also need stronger volume growth. What can you do to stimulate more of the phone adds as we go forward here? Thanks. And anything you can say on the data center sale as well would be appreciated.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right, great. Thanks, Simon. So on handset cycles, so two viewpoints here. One is obviously we saw a similar trend \u2013 maybe not this dramatic \u2013 in 2014 where we saw a slowdown in the first half of the year in anticipation of iconic phones that were coming up on a 2-year cycle. So I think some of it could be that.","Unfortunately for us though, we have our first set of EIP customers coming up on their 2-year anniversary. And there's not enough volume yet of those customers to really get a behavior track, if you will, whether they're going to hold their phone and take a $20 to $25 discount on their bill or if they're just waiting for a new phone.","So I think it's too early to tell. We'll have a better feel for this as we go into the second quarter (sic). And that's why in my prepared remarks, I said it's too early to reforecast. But as I've said consistently, I think our volumes will be similar to 2015.","As far as the, how do we stimulate phone, smartphone growth? Look, I've been saying for over a year now that smartphone growth is going to continue to slow. And we have to look at other areas for that growth, obviously tablets being one. And we have a little bit of a headwind there.","But if you look at the gross adds of tablet, we added over a million tablets this quarter. So we are having pressure in the churn metric for that free tablet promotion that we did 2 years ago. And we will continue to have that pressure throughout the rest of the year. But if you look at the momentum of hum and you look at the other adds that we did, these are the types of devices that we want to add to the account to increase our revenue overall.","And if you look at the underlying ARPA, which is the installment and revenue per unit, that increased to 2.6% this quarter. So you can see the underlying revenue of our base is actually increasing. Unfortunately, you're not seeing it in the results, because the math of moving from the subsidized to the unsubsidized is declining that.","The last comment I'll make here on this topic is service revenue. So you saw the 80 basis [point] improvement on service revenue. And as we've continued to say, once we crossed over that 50% mark, and now we're at 53% of the base on the unsubsidized pricing, we are starting to see that service revenue math take effect and that decline starting to reverse.","So an 80 basis point this quarter. I continue to see that through the rest of the year we will improve. I will say that there won't be as much of an improvement in third quarter, because of the new pricing and some of the optimization. But we will see improvement. And I continue to see this trend going through the end of 2017, which I'm still confident that we will show accretion at the end of 2017.","Finally, on the data center sales we are coming to an end of the process. And we will probably come to a definitive answer in the third quarter as to whether we're going to move forward or we're not. And so I'll hold comment for the third quarter for that.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tori, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Oh, thanks. If I could follow up on Yahoo for a moment. In a letter that was picked up by the press from Yahoo's CEO yesterday, it referred to Verizon's goal to get to a global audience of 2 billion users and $20 billion of revenue within the mobile media business by 2020. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that goal in a couple of respects? In terms of what are the key strategies to get that growth? Is it simply just leveraging the assets you have? Or can you give us a little more color on how you look to maybe manage them differently than they've been managed in the past?","And then secondly, how should investors think about the profitability of that type of revenue in this category over time? Thanks.","Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'll \u2013 let me take the strategic question. And then Fran can talk a little bit more about the profit side.","Mike, I think this is similar to my answer to John's question. We've got a perspective going into this, and we'll refine it as we go along. But if you take a look at the interest that we have received from AOL current partners as well as new partners, we think there's a huge opportunity in the following areas.","First, in the sports area. As you know we've got relationships with a lot of the big leagues. Certainly NFL and NBA are the headliners for us. I've spoken with both Roger Goodell and Adam Silver in the last few weeks about this. And I think we're very excited. And I expect over the next few months you'll see more details about the plan of what we can do with their content, not only in season but out of season. And there are other sports leagues that we have the opportunity to work with.","Some of other big names, I'm not going to tip our hand here just yet. But the networks and their sports channels see an opportunity to partner with us. They may already have NBA rights or NFL rights. And we can work on streaming their games, not only through the traditional channels of Fios, either Custom TV or the full bundles, but over AOL and Yahoo and then finally over go90. So we view this as a waterfall of content moving down through our different properties.","The next one is Yahoo Finance. That's probably their strongest asset today. We'll learn more about that. But as you look at again some of the networks that have finance channels, and frankly some of the other folks that were bidding on this, we think there's an opportunity for us to work with them in partnership to realize some of their visions and some of our visions.","And then certainly news, as you would expect, and the email platforms, we see ways that we can combine some of our assets and some of their assets, the TechCrunch, the Engadgets, the Huffington Post. And we can drive a lot of visits to the site.","So I think the different for us is we have a lot of \u2013 us versus the Yahoo management \u2013 we have a lot of the relationships well-established, because of our Fios and our mobile assets. And we can combine them with their platforms and their leadership expertise to deliver a very good lineup here.","So I think on the profitability side, Fran, I don't know. Any comments you have on that? But that's where we'll head from a strategic perspective, Mike.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Mike. What I would say is everything that Lowell said. And we're looking at this as a portfolio of assets. And as I said during this whole process, look, Yahoo brings viewers, viewers brings advertising, advertising brings top line growth. So the first thing here is to scale, to drive that top line growth. We believe that with the combination of all these assets, we have a lot of revenue synergy upside. So the first will be to drive the top line. And then as Tim has shown, and along with the Yahoo team, we'll drive the profitability that's required to generate the cash flow that we forecast. So that's the top priority right now.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Mike, thank you. Tori, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks so much, guys, for taking the questions. Maybe two if I could. First, Fran, you highlighted a GDP level of revenue growth next year. I think in the past you've talked about a kind of mid- to high-single digit normal earnings growth expectation for next year. Could you just kind of confirm that those two are the same thing?","And then second, just I think in Lowell's commentary, he kind of referenced a view that spectrum is not necessarily the be-all, end-all for creating capacity at the margin. In the notes out this morning you noted that 93% of the data traffic is on LTE capacity. I was wondering if you could kind of refresh us as to where or how much of your spectrum portfolio is dedicated to LTE? And how much is still available to be tapped to kind of continue to support that 40% plus growth rate in consumption? Thanks.","Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, David. Thanks for your question. Let me go first on the spectrum side. And then Fran can cover the first part of your question about growth rates.","Today, just to say it, about 50% of our spectrum is dedicated to 4G LTE. We still have some spectrum on 2G. We're refarming our CDMA spectrum as we go forward. And I expect that we've got plenty of headroom here.","The point of my comments \u2013 and Boston is our good example there \u2013 is the farther we push fiber out into the network, the more small cell technology works for us. And the cost trade off that we expected prior to the last auction told us that we would be better off going with the small cells than we would paying the prices that were \u2013 that the spectrum was demanding.","At the Super Bowl last year we went in and built out San Francisco and proved that thesis was correct. We were actually more conservative than we needed to be. The Boston effort that we've got underway now will further solidify that opinion.","And then as we densify the network for 4G, it sets us up perfectly for deploying 5G with the millimeter wave technology. So we're extremely pleased that the FCC approved the XO lease arrangement yesterday, because now we have a clear field in front of us to not only densify with 4G, but use that same capital dollar to get the infrastructure in place for 5G. So we think we're in a very strong competitive position here.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, David, on the second part on the 2017 numbers. Yes, GDP revenue growth for 2017. And we've done a lot of work behind this obviously. What we've talked about around service revenue plays a big factor in this and the comps year over year.","But we believe some of these other things start to \u2013 really start to generate some top-line revenue, like IoT, 25% year-over-year growth rate now. We see that accelerating. Tablets, we believe once we get through the churn headwind of the free promo, they will become a bigger contributing factor next year. So there's a lot of things that go into that. But we're pretty confident on that GDP growth.","And then on the bottom line, all I've said \u2013 I've never again a percentage. But all I've said is a normal growth rate for Verizon. And what that means is exclude the last 2 prior years, where we bought Vodafone and got a 10% increment over our normal growth rate. And then of course the prior year, which was impacted by the EIP accounting. So that's all I've said. And we'll talk more about that when we get to the first quarter of next year.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tori, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, it's Phil. So first of all, can you help us understand the progress on the 5G trials? What are you learning about the cost of deployment? Usable distances and speeds?","And then, Fran, you mentioned tablets are slower, but you do expect a rebound once churn falls away. Do these add value? Is it mostly just sort of tacking on and pulling those customers in more tightly? Or do they actually add value economically on their own? Thanks.","Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'll take the first part again on 5G. What we've had so far, Phil, is we've got a big deployment down in Dallas working with Ericsson and Nokia. We've got several in New Jersey and some down in Virginia.","We've typically seen speeds above 1 gigabit over, let's just say, 500 yards or less, because of the confined space that we've got available to us. With that sort of speed we've been able to put up six ultra high definition TVs, six virtually reality units, numerous tablets, et cetera. So and those services are only drawing in the 300 megs to 400 megs of throughput. So lots of head room.","Now the process we're moving into now is actually going out into a field environment, where we can cover a 200 home development. And see with normal vegetation, with difference in weather patterns where we think these critical parameters are going to go.","Theoretically, looks, 1,000 meters or so between cell sites seems to be reasonable. But again we've got to verify that. We're going to go into some rural environments to see whether that propagation changes based on demand. We'll know a lot more as we go along.","From a pure cost perspective, again I think it's a little too early to tell. But what I'll tell you is about half of our cost to deploy Fios is in the home today. And the next biggest thing outside the home is the drop.","And so our take is that with the router roughly costing the same \u2013 and remember we wouldn't have to have an ONT as we think about it today. So as the \u2013 when we deploy 4G and densify, that small cell can contain 5G for very little incremental cost. And with the router in the house being probably less than an ONT and router combination today, and losing the wiring in the house and losing the drop, we expect there to be a significant cost reduction.","But we'll know a lot more as we finish these trials. And I fully expect that as we wrap these trials up, we'll actually be bringing some analysts and some of media to the field to take a look at these deployments, so that you can judge for yourself. Fran?","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then, Phil, on second part on tablets. So absolutely we view as tablets as adding value. So traditionally you would say, well a tablet that's added to a Wireless account just gives you a minimal amount of access revenue. And that's far less than a smartphone. And all that is true.","But if you look at the entire ecosystem that we're developing here, more people who have tablets, we know watch more video on a tablet. And if you think about what Lowell outlined on our whole video strategy, along with go90, AOL, Yahoo coming into the portfolio fold, we're trying to drive more usage into these devices. And we want those users to consume our content, which then ultimately drives advertising. So we're looking at the value of these instruments if you will more from a holistic standpoint.","So yes. I mean today it's 11.4% of the base. I still believe that there is a huge growth opportunity here in the base with tablets and where technology is going. And that's going to generate not only access revenue on the Wireless side of the house, but it's also going to generate a lot of, if you will, media co type revenue for the future portfolio of digital advertising.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. I understand. Thanks, Fran.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Tori, if you can tee up the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Two if I may. Just following up on Phil's point. Lowell, you mentioned doing in Boston into other cities. Can I just explore that a little bit? Are you talking in your franchise footprint, your Wireline footprint, or going outside of that? Because I guess the logical next question would be outside of that, how do you work with the incumbents there if you're kind of trying to cannibalize their main business?","And then secondly, if you can offer any question \u2013 or commentary on FirstNet? If you guys are there? And any thoughts on that? Thanks a lot.","Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. First on the cities, Jennifer. Well absolutely there's no boundary here on our Wireline footprint. Obviously, we have a stronger position in the Washington to Boston corridor. We can move to market more quickly. But we don't view that as a barrier at all.","And in fact we are talking to other cities. And I mentioned San Francisco, because we made a huge deployment with the Super Bowl. And we're going to leverage that in our work with them. But there's no boundary.","Now as far as cannibalization, there's an awful lot of dark fiber providers out there. And we've had a lot of discussions with them. And they're very happy to sell. And they've got very good footprints that get deep into some of these networks.","As I mentioned, we've obviously just purchased XO, 40 metro fiber rings, which get us into a very strong position. And there's companies out there like XO. So we don't view any issue there.","As far as FirstNet, under federal contracting rules we really can't comment about that while there's an RFP in process. So I'm sorry. I can't make any comment there.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Jennifer, thank you. Next question, Tori?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking the question. Lowell, early on you started off talking about the importance of network. It's interesting, investors have increasingly been asking whether networks really are sufficiently differentiated versus what we've been accustomed to. And of course some of your competitors are arguing that actually there is not a lot of differentiation anymore and people should be more focused on things like price. So I was hoping we could come back to that.","And then just if we think about the evolution of how you've differentiated, it used to be you differentiated on the reliability of voice. More recently it's been the reliability of data and data speeds. Where is the battleground shifting? And how are you going to make sure you continue to be differentiated based on where that's going?","Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Brett, thanks. I think since we started with the original network reliability message back in 2000, those that weren't number one have constantly said networks don't matter. And customers have voted that networks do matter. And all you have to do is look at the churn.","And I'd argue that if you need to sell your product at half of what Verizon sells theirs, that's proof alone that networks matter, if you have to take that sort of a haircut. I know it's shocking, but occasionally advertisements are out there that aren't completely truthful. But that's the world that we live in.","As far as differentiation, as we say around the business, I think we've said this in other \u2013 I don't think it's made it to an ad yet, but, \"Can you hear me now?\" has really moved to, \"Can you see me now?\" And that's because we've moved away from voice being a channel and an application by itself on these networks to, it just rides the data stream.","And so the throughputs, the latency, that's where the battleground shifts. And how we stay ahead is by densifying the 4G LTE network, but then driving very hard to 5G. Because we've seen this time and time again throughout the history of Verizon \u2013 and I'd argue throughout the history of Wireless \u2013 is if you build it, they'll come. And the more we build, the more speeds that we deliver, the more ubiquitous the network is, the customers just soak up that broadband capacity.","Verizon has always been the one that is pushing the envelope here. And we continue to do that. So I hope everyone on the call sees that by aggressively moving to densification and then using that same infrastructure to build out 5G, Verizon is going to stay on the leading edge for the next decade.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tori, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thank you. Two quick questions if I could. Lowell, can you talk about the FCC's Privacy NPRM and what could be significantly stricter rules for ISPs, like Verizon, relative to edge providers like Google or Facebook? Did that impact your thinking about what you could pay for Yahoo and how you monetize Yahoo in any way?","And then second, just a more tactical question. Can you talk about the Fios installation backlogs coming out of the work stoppage and what we can expect with some rebound there?","Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, good morning, Craig. So on the FCC Privacy NPRM \u2013 and I'd also apply this to the set top box side. We're not a big fan of regulation in general. We'd rather let the markets work. But if there's going to be regulation, then we think it ought to be for all the players in the ecosystem.","And I know \u2013 and I've talked with Tom Wheeler. And I have great respect for what he's doing. He's only got so many tools in his toolbox to help set some of the standards here. But we're encouraging a broader action here that might involve the FTC or others, so that everyone in the ecosystem is treated the same. And I think that's our philosophy on set top box. That's our philosophy on privacy.","Did it impact us on Yahoo? No, not particularly. We look at that as a standalone business. Certainly the regulatory environment always enters into your thinking. But we would do Yahoo regardless of however that NPRM turns out. And we think it's going to be a dynamic business for us going forward. So I hope that helps.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Yeah, thank you.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then, Craig, on the Fios installation backlogs. Yes, obviously coming out of the \u2013 when we settled with the representative employees, there was a large backlog. I would tell you as we sit here right now today, that backlog is down to a normal.","But I would say that in my prepared remarks I said we would get back to a normal growth in the third quarter. But I'll caveat that comment let's say that, look, during the strike we discontinued old advertising. And it takes about 60 days to 90 days to ramp that back up. So albeit the third quarter will be a more positive quarter for us, it probably won't be as much as a normal third quarter for us. So a little less than norm. And then we feel that we'll be back in stride by fourth quarter. So that kind of lays the land of how we think about Fios backlog and installation going forward.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks, Fran.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tori, we have time for one last question. If you can place that through.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Fran, between 5G and if you look at platform and solutions, how much could this drive your overall revenue growth in 2018, 2019? Is this enough to drive almost all the GDP-like growth that you're looking for?","And just maybe on the platform side, can you talk about what partners really like most about the platform and what else you're looking to do to it to kind of make it unique to attract more content partners? Thanks.","Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I'll let Fran take the first part there, Tim. So the second part, I assume you're assuming Yahoo. Right?","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Correct, sorry. And AOL, yeah.","Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So look, I think the items that I mentioned around the sports, finance, and news are really the big items there. If you look at Tim's numbers, he's in the hundreds of millions of users. Yahoo is well over a billion users. So you start putting those numbers together, and there's some significant reach here.","I think every content provider \u2013 and I think it's fair to say whether you're an advocate for the 300 channel bundle or over-the-top, you realize that this is moving more and more toward digital distribution. And the partnership of AOL and Yahoo gives them the ability to reach those specific customers.","If you look at our purchase of Complex, Complex has more visitors per month now than ESPN does in that male millennial. And AwesomenessTV has those same sort of numbers for female millennials.","So it gives, whether you're thinking you're part of a large network, sports distribution or you're the actual league or you're trying to deliver finance or other news, being able to tap into that is a huge opportunity. The big advertisers have come to us, saying that they have more ads to place than they have good places to put them. And so you will hear from us over the next several months some partnerships and some agreements to place ads with us.","And then the final probably obvious one to everyone, but we have 113.2 million mobile users. And people are accessing all of this content via their mobile device. And we'll be one of the few that can deliver advertising and content across the home, across the mobile device, and across the Internet. And we think that puts us in a very strong position.","Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then, Tim, on the second part of this, I can honestly tell you that within the comments I made, there is actually nothing related to 5G as far as revenue goes. And the reason for that is, is because we looked at 2017 as a development year for 5G. By the time that we get the licenses \u2013 now we got a great ruling yesterday by the FCC on allowing us to use the leases. So that could accelerate some of that.","But I will tell you to get to a commercial launch and actually start to generate revenue, I think that will come in either very late 2017 or early 2018. But there is nothing in the forecast right now based on the guidance I gave.","Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. That's all the time for questions. But before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back to Lowell.","Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Mike, and I'd also like to thank Fran for taking us through the results. And all of the analysts, I appreciate your questions. I wish we could have gotten to more, but Mike will be available throughout the day. I know we also have a lot of reporters on the phone, and Jim Gerace and our Public Relations team will be available to answer your questions.","Both Fran and I will be out visiting with our large investors over the next several weeks. So we expect to be able to tell our story and answer more questions on a number of fronts here.","I realize that it's been a long call today, and we've covered a lot of topics, both operationally and strategically. But given what we said last year about 2016 being a plateau for us on earnings and given the acquisitions that we've completed \u2013 obviously Yahoo the most significant now front of us \u2013 we thought it was good to give you this sort of an overview and update.","Before we end I just want to make sure we have a few points that don't get lost. The team is very focused on delivering on our fundamental operational execution. We continue to be a leader in network quality and customer loyalty and in financial performance.","On the strategic front obviously we're aggressively building new businesses with revenue and ecosystems that are expanding the industry and enhancing the revenue profile of the company. Certainly we don't kid ourselves about execution. We've been executing, bringing new businesses into the portfolio since we started this back in 1999. But just as we have in the past, we're determined to lead the next growth surge and create value for our shareholders. And hopefully after today you see that path as clearly as we do.","So thank you all for covering Verizon and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect."],"21418":["Verizon Communications Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks, David. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I am here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Fran goes through our results, I would like to highlight a few items related to our earnings. GAAP reported earnings were $1.02 per share. And there were no special items of a non-operational nature. This compares with adjusted earnings of $0.84 per share in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of 21.4%. As a reminder, the adjusted EPS of $0.84 last year did not reflect a 100% ownership of wireless for the full quarter since the Vodafone transaction closed on February 21, 2014. As we indicated a year ago on a non-GAAP illustrative basis, adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2014 would have been $0.91 per share if we assumed 100% wireless ownership for the full quarter. On this more comparable basis, growth in the first quarter earnings per share was 12.1%.","I would also like to make a few points about our wireline segment reporting. Our wireline results include the operations we are selling to Frontier until the transaction closes, which is targeted for the first half of 2016. Our consolidated balance sheet reflects the assets and liabilities associated with those operations as being held for sale. This is important because accounting rules require that depreciation expense not be recorded on assets held for sale. Therefore, wireline depreciation expense will be lower in 2015 due to the classification of these assets. The first quarter included a $146 million pre-tax benefit, which equates to roughly $0.02 per share. Going forward, until closing, the full quarter benefit will be approximately $200 million pre-tax or $0.03 per share.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.","Fran Shammo","Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in 2015 with an eventful first few months behind us. We continue to execute well on our strategy of investing in networks and platforms and positioning the business for future growth. We delivered very strong financial and operating results in the first quarter with strong cash generation. To review our active start to the year, we were successful in the AWS-3 spectrum auction improving our mid-band spectrum position while maintaining sound financial discipline.","As we stated on our conference call in mid-February, we are very pleased with the licenses we won and are confident that they will enable us to execute efficiently on our network strategy of adding capacity through a combination of spectrum deployment and small cell technology. Our early experiences with small cell deployments have been very favorable and we believe that the industry is making good progress on standards for utilizing unlicensed spectrum with LTE, which is already being tested in our vendor labs.","We also executed several value creating transactions that underline our commitment to extend our industry leadership in the markets we serve by being strategically focused and returning value to shareholders. We successfully monetized our tower portfolio in a $5 billion transaction with American Tower, which closed at the end of the first quarter. We signed a definitive agreement to sell our wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California to Frontier for $10.5 billion. And we implemented a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which resulted in an immediate reduction of about 86 million shares in mid-February. Final settlement of this transaction, including delivery of the remaining shares that we expect to receive is scheduled to occur in the second quarter. Collectively, these transactions provide immediate value for shareholders.","Now, let\u2019s move on to our primary focus which is executing our day to day strategy for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. Our first quarter results reflect strong top and bottom line performance. We posted solid revenue growth, high quality earnings growth of 12% and generated substantial free cash flow. In wireless, we had a solid quarter of quality connections growth and profitability. We had 565,000 retail postpaid net adds in a seasonally low volume quarter. Total wireless revenue grew 6.9% and EBITDA was up 6.6%. As expected our wireless EBITDA margin returned to more historical levels. In wireline, consumer revenues grew 4% and we continued to increase our FiOS penetration with quality customer growth. Total wireline revenue was impacted by foreign exchange pressure, but our continued focus on productivity improvements and operating efficiency resulted in EBITDA margin expansion.","Now let\u2019s get into the first quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total operating revenue grew 3.8% in the first quarter continuing our consistent top line growth trend. If we excluded the first quarter 2014 revenues from the public sector business we sold, the comparable growth rate would have been 4.2%. Our consolidated revenue growth continues to be driven by wireless and FiOS. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics continue to emerge and grow. In the first quarter these revenues totaled approximately $150 million, an increase of 25%. We continue to build upon our Internet of Things and video platforms. In particular innovation within the transportation industry presents a great opportunity for us.","Through Verizon telematics we are already providing a platform of manufacturer, aftermarket and fleet services through two-way broadband connectivity to vehicle. Additionally, we will be launching Verizon Vehicle, our direct to consumer aftermarket product which modernizes traditional roadside assistance and enhances driver safety and convenience. In terms of video we are on track to launch our mobile first OTT video product this summer and we have already announced some initial content partners. We are excited about these new growth opportunities which you will hear more about during the year. In addition to top line growth, we continue to focus on process and operating efficiencies and improving our cost structure. Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion in the quarter, up 5.8% and our EBITDA margin expanded by 60 basis points on an adjusted basis to 37.4%. As Mike indicated, we reported $1.02 in earnings per share in the quarter for a comparable growth rate of about 12%. So we are off to a strong start from an earnings perspective.","Let\u2019s turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 5. Consistent with capital allocation model, we have been executing in the last several years, our priorities are to invest in our networks through capital spending and spectrum acquisitions, return value to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. Our strong cash flows enable us to execute on this investment strategy, pay competitive dividends and de-lever the balance sheet. The monetization of our tower portfolio enabled us to execute the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program.","In the first quarter, cash flows from operations totaled $10.2 billion. This included approximately $2.4 billion related to the tower monetization transaction which is non-recurring. The remaining portion of the $5 billion of cash proceeds is reflected in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement. We also securitized the portion of our wireless equipment installment receivables and received $1.3 billion in cash proceeds during the quarter. Free cash flow excluding the tower proceeds totaled about $4.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $3.7 billion in the quarter. Although spending was slightly lower in the first quarter, we expect 2015 capital expenditures to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion.","In wireless we continue investing to proactively stay ahead of demand. In the first quarter, wireless CapEx totaled $2.4 billion. As we have previously stated, our capital investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS spectrum in addition to utilizing small cell technology in building solutions and distributed antenna systems. We are also beginning to refarm our 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G EVDO to 4G LTE in select markets. Despite what others claim about certain network metrics, we are consistently acknowledged as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent performance and continue to be the largest and most reliable 4G LTE network in the nation.","Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. Our financial de-leveraging plan had always assumed the purchase of new spectrum. In the first quarter, we paid the remaining balance of $9.5 billion for the AWS-3 licenses we won in the auction. During the past six months, we have been very active in the debt capital markets managing our maturities and taking advantage of the interest rate environment. We ended the quarter with $113.4 billion of gross debt, net debt of $109 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5 times. We are on track with the plans to de-lever and remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.","Now, let\u2019s move into a review of the segments starting with wireless on Slide 6. Our wireless strategy is to provide the best customer experience while continuing to invest in our network to stay ahead of accelerating demand and higher customer usage. Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total wireless operating revenues were $22.3 billion in the first quarter, up 6.9%. Total service revenue of $17.9 billion declined 0.4%. Keep in mind that lower service revenue from Edge customers have shifted to equipment revenue. Service revenue plus Edge installment billings were up 3.1%.","During the quarter, customer demand for our Edge equipment installment plan continued to increase. The percentage of phone activations on the Edge program was about 39% compared with about 25% in the fourth quarter. We expect the percentage of phone activations on Edge to increase in the second quarter as we are currently running near 50%. Edge phone activations totaled $3.4 million in the quarter and we now have an Edge phone base of $10 million, representing 11.7% of our postpaid phone base.","In terms of profitability, we generated $10 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 6.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 55.8%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. As customer acceptance of equipment installment plans evolves and the percentage of Edge adoption increases, equipment revenue is increasing. Therefore, you should look at EBIT margin on total wireless revenue rather than wireless service revenue. On this basis, our EBITDA margin on total wireless revenue was 44.8% in the quarter, which was similar to a year ago.","Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with $108.6 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.5% to $102.6 million and our prepaid connections totaled $5.9 million. As expected, first quarter seasonality resulted in lower volumes. Postpaid gross additions were $3.7 million, up 2.3% compared to a year ago. A majority of the gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets. Retail postpaid churn improved both sequentially and year-over-year coming in at 1.03% for the quarter.","We are maintaining a disciplined approach with a focus on retaining high value customers. We are seeing good results with our postpaid smartphone churn less than 0.9% as compared to our basic phone churns at more than 1.2% in the quarter. Our retail postpaid net additions of 565,000 were up 4.8%. The quality of the net adds was very good. We added 621,000 new 4G smartphones and total net smartphones adds were 247,000 in the quarter. We also added 820,000 new 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds were a negative 138,000 as the smartphone adds were more than offset by a net decline of 385,000 basic phones. Additionally net prepaid devices declined by 188,000 in the quarter.","Let\u2019s now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 10.3 million in the quarter, up 4.4%. About 84% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We ended the quarter with 68.7 million smartphones in total, about 85% of which were 4G. Our smartphone penetration increased to approximately 80% of total phones. 4G devices now comprised approximately 70% of our retail postpaid connection space. About 86% of total data traffic is on the 4G LTE network. As you would expect growth in 4G device adoption continued to drive increased data and video usage.","Within More Everything accounts average data usage continues to rise, up 54% year-over-year. This is beneficial to us because increasing consumption of content will ultimately drive higher revenue with a lower cost to serve due to the efficiency of our LTE network. In terms of our upgrade rate about 6.5% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter. This represents a sharp sequential decline in the percentage of customers upgrading which was expected due to seasonality and the extraordinary volumes we experienced in the fourth quarter. We continue to have an opportunity to upgrade our basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices. At the end of the quarter we had roughly 17 million basic phones and about 11 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connection space. We also have a profitable growth opportunity with tablets. We ended the quarter with about 8.8 million tablets in our postpaid connection space, so overall penetration is still under 10%. Tablets provide us a good value through increased data consumption and lower churn at the account level.","Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 9. In the consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the first quarter, consumer revenues were up 4%, representing 11th consecutive quarter of 4% or better growth. Mass markets, which include small business grew 2.9%. FiOS now represents 78% of consumer revenue. In the first quarter FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8% driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products and some pricing actions. Our FiOS Quantum broadband service is scaling well and has a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, 62% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribe to a data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75 megabits speed tier. We are just over 20% of our consumer FiOS customers currently subscribe. We had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In broadband we added 133,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.7 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.5% penetration. Overall net broadband subscribers increased by 41,000 in the quarter.","In FiOS video we added 90,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.7 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 36% penetration. One of the ways we strive to improve the customer value proposition is by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. Last year we introduced quantum TV, Speed Match and our Quantum Gateway router. As part of the evolution of customer choice for video consumption, we just introduced FiOS Custom TV, which have been the last few days. The Custom TV option is a creative approach to the changing landscape allowing customers to better choose the type of content they want to watch. Customers will get a base package of pre-selected and local broadcast channels and choose at least two channel packs out of seven. This new option coupled with our traditional programming packages provides more choice, more control, and more value in an easy self-serve manner.","In terms of our ongoing network evolution initiative, we converted about 47,000 Copper customers in the quarter. For the year, we plan to convert a total of 200,000 Copper customers to fiber. We are also in the process of decommissioning 10 central offices. Post conversion, we are seeing improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower cost to serve. These conversions also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services from us. Our focus in 2015 will be to continue adding quality customers driving higher penetration in existing markets and generating profitable growth. Residential broadband and video are highly competitive markets and we will be disciplined and rationale in our approach to customer acquisition.","With that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, we continue work through secular and economic challenges. In the first quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 6%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure, the revenue decline would have been more in line with trends we experienced in the second half of 2014. The overall story is unchanged as declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in applications and services.","In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 3.7% in the first quarter. Healthy demand for Ethernet services continues, but revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than offset this growth. We also had a favorable, which improved revenue this quarter and which will not reoccur. Total operating revenues for the entire wireline segment were down 2%, which included the FX pressure.","In terms of profitability, the EBITDA margin was 22.7% in the quarter, up 20 basis points. Our path to a stronger and more profitable wireline business includes driving further FiOS penetration and continued improvements in operating and capital efficiency. On the enterprise business side, we are changing the revenue mix to higher growth areas like cloud, security and professional services. In terms of our cost structure, we are realizing a number of noteworthy process improvements and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon\u2019s Lean Six Sigma principles. However, we are far from satisfied and we will continue working to improve our overall cost structure.","Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. We are off to a strong start to 2015. From a strategic standpoint, we were successful in the spectrum auction, executed a tower portfolio monetization, and signed a definitive agreement to sell certain wireline properties. At the same time, we return value to shareholders with an accelerated share repurchase program. We also delivered strong operating and financial performance with 12% growth in earnings per share on an adjusted basis.","Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are in a strong market position with a proven ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. Our high-quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. We are on track to achieve our targets of at least 4% consolidated revenue growth, sustained profitability and capital spending in the range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion in 2015.","Consolidated EBITDA grew by 5.8% and our EBITDA margin expanded to 37.4%. In addition to our ability to deliver strong financial metrics, we are very focused on developing new products and services in the Internet of Things and video. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and become more meaningful in the future. Our de-leveraging plans are on track. And we remain committed to getting back to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so that we can get to your questions.","Michael Stefanski","Thank you, Fran. David we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Thanks very much. Good morning Fran. So, you had a couple of management changes in the first quarter, John Stratton taking over as President of Operations and combining the IT and network units, can you give us a little bit of color of any sort of implications, any strategies or anything that has happened as a result of that? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Sure. Thanks Simon. So, as we have moved into our next space as well has consolidated the operational performance under John. This gives us a better breadth of consolidation if you will post the Vodafone acquisition. And if you go back to when we did the acquisition, we stated that there were some internal valves that could be broken down and we could become more efficient. And with the establishment of Marni Walden\u2019s organization around new products and services this is where we are get into the Internet of Things and over the top video she runs Verizon digital media services and some of the other incubation companies we have. So the focus is running the day-to-day operations out of John\u2019s organization and streamlining, implementing Verizon lean six sigma and driving those cost benefits and efficiencies that we are looking for.","With Marni\u2019s organization it\u2019s creating the new products and services that we can launch to grow the future of the businesses. And then with Roger and the consolidation of the network and the IT organization, it just makes sense as we move into more software developed network areas and more the network is driven out of data centers it makes sense that Roger would take over the entire thing from an efficiency and consistency of management perspective. So I think what you are seeing here is more well organized within the company, more cohesiveness and more direct relationship between growing revenue and cost reduction.","Simon Flannery","Okay, great. So no real changes in the sort of cost trajectory or the CapEx trajectory?","Fran Shammo","Well, CapEx we have given you guidance of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. And right now we are staying on track with that. You should see that ramp up through the rest of the year and obviously coming out of the auction we added $500 million to that to densify and build out and that takes a little bit of queuing up time, so you will see that more in the back end of the year. And as far as cost reductions you have seen some of the measures we took at the end of the fourth quarter. If you look at wireline alone, wireline is down over 5,400 people from the beginning of last year. So continuing to streamline that business and become more efficient. And for wireless as John has taken over we are starting to see some streamlining around customer service and some the other things that we have talked about in the past. So I wouldn\u2019t downplay the cost reductions that we will realize in the future here.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks for the color.","Michael Stefanski","Okay David. Let\u2019s take the next question please.","Operator","One moment please. Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","David Barden","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two if I could, Fran on the quarter, I think the two numbers that really stood out to people were number one, the really low SG&A in wireless, I think going back for a model maybe the lowest percentage of wireless revenue we have ever seen, if you can kind of step us through how we got there from last quarter and what the outlook for that would be, it would be huge. And then the second big number was really the ARPA number, which I think stepped down further than people thought, that could have been related to EIP or it could have been pricing environment in the market or retention efforts that you are executing on, could you kind of give us the picture for how we got to where we got in ARPA and kind of what we can think about that for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Thanks David. Just a clarification here on the wireless revenue you are talking about service revenue?","David Barden","I was actually talking about total revenue as a percentage for SG&A, but either way was a really low number?","Fran Shammo","Okay, yes. So look, I mean I think that if you look at the service revenue and ARPA it all goes to the same issue which is as we start to elevate Edge and we start to increase the take rate of Edge and customers move, you are shifting revenue out of service and into equipment. So you are going to continue to see a decline in service revenue. You are going to continue to see a decline in ARPA, but I think what I would center around is what we said in the script, which was we grew overall revenue by 6.9%. And also if you look at the EBITDA margin which kind of normalizes out the Edge impact, I mean, not 100% of it, but if you look at a dollar of revenue and a dollar of cost there is zero margin. So, if you look at total revenue, 44.8% whereas last year at 44.9%. So, it\u2019s a very consistent profitability measure.","The other thing too is if you look at the Edge benefits, you are getting benefits from both lower commissions and so forth, so that is also impacting the SG&A line, because you are indirect before if you think about how that works. We were refunding the indirect through a commission payment for the subsidy of the handset that all goes away. So, you are going to see a decline in the commission expense line, which is impacting the SG&A line. But overall, if you look at the profitability of wireless and I think this is important, if you look at the service margin of 55.8%, if you were to normalize out Edge, the wireless service margin would still have been in that over 50%. So, the profitability of wireless continues to be extremely strong. And again I would go back to what Simon brought up. I would not discount all of the cost reductions and efficiencies that we are creating in the environment.","David Barden","So, this is a good baseline for kind of extrapolating the rest of the year?","Fran Shammo","Well, I mean, from a rest of a year standpoint, I think that the outlook is strong. I think that obviously as Edge continues to escalate, you are going to get some benefit there. We highlighted the depreciation benefit. But I think as far as wireless goes, I think we need to be careful here a little bit, because January normally is a slow promotional, slow seasonal quarter. As you go into the second quarter and you enter into Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day, I would expect that the promotional activity and competitive is going to heat up here. So, that will offset some of the benefits that you are going to see. So, look I think that service revenue and ARPA will continue to decline as the Edge rate takes up, but it\u2019s really about overall revenue growth and the profitability of the business and we feel good about that.","David Barden","Perfect. Thanks, Fran.","Michael Stefanski","Okay, thank you. David, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Phil Cusick","Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess first if I can follow-up, Fran on the Edge stuff, can you help us think about the high-end of the Edge mix given the distribution of where you sell this? What portion of your sales are in channels that don\u2019t have access to the Edge program?","Fran Shammo","Well, all of our channels have access to the Edge program, but obviously within our store channel, it is very, very heavily weighted towards Edge at this point. We are doing very little subsidy model selling out of the store channel and it\u2019s because where the market has moved. I mean, when your entire competitive environment is just advertising and promoting service pricing and ignoring the whole equipment side, we have to follow that in order to be competitive. So, the store channel by far is very heavily weighted towards Edge. Indirect is starting to come up as time goes, but also keep in mind the business channel and our enterprise channel are not really taking the Edge product. So, if you are asking me, we will get to 100%, the answer is no. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what that percent will be, but we do see that second quarter will probably be in the neighborhood of a 50% take rate.","Phil Cusick","Okay. And then second I like the Custom TV launch this morning, there is some controversy around ESPN and Disney, can I ask do you guys have explicit permission for this and have Disney and other pushed back since Friday to you or is this just a storm in the media? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Well, I think the right way to answer this without getting into too public about our contractual situations. Look, this is a product that the consumer wants. It\u2019s all about consumer choice. I mean, if you look at the TV bundles today, most people only on average watch 17 channels. So, this is a way to give consumers what they want on a choice basis. And we believe that we are allowed to offer these packages under our existing contracts. So, we will leave it at that.","Phil Cusick","Thanks, Fran.","Michael Stefanski","David, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Rollins","Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups and then a question. The follow-ups is first, can you just give us the ending net receivable balance for the installment phones and what that was last quarter? And then are you allowing for installment plans early migration on them, is that something you are using to get the take rate of Edge up? And then just a broader question I had if I could is if you could just address the larger strategy for wireline as you went through a quarter of monetizing some additional or announcing the monetization of some additional assets, what\u2019s your thoughts longer term for your wireline business? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Thanks Mike. So, on the accounts receivable, I am not going to get too much detail here on this call, but if you look at the fourth quarter to the first quarter with the securitization that we did it\u2019s relatively flat. On early migration on Edge customers, obviously we have an Edge up feature, but you must pay 75% of the phone off. So, if you decide to pay 75% of your balance off, you can upgrade at any point in time you want. And we do have customers who are taking that and edging up, but there is no \u201cearly migration\u201d other than what\u2019s instituted in the price plan.","On the wireline strategy, look I mean if you look at the three properties that we announced to sell Florida, Texas and California, they were more or less islands to us. They were some of the first properties we build out with FiOS. They are heavily penetrated properties. But the majority of those properties are still copper. And as we look at that strategically, when we laid this out, it just made sense based on the offer that Frontier had in front of us to actually sell those properties. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it other than the fact that they were not strategic properties, because they were islands, but if you look at the rest of our wireline footprint from DC all the way up through Boston, it\u2019s very contiguous. It\u2019s highly populated. We have almost 20 million homes passed now with FiOS. So, it\u2019s extremely viable for us to continue to penetrate these properties. And if you look at the penetration rates, New York is still the lowest penetrated market that we have and still has the highest growth opportunity that we have. So, we are holding on to some of the markets that we believe are contiguous. You will see more and more with wireless and wireline combined under John\u2019s leadership. So, there is more that we can do strategically with the footprint that we have and again it just made financial sense to return that back to our shareholder and bring that cash into de-lever the balance sheet. So, that\u2019s really there all is to it, Michael.","Mike Rollins","Thanks very much.","Michael Stefanski","Okay, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. The smartphone metrics continue to be really impressive. But as you note in the presentation about 20% of your subs still have feature phones, so I was wondering if you could just walk us through what is the strategy for upgrading and retain those subs, particularly because it seems that your competitors are continually targeting that base? And should it be reasonable to think that at this point in the upgrade process, we might continue to see some modest degree of net losses in the phone base whereas what we saw in the first quarter is just a seasonal factor?","Fran Shammo","Thanks, Brett. Well, I guess a couple of things here. So, we still have 17 million basic and 11 million 3G phones and coming out of the fourth quarter, you heard me say that we were going to protect our base. And that was a key ingredient going into the first quarter. And I think with the churn rate you have seen if you look at the basic phone losses on a year-over-year basis, we actually improve that by over 400,000. So last year, we had almost doubled the number of basic phone loss customers than we did this year. And as you notice, we came out with some strong promotional pricing that was targeted towards the basic phone customer and the 3G customer. Now, having said all that, look the environment is, is that there if you look at prepaid on a standalone basis, our prepaid retail pricing is slightly at a premium to some of the other competitors\u2019 postpaid pricing. So, we are in a competitive pricing standpoint. And as I said coming out of the fourth quarter, we will not \u2013 we have to be rationale and we will not chase every customer, but we are making every effort to maintain our base and keep our customers and upgrade them into a price plan that\u2019s fitting for them. And we made improvement in that. But I will tell you we still have some more improvement to do, but we are not satisfied with any losses. But then again, we will not chase every add either, based on just cheap price. So, I think that\u2019s the balanced equation that we showed in the first quarter.","Brett Feldman","And just a quick follow-up I believe in the past you said some of the small offices you have seen have generally been customers that were not as profitable, is that still the case?","Fran Shammo","Well, I think what I said was if it\u2019s not quite I wouldn\u2019t put it in a profitability perspective, but what I would say is if it\u2019s customer who is just price sensitive and does not care about the quality of the network or is sufficient with just paying a lower price, then that\u2019s probably a customer we are not going to be able to keep on the Verizon wireless network.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question.","Michael Stefanski","David, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike McCormack","Hey, guys. Thanks. Fran, maybe if you could just comment regarding subscriber quality, maybe add net add quality or base quality and just thinking about the credit scores within the base, the prime mix and obviously we are seeing a lot of prepaid migration into postpaid is what you guys are seeing with respect to that? And as a follow-up, just a comment if you would on the appetite for additional factoring, how we should be firming that for the full year? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Sure. So, on the securitization piece of the business, yes, you should anticipate that this will be an ongoing program on a quarterly basis going forward. As far as the quality of our base, I think the quality of our base speaks for itself. We have not made any credit policy changes. We have a very strong quality base, but there are a certain segment of our customers as I just discussed around basic, where we are trying to bring them up into a price plan that\u2019s meaningful for them. But if you look at \u2013 again, if you look at the lay of the land around price plans, as I said our prepaid pricing is a little bit of a premium to some other postpaid pricing in the marketplace. And as you saw this quarter, we lost 188,000 prepaid retail customers. I can\u2019t answer specifically where they went, but I would say that they probably made a choice to go to a price \u2013 postpaid price plan, because it\u2019s actually slightly lower on some competitors than it is with us on prepaid. So, I can\u2019t factually state that, but I think that\u2019s some of the migration, but also I would also say that on the reseller side, which we don\u2019t talk much about, we had a very strong growth through our TracFone relationship over 400,000 some net adds this quarter. So, it could have been a migration from retail to wholesale, but I do think there is a migration from the prepaid base into some other postpaid bases and I think others will have to talk to that, but we are not seeing a lot of that within our base.","Mike McCormack","And Fran, just how do you frame the credit risk on these installment plans, I mean, I am assuming you guys obviously have pretty tight credit standards, but if you see this as a risk for you guys on the industry, just I mean more and more loans out there for Apple phones?","Fran Shammo","Well, sure, I mean, obviously it adds risk to the balance sheet, because you are putting up a very large receivable now before it was just service revenue that you are risk add. And if you look at the economics of service revenue, it really is what\u2019s the economic loss to the company really comes down to what\u2019s the actual economic loss of providing the service to the customer. It\u2019s not actually the retail service revenue that\u2019s the loss. So, obviously, the cost of service is minimal. So, the loss was a lot less. Now, you are actually putting up a receivable that has a dollar for dollar loss if the customer does not pay. And again, we are very comfortable with the credit models we use. As I said, we really haven\u2019t changed our credit and we have a very strong credit base. So, I am not \u2013 at this point, I don\u2019t see any trends that will be concerning me on the outstanding receivable at this point.","Mike McCormack","Great. Thanks, Fran.","Michael Stefanski","David, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Hodulik","Hey, thanks. Two quick ones. First, following up on the video tiering, Fran, could you talk a little bit about maybe sort of expected sort of penetration that you expect with these new plans and maybe compare the profitability of these new services to sort of traditional TV subscriptions? And then from Edge standpoint, you have guided to flat consolidated margins for the year, but as you see the higher take rate of Edge and first of all, where that can go for the year, could that drive better wireless margin trends and lead to better overall consolidated margins for the company? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, John. So, on the video tiers look, I think it\u2019s way, way too early to start talking about what the take rate is or where the profitability. So, we will leave that until we get some trending behind us. Obviously, we have done this because of consumer benefit, give the consumer a better choice. So, let\u2019s see what happens here as we go in and we can address that later. On the EBITDA margins, look I mean I am kind of reiterating our guidance that we came out of the fourth quarter from an outlook perspective. And I think that you have to be cognizant of the fact that this is the first quarter of the year. If you look at last year\u2019s trending as we said coming out of the Vodafone transaction, our earnings profile would be more consistent across the quarters. We wouldn\u2019t be as bumpy as we had been in the past. I think that you have to look at the whole thing in retrospect.","And also the other thing is I would not get focused in on the service margins side and as I said I would really prefer as to look at the total margin \u2013 total revenue and the EBITDA margin. And if you saw the EBITDA margin was very, very strong for wirelesses this quarter. And that kind of normalizes out a little bit of what the Edge take rate is. And then again I also can\u2019t speak to what we are in for from a competitive standpoint on additional pricing moves through the year. So, I am kind of reserving on that side of the equation as well from an outlook perspective. So, on outlook and profitability, I would say reiterating what we said in the fourth quarter and more consistent earnings profile moving forward. So, I think that\u2019s where we will leave it.","John Hodulik","Great. Thanks Fran.","Michael Stefanski","David another question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much and good morning Fran and Mike.","Fran Shammo","Good morning Amir.","Michael Stefanski","Good morning.","Amir Rozwadowski","You folks highlighted that 4G devices now constitute approximately 70% of the retail postpaid connections and that traffic or LTE network handles about 86% of the total wireless data traffic for the quarter, given these dynamics what seems to be a rapid adoption of LTE technology, I was wondering if you could give us an update on your ability to reform spectrum in order to take advantage of the network efficiency opportunities. Fran you had mentioned that they are continued cost reduction opportunities that your scale provides you and any color there would be helpful?","Fran Shammo","Good. Thanks Amir. Yes. So I think that this is all point to where the future growth of the business comes from. I mean there is not many businesses where consumers want to consume more and more and if you look at it 86% of the usage is on the LTE network. And if you look at our More Everything accounts they are up 54% in consumption year-over-year. So, obviously consumers are willing to consume the content on their wireless devices which is why we were so optimistic around Internet of Things and of course over the top mobile. Now as you start to look at the densification and the efficiency of the network, as I said in my prepared remarks we are already starting to reap on the 1,900 PCS licenses in certain markets and we still have a long way to go there.","Also we are looking at as I said the LTE unlicensed which is a really good fit with the licensed LTE piece which will give us a lot more download capability in a managed network comparability. So there is a lot that we can still do around our spectrum and efficiency and obviously with the LTE network as you have seen with 86% of that traffic running on it with a 54% overall year-over-year increase the cost structure of the business really has not changed because the ability to deliver this on a very cost efficient network is there. So I would just continue to say that as we continue to grow on the consumption model what we did in the AWS spectrum in buying the licenses and our plan to build out and densify, I think we are in a very good financial position to execute on that in a very financially disciplined manner and continue to generate the returns that are expected of us.","Amir Rozwadowski","Great. And then one quick follow-up if I may, you folks have been consistent noting that de-leveraging the balance sheet is the priority for you. And as you mentioned it seems as though the approach you took to the AWS-3 bidding process seems to reflects that strategy, how should we think about your ability or resources available to pursue other assets in the market, specifically I am thinking about the potential broadcast spectrum auction or any material third party portfolios if they were to come to market?","Fran Shammo","I think look I mean we are very focused on our balance sheet and we are committed to de-lever and as we said coming out of the Vodafone transaction we had four priorities. One was to continue to invest in our networks and platforms, which we are, to buy spectrum, which we did to have a competitive dividend payout, which we are and to de-lever the balance sheet. And we will continue to do all that. As far as any type of strategic acquisitions or additional spectrum we are probably alluding to the incentive auction and I think that we are just going to have to wait to see what the rules are before we decide how we are going to execute on or around the incentive auction. So I think that still a little bit ways out before we can make that decision. But look, we have positioned the balance sheet to be able to execute on the strategies that we need to execute on in order to deliver the future growth and earnings of the business. And I think we are in a very, very sound position to do that.","Amir Rozwadowski","Great. Thank you very much for the color.","Michael Stefanski","David next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your questions.","Jennifer Fritzsche","Hi, Fran. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about over the top video service offering, I know we are going to see a more formal unveiling this summer, but can you just discuss kind of the news floor, what we should be honing? And two, as you go into that announcement, I mean, I assume it\u2019s more content announcements? And then on the packages you announced last week, should we consider this separate from the OTP or kind of a precursor of this integrated wireline \u2013 wireless model?","Fran Shammo","Okay. So, first on over-the-top video, as we have talked before you see us announcing some of the content deals that are in this, but it goes back to what I said before, this is all around having the consumer consume more content on their wireless handset through the Verizon wireless network. And we know that consumers want one content. We know what the viewership is and this is appealing to mobile content and let\u2019s not confuse that with linear TV content. So, I would not read into the Custom TV package as a precursor to the over-the-top video, it\u2019s not. These are two very distinct ecosystems. As far as the monetization model, when you think about the monetization, there is many different avenues we can do on this. There could be premium subscriptions. There could be pay-per-views using the multicast technology. There can be advertising model so that the consumer does not pay for the content consumption or as others would call sponsored data. So, I think there is lot of models that we can use and I hate to say this, but let\u2019s wait until Marni and team are ready to make the big splash here this summer and then we can have more discussion around what it means.","Jennifer Fritzsche","Great. Thank you very much.","Michael Stefanski","David, we have time for one more question if we can take the last question please.","Operator","Your last question today comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.","Tim Horan","Thanks guys. Fran, the wireless data growth is fairly incredible at this size and base. Do you think you have pricing power for wireless data to your competitors aren\u2019t really charging all that much for? Do you think that will change in the industry as maybe the networks get filled up, your thoughts? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Well, I think this is the great lead way into the over-the-top mobile. And it\u2019s developing more ecosystems around monetizing the consumption that happens on the network. Obviously, we are in a period of time where we see the service pricing dilution because of the installments out. And I think that will continue. And of course, we are increasing bundles, so more data for the same price, but this is no different, Tim, than what we saw on the voice world way back where we had a price and then all of a sudden everybody started seeing dilution on the minute per minute price, because more minutes were being given away in the bundle and we saw a little bit of access accretion, but overall, pricing was coming down. And then all of a sudden, the usage tracks started up again and revenue took a turn. And I think that\u2019s the piece that we are in with \u2013 right now with the data world, but the key to this is to develop these other ecosystems to create more monetization around customer usage whether that\u2019s premium subscription pay-per-view or advertising models. And that\u2019s really what we are concentrating on.","Tim Horan","Thank you.","Michael Stefanski","David, thank you. Before we end the call, I would like to turn it back to Fran for a few closing remarks.","Fran Shammo","Thanks Mike. Thanks for everybody for joining Verizon this morning. We are absolutely off to a good start to the year. We stated coming out of the fourth quarter that we return to historical margin in wireless and we delivered on that. We also stated that we would continue to improve the profitability of our wireline business and we delivered on that. We had a good growth quarter. We had strong profits and strong cash flows. We look forward to a very positive 2015 and we look very hopeful and confident in our ability to execute on our strategy, grow the business profitably, and invest for the future. Thanks everyone for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services.

At this time, all participants have been placed in listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with Hans Vestberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.","This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Now, let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the first quarter of 2019, we reported earnings of $1.22 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results including net pretax benefit of $96 million related to a pension re-measurement triggered by the Voluntary Separation Program. The net impact after tax was a benefit of approximately $71 million or $0.02 per share resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.20. This represents growth of 2.6% on an adjusted basis compared to $1.17 a year ago.","Let\u2019s now move to slide 4 and take a closer look at our earnings profile for the first quarter. As a reminder at the beginning of 2018, we adopted accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition, which results in a reduction in wireless service revenue, offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue and a deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments.","As we discussed previously, we expect a smaller benefit in 2019 than we realized last year from the adoption of the standard, primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction in benefit creates a year-over-year headwind to consolidated earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share. For the first quarter the impact was a $0.03 year-over-year headwind to earnings per share. This headwind is expected to continue until the end of 2020.","In addition as of January 1, 2019 we adopted accounting standard ASC 842 for leases. This will primarily result in the gross up on the balance sheet for all operating leases. Upon adoption we recorded approximately $22.1 billion in operating lease obligations on our consolidated balance sheet.","In addition, the lease standard affects our earnings per share, primarily due to the expensing of certain lease costs. As highlighted on our last call, we expect this impact to result in a $0.01 to $0.02 per quarter, headwind on earnings per share through 2019. For the first quarter this headwind was $0.01 on earnings per share.","As you look at slide 4, you can see that the 2.6% growth in adjusted EPS includes both the impacts from the deferral of commission expense related to the revenue recognition standard and the adoption of the leasing standard. This highlights the strong underlying performance of the business. Matt will take you through the details and key drivers later in the call.","Before we do that, I'll turn the call over to Hans for his opening remarks.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you, Brady. And welcome everyone to the first earnings call in 5G mobility era. Once again, Verizon has led the world in the development of new technologies with the launch of our 5G ultra wideband mobility network and the Motorola 5G smartphone.","We launched our first two cities Chicago and Minneapolis and continue to deploy infrastructure in more cities, prioritizing cities that have made it easy to build there. Our initial launches are performing as expected on a brand new technology being deployed for the first time in the world.","As more features within a network enhances become available for deployment through ongoing software innovation, we will provide increased coverage, improved capacity and greater throughputs.","For our 5G Home product, we\u2019re on track to launch additional markets when new customer equipment under the global standards becomes available in the second half of the year. These enable us to apply our learning\u2019s from the initial commercial launch in 2018 to a broader base of customers.","I'm super proud of what Verizon team has achieved so far and I'm pushing our teams for many more milestones and industry first that will give our customers the best experience.","5G has been a huge focus for us, but it hasn't taken away from our ability to enhance and improve the best in class 4G LTE network and superior customer experience. The network team continues to deploy leading technologies that improve our customer\u2019s experience.","We have 4G LTE Advanced capability in over 1500 markets across the U.S. and continue to be recognized by third parties for our superior network performance. Our One Fiber deployment is rapidly expanding the multipurpose fiber network outside our landline footprint.","This will enable new revenue opportunities in the large enterprise, small businesses, public sector and the wholesale businesses, while also delivering expense reductions opportunities.","We have ramped up installations to a run rate over 1,000 route miles per month, which puts us at the top of all major U.S. fiber providers. All of this is being accomplished within the current levels of our CapEx guidance.","We are now two years into the implementation of our next generation Intelligent Edge Network, which we expect to be launched and completed by 2021. We're realizing significant deficiencies and cost savings from our network transformation initiatives and expect the CapEx and OpEx benefits to extend well beyond their investment target.","With our unique set of assets including our wide portfolio of spectrum, dense fiber network architecture and software defined network capabilities; Verizon remains the clear network performance leader in today's marketplace, and we\u2019re best positioned to capitalize on all the opportunities that 5G will bring to bear.","Our ambition remains to provide the most advanced next generation network performance in the world. As I have said many times before, the combination of our Intelligent Edge Network and the 5G technology capabilities will deliver eight network [currencies] [ph] to our customers and open up a new world of innovation that will transform the way we work, live and play.","We\u2019re leading in the world in 5G, extending our leadership position in 4G, executing on the fundamentals and creating new ways to leverage our vast distribution capabilities through our network as a service strategy and focus our partnership and key elements in driving increased value for our customers.","Therefore, we are excited to announce we partnered with Google to offer YouTube TV to our customers wherever they want it and on whatever platform they choose. Our new partnership allows our widest mobility customers to take their YouTube TV with them on-the-go.","Our wireless 5G Home customers to add premium content from YouTube TV to their Internet bundle and gives our consumer Fios broadband customers even more options when it comes to content and services.","2019 is shaping up to be an exciting year for Verizon. We have started a year with a solid financial result for the first quarter, led by strong growth in wireless service revenue and earnings per share.","We're confident in the current state of our business and have good momentum going into the second quarter. I'm proud of the team\u2019s flawless execution in times of so much change and transformation in the company.","We have maintained our disciplined approach to capital allocation, focused on investing in our networks, supporting a consistent dividend policy, and strengthening our balance sheet as shown by our recently announced leverage targets. We\u2019re well-positioned to deliver on all of our capital allocation goals in the years ahead.","We\u2019re highly confident in our underlying business and go-to-market strategy as we now have moved to our new Verizon 2.0 structure as of 1st of April. The new structure positions us to better serve our customers and provide solution to their needs regardless of their underlying technology. We will begin reporting in the new structure starting with the second quarter results.","With that said, I will now hand the call over to Matt to discuss our financial results.","Matt Ellis","Thanks, Hans. And good morning, everyone. Let's jump in with a recap of our consolidated operating and financial results. On a reported basis, first quarter consolidated revenue was $32.1 billion, up 1.1%.","The primary driver of the increase was strong wireless service revenue growth. We are maintaining our full year GAAP consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage growth.","On a consolidated basis, first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.2%. This was up from 37.1% and includes the headwinds from the deferral of commission expense and the impact of the lease accounting standard that Brady mentioned earlier.","The growth in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to wireless service revenue performance, as well as continued improvement in operational efficiencies across the business.","Our business excellence initiatives have produced cumulative cash savings of $3.0 billion since the program started in 2018. At the end of the first quarter, we have completed the first two phases of our Voluntary Separation Program and have realized approximately $118 million of expense savings.","Roughly 60% of the savings in the first quarter is attributed to the Wireline business with the remainder primarily in Wireless. We are on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was up over 100 basis points versus the prior year. Last year's ETR included certain onetime benefits due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will not repeat this year. Despite the higher tax rate, we delivered earnings growth with strong operational performance.","Based on the strength of the operational trends in the underlying business, we are raising earnings guidance for full year 2019. We now expect low single-digit percentage growth in adjusted EPS excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard.","This is an increase from our prior guidance, which is a 2019 adjusted EPS to be similar to 2018 excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard. Our expectations regarding the headwind impact on EPS from the new lease accounting standard remain unchanged at approximately $0.04 to $0.08 for full year 2019.","As Hans said, we are moving to the new Verizon 2.0 structure in the second quarter reporting cycle. We plan to provide recast quarterly historical financial information for the past nine quarters, prior to reporting second quarter results, so our investors can digest the new view of our company well in advance of our second quarter earnings report. We are committed to providing transparency in our reporting in order to help bridge the transition to the new structure.","Now let\u2019s move on to the reviews of the operating segments starting with Wireless on slide 7. Total Wireless operating revenue increased 3.7% to $22.7 billion in the first quarter, primarily driven by continued strong service revenue performance. We are extremely proud of our results given the level of promotional activity in the marketplace during the quarter.","Wireless service revenue increased by 4.4% mainly due to customers stepping up into higher-priced plans, contribution from the strong net adds late in the fourth quarter and an increase in connections per account.","The year-over-year growth rate was positively affected by a number of factors. In the first quarter of 2018, we completed the consumer migration from traditional subsidy to device payment plans and we moved to a longer device upgrade cycle for business customers.","We anticipate that the impact of these two items will be minimal going forward and expect wireless service revenue growth to be within the mid 2% to 3% range for the remainder of the year.","In the first quarter, equipment revenue decreased 2.2% driven by the continuing extension of device ownership cycles. Wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 47.4%. This includes headwinds of approximately 85 basis points, primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard as previously mentioned.","Let\u2019s now turn to slide 8 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. Customer activity in the quarter was consistent with seasonal trends from prior years. We maintained measured promotional actions and our postpaid net adds totaled 61,000 consisting of total net losses of 44,000; tablet net losses of 156,000; and other connected device net additions of 261,000 led by wearables. Postpaid smartphone net additions were 174,000.","Phone churn increased slightly during the first quarter due to the competitive nature of the marketplace. Our postpaid phone churn of 0.84% was up 4 basis points and remain strong. Our superior network quality and our personalized offerings continue to resonate with our customers. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.12% was up compared to 1.04% last year. Total postpaid device activations of which approximately 78% were phones were down 4.7%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.4%, down from 5.0%.","In the first quarter, prepaid net losses were 176,000 compared to a loss of 335,000 last year. We continue to focus on high-value accounts and profitability in our prepaid offerings.","Now let\u2019s move to our Wireline segment on slide 9. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.9% in the quarter as the business continues to face secular pressures. Growth in high quality fiber products was more than offset by pricing pressures on legacy products and technology shifts.","Consumer Markets revenue increased 0.1% driven by the growth in Fios services. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 2.9% due primarily to demand for our broadband offerings.","Fios Internet net adds of 52,000 were driven by continued demand for our high-quality fiber broadband product. Fios Video losses of 53,000 resulting from continued cord-cutting trends as more customers are choosing over-the-top video services.","Our enterprise solutions, partner solutions and business markets revenues declined by 4.5%, 12.5% and 4.9% respectively, driven by technology shifts and pricing pressures as mentioned earlier.","Wireline segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 20.3% which included a meaningful contribution from our cost management initiatives, especially the Voluntary Separation Program.","Let\u2019s now move on to slide 10 to discuss Verizon Media Group. For the first quarter, Verizon Media Group revenue was $1.8 billion, which was down 7.2%. Declines in desktop advertising continue to more than offset growth in mobile and native advertising.","The integration of the demand side and supply side platform is complete and the team is finishing the customer migration to the new consolidated platform. We continue to enhance the features and solutions, making it easier to do business with our advertising partners, enabling us to create even more synergies across the business.","The Verizon Media Group team is focused on enhancing our super channels, driving revenue improvements in sports, finance, news, entertainment, home and mail by deepening our customer engagement.","For example, during the quarter, Yahoo! Finance launched live bell-to-bell video coverage which is linked throughout the family of Yahoo! brands for optimal viewership.","Let's now focus on consolidated cash flow results and the balance sheet on slide 11. Cash flow from operating activities was strong and totaled $7.1 billion, an increase of about $400 million from the prior year.","This was driven by the continued momentum of our operating businesses and lower discretionary employee benefits contributions, partially offset by the first and largest of three payments related to our Voluntary Separation Program.","Capital spending for the first quarter was $4.3 billion, which was down approximately $300 million. Our capital expenditures continue to support the growth in data room video traffic on our industry leading 4G LTE network.","The launch in continued build out of our 5G ultra wideband network, the upgrade to our Intelligent Edge Network and significant fiber deployment in 60-plus markets outside our ILEC footprint.","We maintain our full year 2019 CapEx guidance range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first quarter of $2.8 billion, up about $700 million.","Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to execute on our strategy. We continue to maintain near term maturities at low levels, giving us the confidence to operate effectively in various financial market conditions.","We ended the quarter with $113.7 billion of total gross debt, which was comprised of $103.3 billion for unsecured debt and $10.4 billion of asset-backed securitizations.","As part of our commitment to strengthening the balance sheet, we provided a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 1.75 times to 2.0 times at our Investor Day in February. At the end of the first quarter, our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.1 times, down from 2.4 times in the first quarter of 2018.","Our progress in strengthening the balance sheet and the continued use of excess cash flow after investing in the business to further delever the balance sheet has been recognized by the rating agencies with both S&P and Moody\u2019s recently putting Verizon on positive outlook for a potential upgrade in credit ratings.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Hans for a summary of our strategic positioning and goals for the remainder of 2019.","Hans Vestberg","Thanks, Matt. As demonstrated by our strong results, we have carried forward the momentum that we saw into 2018 through the first quarter of 2019 and our focus and execution in Verizon 2.0.","We\u2019re committed to creating great customer experiences as a result of the investments in our networks. We\u2019re extending our leadership position in 4G, driving innovation in 5G and expanding our high value customer relationships, while creating value for our shareholders.","We\u2019re building momentum for our ultra wideband 5G network, our launch of the world's first commercial 5G smartphone signals the beginning of an era that would transform the way people live, work and play.","Our strategy relates to foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network, enabling efficiencies throughout the core infrastructure and delivering flexibility to meet customer requirements at the network edge. We\u2019re excited about the current position in the marketplace, our financial strength and our opportunities ahead of us.","With that, I will turn the call back to Brady so we can get to your questions.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Hans. Brad, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Actually sort of two related questions here on mobile 5G. At your analyst meeting, you identified a key opportunity with your mobile 5G launches defending and growing your market share. And so, it was actually interesting to see that the first mobile offer was actually priced a little bit higher than your 4G offering and so that implies it's a little bit more of an ARPU driver.","So the first question is, as we sort of watch more 5G deployments going forward, what's success factor do you think investor should be focusing on? Is it going to be subscriber metrics responding favorably or ARPU\/ARPA metrics responding favorably?","And then just the second part of this and this is something Hans alluded to earlier, which is that some of the initial reviews of the launch have noted that this is still an early-stage technology. And so the question is, you know, when should investors expect some of the technical adjustments to be ironed out so that you can scale your mobile 5G offering in a way that will deliver a more consistent user experience? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","Thank you, Brett. And if we start with the mobile 5G, as we said before, we see of course an opportunity when you\u2019re early on a customer experience like 5G, you have a chance and we have high ambitions here to see that we can grow with subscribers. But again, we\u2019re very early stage on 5G. I mean, we are absolutely the first in the world.","At the same time, of course, we will see that we have an offering that responds to the enhanced, sort of technology and experience you will get from 5G. So that's what you saw on the first commercial offerings we did on the 5G moto.","We will soon, as well announced earlier, come with our next phone and that we're going to discuss or announce how we're going to deal with that. But, clearly, the team has high ambition in this area. We think that our leadership and experience is giving us a way to monetize 5G for mobility.","When it comes to the initial launch on the mobility in Minneapolis and Chicago, it meets our expectation what we have seen from the software. Remember, this - we are first in the world to adjust from all the way from the network to the chipset, to the handset and actually have an experience and we have a great experience out there, already right now in the Moto Mod.","Basically constantly updates on the software, improving the throughput, the speeds and all of that and features. And, of course, we\u2019re part of driving the improvements on 5G in the world and giving our customers the first experience.","So I would say that I'm really excited on what I've seen so far. It's meeting our expectations, but we have much more to come out from when it comes to speed, throughput, coverage and all of that from the deployment on our Ultra Wideband 5G.","And then, not forgetting that we also as well said so many times before, when we launched 4G, we didn't even know we're about carrier aggregation, which of course changed the whole game on 4G LTE Advanced, which we now enjoy more than 1500 markets on that, and that will happen with the 5G as well.","And one of the most important features that I have talked about is of course the dynamic spectrum sharing that will come during next year, where you basically also can use, deploy wherever you are with 5G and then you don't need to allocate certain spectrum to certain technology. So I see a lot of technology innovation and we work with most advanced partners in the world here to actually stay in the lead.","Brett Feldman","Thank you.","Brady Connor","Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.","John Hodulik","Great. Thanks. Maybe one for Hans and one for Matt. Hans, can you give us any early learnings you have on the - of the 5G home deployment? And I realized you\u2019re working with pre-standards equipment and expect that equipment to be available later this year. Can you talk about the benefits that you'll see may be in terms of capabilities, installation and form factor, when you get that new standards-based equipment?","And then maybe one for Matt. On the wireless side, it looked like the cost of service was a bit elevated this quarter and then have impact on margins. Is that all being driven by the lease accounting or was there something underlying operational issues that's driving that? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","If I thought and as you rightly pointed out, the first deployment of 5G Home that we did last year was based on our own proprietary standard and thus it was a limited [scope] [ph] and no development on the software. However, what we have seen is consistent speed keeping up 300 megabits per second minimum to our customers, which is great to see.","Second, of course, the installation times has been reduced significantly since the beginning. So we have a great lot of learnings when we come out in the second half of this year when we have CPs on the global standard for 5G Home.","And again it's sort of a multi-deployment, so it's the same equipment doing mobility in Home so with all improvements we're going to see on 5G mobility, it's going to go to 5G Home as well with the software.","So a lot of great learnings, especially on the coverage, installation times and then keeping the consistent on the speeds, which has been very good.","Matt Ellis","Good morning, John. So on your question around wireless margins so we reported 47.4%. But as you touched in on your question there was some year-over-year noise from the accounting both the deferred commission expense coming from revenue recognition and the lease accounting about 85 basis points on there, so that's showing up in both the cost of sales and SG&A lines.","But when you - so when you adjust for that the 47.4% gets you to about 48.3% so up year-over-year, 47.8% a year ago so nice improvement on the margin year-over-year, which when combined with the 4.4% service revenue growth means that we think we had a very good earnings quarter in wireless, high quality of earnings there and really setting the basis for the year as a whole.","John Hodulik","Great. Thanks guys.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Brad - thanks, John. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip Cusick","Hey, guys thanks for the follow-up and a question. First, Hans, can you give us an update on the 5G equipment pipeline and the potential timing for - and our volumes as well as the impact to CapEx pace?","And then second with leverage now in the low 2s, can you talk about strategic priorities beyond the current business? Can you envision making a strategic acquisition this year? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","So first of all, when it comes to the ecosystem of handsets et cetera, I think that as was alluded during our Investor Day, we see a majority of the handsets coming out next year having the millimeter wave spectrum.","Many of the phones as I've already talked about, meaning the Samsung phone both the Note and the Galaxy coming this year will both have it 5G. We have the Moto already. We're going to see also LG phone coming out. So we see a much quicker ramp on ecosystem in that area to be clear.","At the same time, the whole ecosystem from chipsets to equipment is ramping up quickly. But again, we are in the forefront of technology here, so of course we are being on the edge of the demands and the supply on equipment at the moment, but we feel good about that.","Secondly, the question around our capital allocation. We remain very solid in what we have said before. Number one, we invest in our business, number two, we see that we can serve the dividend our shareholders, and thirdly, then we have our targets that Matt talked about on the balance sheet. That's really where we have the main focus. Then we talked at the Investor Day, there could be tuck-ins et cetera, but nothing else in that at the moment.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Phil. Brad, we're ready for the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Matt. maybe you could just talk about the wireless service revenue, the ARPA was strong this quarter, I think you mentioned people moving to higher priced plans. So where are you on unlimited adoption and the spread across those plans? And how much headroom do you have on that?","And then perhaps on the network, can you just talk about the refarming of the 3G spectrum and where you are in that process, particularly in the major markets? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","Yeah. Good morning, Simon. So as you look at the wireless service revenue, as you see the 4.4% was - was a good result in the first quarter. As we look at that the ARPA was a big piece of it. We continue to step customers up to unlimited, which is typically a step-up in our ARPA. We continue to add connections per account, and we think we still have the runway to do so. Unlimited is still less than 50% of our - of our total connections. So there is - there is runway there to continue that, and that's why you heard us make the comment on the prepared remarks that we see, service revenue for the balance of the year continuing to be in the mid twos [ph] to 3% range. So continued growth on a year-over-year basis, as we look forward.","Hans Vestberg","On the spectrum, I think that first of all, the team has continued to do excellent. As I said, we still are gaining the majority of all the performance metrics in the market, so the team is doing good work.","And when it comes to the refarming of the 3G spectrum, we have said that's going to be ended by 2020, and we're on plan for doing that and the team is working everyday to see that we're doing that most out of our spectrum.","Simon Flannery","Okay, great. Thank you.","Brady Connor","Yeah, thanks Simon. Brad, we're ready for the next call.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Barden of Bank of America.","David Barden","Hey, guys. Thanks a lot. Maybe two if I could. Just Matt the - on the, sorry, the cost structure for the - the income statement on the dividend side, sorry, the depreciation side, we saw a step down of about $100 million there into the new year, with the big step up in kind of CapEx in the quarter. So if you could kind of address how depreciation is changing and contributing to the guidance?","And then the second piece was just on the media side and I guess, corporate and other. If we look at the combined number that we back into by comparing the segments to the consolidated total, it looks like we had a step-up in losses there.","Could you kind of talk about the profitability in that unit or if there are other things that are moving around in the corporate side, not related to the - to the media business? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","Yeah. So thanks, David. So on the depreciation and amortization side, couple of things in there. One, you've obviously got the impact of the lease accounting standards, so some items that would have flown through D&A, will now flow through above the line and so that's part of it.","The other piece is - is the mix of our spend over the last year or so has moved to a mix of assets with the longer average life, it means, they are depreciated over a longer time period. So that kind of impacts the timing of how they come through on the - on the depreciation line of the income statement.","On the - the C&O side, as you look at that number, you're right that there is a little uptick in the - in the negative results in that piece and where that's coming from, there is - there is two or three one-timers in the first quarter. They weren't large enough for us to adjust out, but net-net, they had about a $0.02 impact at the EBITDA line. So you see that flowing through there that one-timers. We - you shouldn't expect to see them through the rest of the year.","And so, you got strength in the overall results of the business in the Wireless and Wireline segments being offset by those - those one-timers that I'll say add up to about $0.02 of EPS pressure that's sitting in C&O. So it's related to one-timers rather than Verizon Media Group is driving that number in C&O.","David Barden","Okay, great. That\u2019s enough. Thanks, Matt.","Brady Connor","Yeah. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett","Yes, hi. I wonder if you could just comment on that - what you've learned about high frequency spectrum, the work that we did on the Sacramento market and then some of the - the press reports of your roll out of mobility in Chicago, in particular and then - and what some of the comments are - were yesterday from T-Mobile's, Neville Ray all sort of point at - at millimeter wave having real challenges for propagation.","I'm wondering how you think about millimeter wave in the context of your broader roll out at this point of 5G particularly for mobility? And - and what role you think mid-band needs to play in that roll out?","Hans Vestberg","Thank you, Craig. So when it comes to the millimeter wave, as I said before, I mean, that has lived up to our expectation on performance. And again, we're very early on in - in improving the software, how we can deal with it.","We will need to remind ourselves, this is not the coverage spectrum because we will do it as far as the economic is sustainable, of course. But still, it's - it's very good ranges we can come up with and of course, the throughput and speeds are enormous.","And again, we're very early on - on the - on the journey. I think that no one else in the whole industry knows more than Verizon about it. We're being onto these for two years and what we have seen on it, he said, it's a - it's a good strategy.","And topping that, which I've said before the dynamics sort of spectrum sharing will be the next step for us to see that we have all the assets to deploy our strategy on 5G to meet the different type of use cases, we outlined at the Investor Day sort of the mobility case, the 5G home case and the mobile edge compute case. So that's what we're working with everyday here to improve et cetera. So the engineering team feels good about it.","Craig Moffett","Okay. Thank you.","Brady Connor","Thanks, Craig. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Rollins","Hi, thanks and good morning. Just two if I could. First, if you look at the 5G roll out for the home, I think initially your advertising to offer over several hundred megabits per second of speed to the consumer and more recently, we've learned that you've been trailing in over 100 megabit product.","And I'm curious how that change in throughput affects the potential coverage in homes over time or the speed that you might be able to reach that initial 30 million home targeted that would accelerate that the pace of the roll out?","And then just following up on the comments around the partnership with YouTube TV, what are your thoughts on potentially exiting the Fios video business and letting someone like a YouTube TV or another partner, just potentially manage that video business for you, so you could just really focus on the broadband and the infrastructure side of the equation? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","Thanks. Okay. Rightfully mentioned, we started with the 300 megabits per second in our - in our offering in the cities. Of course, we have said that we will sort of meet all the customer demands and that's why we are of course, are trailing out different type of speeds as well. And as you rightfully said, I mean, if you have a lower speed and throughput of course, the range of coverage will go out and go further.","But again, we need to meet the customer demands in the markets, we're going to and - and the team with Ronan Dunne will see that we are competitive in every marketplace we go.","But of course, you can see possibilities, we'll have different ranges of speeds on 5G home as well, but we're not there yet. We will come in the second half of the - this year and see what offerings going to have.","On the YouTube TV, I think that what most important is that we are committed to support our customers with the optionality. Here we are creating, as we said from the beginning when we decided not to pursue our own investment in OTT that we will have partners in order to work out our strategy, networking [ph] strategy and give our customers optionality and that goes also for our Fios customers, and their You Tube TV will play a - play a role for us.","Brady Connor","Thanks Mike. Brad, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matthew Niknam","Hey, guys, thank you for taking the question. Just two if I could. One on wireless, I think you called out some pleasantness with the churn levels given the promotional activity in the quarter. So maybe if you could talk about what you saw in the quarter? How that compared relative to expectations and typical 1Q seasonality?","And then secondly, just to go back to the question on YouTube, what's exactly changing on the mobility side. Is just - is it just an ability for your mobile customers to watch YouTube on their phones or is there any sort of incentivization on the mobile side using YouTube as well? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","Thanks, Matt. So on the wireless churn, we saw what we would normally expect from a volume standpoint in 1Q with the typical drop off from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. We saw fair amount of competitive activity in the first quarter, and we really didn't participate in that until we got into the March time period when we start to see volumes pick up.","We feel good about the momentum we have in the business, as we exited the first quarter, as we come into second quarter and expect to see that drive performance for the rest of the year.","On the YouTube TV, I think is as you described and you heard Hans gives us the opportunity to combine that product with the core wireless offering and Ron and his team will - will make sure that's relevant to our wireless mobility customers having that additional functionality available to them.","Matthew Niknam","Thanks, Matt.","Brady Connor","Yeah, thanks Matt. Brad, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Colby Synesael","Great. Two questions if I may for - for Matt. The first one is on EPS guidance increase. Just curious how much of that you're anticipating coming from the operational businesses, so say differently, you're showing up in the EBITDA line item versus improvements that you're expecting below the line such as interest expense, taxes or other income I saw, for example, other income was $295 million or about $0.06 benefit in the first quarter at least that we weren't anticipating in our model.","And then secondly, as it relates to the savings from the VSP program, you mentioned the $180 million to date and you mentioned $180 million to-date, and you've - I'm just curious, how much of that or how much more can we expect for the remainder of the year. And I guess, as part of that where can wireline margins go for this year, would you anticipate them continuing to go higher? Thank you.","Matt Ellis","Yeah. Thanks, Colby. So I'll start with your second question. So as you think about the VSP savings in the first quarter, we said approximately 10,000 V Teamers, who are leaving the organization, as a whole around half of those came off at the end of December. So you had a full quarter impact from those.","The second tranche was at the end of - end of March. So really minimal impact from those. So as you think, when you get to a full run rate, it's going to be significantly higher than that $180 million.","2Q will be a blend. It will be more than the 5,000, but not the full 10,000. It really be 3Q when you get to a full run rate benefit compared to the $180 million that we saw in 1Q.","And as you say, more than approximately 60% of that benefit came from the - in the Wireline segment. And so we expect to see that continue to help wireline margins for the year, as a whole. So we think that - that will be something that will be a positive, as you think about managing the - the cost in that business to offset some of the trends on the revenue line.","In terms of the EPS guidance, so I want to just make sure that we level set, where were - where we were. We wanted to make sure we kept it in the same basis as last time. Last time, we said that the adjusted EPS before the impact of the leasing standard would be similar to last year, last year is $4.71. And so we said adjusting the guidance to be low-single digits up.","And to be clear, even after accounting for the new leasing standard that would put us in the - in the mid-$4.70s from an adjusted EPS standpoint.","And when you think about what's in there, you got the headwind from the - the lease accounting standard, you've also got the impact of the commission expense deferral under the revenue recognition, and our expectation of those impacts are the same, as we outlined previously.","So well, we certainly think and Brady took you through this in the prepared remarks, when you look to the first quarter results, we're up $0.03 year-over-year all in, from an adjusted EPS standpoint, that included $0.04 of pressure from the accounting. And in addition to that the ETR year-over-year was up about 100 basis points.","So that year-over-year increase in the underlying earnings of the business was strong. And you touched on one piece that's certainly the benefit of the Voluntary Separation Program was helpful in there.","But when you look at the Wireless business and you see the 4.4% service revenue growth, and you see the - EBITDA margin, when you adjust for the impact of the accounting for 48%, we feel very strong about the operational performance of the business on a good growth, on a year-over-year basis, and we have good momentum coming out of the first quarter, and as we head into the rest of the year. So that was the - the reason for the - the change in guidance.","Colby Synesael","Thank you, Matt.","Brady Connor","Okay. Brad. We\u2019ve got time for two more questions, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Mike McCormack","Hey guys, thanks. Matt maybe a -- just a quick comment on the wireline revenue side, how much of I think we saw from an FX perspective headwind? And then maybe if you can try to bifurcate between the competitive landscape versus technology migration?","And then, I guess I'll beat the YouTube TV one more time, just sort of thinking about and maybe this is for Hans. As you think about the synthetic double play economics for consumers, it doesn't appear at least on paper, but I'm seeing that there's a significant discount you're offering and maybe we haven't seen everything yet, but sort of like the rack rate of $50 a month for YouTube TV plus a naked [ph] broadband or stand-alone broadband product.","How do you think about those economics and how competitive will that be against current double play offers? And I guess also the risk of cannibalization of the current Fios TV customer base? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","Thanks, Mike. So on your question around the wireline revenue, there was a little bit of headwind from the FX, primarily in the enterprise space, but it didn't offset the ongoing pressures that we see from the technology shifts. So we would expect some of those -- those trends to continue, as we go through the quarter. We certainly expect the Partner Solutions revenue trend to improve versus the number we saw in 1Q, but still be negative on a year-over-year basis.","But we are continuing to expand the offerings that we have across the wireline business based of fiber based products and newer technologies. Those are continuing to grow, as we go forward and offsetting the decline in legacy products.","And in addition to that wireline revenue has opportunities, as a result of fiber build. We're able to offer our services to small, medium business, to enterprise, to even on a wholesale partner basis in geographies that we historically haven't. So that will bring some incremental revenue opportunities to -- to our wireline customer base in addition to what we're doing with new products, as we move forward.","Hans Vestberg","When it comes to the YouTube TV and what we offered in our initial 5G home launch that was sort of a stand-alone offering. This is what we're doing right now. We are doing an overall agreement with YouTube TV to be offered to our home and mobility and Fios customers and final commercials, we have not decided yet. But clearly, we will - we will do it - compared to the offering for our customers, but we're also creating the optionality for our customers to get YouTube TV.","And again, it comes back to our main strategy that we are focusing on doing the network, we're doing the platform, and we are doing the integration, but we're not taking sort of the investments of - of TV platform nor for the content.","We see that is our role in this - in this ecosystem. And remember we have the best distribution, the best network and a great brand and that's what [ph] we can expect partnership like with YouTube TV. So that's a little bit different thinking.","Mike McCormack","Great. Thank you, guys.","Brady Connor","Yeah, okay. Brad, we've got time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question will come from Walter Piecyk of BTIG. Your line is open.","Walter Piecyk","Thanks. Two questions. First, I want to go back to -- to Craig's question. Hans, you mentioned that millimeter wave not your coverage spectrum, I think that's a little different than - than what you guys have talked about before, so maybe we can talk about that dynamic spectrum sharing.","Can you talk specifically about what - when next year that would be available? Which -- which spectrum bands you'll be putting the 5G and are on in order to enable that for coverage?","And then, Craig - on the - going back to Hodulik's question on the expenses because I kind of got lost with all those numbers. I'm not sure, what you're referring to on the 42%, 47%. If we just look at network expense and SG&A, as your aggregate OpEx for wireless, it's up 10% year-on-year, how much of that is - has to do with this commission accounting and is this the kind of run rate, particularly on the SG&A side that we should expect going forward each quarter or was there some kind of one-time impacts on just the overall level of this OpEx particularly in SG&A? Thanks.","Hans Vestberg","If I - if I start with the first question there that I don't think we've changed any thing about what we thought about millimeter wave, how we're going to deploy that and we're deploying massively at the moment.","Remember, the majority of all the traffic is in dense urban areas, where we are now initially are focusing of course, getting -- an even greater experience for our customers and 5G experience, the real 5G experience. At the same time, we get the owners economics of having the best spectrum position there.","When it comes to dynamic spectrum sharing and which spectrum, we're going to use et cetera and when will come into play? It will come into play next year. Right now, we're in discussion, but of course it's going to be whatever low band you want to have, mid-band and high band that's how it works.","But all the time, all the spectrum will be sort of exposed to dynamic spectrum sharing. The good thing is for being a leader like Verizon, we can impact on own ecosystem, how this will be done and that's why we're in discussions with the chip set manufacturer and equipment manufacturers to have the best solution and again using the engineering skills of -- of the Verizon team.","Matt Ellis","Yeah. So, Walt, on the wireless margin, the reported number was 47.4% as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. There was 85 basis points of pressure from the combination of the two new accounting standards, but the vast majority of that pressure came from the deferred commission expense.","So as you think about the language we've used over the past few quarters related to the revenue recognition standard, you had the benefit last year. And then we said, you'd have year-over-year headwinds in both \u201819 and \u201820 until you get to a run rate on the amortization of those commission expenses being close to the actual cash expense upfront.","So about 85 points of pressure, a lot of that\u2019s showing up in the SG&A line, as you point out, and that will continue throughout the year to varying degree. In addition to that, we did have a little bit of change in shaping of the advertising spending in wireless over the course of the year, a little more in 1Q this year than last year. I expect that will equal itself out over the course of the year as a whole.","But the big impact was the impact of the deferred commission expense, so that's why we called out the 85 basis points so that you can get to 48.3% from the 47.4% and compare that year-over-year. And you see that wireless margins on a like-for-like basis actually grew year-over-year on an increase in revenue, so we think very strong quality of earnings within wireless in first quarter.","Walter Piecyk","Got it. I think the confusion is I think a lot of people look at margin on a service revenue as kind of a more appropriate way to look at margins, which appear to be down. So total revenue with equipment is - I mean, is your operating margins really have anything to do with equipment?","Matt Ellis","Not significant, but that's why we put the -- make sure the 85 basis points was in the commentary, so that we give people a little more transparency and do the comparison year-over-year. So hopefully that helps.","Walter Piecyk","Great. Thank you very much.","Brady Connor","Okay, thanks. That's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back over to Hans for some closing comments.","Hans Vestberg","Thanks, Brady and thanks Matt. Just to sum up, I mean, the 5G era is here and we are positioning the company for long-term growth by taking advantage of the full array opportunities it has to offer. I think, during the first quarter, again, we delivered solid financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace.","We remain confident in our strategy and prioritized led by building the best network, creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model, and creating value for our customers and shareholders. By that, I would like to thank you all for attending this call today and have a great day.","Brady Connor ","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."],"21405":["Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call January 24, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Michael Stefanski - SVP, IR","Matt Ellis - EVP & CFO","Analysts","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","John Hodulik - UBS","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson","Michael Rollins - Citigroup","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs","Michael McCormack - Jefferies","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Verizon\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks Tory. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I am here with our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides, including a supplemental information slide, are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.","Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are an on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.","Before Matt goes through our results, I\u2019d like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2016 we reported earnings of $1.10 per share and full year earnings of $3.21 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I would like to highlight.","Our reported fourth quarter earnings include a non-cash pre-tax gain of about $1.6 billion. The largest adjustment was the mark-to-market adjustment of our pension and OPEB liabilities, which was a pretax gain of roughly $1.8 billion. This adjustment which was primarily non-cash was caused by an increase in the discount rate as well as other planned factors.","We also incurred pretax expenses of nearly $200 million primarily related to severance costs under our existing separation plan. The net impact of these items after tax approximated $1 billion or $0.24 per share. Excluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.80 a year ago, a decline of 3.4%. For the full year adjusted earnings per share were $3.87 compared with $3.99 in 2015, a decrease of 3%. Recall that our 2015 adjusted EPS included $0.13 of depreciation benefit related to the three wireline properties that we sold to Frontier.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Ellis","Thanks Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. I look forward to working with our investors and all of you who follow our stock and sharing progress in our strategy to deliver the promise of a digital world.","We are in a vibrant and exciting industry. Our leadership position in wireless and fiber networks, as well as our loyal and high-quality customer base, is a reflection of our commitment to continuous improvement by our outstanding employees, which places us in a great position for long-term profitable growth.","The continuous changes from technology advances and the competitive environment will provide us new opportunities to evolve and develop innovative solutions to continue to be the key player in this dynamic market. I\u2019m energized by those challenges and the great team we have and I am excited about the coming years. My primary objective is to build on the strong foundation of this business and ensure we are always being responsible stewards of the company by running the businesses we have today as efficiently and effectively as possible, while investing responsibly to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value.","Let us now move into an overview of 2016. As expected, 2016 was a transformative year for Verizon. We demonstrated strong financial performance and returned value to our shareholders, while repositioning the business. Our core businesses are executing well in highly competitive markets, and we are on track with our strategic priorities.","During 2016, we completed wireline divestitures of three markets, negotiated new contracts with our labor unions, executed successful 5G technical trials, and gained traction in new growth businesses. Operationally in wireless with our network leadership strategy, we added 1.3 million smartphone net adds and maintained industry leading retail phone churn performance of less than 0.9% for the year and for seven consecutive quarters.","In wireline, we restructured the segment and its cost structure. Overall, we delivered solid operational and financial results, which I will go into in more detail in a few minutes. Our capital allocation was consistent with our strategy. We invested in adding capacity through densification of the 4G network, acquired Telematics, and Smart City businesses and extended ecosystems to monetize data traffic.","We reduced our unsecured debt and delivered strong value to our shareholders through the 10th consecutive increase in annualized dividends last September. Entering 2017, we are confident with our strategy and priorities to serve customers and increase value. The foundation of our strategy is a network that is ubiquitous and reliable. We will continue to invest in our networks, expand network capabilities and advance ecosystems to offer value to our customers.","The execution of these priorities will allow us to lead to the network layer and develop innovative solutions to meet customer demands in the rapidly expanding mobile first digital world.","Now let\u2019s get right into the operating performance starting with our consolidated results on Slide 6. Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $32.3 billion, a decline of 5.6%. Consolidated 2016 revenue was $126.0 billion, representing a decline of 4.3%. If we exclude revenues from the divested wireline properties and AOL, which became part of our operations during the second half of 2015, adjusted operating revenue would have declined approximately 2.4%.","Wireless revenue tracked with our expectations in the quarter as the shift from service revenue to equipment revenue across our base of customers is ongoing. Equipment revenue was seasonally strong, primarily led by new smartphone launches and equipment installment take rates.","Wireline segment revenues continued recent trends declining 3.1% with consumer growth of 0.2% for the quarter. In our new businesses, we are pleased with AOL\u2019s performance for the quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, our digital media business, led by AOL, generated revenue of $532 million net of traffic acquisition costs. This revenue was down about 5% year-over-year as expected due to the revenue lift related to the Microsoft deal in the fourth quarter of 2015, but increased around 10% sequentially in line with our expectations.","Organically, Internet of Things revenue was $243 million, up 21% in the fourth quarter. We expect to sustain these strong trends. Including acquisitions, Internet of Things revenue increased more than 60% in the fourth quarter. Strong cost management across the business enabled us to drive profitability, including offsetting the lost earnings contribution from the divested wireline market.","On a consolidated full year basis, excluding non-operational items, EBITDA totaled $44.8 billion, and EBITDA margin was 35.5%.","Now let\u2019s turn to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 7. In 2016, cash flows from operations totaled $22.7 billion, which is impacted by payments of cash income taxes of $3.2 billion associated with the gain on the divested wireline properties. Full-year capital spending of $17.1 billion was just below our guidance of $17.2 to $17.7 billion. Free cash flow for the year totaled $5.7 billion, which does not include the proceeds from on balance sheet securitization transaction.","In the second half of 2016, we shifted to on balance sheet securitization of our equipment receivables as it provides us a lower overall cost of funding. As we have previously noted, the proceeds from our on balance sheet securitization program are reflected in the cash flows from financing.","During the fourth quarter, we generated cash proceeds of about $2.4 billion from on balance sheet securitization for a total of $5.0 billion during the second half of the year. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the year with $108.1 billion of gross debt, which comprised of $103.1 billion of unsecured debt and $5 billion of on balance sheet securitization.","Our year-end unsecured debt balance was lower by $6.6 billion than the prior year. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.","Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments starting with wireless on Slide 8. In the wireless business, we are delivering a balanced operational performance in a highly competitive environment. Total wireless operating revenue declined 1.5% in the quarter to $23.4 billion. For the full year operating revenue totaled $89.2 billion, a decline of 2.7%.","Service revenue of $16.3 billion declined 4.9% for the quarter as compared to the 5.2% decline in the third quarter. For the full year, service revenue declined 5.4%. Overall service revenue trends are consistent with the postpaid base migrations unsubsidized servicing pricing. Approximately 67% of our postpaid customers are now on unsubsidized pricing, which is ahead of our expectations due to higher volumes in the fourth quarter. Service revenue plus device payment plan billings increased 1.7% in the fourth quarter and 2.0% for the full year.","This deceleration in trend is due to the strong migration of customers in the second half of the year to unsubsidized pricing as customers fulfilled their price service contract. We are also seeing strong migrations to our new pricing structure that we launched mid-year with safety mode and carryover data. While these plans have resulted in greater than expected optimization they improved customer satisfaction and retention. Recently we launched a single line pricing plan to improve our competitive position in that segment.","Equipment revenue increased to $5.7 billion, up 6.2% for the fourth quarter and 3.5% for the full year. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans increased to approximately 77% in the fourth quarter compared with about 70% in the third quarter and about 67% in the fourth quarter of 2015. We expect the first quarter take rate for device payment plans to be similar to 4Q as two-year service contracts are no longer available for upgrades by the embedded base.","At the end of the quarter approximately 46% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan. Improving the cost structure of our wireless segment is a priority. We see additional opportunities to increase efficiencies in our operating model through the continued application of our Verizon lean Six Sigma processes. On total revenues, our EBITDA wireless margin was 36.9% for the fourth quarter and 43.8% for the year. In terms of profitability, we generated $8.6 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, a decrease of 5.2%.","For the full year, total EBITDA was $39.0 billion, an increase of 0.2%. As expected, the equipment promotional activity in the quarter was elevated given the holiday season. We will remain competitive in the marketplace.","In the fourth quarter, overall traffic on LTE increased by approximately 49% while we extended our lead in the industry\u2019s third-party performance studies across the country. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.5 billion in the quarter and $11.2 billion for the full year.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. In the fourth quarter we added high quality retail postpaid net additions of 591,000 with a sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 552,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which are partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 456,000 net new smartphones.","Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 167,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net additions totaled 196,000, which was 764,000 less than last year due to lower gross adds and higher churn resulting from previous year\u2019s promotions.","Full year postpaid net additions of 2.3 million included 1.8 million 4G smartphones and 1.4 million 4G tablets. The primary offset to these net additions was net declines in basic phones and 3G smartphones.","Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.2 million for the fourth quarter and to 15.4 million for the full year. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in retail postpaid phone churn of less than 0.9%. Overall our retail postpaid churn increased year-over-year due to higher tablet churn to 1.1%.","Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.1 million in the quarter, down 1.9% and 43.2 million for the full year, down 7.3%. About 85% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. About 8.3% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, up sequentially and consistent with prior year.","During the quarter, 8.6 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Net prepaid devices declined by 9000 in the quarter compared to a decline of 157,000 in the prior year. We are seeing sustained year-over-year improvement in retail prepaid.","We ended the year with 114.2 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 2.1% to 108.8 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million.","Let\u2019s move next to our wireline segment starting with a review of our consumer and mass-markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the wireline segment, consumer revenue increased 0.2% and mass markets, which include small business, declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, consumer revenues expanded by 0.4% and mass markets declined by 0.3%. Fios total revenue again increased 4.4% in the fourth quarter and increased 4.6% in 2016.","Fios revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in the total customer base and strong demand for higher Internet speeds. In Fios Internet, we added 68,000 net customers for the quarter and 235,000 for the year. We now have a total of about 5.7 million Fios Internet subscribers representing 40.4% penetration.","In Fios video, we added 21,000 net customers in the quarter, and 59,000 for the year, and now have a total of 4.7 million Fios video subscribers, which represents a 34.3% penetration. Similar to prior quarters we continue to see strong demand for custom TV offerings. Our one-fiber initiative in Boston is progressing as expected and we launched consumer and business services to customers late in the fourth quarter.","We continue to innovate with our Fios platform utilizing our fiber assets and earlier this month we introduced instant Internet, which is a new service that offers both upload and download speeds of 750 Mb per second. This service was introduced in New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Richmond and other markets will see this service soon.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the wireline segment in total. Global enterprise revenue declined 4.5% and on a constant currency basis was down about 4% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, global enterprise revenue declined 3.6% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3%. In our wholesale business as expected revenues declined 7.5% in the fourth quarter due to the impact of non-recurring items in the prior year.","For the year, wholesale revenue declined 4.9%. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment declined 3.1% in the quarter and 2.3% for the full year. The impacts of the labor contract, workforce reduction and tight cost control supported improved profitability, while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. The segment EBITDA margin was 24.1% for the quarter and 19.6% for the year. We expect to see continuing improvement on an annual basis with seasonal fluctuations.","Capital spending in wireline was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $4.5 billion for the year. Regarding our pending wireline transactions, we expect the acquisition of XO Communications to close in the first quarter and the data center transaction to close in the second quarter.","Let\u2019s move next to Slide 12 to discuss our strategic position. Entering 2017, we are confident in our strategy and priorities for future growth and profitability. The foundation of the three-tier strategy begins with our commitment to invest in our best in class networks. Above the network layer resides our platform layer, which we are developing and creating new business models to monetize the ever-increasing digital traffic growth.","Our goal is to be the trusted provider of connecting people and things and providing scalable solutions and analytics. Network quality and leadership is the cornerstone of this strategy and at the forefront of our brand value proposition to our customers. Today we are in the largest and most reliable 4G network in the country with market leading fiber assets.","To expand our network leadership, we are executing on our strategic efforts to densify the 4G network, increased fiber resources and enhance spectral efficiency. As I noted earlier, we have initiated our next generation fiber network deployments in Boston. Fiber is an important element of our wireless networks as it allows us to strengthen our 4G LTE capacity, which also preparing for 5G.","Our pending XO Communications acquisition will add to our fiber footprint and provides us with additional metro rings in 45 out of the top 50 US markets. 5G wireless technology is a focus for us. We are now launching about 10 pre-commercial pilots across the country with multiple use cases including dense urban and suburban neighborhoods.","Our goal is to test the 5G fixed wireless technology in different environments in order to successfully operationalize 5G for a commercial launch. As noted earlier, we are expanding platforms and building new business models to monetize digital mobile video traffic on our network. In our media assets, AOL\u2019s content and ADTECH capabilities have enhanced our video offerings.","With a focus on delivering timely, short form versions of video clips we have seen digital video consumption gain traction in the last year. At the content and solutions layer of our three-tier strategy, the combination of AOL, go90 and other content has enabled cross-platform sharing. This strategy expands our distribution and revenue opportunity globally across carriers and networks.","We have seen increased usage in the go90 application through this exchange and we are expanding our unique content offerings. The average daily usage in go90 was consistent sequentially at about 30 minutes per viewer, with less than 20% of traffic surfed on the Verizon wireless network in the second half of the year.","We are actively leveraging our content portfolio and have strategically focused on an add-supported model. In 2016 through our joint venture with Hearst, we launched unique content through Complex Media and AwesomenessTV, and we are looking forward to expanding these offerings this year.","In addition, our extensive digital rights portfolio including sports such as NFL and NBA provide enhanced viewing experiences such as launching [stream pass] for Verizon wireless customers across multiple demographics. Our pending Yahoo acquisition will further increase our opportunity to scale in the digital media space with its 1 billion plus monthly average unique viewers.","We are still working with Yahoo to assess the impact of the breaches and we have not reached any final conclusions yet. The Internet of Things including Telematics, is an area of opportunity due to this rapidly growing as it connected world expanse.","Ubiquitous and reliable coverage to support the vast number of devices expected on these various platforms is a comparative advantage and we are developing this ecosystem to leverage our best-in-class networks while providing solutions of verticals such as transportation, energy, agriculture and smart cities. A great example of this is in the Telematics space with acquisitions of both Telogis and Fleetmatics, we became the market share leader.","Our Smart Cities Solutions continued to progress and the business is augmented with the acquisitions of Sensity and LQD WiFi. As a result, we now have a deep inventory solutions on our IoT platform to provide to our customers. Overall, we are confident in our ability to execute deliver results and return value to our shareholders while continuously transforming the business. As we look at our current and pending assets in the media in IoT businesses, we will be focused on integrating these assets by increasing global scale organically and further enhancing cross platform content sharing opportunities.","Collectively, these assets allow us to participate in the global ecosystem of the connected world. We see a clear path to revenue contributions from these integrated assets which will drive returns to the overall business in a less capital intended manner.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 13 to review 2017 priorities. In 2017, our focus will be leveraging our network leadership positions. We will focus on retaining and growing our high quality customer base in both wireless and wire line while balancing profitability in this dynamic environment. Enhancing ecosystems in media and the Internet of Things let by Telematics will further drive the monetization of our network and solutions both domestically and globally. We expect full year consolidated revenue on an organic basis to be fairly consistent without a 2016.","With improvement in wireless service revenue and equipment revenue trends, we also expect full year consolidated adjusted EPS trends to be similar to consolidated revenue trends. Additionally, we are targeting the following for 2017. Consolidated capital spending between $16.8 billion and $17.5 billion. Minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $600 million and in terms of income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate of financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 34% to 36% based on current legislation. We will execute in the long term strategy to position the business for the future. With that I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.","Michael Stefanski","Thank you, Matt. Tory will now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment please, we have the first question. Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, you may ask your question.","Simon Flannery","Great, thanks very much. Good morning. Matt, maybe we could start with the last point on the guidance. Can you just give us a reconciliation up in new guidance versus the previous GDP type growth and the normal type EPS. What are the changes they are causing that? And on EPS, specifically, can you just help us reconcile what the base number that you\u2019ll be using for as sort of a flat kind of organic number would be for all the adjustments with frontier and the labor dispute, etcetera. Thank you.","Matt Ellis","Thank you, Simon for the question. Good morning. So yes, let\u2019s start with the outlook we gave this morning. And I\u2019ll start with the revenue. So, as you saw for now, we said we expect to see a consistent with 2016 on an organic basis. And we continue to see the revenue trajectory of the business improve. So, as you saw in the release, we expect that to be fairly consistent on an organic basis. So, this is an improvement over 2016, when revenues decline 2.4% on a comparable basis. So, let\u2019s unpack that for a sec and see how we get to that improvement from the negative 2.4 up to something is more comparable.","And obviously, the major driver is wireless, where total revenue is down 2.7% last year and service revenue was down 5.4%. So, if we look into the service revenue component there, that trajectory improve throughout the year. We started in the first quarter of \u201816 down 6.2%, we ended the year in the fourth quarter down 4.9% and the year as a whole average down 5.4 as I said. So, as we expect that trend to continue to get better, we should see a better number year-over-year in wireless service revenue. Equipment revenue should also be higher given the higher device payment take rate which we expect to be similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter which was a 77%.","And so, obviously improve pending wireless, it will be the biggest factor year-over-year. And as you look at the other parts of the business, we expect wireline revenue trends to be similar, the 2016. And then Media Cover, we expect that will continue to build off the progress made last year. And then within the IoT businesses obviously included Telematics acquire a 21% in the fourth quarter. And we expect that business to continue to grow at a very healthy pace.","So, on a combined basis, we are confident in seeing a better revenue trajectory in 2017 in last year. When you talk about the how we gave the outlook on revenue versus what we\u2019ve been saying previously. I think the biggest light and you got to look at in there is wireless service revenue. So, we continue to make good progress transition the base to unsubsidized service pricing and as customers come out of their two year subsidy plans, we see them quickly migrate to the unsubsidized service pricing.","And we ended the year with 67% of the post pay customers now on those unsubsidized pricing plans. And so, while we were happy to have seen the acceleration, it does provide a head wind to service revenue. And then additionally, within service revenue we saw a higher level of migrations and then past pricing changes. To the plans that we introduced in the middle of last year and that functionality of those new plans appealed to our base. And we saw customers take advantage of that and not to might say a plan.","So, those two development especially have essentially pushed out our expectation of the timing of the service revenue to return to year-over-year growth from the end of 2017 into \u201818. And as then as you look at the earnings side of it, obviously the largest driver of EPS changes is what happens in the wireless service revenue. So, obviously the service revenue being $66 billion, more than 0.5% of our total revenue. It\u2019s largest driver and so that\u2019s we continue to work through that service revenue migration.","It is offset by the strong cost management we had across the business. And that\u2019s been a hallmark of our performance over the past few years using the Verizon Lean Six Sigma program that you\u2019ve heard us talk about previously. And that will continue to produce significant benefits in 2017 and will also see a full-year benefit in \u201817 from the new labor contracts. So, when you factor in all of the above, we expect to produce strong earnings again in 2017 and we talked about the trend we expect on EPS.","You\u2019ve obviously got the impact in 2016 of one year of the Frontier properties in the first quarter and obviously the work stoppage. But in total will be around the revenue lines. It will be around where we were in 2016 as the baseline of our view for \u201817.","Simon Flannery","Okay. So, just to be clear on the EPS. It\u2019s we should take the EPS that you reported for 2016 as the base for \u201817?","Matt Ellis","That\u2019s a reasonable starting point, yes.","Simon Flannery","Okay, great. And just one last thing on the optimization. Has that sort of faded at this point or is that still continue at quite a pace. Was that kind of a three or four month effect, are you still seeing a lot of that going on?","Matt Ellis","Let\u2019s say and that still continue but we saw at a certainly an aggressive pace. Initially, after we launch those plans, so that just means the base moved quicker to those plans that we\u2019d seen in other changes. So, we\u2019re excited we launch product features where of high level of interest to our customers.","Simon Flannery","Great, thanks, Matt.","Michael Stefanski","Simon, thank you. Tory, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Philip Cusick","Thanks. Just a follow-up first on Simon\u2019s question. Can you give us explicitly what the revenue number you\u2019re looking at in \u201816 sort of a normal number as well as the earnings number?","Matt Ellis","Yes, the normal number for 2016 would be the comparable against the down 2.4% when you adjust out for the acquisitions over the course of the couple of years.","Philip Cusick","So, all right. So, exactly the dollar number that we should be starting with as the baseline to build from.","Michael Stefanski","Yes, I\u2019ll come back to you on that one. As to say, we refer of the down 2.4% year-over-year. It adjust out for the transactions in both 2016 and also the AOL introduction in 2015. So, when you adjust both of those numbers.","Philip Cusick","Right. And I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m sorry, go ahead Mike?","Michael Stefanski","No, I just going to say we\u2019ll get to you that exact number because it is both taking out Frontier for the first quarter.","Philip Cusick","Exactly.","Michael Stefanski","As well as we do make an adjustment because we didn\u2019t have a full-year of AOL. So, that\u2019s how we get to the negative 2.4%. But effectively what we\u2019re saying is that organically that plus not including any of the growth for new businesses, that would be the consistent number, but we\u2019ll get you that exact number.","Philip Cusick","Okay. And then just to make sure, when you talk about better trends and it sounds like you\u2019re looking for stability. That revenue number you\u2019re looking for dollars of stability year-over-year not stable down tick in percentages. Correct? Now down 2%.","Matt Ellis","Correct. Consistent on a dollar basis year-over-year and we get that through seeing improvements in the trend on the service revenue trajectory, the equipment revenue trajectory. So, in total across wireless and then also the newer businesses whether it be Media Curve or across the Internet of Things businesses, we continue it to expect to see those the revenue from those businesses improve in 2017.","Philip Cusick","Okay, that makes sense. And then on earnings is it 386 that we\u2019re using as the baseline from 2016 to jump off into \u201817 or is that a different number?","Matt Ellis","That\u2019s I\u2019d go off with 387 that we had on an adjusted basis, adjusting off for the mouth to market another items.","Philip Cusick","387 got it okay. And then if I just add one more new one, you talked about the gap tax 34-36 how should we think about cash taxes in 2017 under the current legislation?","Matt Ellis","Yes, we would expect cash taxes to converge to all the effective tax rate during 2017.","Philip Cusick","So higher cash tax rate in 2017 than 2016?","Matt Ellis","Yes, the cash tax is just purely on income obviously, our cash taxes for 2016 did include $3.2 billion of taxes related to the frontier transaction, we would expect to have cash taxes in \u201817 related to the disposal of the data centers, when that occurs at a lower level, but on the organic tax on earnings we would expect that the cash taxes to be closer to the ETR during the course of \u201817.","Philip Cusick","Okay, and do you have any initial thought on what the different plans of tax changes could be, anything you can help us as we model out the different impacts from border adjustments and things like that?","Matt Ellis","Yes, so as we look at tax, we certainly, we\u2019ll be certainly, look it\u2019s a little too soon to tell, we certainly are supportive to changes in the tax legislation, we believe that we need to get to a more competitive tax environment and we look forward to working with congress and the new administration as Trump put new tax rate forward. Certainly a reduction rate would be beneficial, 100% expansion of CapEx would be beneficial initially, but the plans being discussed also include items such as removal of the interest expense deduction, and then as you mentioned, we\u2019re trying to understand exactly how border adjustable as it may or may not work, so certainly believe that tax reform would be a benefit to us, whichever year first it applies to whether applies to \u201817 or whether it initially apply to \u201818. We definitely seeing it being a benefit to the cash taxes we pay, but given the uncertainty on the specifics of the plan, it\u2019s a little too soon to say exactly how much that could be.","Philip Cusick","Can you give us an idea of within your CapEx and OpEx what other dollar number or percent comes from overseas and then I will stop?","Matt Ellis","Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve disclosed that number previously, so we\u2019d have to go back and look that back, we\u2019re not going to be disclosing that at this time.","Philip Cusick","Thanks very much.","Michael Stefanski","Phil, there is a reconciliation of the number of revenue that we\u2019re using in our financials that we released this morning on our website, but the number is $121.8 billion. So 121.8 would be the base for the revenue as we discussed.","Philip Cusick","Thanks Mike.","Michael Stefanski","Tory, if you could, next question.","Operator","Your next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Hodulik","Great, thanks. Another follow up on the guidance, Matt obviously there is a lot of moving parts, but with the revenue trends and EPS trends sort of mirroring each other seems to suggest a route to roughly sort of flourish margin, but you\u2019re leading the year with real strength in wire line profitability. So first of all if you can talk about what\u2019s driving that and next is that to continue that should we, that the margins on the wireless side, but on the \u201817, should be sort of flat to maybe even down and maybe talk a little bit about that trend specially given the help that you should see from the removal of subsidies in the year? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","Yes, thanks John for your question, so starting off with wire line, certainly wire line had a good result in the fourth quarter, I would tell you as you say it in our prepared remarks that we would expect wire line margins for 2017 in the year as a hold to be higher than they were in 2016 and you\u2019ll see some seasonal fluctuations in it, as we typically do, so I would tell you be reasonable to expect wire line margins with the year as a whole to be in the low 20\u2019s compared to the 19% that we saw for 2016. So we see a lot of improvements going through the business, there obviously we\u2019re going to have the full year benefit of the new labor contract through there and we continue to manage costs in that business very closely in-line with the revenue trajectories, we continue to see kind of similar revenue to direct these for the enterprise and wholesale businesses and are excited about the files business which was up last year 4.6% on the full year basis, for files revenues and we continue to have more open for sale properties there, the great opportunities as we head into \u201817.","On overall margins, when you talk about the wireless margins, this always comes back to where the service revenue trajectory is going to be. And so we certainly see improvements in the service revenue year-over-year, but we do go into the year off that 4.9% jump off point from the fourth quarter and we expect to see that continue to improve as we head into \u201817, but as I said we now see the point that which we get back to year-over-year positive number pushing out into \u201818. And so, I would expect us to have continued to a very strong margins in the wireless business but is going to be half of that service revenue trajectory continuing to be slightly negative though in an improving direction.","John Hodulik","Did you think on a net basis you can keep those wires margins flattish?","Matt Ellis","We will continue to aim to produce strong margin in that business and certainly believe that we have the ability to maintain a premium pricing in the market and we will, that will certainly be our aim as we go through the year.","John Hodulik","Great. Thank Mike.","Michael Stefanski","All right, thanks John. Tori next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead with your question.","David Barden","Hey guys thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could, first Matt, lot of focus on the guidance taking maybe $2 billion to $3 billion of revenue out of that number. It feels like something has changed on the ground competitively that\u2019s making you have to really get more aggressive on the EIP side and then the promotional side. Do you feel like Verizon needs to go to market more aggressively with an unlimited product like each of your competitors have and as kind of leading with these days and if you could kind of talk about kind of your view we all knew Fran\u2019s view on the economics of that but I look to kind of hear what your perspective is on the necessity that you do that and your ability to do that if you chose to?","And then the second thing just now with G price elevation to the chair I think we have greater clarity on the likelihood that we are going to be getting rid of the privacy rules specifically in the telecom also the opportunity to maybe more aggressively monetize broadband. Could you talk a little bit about some of the opportunities and actions that you might be taking right now to prefer kind of the next regulatory wave? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","Yes. Thank you, David. So I will start with your first question. So as we look at our market position it's based off the product offering and we have the best network performance out there which is a major criteria in the user experience. Despite the claims of others third parties studies continues to demonstrate the superiority of our network and as network leadership position, I will say allows us to maintain a premium price round service in the marketplace. So as I look at our service revenues plus installment billing so the total amount we are actually billing a customer each month I think increased 2% in 2016. So that demonstrates how often it continue to be competitive and resonate in the marketplace. We continue to constantly monitor the competitive market. We look for opportunities to compete more effectively. And as an example of that we have recently launched new single line pricing which we believe was an under-penetrated market for us.","So our pricing is disciplined to provide a return for our premium service. This number of different offers out there, we saw some folks go to unlimited. We saw some bundling of content and so on in the marketplace. We continue to assess where we are in there and so I will say I think our result we had 167,000 net phone nets in the quarter so I believe our positioning continues to be competitive. We constantly look as well out there. There is unlimited is one of the things some of our competition has at this point in time. There is not something we feel the need to do but I will say we continually monitor the market and we will see where we are heading in the future.","In terms of your second question, so look there is a lot of changes going on in DC right now. Obviously yesterday we saw the announcement that as you mentioned G pie and so that may have a number of impacts across the regulatory space but I think it's just too soon to tell exactly where we are going to be. We look forward to working with the regulators for the CFCC or others. The other thing I would mention though you think about that we make investments for many years given the nature of the business that we are in. and our investment are focused on just who happens to be in office today. We make an investments so that for 10 plus years and I think our records stands for itself irrespective whoever the administration is run by and the regulatory regime they were effective and that will be continued to be how we focus on our investment. So I will say we look forward to working with the new administration and the new leadership and the FCC and we expect to continue to be competitive in whatever we environment we are operating.","Michael Stefanski","David, thank you. Tory, if we can move to next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson, please go ahead with your question.","Craig Moffett","Thank you. Hi. Good morning guys. So I wanted to sort of step back to a bigger picture question if I could. Matt given the comments that you made in the press release about getting the balance sheet back to the pre-Vodafone deal levels, how much room does that leave you before 2018 and 2019 for strategic transaction. There has been a lot of speculation about the types of things that you might do in this new environment whether it's content, or wire-line or spectrum or none of the above. I wonder if you can just sort of give us some thoughts on how much flexibility you have and how you think about the various factors of opportunity for you?","Matt Ellis","Yes. Thanks Craig. So as you mentioned that we have been on this path to getting back to the pre-Vodafone credit metrics by 2018-19 and that's part of our overall camp allocation, we have been able to be consistent with investing in our networks on a continuous basis, making that improvement in the balance sheet and also returning value to shareholders and since the Vodafone transaction we had a number of activities that we have done whether that be AOL some of the other acquisitions in IOT such as Fleetmatics, we have also divested of business whether it would be the tower transaction as an example. And so we have been able to continually make strategic transactions while staying consistent to each part of that cap allocation policy. So that would be our intent to continue to do so. And as we head into 2017 we believe that we will out of the two, while continue to maintain that cap allocation policy that allows us to deliver on all three of those key areas.","Craig Moffett","And Matt can you comment on how you think about the various options out there whether it's content or wire-line or spectrum or something else?","Matt Ellis","Yes. So obviously look I am not going to comment on any specific combinations that have been rumored over the years and certainly I am - we are not able to talk specifically about spectrum right now given that we are in the incentive auctions. So we will continue to look for to opportunities to expand and grow the business. Although we\u2019re not completely aligned that we will be disciplined in any investment activity. We evaluate all options whether that's build by our partner for our strategic positioning and the key criteria is creating long term value for the business and shareholders. So we will continue to look for the right things to do to position the business to be successful in the future and that's we do that on an everyday basis and we will continue to do so. And I think we have successfully done that over the past few years.","Craig Moffett","Thanks Matt.","Michael Stefanski","Our next question please Tory.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup, please go ahead with your question.","Michael Rollins","Hi, thanks and good morning. Two if I could. First if you could talk about how the 5G business case is progressing from the financial perspective and Matt what are the key metrics that you are looking for from the key that's working on business case to facilitate a green light of commercial deployment?","Is there certain cost metrics like per home path or certain other metrics that you are focused on and then just if you could follow up on a clarification? So I think you mentioned that in terms of thinking about flat organic revenue for 2017 you took the revenue for 2016\u2019s tracked divestiture of market to frontier and you subtracted AOL. Can you help us think through what the backs have been on for the 2017 with the number of pending and completed acquisitions that you announced and are still in progress? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","Yes. Thanks Mike so let me start up with 5G, so look we had a good progress in 2016 as we discussed throughout the year. We had a number of technical trials and labs go trials which we completed and so we have now moved on to the next phase of that which is some of these commercial scale pilots that are getting on the way right now in about ten different locations around the country. So we are very excited about the opportunities of 5G brings. And we will see how those trials go and we look forward to sharing progress with you on those as we move forward throughout the year.","You asked around key metrics and I think it's going to be the same as any major investment we could be looking at is the combination of what's the cost of rollout 5G, we get into questions about how the distance from the node, how many homes can you cover many particular node, what speeds can we get, what\u2019s the cost of putting that there etcetera. Etcetera. XO obviously brings something to that but having additional five to the basis we think about rolling out the infrastructure needed for the 5G and but it's the same as any investment Mike we are going to look at the revenue opportunity. We think we can get based off the results of the tests around the way right now. And compare that with the cost. And if it provides a great return for shareholders we will certainly move ahead with launching commercially and if it will be the same as any other investment. We will look at the same way.","In terms of your second question on 2016 you are right. The base line is reducing the frontier divestiture and also AOL because Sony had partially part of the year in 2015. So then if you think about total revenue for 2017 it would include obviously the full year of AOL this year. We expect XO to kick in later this quarter. We expect the IOT business as you are going to have the full year of Fleetmatics in Telogis and the other IOT acquisitions and then assuming the Yahoo transaction closes we will have the revenue from there too. So when you think about building on the number that Mike mentioned the 121 billion you got all those things to layer on top of that to get to the expectation for the full year. Obviously it relates to pending transactions. It will be contingent on the timing of those as well. But hopefully that answers your questions on that.","Michael Rollins","Thanks very much.","Michael Stefanski","Okay. Tory next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. If I look at your CapEx guidance for the full year, essentially seems you are guiding to flat to plus or minus a reasonable range. So maybe you can maybe unpack that a little bit and just thinking about your network strategy and your product strategy what areas are you accelerating capital investment inside the business and maybe where do you feel like you have done a good job building our your network where it needs to be? Thanks.","Matt Ellis","Yes. Thanks Brett, so as you think about the CapEx as you say the number is reasonable consistent year after year and that's something you have seen for a number of years but as you say within that it changes overtime. And so within LTE our spending has continued to transition from coverage to indentifying the network and that continues to evolve as we leverage new technologies around radio and hardware and software and then reforming our spectrum within 4G and identifying with small cells. So you will continue to see that densification of the 4G network and that includes how we put fiber out there which obviously is needed for the 4G network but also it's something we think about for pre-positioning for 5G so you will continue to see that - you will continue to see us launch additional pods of LTE advances as we go through that. We had the initial launch that last year. We expect additional features to come through in the close of this year. And we will continue to expand our architecture. So within wireless you should expect to see the spending continue to move to make the network more efficient on a cost per gig basis going forward.","And as we have mentioned fiber is a consistent part of our business. So that's something you should expect to see us continuing. We have talked about what we are doing in Boston. You should continue to see us do that. Some of the other businesses aren't as we said previously they are not as capital intensive as our network business. So you should expect to see the CapEx will continue to be focused on the network side of the business as we go into 2017.","Brett Feldman","And just a quick question as a follow up around where you are investing you talked about the pre-commercial 5G commercial trials you\u2019re running. Are these predominately within your wire-line footprint or do you actually think that when you are ready to go commercial you have a business case to go in whatever market so quick they have the best demographics regardless of whether you are an incumbent wire-line provider or not.","Matt Ellis","Yes. It's not just in the wire-line footprint it's across the country and we certainly see the opportunity to deploy 5G solutions across the country as well once we get comfortable that they are ready to be launched out on a commercial basis.","Brett Feldman","So you could do one fiber as in market across the country not just in Boston?","Matt Ellis","Yes that's certainly we are looking at how we would support the 5G network across the country both in and outside the ILX footprint.","Brett Feldman","All right. Thank you.","Michael Stefanski","Tory next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies, please go ahead with your question.","Michael McCormack","Hey guys, thanks. Matt, maybe just a clarification on your comments regarding service revenue turning positive. Just give us a sense obviously optimization continues but is that predicated stable pricing environment in your view. Secondly, on the retention side it looks like you have got about 21% Delta between those that are on sub-side plans versus those making device payments. Is that fair and as I think about that how much of that is bring your own devices versus off-contract versus your own retention efforts? And then if you don't mind a final one based on our math it looks like you still have about 13.1ish million feature phones out there so non-smart phones what\u2019s the strategy to try to move those over to smart phones or try to retain them to prevent headwinds on handset as we look in the 2017?","Matt Ellis","Yes. Thanks Mike, I will start with the last one, look we certainly like it when customers migrate from feature phones to an LTE smart phone but we are also very happy for those customers that just want a feature phone. They are not looking for the additional functionality but they want to be connected to a great network. We are very happy to continue to have those as customers and we look forward to continue to have offerings that meet their needs as well.","In terms of service revenue and I think you talked about the gap between the 46% of our customers who have a device payment plan in the 67% of our base who are now on subsidize pricing. That's a factor of those customers come out they are two year service contracts and they move over to that pricing without necessarily upgrading a handset and we expect that will continue. That delta between those two numbers will be those customers who have either come out of two year subsidy and moved over to the un-subsidized pricing. They could be we now have customers who took out a device payment plan over two years ago who have completed those payments and are now no longer making a device payment every month and as you say BYOD continues to be part of that base too. So you should expect they will continue to be delta between those two numbers because not everyone on unsubsidized pricing is going to have a current device plan. So we see that continuing as we go into the year and part of that is certainly migrating over to device payment.","Michael McCormack","Just a clarification, I guess I am trying to get to how much of that I am sorry to interrupt but the actual percentage that is it you going into actively retain customers that are still on contract to reduce their price point without losing a customer. Is there some component to that as well?","Matt Ellis","Yes, the vast majority of our two year customers who have gone on to the unsubsidized prices but they've come to the end of that. I mean, we typically its customer has to get through their two year price plan if they're on that two year service contract before they were then being able to come to the unsubsidized pricing.","When you look at our churn, I think what you're trying to get to is that phone shown it was below 0.9%. And that is not because we're bringing customers on to that pricing before they've moved their thing. Their continued strong churn represents the value out basis and the service they get and the high quality of the network what they have when they're authorizing customer. So, it's only when they come out of their two year contract do they move over to -- have the opportunity to move over to unsubsidized pricing.","Michael McCormack","Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And just on the service revenue expectations, is that stable pricing is the expectation there or expecting this sort of promotions if we look at 2017?","Matt Ellis","Yes. We expect to continue to compete in the marketplace as throughout 2016, we had various promotions throughout the year. I'd expect us to continue to different times of the year, have different promotions out there. But I expect base of that, we will compete effectively in the marketplace.","Michael McCormack","Great. Thank you, Matt.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks, Mike. Tory, we have time for one more question. So, last question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thanks very much and good morning. Just a quick follow-up on Brett's questions on fiber. Specifically, how should we think about your future fiber needs? It seems like in some contacts you're willing to shed certain assets but have also acquired others and are also working with third party providers. In some cases over building in areas such as Boston. I'm trying to understand is that based in your actions, I'd seen as not all fiber assets are created equal. And so, how do you get to the point we have the right fixed assets in the right locations to support your network vision.","And a just kind of brief follow-up.","Matt Ellis","Yes. So, good morning Amir. Thank you, for that. Yes, fiber is going to be a critical asset for us. It's a critical asset today and it will certainly continue to be selling as we go into the future. So, one thing it allows us to do and is certainly is within our footprint is it replaces the core copper networks that have served us well over the year. But from a capability standpoint, or now it's just a maintenance standpoint, it certainly makes a lot of sense for us to continue to replace copper with fiber.","And then as you say fiber is going to be critical for us as we densify 40 and think about 5G, that it explains why the XO transaction was interesting to us getting those metro rings in 45 of the top 50 markets. The other thing you seen us doing in Boston was really look at this one fiber approach which was built in a network in a way that it provides a common fiber infrastructure to serve a number of different needs, whether that be consumers in home or in out of home and then obviously our small medium and enterprise customers too.","So, you should continue to see us deploy fiber. How we deploy that fiber? Can differ from location to location. We certainly look where it makes sense for us to own the fiber, but if there's way for us to partner with other people, they can build the fiber on our half, we certainly do that as well. So, it a location-by-location, case-by-case basis, we look at the economics and we decide the best way to get to the fiber assets. And we need, and we think about that if not justify brands, so we need for what we were doing today, but as we think about the network going out in to the future.","So, you should continue to see us make investments in fiber as we go forward and position the network to service the business well into the future.","Amir Rozwadowski","Great. And just a quick follow-up on your 2017 outlook. What type of factors do you take into account on any potential changes for the comparative landscape? In particular, Comcast has highlighted that they expect to launch their WiFi and VNO strategy in the back half of the year, giving you focus who're partnered there, was wondering what you're factoring in with respect to that partnership in terms of size and impact of both your financials and potentially the competitive landscape.","Matt Ellis","Yes, so as I think about, look we know they said they're going to they expect to launch that later in the year. We'll have to wait to see what is. As we said previously, look, we've been in the wholesale business for many years. We're happy to be in that business and we'd sign that agreement again if the opportunity came up. But look we don\u2019t expect that to necessarily have a major impact during the course of 2017. They got a lot of work to do there and I'll let them talk about this strategy on that.","But as I thi8nk about the competitive environment as a whole, I would expect to continue to evolve in ways that some of which we may guess, others which we'll have to wait and see how they play out, but what I would remind you is that we've seen many different competitive environments over the past 15 20 years in wireless and I think the one constant is being is the way that we've always competed effectively, whatever the environments and I highly expect us to do the same thing in 2017.","Michael Stefanski","Great. Thank you for your questions. Tory, before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back to Matt.","Matt Ellis","Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close this session with a few key points. In 2016, we delivered solid results in the competitive environment. We had a quality customers will lead in the industry and network performance and customer retention. We had solid financial results generating cash flow and shareholder return. We are confident in our strategy and priorities led by investing in our networks, creating platforms to further monetize daily usage, maintaining a discipline capital allocation model and returning value to our shareholders.","We are positioning the company for longtime growth. A key foundational element for our vision of the future is be the trusted network provider. Our strong network assets will enable us to be a centerpiece of this new connected world of people and things and give us the opportunity to participate globally and at advancing digital ecosystems. We look forward to the opportunities ahead of us to create value for our customers and shareholders.","Thank you for your - time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you, for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."],"21417":["Verizon Communications Inc.

And welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]","Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Michael Stefanski","Thanks, David. Good morning. And welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with Fran Shammo, our Chief Financial Officer.","As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.","This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website.","Before Fran goes through our performance results, I like to cover our earnings reconciliation for the fourth quarter and highlight a few special items. These are displayed on slide three.","For the fourth quarter we reported a loss of $0.54 per share on a GAAP basis. This reported result includes several significant non-operational items that I would like to highlight.","The largest item is our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities. This year we recorded a pretax expense of $7 billion to increase our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment which was primarily non-cash was caused by changes in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality tables and other actuarial assumptions.","We also incurred pretax expenses of $502 million related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. On an after-tax basis, these two charges amounted to $4.7 billion or $1.12 per share.","We also incurred non-operational expenses of $872 million in connection with early debt redemption and other costs. On an after-tax basis, these charges amounted to $528 million or $0.13 per share. Details regarding the income statement line item effects for these items are available on our website in the Financial and Operating Information and Non-GAAP Reconciliation schedules.","Excluding the non-operational charges of $1.25 per share, adjusted earnings per share was $0.71 in the fourth quarter. This compares with adjusted EPS of $0.66 a year ago, an increase of 7.6%.","For the full year adjusted earnings per share was $3.35, compared with $2.84 in 2013, an increase of 18%. Keep in mind that the $3.35 adjusted EPS does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless from the beginning of 2014 since the transaction closed on February 21st.","The results and growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and remarks exclude the effects of the non-operational items and are therefore on an adjusted basis. Also the growth rates we provide on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.","I would like to remind everyone that due to the FCC's rules, we cannot discuss or answer any questions related to the auction or AWS-3 spectrum. When the rules permit, we do plan to provide you with an update on our participation.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.","Fran Shammo","Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and happy New Year. 2014 was a great year of execution and achievement for Verizon from both a strategic and financial perspective. We delivered strong operating and financial performance and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in any environment.","Strategically, our most notable accomplishment was completing the transaction for full ownership of Verizon Wireless. We closed the deal in late February, providing immediate earnings accretion and full access to the cash flows of what we believe is the best Wireless asset in the world.","Throughout the year, we continued our steady and consistent investment in our networks and platforms, which are critical to driving profitable growth in the future. Our strong cash generation enabled us to invest $17.2 billion of capital and returned value to shareholders through dividend payments, which totaled $7.8 billion for the year.","Last September, our Board of Directors approved 3.8% dividend increase, raising the annual amount to $2.20 per share. At the same time, we are investing and innovating for the future through new growth businesses and integrated product development efforts in rapidly evolving markets like mobile video and the Internet of Things.","The foundation of our continued success is network excellence, which is the hallmark of the Verizon brand. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services, which will fuel profitable growth.","The depth and breadth of our networks provide the fundamental strength and basis for our competitive advantage. Our industry is strong and demand is growing with customers using Wireless and Broadband even more and in different ways than ever before.","Our competitive position is very strong and we are well-positioned from a strategic standpoint to capitalize on these market trends. In Wireless, we had another exceptional year of quality connections, growth and profitability.","Retail postpaid net adds totaled 5.5 million for the year, with 2 million coming in a highly competitive fourth quarter that featured heavy promotional activity. Postpaid activations, gross additions, upgrades and net adds all grew by double-digit percentages in 2014.","Total operating revenues grew 8.2% for the year and our EBITDA service margin was 48.5%, even with the short-term pressure of significant device volumes in the fourth quarter. In Wireline, consumer revenues grew 5% for the year driven by our FiOS platform.","In 2014, we continue to increase penetration in existing markets and ended the year at 41% for Internet and just under 36% for video. Our sharp focus on productivity improvements and operating efficiency resulted in an 80-basis point expansion of our EBITDA margin to 23.2% for the full year.","Now let's get into the fourth quarter and full-year performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on slide five. On a reported basis, total operating revenue grew 6.8% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we added $6.5 billion to our topline, representing 5.4% growth, which exceeded our guidance of 4% consolidated revenue growth for 2014.","If we exclude the prior period revenues from the public sector business we sold, the comparable growth rates would have been 7.3% for the fourth quarter and 5.7% for the full year. Our data revenue growth continued to be driven by Wireless and FiOS. In the fourth quarter, growth was favorably impacted by increased Wireless equipment revenue due to the significant 4G device activations.","New revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics are beginning to emerge. In 2014, these revenues totaled about $585 million, with growth of more than 45%. There are countless innovative technology solutions being developed in the Internet of Things ecosystem across multiple industries.","A great example of this was unveiled last week at the North American International Auto Show, where we announced Verizon Vehicle, a powerful new connected-vehicle service. This unique aftermarket solution modernizes traditional roadside assistance while enhancing driver safety and convenience.","We expect this service to launch commercially in the second quarter. The addressable market is more than 200 million vehicles on the road today that are not connected to the Internet, or have a GPS unit. We believe that this large unserved market stands to greatly benefit from this new car Wireless connectivity solution.","In addition to topline growth, we continue to focus on driving process improvements and cost efficiencies through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $43.3 billion in 2014, an increase of 2.9%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 34.1%.","Let's take a look at our cash flow results on slide 6. As I previously noted, the transaction to acquire full ownership of Verizon Wireless created a lack of comparability between the current and prior periods in our statement of cash flows. In 2014, cash flows from operations totaled $30.6 billion. In addition to incremental cash interest and tax payments, we made $1.5 billion in pension contributions that we did not have to fund in 2013.","In spite of these additional cash outlays and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $13.4 billion for the year. Our capital program was consistent with our guidance of around $17 billion for the year with improving capital efficiency. In total, capital expenditures were $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.2 billion for the full year, up 3.5% from 2013.","Our annual CapEx to revenue ratio was 13.5%, an improvement from 13.8% in 2013. The pace of capital spending in Wireless was very consistent throughout all four quarters of the year. Wireless CapEx was $2.7 billion in the quarter and $10.5 billion for the full year. We continue to invest the necessary capital to proactively stay ahead of demand.","Our investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS spectrum in addition to utilizing small cell technology in building solutions and distributed antenna systems.","As I am sure you\u2019ve seen from our advertising, we now have deployed AWS or XLTE, as we have branded it in more than 400 markets, effectively doubling our existing capacity. And despite what others claim about certain aspects of their networks, when you look across the entire nation and consider all the relevant performance metrics, Verizon has the nation's largest and most reliable 4G LTE network.","We are consistently acknowledged as the performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. In Wireline, capital spending totaled $1.6 billion in the quarter and $5.8 billion for the year, down 7.7% from 2013. Our balance sheet remained strong and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals.","We ended the year with $113.3 billion of gross debt and $102.7 billion of net debt. We significantly improved the maturity profile of our debt portfolio during 2014 through various debt market transactions. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.4 times. We remain committed to getting back to our pre-transaction credit rating profile into 2018 to 2019 timeframe.","Now let's move into review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide 7. Our Wireless strategy is built on making consistent network investments and providing a compelling value proposition to our customers. Our investment strategy is focused on adding network capacity ahead of accelerating demand, which is driven by increasing 4G device adoption and higher customer usage.","Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high quality retail postpaid customer base. In 2014, we strengthened the overall quality of our customer accounts. We added 24.7 million 4G devices into our postpaid connection space, representing annual growth of about 58%.","In addition, we increased the number of More Everything shared data plans to 61% of total accounts. The average connections per account grew 4% in ARPA plus Edge installment billings increased by more than 5% in 2014.","As I stated coming out of the third quarter, we expected and closed the year with the very high volume quarter. Total postpaid device activations in the fourth quarter were unprecedented, totaling 15.3 million, up nearly 34% over last year. More than 13 million were phones, driven by iconic smartphone launches from both Apple and Samsung.","To give some historical perspective, these phone activations were 1.5 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2012, which at that time was a record high because it was the first time of 4G iPhone or our free 3G iPhone was available on our network. The usage characteristics of these iconic 4G smartphones also generate strong returns and higher NPV.","Our fourth quarter promotions were successful, driving a sequential and year-over-year increase in gross adds, net adds, and upgrades. This customer growth sets us up very well for profitable growth in 2015 and beyond, as we drive usage and leverage the efficiencies of our LTE network.","Total Wireless operating revenues were $23.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 11%. For the full year operating revenues totaled $87.6 billion, representing growth of $6.6 billion or 8.2%. Total service revenues grew 2.8% in the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year. Verizon Edge installment billings totaled $443 million in the quarter and $976 million for the full year. Service revenues plus Edge installment billings grew 5.2% in the fourth quarter and 6.6% for the full year.","As we expected, the percentage of phone activations on the Edge program increased to about 25% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with slightly more than 7 million phones on Edge, which is just over 8% of our postpaid phone base.","In terms of profitability, we generated $7.7 billion of EBITDA in the quarter and $35.2 billion for the full year, an increase of more than $1 billion or 3%. Our EBITDA service margin for the fourth quarter was 42%, due to the significant device volumes. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin was 48.5% compared with 49.5% in 2013. The full year EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 40.2%, compared with 42.2% for 2013.","Now let's turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account, beginning on slide eight. Retail postpaid service revenue per account, or ARPA, grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 3.9% for the full year. If you add the Edge installment billings to ARPA, the growth rates increased to 3.5% for the quarter and 5.3% for the full year. We ended the year with 35.6 million postpaid accounts, an increase of 1.5%. The number of postpaid connections per account grew to 2.87, up 4% from a year ago.","As I said, the number of customers\u2019 accounts on More Everything shared data plans increased from 46% to 61% of total. As you would expect, the average number of connections in More Everything plans are higher at 3.06 per account and grew faster, up more than 7%. And the average data usage in these accounts has increased by about 50% in the past year.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on slide nine. We ended the year with 108.2 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections space grew 5.5% to 102.1 million and our prepaid connections totaled 6.1 million. As we said, 2014 was a year of historical connections growth. Postpaid gross additions were 5.4 million in the quarter, up 25.5%. For the year, postpaid gross adds totaled 17.8 million, up 18% from 2013 and 20% higher than 2012.","In terms of the gross add mix in the quarter, 55% were smartphones and about 37% were Internet devices, primarily tablets, about 6% were basic phones. This percentage mix is also representative of the full year.","As we said in our updates, we did experience an alleviative rate of retail postpaid churn in the fourth quarter at 1.14%. Throughout the year, we maintained a disciplined approach to customer acquisition and retention with the focus on attracting and retaining high quality customers.","Within a heightened amount of phone activity in the fourth quarter, we are pleased with the overall improvement in the quality of our phone base. Our retail postpaid net additions of 2 million in the fourth quarter were up 26% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. Our 5.5 million postpaid net additions for the year compare favorably with the 4.1 million in 2013 and 5 million in 2012.","As far as the postpaid net add mix, the fourth quarter including 1.5 million new 4G smartphones and 1.4 million 4G tablet. Postpaid phone net adds totaled 672,000, as the 1.5 million 4G smartphones were offset in part by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones.","Full year net adds of 5.5 million included 4.6 million 4G smartphones and 4.3 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones and non-tablet internet devices.","Let\u2019s now turn to slide 10 and take a look at device activations and our success in driving 4G adoption and usage. Total postpaid device activations totaled 15.3 million in the quarter, up nearly 34%. For the full year, postpaid activations totaled 48.1 million, up 16% from 2013, about 85% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablet.","4G LTE devices now comprise 66% of our retail postpaid connection space. This strong device adoption continues to drive increased usage. We ended the year with 67.7 million smartphones in total, about 80% of which were 4G.","Smartphone penetration increased to 79% of total phones, about 75% of our phone activations in the quarter were customer upgrades. In total about 9.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter. As you would expect, a vast majority of these upgrades were 4G smartphones.","Most of our smartphone upgrades represent an incremental revenue opportunity for us. 1.2 million were upgrades from basic phones, about 46% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G, which we monetized through higher data usage and a lower cost to serve. We also continue to successfully identify and retain a high percentage of what we call high-risk high-value accounts.","Looking ahead, we still have a sizable quality upgrade opportunity, with about 13 million 3G smartphones and 18.5 million basic phones remaining in our postpaid connections base. We are very focused on this opportunity to upgrade customers and protect our high-quality postpaid base.","In addition, we also have a profitable growth opportunity with further penetration of tablets. We ended the year with about 8 million postpaid tablets in our connections base. Tablets have expanded the market for postpaid devices and provide us a good value through increase data consumption and lower churn at the account level.","Data and video usage on our network continues to rise, about 84% of our total data traffic was on the 4G LTE network. We are handling this demand and by our own measures the network performance continues to improve.","Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on slide 11. In the Consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In fact, we have posted 10 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in excess of 4%\/.","In the fourth quarter, Consumer revenues grew 4.1% and for the full year were up 5%, exceeding our guidance of at least 4% growth. Mass markets which includes small business, grew 3% in the quarter and 3.8% for the full year. FiOS now represents 77% of Consumer revenue.","In the fourth quarter, FiOS Consumer revenue grew 11.1%, driven by a combination of customer growth, pricing actions and increase FiOS quantum penetration. At the end of the year, 59% of our FiOS internet customers subscribe to data speed higher than 50 megabits per second. This is up from 46% at the end of 2013.","Throughout the year, we continue to improve the customer value proposition, driving better investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. During 2014, we introduced FiOS Quantum TV. Another differentiated offer was our Speed Match service, which increases customer upload speeds to match their download speeds.","In December, we introduced the FiOS Quantum Gateway, our new router that delivers America's fastest Wi-Fi. You will begin to see more marketing of this router and its capability shortly. Looking ahead, our focus will remain on driving higher penetration in the existing markets, which in turn will generate profitable growth and further improve our investment returns.","In Broadband, we added 145,000 net FiOS customers in the quarter and 544,000 for the year. We have a total of 6.6 million FiOS Internet subscribers representing 41.1% penetration, which is up 160 basis points for the year. Overall, net Broadband subscribers increased 59,000 in the quarter and 190,000 for the full year. In FiOS video, we added 116,000 net customers in the quarter and 387,000 for the year.","We have a total of 5.6 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.8% penetration, an increase of 80 basis points in 2014. In terms of our network evolution initiative, we converted an additional 52,000 Copper customers in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to around 255,000. In total, we have converted more than 800,000 customers to fiber since we started this initiative in 2011.","Aside from the maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services, which result in additional recurring revenue. In 2015, we plan to convert another 200,000 Copper customers to fiber. During 2014, we also continued our consolidation efforts around central offices, which will recreate additional efficiencies.","We have a strong commitment to customer service, and have implemented several new frontline tools that are improving efficiency and increasing customer satisfaction. While we benchmark well against the competition, we have more work to do in 2015 to take our performance to the next level.","Let's turn to slide 12 and cover enterprise and the wholesale business. In the enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 4.6%, which included about $30 million of pressure from FX.","For the full year, revenue of $13.7 billion was down 3.5%. The overall story is unchanged as declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continue to outweigh growth in the newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale.","Strategic services grew 1.5% in the quarter and 2.3% for the year. This category includes both of IP layer and application such as data center, cloud, security and managed and professional services. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in application services.","In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 5.8% in the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. On the positive side, healthy demand for Ethernet services continues but revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than offset this growth.","Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment were down 1.6% in the quarter and 0.5% for the full year. In terms of profitability, EBITDA increased 4.3% in the quarter and 3% for the full year.","The EBITDA margin was 23.9% in the quarter and 23.2% for the year, up 80 basis points from 2013. While we are making steady progress in the Wireline business and achieved our goal of expanding margins, we are far from satisfied. There is more work to do to drive sustainable improvements in both revenue growth and profitability.","Our path to improve profitable growth includes driving further FiOS penetration and improving operating and capital efficiency. In the enterprise and the wholesale business, we are changing our revenue mix toward newer growth services like cloud, security and professional services.","On the cost side of the equation, we have realized many noteworthy process improvements and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. We are confident that this continued focus will improve our overall cost structure, ultimately resulting in a much stronger Wireline business.","Let's move next to our summary slide. Our operating and financial performance in 2014 demonstrated once again that we are in a strong market position with a proven ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. Our high quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage.","2014 was a remarkable year from a financial viewpoint. We delivered 18% growth in adjusted earnings per share with very strong cash flows. We executed a strategically important $130 billion transaction through a combination of debt and equity.","Our strong cash generation allowed us to invest $17.2 billion in capital, pay $7.8 billion in dividends, make incremental cash interest in tax payments and redeem higher coupon notes in the course of restructuring our debt maturity schedule. In addition, we declared a 3.8% dividend increase and improved our cash position since the closing of the Vodafone transaction.","Our customer growth in the fourth quarter, particularly in Wireless gives us a great confidence heading into 2015.","In terms of our 2015 outlook, it is difficult to predict the competitive intensity with others, particularly in Wireless. However, we have faced highly competitive Wireless environments before and I have always been able to successfully and profitably grow the business, because our customers understand the value of our services. In this environment, we will continue to protect our base by focusing on net adds and upgrades that make financial sense for our business.","We will also continue to focus on growing in the right customer segments, while at the same time creating new revenue streams for the future. Over a sustained period of time, our industry is governed by free cash flow dynamic. To be successful, companies need to generate free cash flow, which can be invested in their networks to attract and retain customers by providing a quality experience.","In that context, we are targeting the following for 2015, consolidated revenue growth of at least 4%, sustain profitability with a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin at a level consistent with our full year 2014 performance, strong free cash flow generation with consolidated capital spending of between $17.5 billion and $18 billion, and a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $700 million.","In terms of income taxes, we realized the cash benefit in 2014 due to the extension of bonus depreciation, which will also have a carryover benefit in 2015. However, with the full year of 100% Wireless net income, we expect total cash income taxes to increase in 2015. We also expect our effective tax rate for book purposes to be in the area of 34% to 36%.","With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.","Michael Stefanski","Thank you, Fran. David, we are now ready to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Phil Cusick","Hey, guys. Thanks. Fran, I guess to start speaking of free cash flow needs in the Wireless industry, can you help us range your 2015 free cash flow given the commentary on higher cash pension expense, EIP and CapEx?","Fran Shammo","Thanks, Phil. I\u2019m not going to get into the specific guidance on free cash flow, but you can see what we generated this year. I\u2019ve guided you to a consistent EBITDA margin on a growth rate of revenue of at least 4%, and I want to stress that at least 4%.","The other thing is, I think that cash taxes at this point given where we are, if we don't give bonus extension from '15 into '16 that obviously that puts more pressure in '16 on cash taxes as well. So I'm not going to get into specific guidance on that metric, but I think I've given enough to put us in the ballpark.","Phil Cusick","Maybe I can try again. Given the revenue growth, can you talk about your assumptions on the Edge mix in 2015, so how much of that revenue growth should we think about is coming from equipment revenue that\u2019s more recognized than cash? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Yeah. So I think on the revenue growth side of at least 4%, if you think about that metric. What we are planning for right now is that our Edge take rate probably increases to around 34%, 35% take rate, so some of that will be equipment revenue.","But I think what you have to focus in on is if you look at the service revenue component, you look at the recurring revenue of FiOS. So if you look at the recurring revenues of this business, 4% plus is an achievable metric, but obviously equipment revenue will play a factor in that.","But keep in mind as we start to -- start to go out into the future on the installment sales, the installment sales really neutralized themselves over two-year period of time if you think of it that way. So as we collect more on installment sales, we are putting more on, but cash flow is starting to catch up with it. So I would keep that all in mind.","The other thing too is from a cash flow perspective, we are looking at alternatives around the receivable as this grows. So you could see us do things around securitization in the future, not that that we are announcing anything today. But that is a possibility that we\u2019re looking at as we continue to grow that mix on the Edge program.","Phil Cusick","That helps. Thanks, Fran.","Michael Stefanski","David, we can take the next question now?","Operator","Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Fran, you talked in your summary comments about your focus on non-strategic assets sales. There has been a lot of talk for about towers for a while, we haven\u2019t seen anything yet. Can you just talk about towers and then access lines, datacenters, enterprise, how you are thinking about some other -- some of these assets and what we should expect going forward? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Look, I think, we\u2019ve talked about a lot of this in the past. But at this point, we are aware of all the rumors in the marketplace. Naturally we don't have any comment on any specific rumors, but we have consistently said that we are always looking at all kinds of strategic transactions and if they are the right transactions and provide value to our shareholders, we will execute on those transactions and at that time, we will come back to you and announce our strategy around that. But beyond that there's really nothing else to say on this subject.","Simon Flannery","So, just to say, are you -- you expect to make some transactions this year or is it just dependent on the terms?","Fran Shammo","I think, what I would say is, we continue to look at all strategic availability and if something makes sense then we will execute on that strategic initiative.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you.","Michael Stefanski","David, we can take the next question now?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","David Barden","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Fran, just on your comments about free cash flow kind of governing the competitive intensity in the space, could you talk about the assumptions that you're making for your 2015 expectations? Are you assuming that competition kind of continues at its current course and speed? Does it level out at kind of current levels or are you assuming that maybe it even reverses course, it would be kind of helpful to get a sense of the backdrop you're making assumptions on?","And then second, just kind of whilst in the headlines, could you opine a little bit on what you think the import of Google kind of doing an MVNO in this space, is did you have a chance to talk to them about what their plans are, as they kind of where going in the market looking to try to execute on something? It would be helpful to get some color on that? Great. Thanks.","Fran Shammo","All right. So look, I think, it\u2019s important just to set the stage here. All the hype around 2014 around price competition and the intensity of the competition, and just look at what Verizon delivered during all that period of time.","So we had topline growth of 5.7%, we expanded the EBITDA by $1 billion in Wireless, we expanded the EBITDA in Wireline of $200 million, we had net [phone] [ph] adds which seemed to be the big issue of 1.3 million in this competitive environment and we grow our overall net adds year-over-year by 24%. So I think the basic point here is, is that we will continue to compete and we will continue to compete at a positive profitable value.","I talk -- also it's important as we enter into 2015, with the competition we are also doing a lot of different things. So number one, based on our base, as I said in my comments, we saw 13 million 3G smartphones and 18.5 million basic phones that we will pursue to upgrade into our 4G LTE network that is more efficient, generates more revenue. Tablets are only 8% of our base and as I said in the past, tablets will continue to be a very large piece of our growth into the future.","Tablets are very, very good because, one, they make it more sticky at the account level; two, we get a recurring revenue stream albeit lower than a smartphone but the subsidy on that is much reduced. And then also, it also increases the amount of usage and video uptake on the network, which is what we\u2019re driving to is the more usage to benefit on the bundles.","The other thing is, as you look out to us and directions we\u2019re taking, obviously as we stated Internet of Things is going to be a very important category, 585 million up 45% year-over-year. And we don't really disclose it but we have over 15 million connections now of Internet of Things. We announced the Verizon vehicle as I said, you should look at us as launching over-the-top MobileFirst sometime this as Lowell has talked about in the past.","And on the Wireline side, we just launched a new router which we think is going to improve both the intake of video into the home. But it's also very important because it has to sustain the ability of Wireless products within that home. And as you know, when you get four to five devices running on that router today that, that can only deliver up to 75 megabits, you're really not getting 75 megabits.","So this router will be able to produce significant higher throughput and we believe it\u2019s the fastest in the industry today. So putting that all in context from a competitive standpoint and what we can deliver, the guidance we're giving you is based on all the strategic action that we will be taking in the future.","The other two things I would talk about is if you look at our prepaid base, again another positive quarter, up 7.5% on ARPU growth and then of course our own reseller base with our own strategic initiatives with that whether you call it a reseller base or MVNO is all positive and growing positively. So that leads me into the Google discussion.","I guess what I would say right off the bat, number one, is this is not just another very prime example of the intensity in the competition around this industry. The availability of the open networks and access to the networks and this is why another reason why this industry does not need to be regulated.","I would also say on this one is, if you look at Google, they've entered the fiber, they\u2019ve done other initiatives. Their whole purpose is to increase speeds so that people can do more search. What I would say is we\u2019ll have to wait to see how they execute on the MVNO but listen MVNOs or resellers or people leasing the network from carriers has been around for 15 years. It's a complex issue. You have to deal directly with the consumer. There is a whole infrastructure that's needed to do that.","So I think this is another example of where Google is going to enter the market under a platform basis to do what they want to do. And it's just another competitor as we look at it. So I'll leave it at that.","David Barden","Thanks a lot, Fran.","Michael Stefanski","David, we can take the next question now please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Hodulik","Okay. Thanks. Good morning guys. As you look at the results of the Wireless quarter churn and the upgrade rate really for standout as having spiked. And obviously, there is couple of drivers, I think the competition and the number of iPhones you guys are renewing this quarter. So is there a way, Fran, to sort of delineate the two and as you look out to 2015, are these -- do you expect these numbers to remain elevated because of competition or should we expect them to both, trend back towards a more normalized level? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Yeah, thanks John. So I think this is what we need to look at, as we said in the remarks and follow the words carefully is that we will pursue our base. We will pursue net adds and we will pursue upgrades that are financially beneficial to the company. So what that means is at a 1.14% churn rate, you should take that as we did not go to places where we do not financially want to go to save a customer.","And there's going to be certain customers who leave us for price and we're just not going to compete with that because it doesn\u2019t make financial sense for us to do that. As far as why upgrades were so high, I think you have to go back a little bit and reflect on what we did in the past. So if you look at 2013, we made a lot of policy changes around upgrades. It pushed the upgrade view back into \u201814. So in \u201814, we took probably more upgrades than we generally would have taken because of those policy changes.","But as we came out of the third quarter, I said that we had about 3.2 million iPhones in our base that were coming out of contract. And that was the signal that we were going to aggressively go after those 3.2 million customers and we did. We are very satisfied with the quality of the upgrades.","So if you look at it from that perspective in the remarks I made, look at it on a percentage basis. 78% of our upgrades are what we would call strategic quality upgrades and that means a 3G to 4G, or basic to 4G, or a high value type customer who delivers a lot of value to us and we appreciate their business and we want to keep them as a customer.","So that\u2019s how you should view this, John and I think that with the competition and some of the pricing that\u2019s out there, you should think that we are going to have a higher churn rate because some customers we are just going to financially keep.","John Hodulik","Sounds good. Thanks.","Michael Stefanski","David, next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Rollins","Thanks for taking the question. Just two. First, if you look at the margin guidance that you are providing on a consolidated level and the aspirations to improve the Wireline margins, does that mean that Wireless margins are facing some headwinds just as you are processing the higher volume environment coming off the fourth quarter and some of your initiatives that you are planning for 2015?","And then secondly, Fran, if you can give us an update on your video strategy with any more details or perspectives you could share with us on what that product might look like later in the year when you talked about launching it? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Thanks Michael. So on the competitive consolidated margin, look I think it's important again that you focus on the words. We said at least topline 4% growth. We said that we would have at least a consolidated margin consistent with 2014, but I think you need to put it in perspective that we had an extremely heavy fourth quarter in 2014. So, I would not expect that to repeat in 2015, given the iconic devices that hit and given the level of competition at this point in time versus what we would expect next year.","I think the other important thing too is, as you are focusing in on this, I think it's important to focus on 2014 earnings per share, so we grew at 18%. I know most of you will subtract out the 10% for the accretion of Vodafone. So when you look at it, the core business in this highly competitive environment grew at 8%. I would also say that don\u2019t get ahead of yourselves on the Wireline accretion of margin as Lowell and I said before, this will be a slow progression of Wireline accretion. So we grew 80 basis points this year. We will continue to focus in on topline growth and continue to take out those costs, continue our copper to fiber migration efforts and continue to become more efficient of the company. So, I wouldn't read too much into. We expect Wireline to jump off the charts and Wireless to go down.","On the over-the-top strategy, I guess I'm not going to disclose as to too much what we are going to do. But I think if you look at the environment, there is a lot of positive things coming out of the environment. So if you look at what Dish has done around some of their recent launches, look at CBS and their own launch of over-the-top with their own programming. This just leads us to a path of content owners are willing to open up their content to different models and that's exactly what we are going to execute on it. And we are working with many content providers to join that model and we will have a lot more to say about that and Marni and I obviously, Lowell will talk more about that when we launch our first product come this summer.","Mike Rollins","Thanks very much.","Michael Stefanski","David, next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Feldman","Thanks. And I\u2019m going to follow up a little bit on what Mike said and Fran in your response. Typically when we see telecom operators start ramping content driven models, there is a big upfront investment particularly in content costs. So just wonder if you can maybe just help us think, are we going to begin to see any of that spending flow through your P&L this year and is that a component of how you thought about your margin guidance you provided? Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Well, number one, on the traditional model of FiOS, obviously in our guidance we've included an increase in content cost because every year you have a content cost and you should feature in around, consistent with where we were in 2014 around a 3% to 4% content increase cost right now is what we are projecting.","As far as the new model, again, I'm not going to get a lot into that model. You should not think about it as a traditional linear TV model. It's going to be, I would think a different type of a model. So, we'll wait till midsummer when we can talk more about that. But within our plan, we do have those content costs.","Brett Feldman","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.","Michael Stefanski","David, next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike McCormack","Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, Fran, following on, I guess, somewhat related to the Wireless margin story in 2015. But just trying to get a sense for what your thoughts are on ARPA sort of puts and takes? Obviously, you\u2019re talking about some potential, I guess, save retention tools on your base, the competitive landscape. Do we still think you can get some modest growth on ARPA in '15?","And then secondly, the CapEx level, I think, is a bit above what prior commentary had been, not dramatically, but trying to get a sense for what that is, whether it\u2019s Wireline, Wireless? I know you and I had spoken about densification back in December, I am assuming it\u2019s probably related to that. Thanks.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, Mike. So, on the VZW margin, the follow-up question on around the ARPA, I think this becomes a more tricky question, because obviously ARPA is around service. And with the Edge program, we are kind of convoluting that now, that it\u2019s a tougher metric to get your hands around, which is why we are giving out the recurring installment billings to try to get it on an apples-to-apples comparison. But if you think about that, we grew that ARPA by 5.2%.","So look, I think, given everything that\u2019s going on, and given that the fact that I said we would have a topline growth of 4%, obviously we believe that we can continue to accrete the ARPA of this business, given everything I said about the additional growth things that we\u2019re keen in on, just the jump off point that we came into this year.","So the other thing too is if you go back to 2012, the fourth quarter of '12 was very much like this quarter of '14. We really placed the bet on growth and upgrades and solidifying our base. In '12, albeit we added lot more smartphone net adds back then, but it\u2019s pretty much the same quarter that gives us a great basis to jump off into 2015. So that\u2019s how I would think about the ARPA as a metric.","On CapEx, Mike, it goes directly to what you said. I have been pretty consistent with this in the fact that we will spend more CapEx in the Wireless side and we will continue to curtail CapEx on the Wireline side. And some of that\u2019s, because we are getting to the end of our committed build around FiOS. Penetration is getting higher. We are reconnecting homes that we\u2019ve already connected.","So it\u2019s not additional capital that we have to outlay and we are very focused on those, what we call connected homes that are not our customers to go aback after them that that is a very good return for us, because we\u2019ve already spent the capital to connect that home. So it\u2019s a lot of combination around that. But yes, this is around densification, this is around our projection of growth for the Wireless industry and staying ahead of that. So again, it\u2019s all about encompassing. So we are looking at a slight increase from where we ended 2014.","Mike McCormack","And Fran, just thinking about the densification, are there particular markets where you guys are spending more? Are there pressure points that you look at in '15 is being areas where you would need to sort of not rush and go out and spend, but I guess there is a focus?","Fran Shammo","Not really. I mean, it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we did in '14. I mean, obviously, your major cities are where you have your biggest densification happening right now. Because as we launch AWS around the U.S. and get the coverage map up, AWS is really handling most of that outside of the major cities, but it\u2019s the major cities that are being densified on a quicker basis.","Mike McCormack","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Michael Stefanski","David, let\u2019s take the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much. And good morning, folks. Fran, it does seem as one of the standouts for you folks has been the ability to reduce costs through operational efficiency. And I know you touched upon this with some of your questions in your prepared remarks. But is there any sense that you can give us sort of the scope of opportunities over a multiyear period? I guess the genesis of the question is really we find ourselves in an intensely competitive environment as you had mentioned. How much opportunity is there for you folks to continue to drive down costs in order to retain this sort of industry leading margin profile on cash generation ability that you guys have built over for the last couple of years?","Fran Shammo","Just a couple of thoughts around that. Number one is, obviously the more and more we convert 3G customers to 4G that affords us the ability to get on a much more efficient network, it affords us the ability to reappropriate our spectrum, and it affords us to actually start to run down if you will the higher cost network of 3G. So, all of that plays into this.","The other thing is, as we said before, we have a very cost structure in servicing our customers and you\u2019re going to see some things different of how we approach customers and mainly around getting more around self serve, so that we can do more of the handsets. And we saw over the last two years, starting in 2013 into the 2014, that this played a big role and how we take cost out of the Wireless cost structure.","On the Wireline side, it\u2019s just continuing to do more of the same. So we really don\u2019t play up the fact of all the copper to fiber migration. But this is really starting to pay benefits to us. And as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve been doing this for the last three years. We are now in the position of starting to shutdown central offices, which free up real estate for us to monetize and get out of. It reduces the property tax around this. So there\u2019s a lot of efficiencies that come from this.","And the other thing is that within the one-time charges, you probably picked up a severance accrual. And in December, the Wireline company already has reduced about 2,300 headcount, including about 1,300 represented workforce, who took an additional incentive for them to voluntary retire. So we are setting the company up once again to produce a very beneficial efficient cost structure going into 2015.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much.","Michael Stefanski","David, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Kevin Smithen","Thank you. Wanted to follow-up in your comments about not chasing on profitable subs and upgrades. Does that change if you begin to go negative on phone net adds? Like what is your tolerance for sub losses because in the past that has sort of been a key level where you sort of responded with some retention in offensive marketing?","Fran Shammo","Well, I mean, Kevin, we always have save programs and specific targeting to a specific customer base or a specific segment, so that's not going to change. My point is here is that there are certain customers that will go for the lowest price. And at that point, we\u2019re probably not going to compete on price with those customers and that\u2019s what you saw.","I mean, if you look at it for the fourth quarter, we added 672,000 net phone adds. So, I think you have to keep it all in focus that what we are gaining. We are gaining 4G high-value customers and we\u2019re not necessarily losing that 4G high-value customer. So, I think you have to look at it in a holistic point of view, but that's really the strategy that we have deployed and we will continue to execute on our strategy.","Kevin Smithen","And just a quick follow-up. Does your guidance change at all under certain Title II outcomes and what is your current thinking on this given recent government comments?","Fran Shammo","Well, that\u2019s a great question because I personally have been misquoted, both in the press and in Congress on what I've said. So this is a good question for me to clear this up. So first of all, this is not of an issue about Internet rules. It\u2019s about an issue of FCC reclassifying Broadband to Title II service. And this will absolutely affect us and the industry on long-term investment in our networks.","And that can be seen factually as to what happened in the rest of the world where you have high regulation, the networks are not invested in, there are not good quality of service networks and that's where this will put us. I guess, I would emphasize also that the approach in whole or in part on Title II is an extreme and risky path that will jeopardize our investment and the development of innovation in Broadband Internet and related services.","It will also tie up the industry in a very uncertain time and cause all types of litigation. So when I said before, I misquoted on the fact that it would not hurt our investment, I was talking about 2015. But if this piece of Title II was to pass, I can absolutely assure you, it would certainly change the way we've been view our investment in our networks.","The other thing too is, as I think it's important to show that this industry on a high-level basis has invested about $50 billion a year in networks and improving the quality of service and open network to everyone. And that's what the industry belief is, that this is an open internet basis.","If we could curtail the investment of this industry, it will definitely trickle down to what we would consider middle-class jobs. And it\u2019s because most of at least, for Verizon Wireless, a lot of our build are done by thousands of contractors across the United States, that will impact those small business and impact their employees.","So from that perspective, I guess, what we would say, Kevin, is we would encourage Congress to adopt a legislative solution, Congress has the authority to adopt clear rules of the road that will allow policy makers in the industry to move on to more important things. So, I think, that summarizes the position about Title II.","Kevin Smithen","Very helpful. Thank you.","Fran Shammo","Okay. Time for one more question, David?","Operator","Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Jennifer Fritzsche","Great. Thanks Fran. Just two quick questions if I may, just an update on thoughts around the tower sale, I assume it\u2019s still part of the plan. Secondly, I just wanted to explore the ARPU question, a lot was made of your November 1st price cut? But am I crazy to think you could look at this glass half full, because with 84% of your traffic now on LTE and I think you said 66% you are base on LTE phone? Did you see some movement upward with that price change that actually could have offset any sort of downward movement you saw? Thanks a lot.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, Jennifer. Well, on the tower sales, look, I think, we\u2019ve been pretty clear on the remarks here. We are not going to talk about the rumors anymore until there is something that substantially state. So at this point, I think, we\u2019ll just leave it at that.","As far as the price cuts, you are absolutely correct, Jennifer. When we look at the provisioning of our base, we have seen a significant increase in the amount of customers who are taking our higher data plans, if you will, that drive more revenue. And even with those higher plans, we still see a large portion of those customers breaking their bundles because of video consumption in the increase in video consumption.","So, yes, there is an offset here. It is not all just dilution, there is an upgrade of what customers are using and obviously, we built the plans around LTE, we built the plans around, we want customers to use more, because that's what will generate incremental revenue for the business and give us a return on the continued investment in our network.","Jennifer Fritzsche","Great. Thank you.","Fran Shammo","Thank you.","Michael Stefanski","Okay. That\u2019s all the time we have for question, but before we end the call, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Fran.","Fran Shammo","Thanks, Mike. So at conclusion here, I just want to state that Verizon had another strong year of operating and financial results with topline revenue growth and quality earnings and cash generation. We are very focused on driving growth and profitability. To that end, our execution strategy is around the assets we have in place.","As always, we continually look at options for monetizing certain less strategic assets and creating value for our shareholders. We continue to develop new products and services in the area of video delivery, Internet of Things that will drive growth and profitability into 2015 and beyond. We look forward to a very positive 2015 with confidence in our ability to execute our strategy, grow the business profitably and invest for our future. Thank you all for joining today and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty.John DohertyThanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I am John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo; and well as Mike Stefanski, who recently assumed our role as Head of Investor Relations.Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be available on our website later today.I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website. I would also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks, are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I would like to cover the differences between reported an adjusted earnings this quarter. These are displayed on slide three. For the quarter, we reported a loss of $1.48 per share on a GAAP basis. This quarter, there were several significant non-operational charges that we\u2019d like to highlight. The largest item is a pre-tax charge of $7.2 billion related primarily to the non-cash yearend mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities. This charge is due primarily to changes in the discount rate and other actuarial assumptions, as well as the annuitization of various pension liabilities during the quarter.On an after-tax basis, this charge amounted to $4.4 billion or $1.55 per share. We also incurred pre-tax charges of $1.4 billion related to early retirement of debt and other restructuring activities. Most of the charges are debt redemption costs resulting from a tender offer for a high coupon note during the quarter. On an after-tax basis, this charge was $871 million or $0.31 per share.By excluding $1.86 per share for these non-operational charges, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.38. This adjusted result includes $319 million of direct impact from superstore Sandy which equates to $0.07 per share. Excluding the Sandy impacts, adjusted EPS would have been $0.45 for the fourth quarter and full year results on the same basis would have been $2.31 per share.With that, I will turn the call over to Fran.Fran ShammoThanks John. Good morning everyone and Happy New Year. Before we get into the details, let me start with some overview comments to put our fourth quarter and 2012 results in context.As we have outlined in the past, our strategy is to build upon the strong foundation of our superior network assets as platforms for growth and innovation. This positions us in the center of the trends that are driving growth in our industry. We have been consistently focused on better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business to capture growth opportunities in three key areas.In wireless, we\u2019re looking to take advantage of opportunities driven by the rapid evolution of 4G LTE. Another key area is FiOS, where we are looking to further penetrate the consumer and small business markets. We\u2019re also looking to drive growth in enterprise strategic services, particularly in the areas of global IP, Cloud computing, security and managed services.From a financial standpoint, our focus is on execution, capturing incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business, increasing our cash flow and improving our earnings profile. During the year, we made good progress across the entire business which I will detail more in the segment reviews.In addition to our solid execution, we also continued to make smart investments for future growth and improved profitability. While very disciplined in our approach to capital spending, we continued to invest in networks and new technologies which will be the platforms for accelerated growth going forward.On the strategic front, we closed several key transactions that will significantly improve our competitive position, namely the acquisition of additional spectrum, the purchase of Hughes Telematics, the creation of Redbox Instant by Verizon, our continued investment in Verizon Digital Media Services and the annuitization of $7.5 billion of pension obligations. We are also focused on joint efforts around innovation with a number of partners and we expect to continue to build on our leadership position in the rapid development of the 4G LTE ecosystem.From a shareholder value perspective, we generated a total return of 13.2% in 2012 through a combination of stock price appreciation and dividends.For the sixth consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase, indicating their confidence in the sustainability of our business model, cash flows and improved earnings profile in 2013 and beyond.Let\u2019s begin with a brief look at consolidated results, starting with slide 5. Revenues from strategic growth areas drove a $5 billion improvement in our topline in 2012 and increased our annual growth rate by 50 basis points to 4.5%.In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue growth increased to 5.7%, which was our highest quarterly growth of the year. Our positive momentum in wireless and FiOS, together with our continued focus on improving the revenue mix in our enterprise business gives us confidence that we can drive topline growth in 2013.Let\u2019s take a closer look at earnings on slide 6. Our strong focus on cost management and improving profitability resulted in double digit growth in adjusted operating income for the year. Through the first nine months, we posted double-digit adjusted earnings growth. In the fourth quarter, our bottom line results were impacted by decision to take advantage of our strong wireless market position, which enabled historic customer growth and smartphone penetration gain.Additionally, the significant challenges created by super storm Sandy, certainly had an impact on the business in the fourth quarter. As a result, 2012 earnings per share adjusted for the non-operational charges John outlined earlier, came to $2.24. One additional comment I would make related to Sandy is that while we were able to specifically identify a direct impact to the wireline business in the fourth quarter, it was extremely difficult to effectively quantify the actual impact to normal operations. I will talk more about this later.Now let's move into a review of the segments starting with wireless on slide seven. As one of our key growth platforms, we have consistently invested in wireless to differentiate ourselves in terms of network quality, reliability, and the overall customer experience. Five year ago, we made a bold commitment to 4G LTE as the next generation technology. Since then we have invested in the technology and its deployment.We secured valuable spectrum. We fostered our robust device ecosystem. And this past year, we introduced share data plans that changed the industry\u2019s pricing framework. These actions have resulted in consistent sequential growth throughout 2012. Coming off a strong third quarter, we made a strategic decision to take advantage of our 4G LTE lead and invest in growth, which resulted in a record high post paid gross and net adds in the quarter.In his keystone address at CES a few weeks ago, Lowell showcased our long-term vision of what is possible with the 4G LTE, highlighting innovation applications under development in areas like video, the connected environment, healthcare, and energy. Our new brand advertising campaign with the theme \u2018powerful answers\u2019 demonstrates our vision of network innovation and the many growth opportunities which will expand the industry in the coming years.In 2012, wireless operating revenues totaled $75.9 billion, up 8.1%. Wireless now represents more than 65% of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue. Service revenue increased $4.6 billion or 7.7% for the year, driven by connections growth and increasing smartphone penetration. This service revenue growth together with our intense focus on cost efficiency and our ability to retain customers is clearly helping to mitigate equipment cost pressures.Our success in capturing these cost savings resulted in higher profitability growth in 2012. EBITDA grew $3.2 billion or 12.2% for the year, and we expected our industry leading EBITDA service margins by 180 basis points to 46.6%. Let's now turn to a more detailed look at volume growth beginning on slide eight.Throughout 2012, we saw accelerating sequential growth in the postpaid market, culminating in record net adds in the fourth quarter. We had a great year of postpaid connections growth enabling us to gain market share. Postpaid growth additions were up 6%, and postpaid net adds increased by almost 800,000 to 5 million, our highest annual net add total in four years. During the fourth quarter, we added more than 2.2 million new retail connections, with 2.1 million postpaid and 142,000 prepaid. We have an industry leading 98.2 million retail connections with 92.5 million postpaid and 5.7 million prepaid.Our postpaid connections represent 35.1 million accounts. Within the postpaid net add mix this quarter, 1.9 million were smartphones and about 600,000 were internet devices. The remainder being the net change in basic phones. Postpaid gross adds in the quarter were a record 4.7 million, up 18% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. In terms of upgrades 9% of our postpaid connection space upgraded during the quarter, up from around 7% in the third quarter and less than the 10% we experienced a year ago. Our churn matrix continued to be market leading. Retail postpaid churn was 0.95%.Next, let\u2019s turn to slide nine and take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE. Our record sales volume in the fourth quarter included 12.5 million postpaid devices, more than 90% of which were phones. As we\u2019ve seen each quarter, an increasing majority of these phone sales were smartphones. In the fourth quarter, we activated 9.8 million smartphones, which was by far our highest total ever. About 65% of these smartphones were 4G LTE. In terms of Apple iPhones, we activated about 6.2 million in the quarter and almost half were 4G LTE.Android phones made up a majority of the remaining smartphones and over 95% were 4G LTE. Our smartphone penetration increased from 53% last quarter to 58%. A year ago, smartphone penetration was 44%.A key point of differentiation for us which speaks to our incremental revenue opportunity is the improved mix of gross adds and upgrades within our smartphone activations. In the fourth quarter, gross adds for new to Verizon represented about 30% of total smartphone activations, a sharp improvement from the 20% to 23% range we reported throughout 2011 and the first half of 2012.We also have an incremental revenue potential within our upgrades. as about 42% of customers upgrading this quarter were buying a smartphone for the first time. In addition, if we include customers upgrading from a 3G to a 4G LTE smartphone, considering the likelihood of higher data usage, we can say that three out of four upgrades represent incremental revenue going into 2013.Customer adoption of 4G LTE is really gaining momentum. While we have seen a steady increase in sales of 4G LTE devices each quarter since we launched service, the sequential increase in the fourth quarter was much more dramatic. Total 4G LTE device sales increased to $7.3 million, up 60% from the third quarter. Smartphone activations represented $6.4 million of this total, up 74% sequentially. Virtually all internet device sales in the quarter were 4G LTE, with turbo sales doubling over the third quarter.At the end of the year, 4G LTE phones and devices represented 23.3% of total retail postpaid connections. 34% of our smartphones and 58% of our internet devices are now 4G LTE. Almost half of our total data traffic is on the 4G LTE network, which we believe is five times more efficient than 3G. As we have stated throughout the year, we are no longer adding capacity to our 3G network.While the 4G LTE connections and data volumes are impressive, we expect that these percentages will continue to grow as all new smartphones in our device roadmap will be 4G LTE. In terms of 4G LTE geographic coverage, we are by far the market leader. Our 4G LTE service is currently available in 476 markets, covering more than 273 million pops or about 89% of the U.S population. We intend to continue leveraging our advantage and expanding coverage, with the goal of having a nationwide 4G LTE footprint similar to our 3G network by midyear 2013.Let\u2019s take a closer look at our quarterly revenue performance on slide 10. Total wireless revenues grew 9.5% to $20 billion in the fourth quarter. Service revenue grew 8.5% in the fourth quarter, driven by equally strong retail service revenue growth. As you know, last quarter we begun disclosing new retail postpaid metrics, replacing ARPU with ARPA, as well as providing the number of postpaid accounts and the average connections per account.During the quarter, ARPA grew to more than $146 per month, an increase of 6.6%. The average connections per account increased to 2.64, up more than 4%. In just six months, 23% of our postpaid accounts are on a shared everything plan. Customers are quickly recognizing the value proposition. Adoption is ahead of our expectations and we continue to see customers adding devices to their plans and increasing their users tiers.Let\u2019s conclude our wireless review on slide 11. Our EBITDA service margin of 41.4% in the quarter was impacted by higher retail gross adds and the increased mix of smartphone sales this quarter, in addition to stronger indirect channel performance. During the fourth quarter we activated 2 million more smartphones than we did a year ago and saw only an 80 basis point differential in the margin. In terms of absolute dollars, we generated $6.8 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, which is an increase of 6.3% year-over-year. This strong customer growth and increased smartphone penetration drove service revenue and increased ARPA.Our intense focus on cost efficiency is helping to mitigate the cost of equipment subsidies and commissions. Our industry leading customer retention is also a key factor in our profitability, which is a testament to the quality and reliability of our network and to the overall customer experience. Verizon Wireless continues to be the industry leader and we have great momentum heading into 2013. We fully expect to sustain our very strong service revenue growth and increase our profitability this year.Last year, we saw margins recover quickly from heavy smartphone sales in the fourth quarter of 2011. In 2013, we expect the wireless EBITDA margins will rebound within the range of the record levels we reported in the second and third quarter of 2012. Let's move next to our wireline segment starting on slide 12.In wireline, we are focused on migrating customers to fiber assets which provide better services and capabilities, such as FiOS, IP-based applications, and cloud solutions. These services are also more efficient and in the long run improve our cost structure. The wireline business made positive strides in 2012 and fundamentals are improving in the strategic growth areas. From a topline perspective, we have encouraging signs in the consumer market, where we posted the strongest topline growth in ten years.In enterprise, we continue to manage through the secular and global economic challenges. Our product rationalization initiatives are also putting near-term pressure on revenue growth, but we are confident that these initiatives which include significant efforts in the area of process and systems streamlining, will prove to be the right decision as we build a fundamentally stronger business.In terms of profitability, we do not see the margin improvement we were expecting in the second half of 2012, due primarily to the length of the time it took to reach an agreement with our unions and also to the significant business disruption caused by the challenges of Sandy. Our 2012 EBITDA margin of 21.3% includes $319 million of direct impact from Sandy. Again, it was very difficult to effectively quantify the indirect impact caused by this disruption. Sandy had a dramatic effect, particularly on the wireline business due to the heavy concentration of damage in the New York metropolitan area.Our challenge was to restore service to customers as quickly as possible while still managing to meet the demand for new services. We also made a strategic decision to use storm restoration as an opportunity to accelerate fiber migrations in both the enterprise and FiOS markets.During the course of the year, we successfully migrated 223,000 residential homes to fiber, exceeding our target for 2012. These customer migrations increased in the second half of the year and picked up considerably in the aftermath of Sandy. From an operational standpoint, we saw an 11% improvement in our overall copper-trouble report rate for the year. This marked the first decline in four years and helped to lower the number of dispatches and reduce our repair costs. Providing these customers with a greater opportunity to purchase FiOS services is also gaining some traction.For customers that have decided to upgrade to additional FiOS services, we are seeing a $45 lift in monthly ARPU. We are pleased with our progress to date and view the copper-to-fiber migration plan as an important part of our strategy to reduce the wireline cost structure. In 2013, we are targeting an additional 300,000 homes within the FiOS markets.Let's take a closer look at the revenue components, starting with mass markets on slide 13. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue growth of 4.1% was driven by FiOS, where revenue increase nearly 16% and now represents about 68% of consumer revenue. Consumer revenue growth was impacted in the quarter by service credits and customer billing suspensions resulting from Super Storm Sandy. The increasing scale of FiOS is driving growth in consumer ARPU which increased to more than $105 per month, up 9.5%. FiOS ARPU is now over $150 per month and two thirds of our FiOS consumer customers are triple play, with voice, internet and video services.In terms of broadband customer growth, we had 144,000 new FiOS internet additions in the quarter and now have 5.4 million subscribers, representing penetration of 37%. In HSI or DSL, we had a net loss of 117,000 customers. Net broadband subscribers were a positive 27,000, marking an improvement over the past two quarters.Looking at the full year, broadband revenue growth improved by 3.1%, in spite of the fact that subscriber growth slowed to 1.4%. This revenue growth was driven by customers buying up in speed, taking advantage of our FiOS quantum offers. I would also attribute some of the improvement to our corporate fiber migration initiative.In FiOS video, we added 134,000 in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.7 million which is 33% penetration. Our FiOS customer growth in the fourth quarter was very good. In fact, net adds were greater than the second and third quarters. This was in spite of the significant disruption caused by the Sandy restoral efforts. In contrast to the second half of 2011, we decided to aggressively meet the increased demand for our FiOS services by authorizing overtime so that we did not lose customers by making them wait until we caught up to the backlog.I would also add that our residential connection trends continued to improve. During the fourth quarter, we lost 156,000 retail residential connections, representing a 6.2% decline year over year, compared with the loss of 183,000 or 7.3% at this time last year.Let\u2019s move to our enterprise markets next on slide 14. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined $83 million or 2.1%, all of which was due to lower CPE sales. Strategic services, which comprised 54% of global enterprise revenue, totaled $2.1 billion and were up 5.3%.During the quarter, we continued to see delays in new contracts and investment decisions as enterprises exercise caution with regard to the fiscal cliff, potential tax reform and other government policy changes. This uncertainty created a wait and see approach that clearly impacted new business in 2012. We continue to believe that as these factors evolve, companies will be in a better position to make decisions about their capital commitments. We remain hopeful that enterprises will renew their investing activities in 2013.Moving next to global wholesale. Fourth quarter revenues declined $168 million or 8.7% year over year, due primarily to continued declines in transport services. Again, our strategy is to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and better position the business in the fiber based Ethernet data services space as customers with Special Access transition from DS1s and DS3s.Let\u2019s conclude our wire line review on slide 15. In the second half of the year, we saw some improvement in topline performance. In the fourth quarter, wire line revenue was down 1.5%, repressing an 80 basis improvement over the rate of decline in the third quarter. Sequentially, revenue increased $76 million or 0.8%. in terms of cost, as I said earlier, this was a very challenging quarter and far from normal when you factor in the additional resources devoted to Sandy restoral efforts and to quickly catching up on our FiOS order backlog.On the labor front, after 400 days of negotiations with our unions, we have a fair and balanced three year agreement that is good for our employees as well as a positive for the business.In the consumer and mass markets business, we are confident that several factors will lead to an increasing contribution to wire line profitability in 2013. These include our focus on driving FiOS revenue growth and improving our operating and capital efficiency, the continued success of our copper to fiber migration initiative and the benefits of the new union contracts.In enterprise, we still see uncertainty around the debt ceiling, deficit reduction and tax reform. We are all looking at the same published reports about international economic growth which point to continued pressure on enterprise spending. We believe the actions we are taking will ultimately improve our cost structure and are the right steps to improving wire line profitability. In the short term, we expect similar performance within our enterprise unit. If some of the uncertainty is dealt with by Washington, than things can improve throughout 2013. I would like to turn now to slide 16 to discuss our cash flow results and how we further strengthened our balance sheet in 2012.Our free cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year was once again a combination of strong cash generation and disciplined capital spending. For the year, cash flow from operations grew 5.7% to $31.5 billion and free cash flow increased to $15.3 billion, up 13%. Capital expenditures for 2012, totaled $16.2 billion, down about $70 million from last year. Capital expenditures for 2012, totaled $16.2 billion, down about $70 million from last year. This includes about $135 million in capital related to Sandy.Our capital efficiency improved ending the year at 14%. With the heavier investments to transform our business largely behind us, we expect our CapEx to revenue ratio, which is already at a historical low, to continue to decline based on disciplined capital spending and sustainable revenue growth.In wireless, CapEx in the fourth quarter increased to $2.8 billion and we finished the year at $8.9 billion, down 1.3%. In 2012, we allocated more capital to 4G LTE to expand coverage. In the fourth quarter, we also pre-positioned additional capacity in certain key markets. As more customers choose 4G LTE smartphones and devices, we expect that the continued migration of data traffic from 3G to our lower cost 4G LTE network, will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency in 2013 and beyond.In wireline, capital spending was $1.7 billion in the quarter to finish the year at $6.3 billion, down about 1%. Our balance sheet and credit metrics remained very strong. Total debt of $52 billion was down more than $3 billion or 5.7% from the end of last year. We ended the year with the net debt of $48.9 billion and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.3 times. In December, we closed the pension annuitization transaction with prudential, transferring $7.5 billion of management retiree pension benefit obligations by purchasing the group annuity contract. This transaction was part of an overall pension de-risking strategy which will reduce our exposure to funding and income statement volatility caused by changes in investment returns, discount rates and longevity risks.This transaction also provides us with additional financial flexibility. In the fourth quarter, we contributed an additional $1.7 billion in pension funding to end the year at $3.5 billion, which is in line with what I indicated on our third quarter call. Again, we do not expect any cash funding requirement for qualified pensions in 2013 and based on our current plan assumptions, we expect contribution requirements in future years to be lower as a result of this transaction.Let's move now to our summary slide. We enter 2013 with great confidence in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. We have great momentum in wireless and we expect to build on that strength, driving further penetration of devices and extending our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets and continue to differentiate ourselves with our superior internet and video services. In the enterprise space, we will continue to aggressively market our strategic services, demonstrating to customers that we have a unique set of capabilities to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure.In terms of our cost structure, we will continue to drive operating efficiencies across and throughout the entire business. We continue to dedicate resources to examine all cost and processes, including product rationalization, services provisioning, back office operations and systems. Our ability to effectively execute and capture these incremental revenue opportunities and operating efficiencies will result in increased profitability, higher cash flows and improved earnings growth in 2013 and beyond. Lowe and I have challenged our business leaders to build on the strong foundation we have, accelerate the momentum we have achieved, improve our investment returns and drive significant shareholder value.With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can address your questions.John DohertyThanks Fran. Brad, let\u2019s open it up for our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions). Your first question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman SachsThanks and good morning. Fran, maybe quick question on wireless margins and maybe just a clarification on your outlook comments. I think you said you can get back to margins that we saw in the second and third quarter of this year which was in the 49% to 50% range. Was that a full year comment or was that a 2Q and 3Q of \u201913 comment? And if it\u2019s full year, that\u2019s 200 to 300 basis points of margin expansion in wireless. Just help us think through the drivers of that. And then second, on capital spending we\u2019ve heard three of the industry peers in wireless talk about an upwards bias to CapEx as we head into 2013. At the same time, you\u2019re winding down the initial LTE build and talking about declining capital intensity. Just help us think through maybe your confidence in the ability to sustain network leadership position in wireless given that. Thanks.Fran ShammoGood morning Jason. Thanks for the question. So on the Verizon Wireless margins, that was a view of a full year range and I think that if you look at just the fundamentals of the business, I would say that our fundamentals are more sound than they were a year ago. If you look at this business, it grew EBITDA $3.2 billion or 12% and that was with a historical growth rate in the fourth quarter of this year. We gained significant market share that will carry us into next year with 5 million net adds. If you look at our ARPA growth, our ARPA growth was over $9 from a year ago and that\u2019s on a base of 35 million accounts. So the fundamentals of this business are extremely strong and I have no doubt that we will return to a margin progression of where we left the second and third quarter.On the CapEx side of the house, the guidance I would give for \u201913 is no different than what I\u2019ve said before which is we will be flat. That is in addition with all of the 4G LTE continued buildup that we have. I would tell you that we ended this year slightly higher than we probably had expected in midyear, but there were two factors for that. Number one, hurricane Sandy or Superstorm Sandy created us to incur $135 million of additional wire line capital. But in addition, we also proactively spent another $300 million on the wireless side to preposition our AWS spectrum that we originally planned for 2013 and we advanced that into 2012 and that was because we were coming off such a strong third quarter and we knew that by investing in the growth for the fourth quarter, that we were going to need to preposition this. So in essence we\u2019ve actually forward advanced some \u201913 capital. So I\u2019m very confident that we will not end up where some others will be and that our CapEx will be flat for \u201913. Thanks for the question, Jason.John DohertyThanks, Jason. Brad, let\u2019s take the next question please.OperatorOur next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorganThanks. First a follow up a little bit on Jason. On the wireless side, can you help us break into that 49% to 50%? Last year you talked about $2 billion cost cutting effort. Can you help us quantify that? And then second, as that leads into earnings per share growth, can you help us with a range of what EPS growth should be this year? Seems like a real acceleration is possible.Fran ShammoThanks Phil, good question. So first on the 49% to 50%, as you know over the last three years we\u2019ve taken $5 billion worth of cost structure out of wireless. We have another $2 billion of target for this year and we already have all those initiatives established for the $2 billion. Now that will happen over the course of the year. So we will continue on that. In addition, we\u2019ve also launched our Verizon Lean Six Sigma which will also contribute to the reduction of the cost structure within wireless. But also I would extend that that as we consolidate and I\u2019ll use finance as an example, as we consolidate the finance organization to the middle, we will actually take cost structure out of wireless, but we will also implement Verizon Lean Six Sigma around the entire organization and reduce the full cost of finance across the board.So again, some of the corporate Verizon Lean Six Sigma will also help reduce the cost structures of the individual units, including wireless and wire line. As far as EPS guidance, I\u2019m not going to give specific guidance today, but what I would tell you is that if you look at the first three quarters of 2012, our approximate growth was 15% year-over-year. And as I said, I am more confident in the fundamentals of this business today than I actually was a year ago. So that should give you some sense of my confidence for 2013.OperatorOur next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.John Hodulik - UBSMaybe two if I could. First, Fran, you have given some good guidance on the wireless margins and some of the consolidated. Maybe a little bit on wireline, you are going through this VES repositioning, can you talk about the progress there and maybe give us a sense for what kind of wireline margin improvement we can see on year-over-year basis? And then secondly, with the CapEx intensity coming down and some of the stuff you have done to de-risk the pension we have talked a little bit about buybacks and maybe for coming part of the discussion by the end of year, how do you feel about it given what you have seen here in 2012?Fran ShammoSo on wireline. First, I guess I want to take a few minutes on this one because obviously there is two separate components to this. One is the consumer side and then one is the enterprise side. So let\u2019s start with the consumer. Obviously, for the fourth quarter I mean consumer and wireline was significantly impacted by Sandy. And as I said on my opening remarks, it was almost impossible for us to really calculate the impact that that had.But putting that aside, I think the strength of the platforms that we have build on will continue to drive the profit of wireline. So first, copper-to-FiOS migrations, we completed 223,000 this year. Our target is 300,000 next year. This is significant reducing the cost structure of wireline from a repair perspective and as I said in opening remarks, 11% reduction for the first time in repair load from truck roll. So our strategy is working.Than we talk about the strategic pricing around FiOS. And I said a year ago that we were not disciplined around our price-ups and we started that in 2012, and as I said coming out of the third quarter, we already had our strategy laid out for \u201913. So that strategy will continue to help offset the content cost increase. In addition, FiOS quantum. If you look at what we have done over this last year, we have really solidified the strategy around speed. And what we are seeing as customers migrate from that copper and even current customers are buying up in the speeds because they realize the quality products that we have.Then if you go and look at just the union agreements and some of the pension things we did, this all culminates on the consumer side. Now, having said that, there are other things that we are investing in that put a little pressure on the wireline margin. So for instance Redbox. Redbox was a startup this year. We incurred startup costs like any startup company would. That put pressure on us in the back half of this year. Hughes, we acquired Hughes. It was a loss company. We are building back that company. They are doing an excellent job on acquiring contracts. We have one that we signed recently that will launch in the second and third quarter of this year. So we are actually adding 200 to 250 people in that business to get ready for that new auto company that we signed this agreement with in Telematics.So again, continuing to grow on that platform. VDMS is also another startup that we incurred some operating expense with no associated revenue. So when you look at Redbox, Hughes, and VDMS, these will all start to contribute to topline in wireline for 2013, but again, probably not much in the profit area. Because they are all startups and I would think that in 2014 these will really start to contribute to the overall profit. On the Verizon enterprise side, obviously my view on this one is, the best that we can hope for is flat at this time, because of all the uncertainty.Now as I said in my opening remarks, if we can get rid of some of the uncertainty around debt ceiling and deficit reduction and especially tax reform, I think this will open up for companies to start to invest again. But given that in this time of repair, we are actually building out the platforms with Terremark, and again Hughes and Verizon digital media services. So I think we are making all the right strategic moves around the product rationalization. So having all this combined, I am confident that we can improve our profit in wireline 2013 over 2012.Now on the share buyback. Given everything that we have done this year, I think we are exiting this year with a really strong balance sheet. We executed on our pension annuitization. We declined our debt by over $3 billion. We also strengthened our balance sheet from other means as well. So when you take this all in combination and the strong cash flow performance on a year over year basis even with the growth that we did in the fourth quarter and the impact of Sandy, I originally stated that share buyback would be something that we would do at the end of 2013. I am in a position now that we could do share box at any point in time right now, but I would call it an opportunistic time. So if the opportunity presents itself in our share price, then I would contemplate buying back shares. So hopefully that answers the question, John.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBSYeah. Thanks for all the detail, Fran.John DohertyThanks, John. Brad, let\u2019s take the next question please.OperatorOur next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan StanleyGood morning. Just a follow up on John\u2019s question there. Do you need any more authorization or how much do you currently have available if you wanted to buy back over the next few weeks? And then a couple of other cash items. Given the extra year of bonus depreciation, have you got a sense of what your cash taxes might be this year and perhaps you can update us on the 700 megahertz sale process. Thanks.Fran ShammoThanks Simon. So the first one on the cash buyback, we have a shelf registration of 100 million shares. So there\u2019s no issue there. On the second one, let me come back to that. On the 700 megahertz, we have completed some deals to date. On the side of the licenses side, we closed our deal with T-Mobile back in the third quarter of this year on the swaps. We previously agreed to sell 35 out of 77 700megahertz licenses on the B block side to 10 different purchasers and some of them are still pending at the FCC. We also agreed to sell four out of our 700megahertz A block licenses to four different purchasers and two of them are still pending at the FCC. So we continue to look at suitable deals for the others and if they come through the process, this will then take that through the regulatory process.So at this point that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. On the cash taxes, as I\u2019ve said before, this community kept questioning about the increase in my cash tax in 2013 and I kept telling everyone that we had plans in place that even with bonus deprecation going away, that would not happen. Now with bonus deprecation there, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve reflected back to the share buyback and why we\u2019re in a different position here. So I think that all ties together. But our effective tax rate for going into next year would be the same as the guidance that I gave this past year which is anywhere from 31% to 33%.Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan StanleyHelpful. Thank you.John DohertyThanks, Simon. Brad, let\u2019s take the next question please.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment. Your line is open.Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup Investment ResearchThanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, just the typical Verizon Wireless net debt question, if we could just get an update on that balance at the end of the year. And then secondly, as you think about the wireless margin guidance that you laid out for 2013, can you talk a little bit more about what\u2019s going on with the device replacement rate which can add some sensitivity to the margins. Do you think that will be a faster rate of replacement, same or even lower in 2013? If you could talk about some of the drivers that are contributing to that. Thanks.Fran ShammoThanks, Mike. So on the net debt side of the house, Verizon Wireless is $9.3 billion net debt. They actually have about $1.4 billion worth of debt maturing in \u201913 which we at this point plan to retire. Just on the overall handsets, this really goes I think to the question of the upgrade rate and what do we see. And again as we saw this year as I said, we would see an uptick in upgrades going into the fourth quarter from the third quarter, but we would be down from a year ago and that\u2019s exactly what happened. I would say that \u201913 is probably a flat year on an upgrade basis to this year. So I don\u2019t see any incremental increase, but it\u2019s the quality of the upgrades that we\u2019re really focused in on and if you look at the progress of basic phones, this year we had a significant amount of basic phone upgrades. So if you look at a year ago, a year ago we moved about in the fourth quarter 3.5 million basic phones. That was cut by 50% this year.So you\u2019re still going to have a population that only wants a basic phone riding off of the 3G network, but what we\u2019re seeing is as the prices of the smartphones have decreased, there\u2019s an incremental population that are coming into that smartphone category and again every single one of these adds and every single one of these upgrades, except for a few who are willing to pay full price for the smartphone, are moving into our share price plan. And as I said, 23% of our accounts now are in share pricing and you can see what\u2019s happening from a revenue increase perspective and a device attachment perspective. So again I think that from a pure upgrade perspective it\u2019s flat, but the quality of the upgrades I think just continues to get better into 2013.OperatorOur next question is from Mike McCormack of Nomura Securities. Your line is open.Mike McCormack - NomuraYeah, Fran, just not to beat a dead horse here on the full year guide, but I am assuming that you are anticipating iPhone refresh at some point in time. And then just thinking about, as we look forward over the next year or so, smartphone penetration obviously getting close to 60% now. How do we start to offset the impact of this smart to smart migration on margins generally? And I know you talked about 4G driving some additional revenue opportunity there, but how should we think about the margins longer-term as we get smartphone penetration reaching, let\u2019s call it 80%, and then we are seeing much more of the smart to smart to impact.Fran ShammoThanks, Mike. I guess the way I look at this is, is that there is more to this than just the smartphone category. So if you look at, again, of what we are doing with shared and the increase of the revenue and the attachment of other devices. So if you look at our internet device category including the tablets, we had one of our strongest quarters from another device attachment rate than we have had in the past. This all drives the revenue. So when you think about the increase in the service revenue side because this does not go with just concentrating on the subsidy of the handset. Because the subsidy of the handset although higher than a basic phone would be, these drive incremental revenues from usage perspective. And especially when you have a platform like the LTE with the speed and the video consumption that people are using and the buying up of the tiers that they have.And then you think about machine to machine and the opportunities for mobile payments and other solutions that are going to ride off of the Hughes platform. We have many, many opportunity to offset the subsidy with the incremental revenue. Now having said that, on the subsidy side of the house, you can see that the price of the handsets continued to decline. We now have the Windows platform in our mix and we saw some steady albeit slow increase in some of the uptake of that platform. But as we get more and more platforms in the mix and now we have RIM out there again, there is going to be incremental competition, there will be subsidy reduction as there was in the basic phone history in the ecosystem.So again, this is full management of the P&L. This is just not locking in one item on the P&L. And if you can culminate that with the $5 billion reduction in cost and then the other $2 billion that we have this year, again, I am very very confident in the fundamentals and the trajectory that we have going into 2013.Mike McCormack - NomuraFran, what was the initial impact on the pool data plans? I think you guys had anticipated some potential risk of dilution there. What was the initial experience for those that are signing up?Fran ShammoMike, can you just -- I think we missed the front end of that question. Could you just restate it please?Mike McCormack - NomuraJust the pool data plans. I think you guys had talked initially about some potential early dilution when you switched over those plans. I am just trying to get a sense for what the early experience has been.Fran ShammoYeah, the early adaptors, Mike, obviously were in fact dilutive. But it wasn\u2019t as much as we had expected. And if you look at the ARPA growth that we are generating now, it actually is way offsetting any of that initial dilution. So we are in a very good place with the shared price plan.OperatorOur next question is from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Your line is open.Kevin Smithen - MacquarieCan you discuss how you evaluate various uses of free cash flow with spectrum purchases last year, CapEx flat and tackling the pension. Looks like you have a lot more free cash flow this year. You have talked about the buyback but you have also mentioned some cloud, video wireline growth initiatives, potentially raising the dividend. Or would you say powder for Vodafone or other wireless M&A. How do you balance all those out and should we think about a little bit of all of them or the focus on the buyback, given where the stock is right now.Fran ShammoKevin, I think you answered the question. All encompassing in your answer. But, look, I think it\u2019s all of the above. Again, I think we left this year in a very, very good solid place. We bought spectrum last year, we bought Hughes last year, we made some significant investments. We continue to invest in that Redbox platform, the Hughes platform, as we acquired it. We continue to build out the Terremark asset that we acquired over a year and half ago. So it\u2019s all of the above. And share buyback, dividend policy, deleveraging, is all encompassed in that strategy. So again, I think you answered the question given everything you said.OperatorOur next question is from Tom Seitz of Jefferies. Your line is open.Tom Seitz - JefferiesOne on wireline and one on wireless, if I could. On wireline, can you help us think about the impact to wireline margins of the copper migration over time? Texas is one of the oldest FiOS markets and I believe you\u2019ve said in the past that video and internet penetrations there are in the high 40% range. You already had the more favorable union contract down there, more forward looking state regulatory environment. Are margins in Texas better by a few basis points or are they on order of magnitude better? Any framing you could do in that area would be great. And then on the wireless side, BlackBerry 10 launches this quarter. You just mentioned it. It\u2019s reported to be another expensive device. When you look at your BlackBerry base, is there any chance at all that this handset has an unusual impact to the first quarter or second quarter that could impede the improvement you outlined? And if you can indulge me, any view your product guys have on RIM becoming the third competitive OS now that they\u2019ve seen the device?Fran ShammoThanks Tom. So on the Texas market, I\u2019m not going to specifically speak to any individual market of FiOS. It\u2019s not a good thing for me to do that at this point in time. But what I would tell you is that it is the highest penetration of our market. It is a very profitable market. So given where we are in Texas which was the first market we launched, we know that the rest of the markets can achieve those types of penetration rates which we\u2019re in the 50%. So there\u2019s no stopping us from a penetration rate and as we continue and you saw this quarter, we had a higher demand for the FiOS product and some of that was because quite honestly, Superstorm Sandy showed the reliability of the fiber network even in this type of a catastrophe. Copper does not mix with water. Fiber optics doesn\u2019t care if it\u2019s in water.So again the strength of how we build our reliable network with generator backup and all sorts of things just speaks to the popularity of this product. So I think that we\u2019re in a good position going into \u201913 overall with FiOS and I will tell you that year over year, FiOS continues to become more of a profitable product for us. So I\u2019ll answer it that way. On the BlackBerry 10 launch, given your question, no, I don\u2019t anticipate any unusual item that would cause me to come off of the statement that I made earlier. This is just yet another platform. We are hoping that the platform is successful. We have very loyal BlackBerry users in our base and we\u2019ll see how that goes. But all in we now have four operating platforms coming into the mix and again as I said before, I think more choice for our customers is better for us and for the consumer and for competition.Tom Seitz \u2013 JefferiesThanks Fran.John DohertyBrad, we have time for two more questions.OperatorOur next question is from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill LynchHey guys. Thanks very much. Welcome Mike. Just wanted to ask two if I could. Number one, Fran, on the upper growth that you saw, could you give us a sense as to the mix of the drivers in the growth year over year? Is it the volume coming from the Tablets connected devices and people coming from handsets to smartphones? Or with respect to the upgrade in the data plans, has that become a driver that you can quantify and grab onto yet? And then I guess the second question would be, as you have talked about starting to harvest the 3G network capacity, could you talk about how aggressive you plan on being in terms of trying to monetize the capacity that you have as customers move from 3G to 4G? I\u2019d imagine that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to especially get more aggressive in the prepaid side of the equation. Thanks.Fran ShammoThanks David. So on the ARPA growth, it's a combination of a lot of things. Obviously it's the \u2013 as we said, based on our view of when we launched this plan, we expected the uptake in the data consumption based on the LTE network and the speeds that that network can deliver. So as people consume more they will buy up in the tiers. And then in addition, it's the device attachment and this one is really considerable for us, because that's why we developed the plan we did and you can attach up to 10 devices. And what we're seeing is, as we said in the outset here, if 30% of these customers coming to us on smartphones are new to Verizon and what we see is that they come in at the low end of the devices onto the share price plan, and over a period of six-months they almost double the amount of devices that they put on the plan. So the device attachment, whether it's a tablet or a MiFi card, we launched a camera in the fourth quarter, so all these things will contribute to the attachment which will drive usage and then hence drives the ARPA increase. And then on to 3G network, yes, we stopped investing in that network. We obviously continued to sell the 3G iPhones on that network, which were very successful in the fourth quarter. So, again, we managed this network very closely. But look, I mean we made some moves in 2012 around prepaid and we will see where we go in 2013 but we will continue to utilize that network to contribute to the bottomline of the company.OperatorOur last question will come from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells FargoJust following up on David\u2019s question on the capacity. On the LTE coverage given it\u2019s almost complete, when will we see you adding more LTE capacity kind of through the lining up of spectrum, AWS spectrum that you got from the cable companies. And if you just....Fran ShammoSo we actually did pre-position, as I said this year we pre-positioned $300 million of capital to start positioning that AWS spectrum for capacity around LTE in some of the major markets. And that really was a result of our exiting the third quarter and the growth that we saw. And knowing that we were strategically going into and investing in the growth of the fourth quarter. So given all that we did pre-position the AWS spectrum and we will continue to do that as needed. So we are in a very good position with our LTE network. We are in a very good position with our license holding. So no issues at this point.Okay. So thank you everyone. Let me just close this real quick. First, just thank you for joining the call today, but also I wanted to just say thank you to John for his diligence here in the IR role and I wish him luck in his new mergers and acquisition, and business development role here at Verizon. And I take the opportunity to welcome Mike Stefanski to the team. So thank you again for joining the call and I look forward to speaking to each of you.John DohertyThanks, Fran. And, Brad, that concludes the call.OperatorLadies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. Your may now disconnect."]}}
