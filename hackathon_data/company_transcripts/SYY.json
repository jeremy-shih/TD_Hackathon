Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results represent continued momentum in the business, most notably in the top line fundamentals, driven primarily by solid case growth. The quarterly results also include some circumstances that created gross profit and expense challenges as well as some tax-related impacts that Joel will describe in a few minutes. Nonetheless, our strategy of delivering disciplined profitable growth remains our focus, and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year fiscal 2018 financial targets.","Our results for the second quarter include: sales increase of 7.1% to $14.4 billion, driven by U.S. Broadline local case growth of nearly 5%; gross profit growth of 5%; and adjusted operating expense growth of 5.3%, which delivered an adjusted operating income increase of 3.9% to $579 million; and an adjusted EPS increase of 34% to $0.78. Further adjusting to remove the beneficial change in our statutory tax rate, adjusted earnings per share grew 13.8% to $0.66. Joel will take you through the details in a few minutes.","We achieved these results in a favorable macroeconomic environment propelled by steady spending from businesses and households in the United States. Market conditions in the U.S. for foodservice operators remained somewhat favorable as sales at restaurants continue to rise, offsetting somewhat lower traffic counts. Economic growth in the international markets in which we operate is mostly positive, including modest growth in the foodservice sector. However, significant food cost inflation in our UK business, driven by a combination of both product cost increasing, along with less favorable currency translation, impacted both our volume growth and gross margins.","Transitioning to our quarterly results by business segment, beginning with U.S. Foodservice Operations. Sales grew 6.6% for the quarter, gross profit grew 5.1%, operating expenses grew 5.9% and operating income grew 3.6%. For the quarter, local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business was very strong at 4.8% and has now grown for 15 consecutive quarters. Local case growth, excluding acquisitions, was also strong at 4%. Cases grew by nearly 2% with national customers, driving overall case growth to a healthy 3.5%. The national customer case growth is the result of recently added new customers and we will continue to look for opportunities to grow in this segment in a disciplined and profitable manner.","While we are pleased with the gross profit growth we delivered this quarter, we continue to face challenges from escalating inbound freight costs, which have provided headwinds to our gross profit dollar growth. The industry is facing driver availability challenges, which is leading to increased lane rates for many carriers. As a result, our cost to move products has increased, and we've had to utilize more spot loads to transport goods. We are actively working to mitigate these risks and continue to ensure that Sysco remains a preferred customer with various carriers we work with.","From a product perspective, Sysco Brand continues to grow with local customers, making up almost 46% of cases purchased, which is up 37 basis points for the quarter versus the prior year. The consistent success we've seen is driven by a few factors, including the breadth of products that are offered across multiple categories and tiers, along with continued progress from our brand revitalization work and new innovation concepts.","Some examples of this work include products that offer our customers unique value through labor savings as well as on-trend products that fulfill specific customer needs. Our e-commerce ordering utilization continues to grow, and early indicators tell us Sysco customers who shop via digital platforms have higher penetration numbers versus customers who do not. We are pleased to see increased utilization. However, we continue to believe that providing choice to our customers in how they want to interact with us is the right strategy to ensure the best possible customer experience.","Turning our attention to cost in our U.S. Foodservice Operations. Our operating expense growth for the quarter was roughly 6%, driven by volume-based supply chain costs, startup costs related to some new national account business recently signed, continued investment in our selling organization and increased fuel prices. In supply chain, some of these costs are offset by improvements in productivity that are result of reengineering the delivery process to be more efficient while also providing higher service levels.","In the selling organization, we are once again adding marketing associates in an effort to accelerate our local sales and are doing so through a targeted insights-based approach where we have the greatest opportunities for growth. We continue to believe that our consultative approach to selling is the key driver for local case growth, and we believe these efforts will continue to enrich our customers' experience of doing business with Sysco.","Moving on to International Foodservice Operations. We had mixed results for the quarter with sales growing 9.3%, gross profit growing 4.1%, adjusted operating expenses growing 11.9%, and adjusted operating income declining 28.8%, driven by the reporting change from a calendar year to a fiscal year, investments in our supply chain transformation, and new change initiatives targeted to grow local customers all within our European business. Additionally, we had transition costs associated with the acquisition of a large customer in Mexico.","Our business in Canada had a strong quarter, with gross profit dollar growth of more than 4% and an operating leverage gap of nearly 2 points. This led to strong operating income growth, driven by an improving macroeconomic environment, increased restaurant traffic and improved execution of our customer-centric strategy.","Our business results across Europe were mixed. Looking at overall product costs, the UK continued to experience acute inflation of about 6% during the second quarter, driven by a combination of Eurozone sourcing and the relative impact of the pound sterling versus the euro. Also in the UK, we continue to invest in the supply chain transformation to multi-temperature facilities and fleet as well as new initiatives such as technology solutions that are being implemented to enrich the customer experience, which will ultimately lead to improved loyalty and local case growth.","Outside of the UK business, France and Ireland are performing well. France is driving solid top-line growth while recently completing key IT milestones that will help us to integrate the Davigel and Brake France businesses. This is another important step to build on our position as a leading European foodservice provider.","In Ireland, we are ahead of expectations in cost synergies from the merging of Brakes Ireland and Pallas Foods. And finally, in Sweden, we recently acquired a small produce company that has broadened the range of fresh fruit and vegetable products offered to our customers and we are seeing positive trends as a result.","As for our business in Latin America, we continue to be excited about the growth opportunities in this region. In Costa Rica, we continue to see solid growth and have continued our expansion of Cash & Carry locations to complement our Broadline footprint. In Mexico, we're absorbing the costs of adding a new customer and are due to annualize that addition next quarter. We remain confident in the performance of Mexico and expect continued growth in the future.","Our SYGMA segment continues to grow and performed well this quarter, producing high single-digit growth in sales and gross profit while expanding gross margins by 6 basis points. Operating income grew approximately 6%, and we are focused on continuing to improve operational performance that will contribute to long-term operating income growth.","And lastly, our Guest Supply entity continues to be a great business model, serving our hotel customers with various products and services, which help them to be successful. Although their overall results were slightly down for the quarter, we are confident in their ability to deliver growth in fiscal year 2018 and remain excited about the long-term potential for this business.","In summary, we feel good about the fundamentals of our business and about the trajectory we're on for fiscal 2018 to close out our initial 3-year plan. Despite the inbound freight and unique expense challenges we experienced in the second quarter, we continue to make progress on our customer and operational strategies to improve our customers' experience.","One example of this is Sysco's redesigned website sysco.com, which we'll be launching this week. This site will be enhanced to further enrich our customers' overall experience of partnering with Sysco and to provide all those looking to engage with Sysco, a clear understanding of the company's differentiated position within the foodservice industry. Showcasing Sysco's breadth of industry-leading innovative solutions, including products, services, and customer-facing technology, the updated site will reinforce Sysco's brand and recent positioning at the heart of food and service.","With that, now I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the top-line fundamental results for the second quarter. Our earnings growth reflects strong sales and case growth, partially offset by challenges from inbound freight, increased investment in our sales force and national customer startup costs in our U.S. operations. In addition, our continued transformation investments and integration costs in Europe, as well as the reporting change from a calendar year to fiscal year impacted our performance for the quarter.","This morning, I'll start with our quarterly results. For the quarter, sales grew 7.1%. gross profit grew 5% while adjusted operating expenses grew 5.3%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 3.9% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 34.5% to $0.78 per share. As Tom mentioned, when further adjusting for the tax benefit, our adjusted earnings per share grew 13.8% to $0.66. This further adjustment assumes a consistent statutory tax rate to the previous year and provides a better apples-to-apples comparison of performance on an EPS basis.","For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we saw foreign exchange benefit to sales of approximately 1%. Sysco experienced inflation across all of our segments in the second quarter. In our U.S. Broadline business, we experienced 3.3% inflation, driven by a few categories including meat, dairy and produce. The pace of inflation increases in some of these categories was rapid, ultimately driving overall inflation.","Within our international business, inflation was a combination of both product costs increasing along with currency translation in the UK. During the quarter, we had gross profit growth of 5%, driven by overall volume growth and improved Sysco Brand penetration. As Tom mentioned earlier, the increased inbound freight expense is a headwind for gross profit dollars as both the product cost and associated inbound freight both reside in our gross profit line.","Adjusted operating expenses grew 5.3% for the quarter. The increase in expense is largely due to overall volume growth, new customer startup costs, increased investments in our sales force and increased fuel prices in our domestic business as well as investments in our transformation and integration costs in our international business. As a result, we did not leverage operating expense growth to gross profit dollar growth in the way that we would have liked to. However, we expect to improve this trend in the third quarter and for the remainder of the fiscal year.","As it relates to taxes, our results for the second quarter were impacted by excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and additional tax credits. In addition, per the new tax reform legislation, we incurred a provisional estimated charge of $115 million for our onetime transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. And we incurred a provisional estimated benefit of $15 million related to the remeasurement of our accrued income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the change in our U.S. tax rate. Because we are halfway through our fiscal year, our U.S. statutory tax rate is prorated to 28%, retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year.","Our second quarter income tax expense include a tax benefit of approximately $64 million related to applying the lower rate to year-to-date earnings. Our U.S. statutory tax rate will change to 21% in fiscal year 2019.","Cash flow from operations was $933 million for the first half of fiscal 2018. Net CapEx for the first half of the year was $255 million or about 1% of sales, which was roughly flat to last year. Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2018 was $679 million, which is $313 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvement in free cash flow is largely driven by cash taxes that were not paid in the second quarter due to flood relief associated with Hurricane Harvey. We continue to expect strong cash flow for the full fiscal year 2018.","Now I'd like to transition to three business updates: first, regarding second half expectations. We still expect to see a stronger second half of the year including the international segment, as we align the Brakes Group calendar year to our fiscal year. Second, regarding U.S. tax reform. We currently estimate $200 million to $300 million in annual savings from lower taxes as a result of the Tax Act. We will continue to evaluate our options with regard to how to best utilize these savings and will do so consistent with our capital allocation priorities.","Finally, as a financial update, we expect our earnings per share for the second half of fiscal 2018 to be positively impacted by $0.09 to $0.13 as a result of tax reform changes related to the ongoing effective tax rate.","In summary, I remain confident that we're on track to achieve our three-year plan financial objectives, including the high end of the $600 million to $650 million range of improved adjusted operating income comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015, excluding Brakes. The fundamentals of our business remained strong as we expect to deliver solid local case growth and good gross profit dollar growth along with improved cost management. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning. Was hoping you could just help us kind of understand the components of the pressures on the margin, the inbound freight, the investments in the sales force and the startup costs. Can you quantify those? And just particularly on the inbound freight costs, how are you thinking about passing those along if those continue? And what is the mechanism to pass those on, on the local side and the multiunit side?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Good morning, Kelly. Let me take a cut at that and then give Joel an opportunity as well. Let's start with the freight and the margin side. So inbound freight obviously does impact our gross margins. And as I think everyone's fairly aware, there's been significant increases, specifically in spot loads in the marketplace, driven by carrier challenges with drivers primarily. A lot of it started with some of the recent storm activity in the our first quarter or the third quarter in the U.S. and has continued and we continue to see that impacting our business. We're able to pass on some of that certainly to our contract customers, and we are doing everything we can to try to move that along as quickly as possible.","But on our local customers, it's obviously a little more sensitive. We're having to deal with both product inflation and the cost of that inbound freight. And it's just a balancing act of how much of that you can move through at any point in time with those local customers. And so, we continue to work on that. We, I think, are doing as good a job as we can, leveraging in some of those tools we've built in our past and we've talked about regarding revenue management. But the fact remains that the rates that are increasing in some of those spot loads are dramatic, and we are struggling to be able to pass all that along.","That's one of the primary drivers obviously of the margin impact. The other things that we can talk more about is some of that customer mix is impacting margin. And obviously, the impact of inflation, while we're able to pass along some of that on a percentage basis, it's affecting the gross profit percentage. And then on costs, you'd asked about cost, a couple of comments there. The investment to sales force, we are, in fact, adding additional marketing associates. We believe that we got into a point where you heard us talk about leveraging data and analytics to target those resources. We're at a place where we believe we now can add effectively. Even though we're getting some leverage with e-commerce, we feel like there's enough opportunities, and we know where those opportunities are that we're now adding marketing associates again. And we feel really good about that and really do believe that will help us continue to accelerate our local case growth. So those are a couple of the headlines. Joel, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I think the only other thing I'd add is, we talked about some of the startup costs, again, we certainly have continued to talk about our disciplined approach to growing our business. And we did, as Tom mentioned earlier, take on some additional multiunit business and have incurred some startup costs associated with that. And so, I think the one thing I would take away from a lot of that stuff, certainly, some of the challenges in the inbound freight were certainly actively again (22:21) to do something with. And these other areas with some of the investments in the sales force as well as some of the startup costs for some of these multiunit customers certainly over time obviously, we expect some benefit out of that to come through.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, that's helpful. And then just another one on the local case growth, obviously very strong, ahead of your target for the next couple of years I think the strongest growth on the local in several years over the past couple of years. But just curious if you feel like that was market share gains on the local side or you feel like that local customer in general is improving? I know it's hard to pinpoint, but what's your sense just from talking to your customers?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","I think, Kelly, it's a combination of all. I think we're certainly having success and gaining some share in certain markets. And I think as we've talked we feel pretty good about that local or independent customer, that restaurant operator, in particular their ability to continue to grow in the local marketplace. So I think it's a combination of both.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey great, good morning guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So just to go back, I know the big question on folks mind of course around is kind of the margins. And as you had mentioned in the past, in an inflationary environment, should we basically think of it as obviously the dollar's going up, the percentage going down. But I guess, more of my question is, as we're getting into the second half of the year when you're starting to go against compares that are less increases from last year, should we \u2013 I guess, maybe just any thoughts on how you see that in the back half of this year for folks would be helpful.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","So again \u2013 Vinnie, good morning.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","One, I think you got it right. Obviously, as with inflation, margin dollars are going to go up generally and the percentages are going to be pressured a bit. And we are seeing that. As an example, our gross profit per case has actually gone up in the second quarter. So we feel good about that. Remember though, this inbound freight thing is going to impact our gross profit line as well, so you got to continue to keep that in mind. That's beyond the inflation. And then I think as you think about it going forward, we're going to have some of those inbound freight challenges, we believe, will still be with us in the next couple of quarters. We're going to do everything we can to mitigate that and pass along where we can, but we know that's going to continue to be in there.","And I think not knowing exactly how inflation is going to play out and as you guys know and as we talked about a lot, it's not \u2013 even though it's an average number we talk about, there are certain categories that are moving a lot more than others and produce is a great example of that, certainly impacted by some of the activity and the storm activity that's affected various parts of the U.S.","So longwinded way of saying I think modeling going forward, you should probably expect some continued pressure on the gross margin percentage. But we should be continuing to be able to grow our gross profit dollars at the rates we've talked about, and our \u2013 for case gross profit, we anticipate to also be favorable.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yes. And I would just add, I mean, I think when you look at some of the other components, I mean, our Sysco Brand percentage continues to perform well. We continue to have benefit from category management. So I mean, there are some puts and takes on this. Certainly, we're calling out some of the headwinds, some of the challenges, but we certainly have some good things happening as well. And so, I think in general, we actually feel good about that moving forward. And certainly, on the margin piece, again when you factor out the impact of the freight and some of the inflation impact, again, I think overall, our margins are actually in a decent place as well.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. Just if you can give a little bit of an update just on the UK business? Obviously, we know that you've got inflation and some currency effects going on there. But just maybe more on kind of the fundamental investments that you guys have been making. I know you said kind of we're making these now for the longer term. But if you could give us an update maybe how kind of far in you are? Is that something that we should expect to kind of wind down over the next couple of quarters? How should we think about that?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","So good question. And so the UK is probably, of all those markets, the most unique. Everything from the Brexit impacts that are still obviously not all that clear and yet would be \u2013 ultimately the outcome of that's going to be in the marketplace. Because we source a lot of products for the UK out of other parts of Europe, that impact \u2013 the Brexit \u2013 Brexit basically, but on the pound sterling versus the euro, it's certainly having an impact on our costs. Therefore, the inflation we're having to try to pass along in the marketplace is quite high. And so, we've struggled to be able in all cases move that completely through and remain competitive.","So we talked about the impacts both on our gross profit, but also on our volume in that market. And some of that's driven by the competitiveness, and some of that's driven by the consumer not being as confident in that market as maybe they are certainly here in the U.S. And so, I think we're going to continue to see some of that on the margin line.","Regarding costs, when we acquired that business, they were on their journey of this multi-temp transformation. We are accelerating some of that across the UK and looking to get that in place. And so we still have certainly, I'd say another year or so of investments there that we have to make to get that up and running. And we feel good about it. We think it's the right thing for the long-term and it will certainly put us in a very solid position in the UK. But that investment's going to continue for a little while here.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. And I think just a couple of things on that also. Just in addition to the multi-temp transformation, there are some things that we're doing even from, in terms of the way we go to market there that we're making some investments as well. And so again some of that's going to be ongoing. The one thing I'll remind you though, and that we've been calling this out over the last couple of quarters, just to remind you. I mean there was a calendarization impact that you saw this quarter, and again we've certainly been foreshadowing here because as we switched the Brakes Group from a calendar year to a fiscal year, again, all those things were true about some of the investments in here. But again, just a reminder, some of the \u2013 I'd say somewhat acute performance that you saw this quarter certainly also, in large part, is related to some of the transformation in the year or the calendar, excuse me, transforming from a calendar year to our fiscal year, and some of that impacts is going to \u2013 you'll see some of that picked up in the second half of the year.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Okay. That's helpful color. Thanks very much, guys. Good luck.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Thanks.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So a couple of things. Let me start with, is inflation continuing to run here in this quarter kind of in that 3% range? And with respect to, have you seen any change in pricing, right? Because you look at the pickup in local case growth, I assume that had very little to do with any change in pricing on your end, so the price environment remains rational, is that fair?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Hey, John. Yes, a couple. So inflation, yes, we expect it to continue kind of the same pace that it has been. And from a pricing standpoint, no, we didn't see really any major changes or impacts. And certainly, we aren't investing in price at this point. So don't believe that's an issue or will be one going forward other than the normal competitive environment we operate in.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And if I look in the U.S. business, the margin pressure this quarter, do you think was that evenly split between inbound freight and impact of inflation, right? So inbound freight may be in that 10 basis point to 15 basis point range or is that not right?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","I don't know, we want to get that specific. Let me just remind you and everyone. We feel actually really good about the gross profit increase this quarter. We were up 5% in the U.S. and that's a really positive number even of the case growth numbers that we shared. So yes, all those things are impacting that number, including the addition of, while our local was good, we also had an increase in the CMU business, so that national account business, and those all impact that gross margin number.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yes, I would say, John, just on a real high level, there's probably a little more impact of inflation than the other, just kind of a high level.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. And then lastly, right, if you think about getting to $650 million for the year, right, your target pre-Brakes, U.S. EBIT probably has to step up from where it is, 300 basis points or 400 basis points in terms of growth. What's the biggest thing that changes? And is it more on the SG&A line? Or I imagine it's more on that line than gross or is that not right?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. It's on the SG&A line clearly. I mean, you saw the numbers. Again, we feel really good about where we're at from the top line and a gross profit perspective and we had some cost challenges that we're dealing with, but yeah.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. I just wanted to start with the inbound freight. Is that a structural thing that you kind of \u2013 or let me put it this way. Is that something you can fix structurally by increasing contracting or hauling it yourself? Or is that just something that's sort of you're stuck with and it's going to have sort of pass through as the market allows?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Look, I think we're doing everything we can to try to mitigate the impact. I think the part that's less controllable is as the overall shortage of drivers is there, the carriers are choosing what products they're going to haul and who's going to pay them the best rates to haul those products.","From a service standpoint for us and, I think, you all know in this industry we've got to have our products available for our customers and they've got to be there when they need them. So, we've got to make sure we've got them in our facilities. So the big impact to us has been having to pay higher rates to get the products here, so we can make sure we're servicing our customers. And we're always trying to balance that. But getting the products in the facilities to be on hand for our customers is job one for us.","So a longwinded way of saying, I think you should expect that we're doing everything we can but we're going to continue to see some challenges here as we try to impact that. It's not like we're going to pick up a lot more loads ourselves because we're not going to necessarily add the fleet to do that or move our outbound organization to handle inbound. So it really is something we've got to manage through our carrier partners.","Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. And just related to that as a follow-up, do you have any sense that \u2013 is that at all related to some of the things we've seen on the retail side of food \u2013 Walmart and Kroger have sort of \u2013 were getting shorted or they weren't happy with their logistics and tried to penalizing some of the vendors. Is this at all related to that or maybe some of the resources in the trucking world are going to make sure that's handled, or do you have any feel for that?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","It'd be hard for us to comment on whether that's driving it. I think we know what's started a lot of this was the storm activity. And we know then carriers were either being diverted to carry and handle other products that those areas of the country needed. There's been some rail issues, as I think have been well-documented that also put some additional pressure on the trucking industry. So there're probably a lots of things, but I don't know if we can comment or know anything specific to the points you made.","Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. And sort of a housekeeping and then I'll cede. For Joel, on the $200 million to $300 million range from tax reform that seems like you expect, it seems like a fairly wide range. Is that because you and your tax folks are still kind of figuring it out? Or is it more some of the discretionary things you can do with CapEx and other things?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I would say I mean probably a little bit of both. But I think \u2013 obviously, this thing is somewhat complicated and there's certainly a lot of things we're looking to do to optimize this, which would certainly impact the dollars. But I mean suffice it to say, certainly with the significance of our profits in the U.S., it's certainly going to be positive opportunity for us.","Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch back on the expense outlook for the second half. You called out a number of factors that impacted your second quarter customer startup costs, fuel costs, increased investments in international. How much of those do you expect to persist into the back half of the year? And which of those would actually alleviate and help you to get that better back half performance? Thank you.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Thanks, Marisa. So I think certainly, the startup costs, we anticipate those, obviously, going away or being much less in the third quarter and beyond. The investment in the selling organization, obviously, we're going to have that with us for a while, but we look at that also is them providing growth on the top-line. So the investment there, we think, gets covered pretty quickly with some of the other top-line benefits. And then as it relates to a couple of the other things, the calendar move was a one-time thing in the European or the UK \u2013 sorry, the European business, that calendar year to fiscal year. So those are the primary things. We talked about fuel \u2013 that isn't really \u2013 the fuel rate, that will probably continue here for at least another quarter or so. But those are the primary ones, I'd say.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yes. And I think some of the other investments we talked about in Europe also. I mean, those again, those continue to be ongoing. But I mean obviously, Marisa, there's certainly things that we're doing, we're working on that also ultimately \u2013 those aren't simply the only categories or things that we're dealing with, that we're focused on here. And so again, we said a couple of times, I mean, we certainly feel good about the remainder of this year and as we head into the second half of the year, I think certainly anticipate some of that cost pressure to mitigate some.","Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then just quickly to follow-up on that. For the MA sales force expansion, do you expect that to continue in the second half? Or was that more just the onetime step-up in 2Q? And then was the sales force investment, was that mainly just in the number of MAs that you're hiring or you're also seeing any wage pressures in that part of your business?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Great question. So think about it as we've added the resources now, so it's somewhat of a onetime or of an acceleration. And now that they're here, obviously, the costs will continue. But we don't look to continue to accelerate that beyond necessarily those numbers at least at any significant pace. And from a wage pressure standpoint, we really aren't seeing anything new or different for our business.","Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, and good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just circling back on the previous question. What was your productivity for the U.S. marketing associates during the quarter? And has it kind of capped out here? And should we expect it to decline slightly as you guys step-up investments in the selling organization?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Hey, Shane, so we don't necessarily talk about our share productivity metrics for our selling organization. But if your question is, are we feeling like they are continuing to be productive and grow in their productivity, the answer is yes. Obviously, the e-commerce work that we've been doing and the utilization continuing to grow is enabling that. In addition, the way we're resourcing and supporting them with this consultative model, we also feel like it's continuing to drive productivity.","The opportunity we saw was in targeted areas where we were underdeveloped, and we felt like we had now enough inside knowledge around where we could target those resources to drive incremental growth, specifically with our local customers. So that's why you're seeing the investment we're making, but we feel really good about that organization and the progress we keep making and the leverage we're getting with them across the business.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","And then Shane, the only other thing I would add is that I mean, as we one of the great, I would say, advances we've made as an organization is the ability to actually rollout new sales associates, once they get through their training with actually larger territories than we used to have with some of the tools, some of the things that we've talked about here. There, I would say, even the newer people are more productive faster in the world we're in today. And so I think that's also a benefit.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, I appreciate the color. And then just a question on the lower corporate tax rates, I mean do you guys think that gives you an advantage versus some of the smaller private distributors out there? I'm not sure how their taxes are, or if they're similar to yours or if they're completely different. Thanks.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Sure. So again, this is probably a little bit of me giving an opinion or speculating here. But I would say in many cases, as we've gone down the acquisition trail, we certainly have some exposure to some of the smaller distributors that are in our industry. And I would just say this. In some, not all, but in some cases, certainly, part of their goals of family-owned business is to minimize their tax that they would pay. And so, I would say that in general, our ability \u2013 again, given the amount of profitability we have in the U.S. and sort of again, just the amount of tax that we pay relative to our overall profitability, I would say that we have a good opportunity over and above, in some cases, what they may have. Again, that's a very general statement, not necessarily certainly applies to all. But I would certainly say that there's probably some opportunity there for us versus some of the \u2013 particularly, the smaller family-owned competitors.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right, great. Thanks. That's it for me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. First, just a question on international. I mean, we've talked about the fiscal or I guess, the calendar to fiscal calendar shifts a couple of times. I'm sorry if I missed this, Joel, but did you quantify in dollars or in basis points whatever you want to do, how that hurt the second quarter and therefore how it may help the third?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","We didn't, John. We have called it out for a couple of quarters now that we're certainly looking at the fact that this quarter, we'd see a negative impact of that. That would then be somewhat picked up over the last couple of quarters but we did not quantify that.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. But that amount was not adjusted out of operating income as one of the operating income adjustments for the international segment, is that correct?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","That is correct. We did not provide any of that, no.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you just for clarifying that. And then certainly, it's interesting, and I think you touched on this a number of different places. But it is interesting that you're adding marketing associates at this point in the technological cycle. Obviously, you're putting some of the technology initiatives in the hands of the customers, allows them to order easier and allows your salespeople to focus more on selling and consulting as opposed to order-taking. Is there may be a point in your forecast, I don't know if it's 2019, 2020, 2021, whatever it is, where you expect the sales force to become much more efficient, in other words, utilizing technology themselves to the extent that they can, cover bigger territories, as you mentioned? Just want to get a sense when that you can inflect that to where we can actually start to leverage the salespeople as opposed just in incremental costs, which I think was the case in the second quarter?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","So John, let me try to take a shot at that. So again, this was what I said a couple of minutes ago around how we're thinking about this. We actually feel really good about the productivity we're getting out of our existing selling organization. You got to think about though is there's a difference between better managing the current customers and trying to acquire and drive our relative share in the marketplace through incremental business. And so I think you need to think about the two of those in conjunction. And the adding of the salespeople really on a more very targeted basis is all around trying to improve our position in certain markets where we believe we've got significant opportunities.","And given our share position relatively in the industry, we've got plenty of room to grow and we've talked about that. And so, it's a combination of, yes, you should expect us to continue to get productive with our current selling organization with existing business. But as we look to take on new business, we do need resources in place. And those resources not only are the people but the training and the support that goes along with that. So there's \u2013 it is an investment, but one, we feel really good about and one we feel like will create a nice return for us.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. And just to reiterate, Tom said that extremely well, and I think the one thing just to reinforce, this is not \u2013 you should not take away from this that for whatever the reason there is an \u2013 productivity impacted a negative way of any of the stuff. We certainly look at this as an ability to continue to take share again in a targeted way. And so that to me is a separate and distinct from the fact that we also have some continued increases in productivity through some of the tools we've talked about. They're not mutually exclusive here in terms of adding MAs and driving productivity that they can (45:05).","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, understood. And certainly in the press release I mean I think selling expenses were called out. And so when you see that you just assume that we're just going through I guess an investment phase before we can start to get some of that full benefits and maybe that's where a lot of the questions are arising from.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","I think that's fair.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","Hey good morning. Joel, just excluding the calendar change to international and how that might affect Q3, should we be expecting the underlying business to have a better second half versus first half?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","The underlying business in international or just in general?","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","In general.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. So yes, the answer is yes. And certainly, part of in my script, I wanted to make sure I called that out. I mean we do anticipate an improvement in the second half of our year over the first half of our year. And so, I think in a number of different areas but I would certainly say the answer to that is yes, and again, we certainly tried to call that out in the script.","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just one on the modeling front for me, assuming you guys are still looking at CapEx of 1.3% to 1.4%, as a percentage of sales, that would assume or that would imply a pretty sound acceleration in the back half of this year?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. that hasn't changed. We typically experience actually a heavier amount of CapEx in the second half of our fiscal than we do in the first half. And again, our first half CapEx is very consistent with where we were in the last year. And so, we do anticipate some level of acceleration in the second half.","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","Right. And then just a follow-up on that, when it comes to D&A is there any ability to help us guide with that line item since it's been moving around quite a bit?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. No, I mean, I don't \u2013 we haven't typically guided that. I don't think there's anything really unusual to go there. I mean, just as you had modeled just our normal CapEx I would think just keep a normal view of D&A I think is reasonable. There's nothing really exciting there.","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, Joel, can I just clarify just from a guidance perspective? So, you're still talking about the upper end of the $600 million to $650 million, excluding Brakes. What should we be thinking about for Brakes at this point? I think at one point, you were expecting that business to be flat year-over-year. I don't know if that's still the case. I'm just trying, as we piece all this together, what should we be thinking about from Brakes in this year as we try to get ourselves to total EBIT?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. And so, what I'll tell you is we're going to give you a little \u2013 an update on that probably in our Q3 call. I would say, it's likely that will be slightly less than flat, although some of that is due to \u2013 and the reason I'm hedging in terms of the timing of this is that there were some actual tax reforms that happened in the UK and in France as well that we're still working through to be able to quantify the impact of that also factored into that number. And so again, I would anticipate that there'd be somewhat less than we guided. But again, I'd like to get a better number before I quantify that for you, we will plan to do so.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","As we think about international as a whole, is it possible for international to be flat this year? What I asked that question because EBIT was down about $40 million in the first half. And I'm just wondering how big of a ramp we should be expecting in the back half of the year with this calendar change.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yes, again, I don't want to be not responsive to your question, but we just haven't guided that number. I would just suffice it to say that again, that there will be some level of pickup in the second half of the year. But again, we haven't guided specifically of what that was like. And keeping in mind, as Tom talked about earlier, I mean, there's been somewhat of an acceleration and where we've seen opportunities that we anticipate long-term benefit from to accelerate some of the investments that we made both in the multi-temp and in some of the (49:40) as well.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Just to follow-up on the question on tax reform. As you go through the process and think about the possibility for reinvestment, can you maybe just talk about the process, what you're considering? I mean, you could probably make the argument that you've already made some reinvestment, given what we've seen on the startup side on the SG&A. But just thoughts around how much of reform, at the end of the day, you think you're going to end up keeping versus putting back into the business and how you think about that?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yes. So I think the main takeaway I'd have from that, number one, one of the things I talked about in my prepared remarks is around making investments in our business that are in line with our capital allocation priorities. And the reason I said that specifically is that we've done a lot of different questions around, will you invest in pricing, will you do some of those things? And the answer to that is that, that's not part of what we're talking about here. When we talk about investing in our business, we're talking about opportunities. Again, part of our capital allocation priority is to continue to find ways to accelerate items, to invest in assets and technologies and people and in ways that ultimately drive long-term value for this organization.","And so, I would look at it and think about it more that way, and again certainly not \u2013 we're not thinking about as just turning around and investing that ultimately in price. And so I think \u2013 and again, as you know, our capital allocation priorities, I think, are quite balanced between investing in our business, providing value to shareholders. And I think that again, our overall investment moving forward is going to be very consistent with that.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I had a question on just the currency impact. I'm guessing the currency should have helped this quarter as opposed to being a tailwind. And I don't think that's been the case for a while. So now that you have clean comparisons for Brakes year-over-year, can you confirm what the currency impact was in Q2 on a consolidated basis, or even just for international specifically? So I'm just wondering if you have any color on the relative impact from currency on revenue expenses and the earnings impact overall.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, Ajay, it's Joel. I would \u2013 on a top-line basis, it was just a little bit over 1%. We also had \u2013 there was obviously impact on the gross profit, impact on the expense. For the most part, that washed out as you translate that down to our operating income line. But we did have some benefit on the top. Again, certainly, there was somewhat \u2013 again, a little bit relative strengthening in the sterling and the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. is really what's driven that recently. But at the end of the day, again, the overall impact on the operating line is not a lot, but on top, we did get 1%.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. That's helpful. So really no flow through to earnings, you would say, from currency?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I would say nominal amount, but nothing of what I'd consider real significance there.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. I had one follow-up on tax reform and my question is twofold. So maybe it's a little early to talk about the consumer-related impact, but do you have any preliminary sense on whether there's been any kind of impact, like any discernible impact on restaurant spending in general in terms of what you're seeing and what you're expecting going forward? And then I was also interested in how your customers are reinvesting the tax benefit. I don't know if you've got a lot of direct visibility into that, but I'm also curious if you expect to see any benefit being ploughed back into wage adjustments by your multiunit or Broadline customers.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Well, why don't I start and I'll let Tom add his thoughts on as well. I mean \u2013 a couple of comments there. I mean, I think broadly speaking, anything that ultimately is positive for the consumer or positive for the overall economy, we certainly would view as a positive for our industry and so I'd certainly start with that.","Yes, I think the question of, have you seen impact or what do we anticipate from a restaurant perspective, I'm sure, I think, it's varied to some extent across restaurant types. Again, one of the things I've mentioned a little bit earlier in terms of the smaller distributors, a lot of our local restaurants tend to be family-owned businesses. And so again, this is really me just opining as much as anything else. But to some extent, more family-run businesses tend to try to look at ways to minimize tax. So I'm not necessarily sure on the local level that there's going to be still that \u2013 again, in all cases, it will be different, but so much impact from that perspective and their ability to plough some of that back into the business.","On the multiunit side, probably some extent more so. But again, I would just go back to saying in general, where there's a positive macroeconomic opportunity there, I think that certainly provide something we see positive benefit for our industry. And I don't know if there's anything else do you want to add, Tom?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Yes and you guys have probably seen some of the restaurant data, I mean, some of it was good for December. If you think about same-store sales versus \u2013 traffic continues to be a challenge in certain areas for sure, but same-store sales seemed to be growing and that's helpful. Also if you look at the relative improvement throughout the end of last year, it was stronger obviously than the first part of the year. So I think a lot of the indexes that are out there, a lot of the data that's being shared across the restaurant industry is somewhat positive during this quarter.","And so we're hopeful that that continues, the consumer confidence that Joel is referring to and that we're all hearing about, reading about, you hope translates into increased \u2013 hopefully increased traffic but certainly increased sales in the restaurants.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Summers with Macquarie Securities. Your line is open.","Bob Summers - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, everyone. I guess I want to leverage that last question a little bit and maybe ask it in a different way, which is when you look at prior instances where you \u2013 the consumers had tax relief, can you go back and look at a discernible change in trend within restaurants and your business? I mean, I think it's widely speculated on the Street that with sort of restaurant spending being high at \u2013 top of the list that you'll be a beneficiary, but empirically I'm wondering if you have any data from the last 30 years or so.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Bob, I don't think \u2013 I mean the data that's out there, we have not spent any time looking at that, it's probably something worthy of us and the industry looking at, but I can't honestly (56:51) say we've got that data in front of us. But we tend to believe a lot of the things that we're all seeing and reading. And I think that that will \u2013 we know in this business, consumer confidence, unemployment all those things are positive drivers for foodservice and for restaurants in particular. And so we're hoping that all those things do, in fact, continue to provide some nice tailwind for this industry.","Bob Summers - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then separately on the incremental hiring of salespeople, which I think as I look at advantageously or as a positive, that seems a little different than maybe you've been talking about over the last pick a timeframe. One, am I interpreting that right? And then two, I guess if it is different, what's driving the change?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","It's a great question Bob. And I think you are interpreting it correctly that over the last probably year-and-a-half or so I would say we are more stabilized with our selling organization. We're very focused on building out this consultative model. And so where we were maybe adding some in the past it was more around the support resources versus the actual selling resources. We're now at a place both because we have the insight and data to tell us where we should be focusing. And we've I'd say optimized might be the right word that current selling organization we felt like it was the right time to be able to start to add. So we just feel like we're in a much better position from an insight and knowledge basis and know where we have the opportunities to go ahead and start making those additions.","Bob Summers - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, great.

DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone.","This morning Sysco reported strong third quarter financial results. Our performance reflects both the commitment of our 52,000 associates to supporting the success of our customers and the improving execution of our strategy and three-year plan initiatives.","During the quarter Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of 4% while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to 1.5%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of $60 million or 16% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 15% to $0.46 per share.","These results were achieved with the benefit of favorable weather conditions and an earlier Easter holiday compared to the prior-year third quarter. Consumer confidence data points, while still favorable compared to a few years ago, were somewhat uneven and tracked the volatile financial market activity quite closely.","Lower fuel prices were likely a net positive, as the impact of consumer spending benefits and reduced delivery costs offset to some degree the economic slowdown we are experiencing in energy-driven economies in certain parts of Texas and in Montana, North Dakota, and Alberta Canada.","Turning to specific restaurant industry data, the overall sales trends remain mixed. According to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant sales have been uneven during the first three months of 2016 after steadily rising throughout 2015. Both NPD and KNAPP-TRACK have also shown recent traffic and sales declines. However, even with this recent shopping industry performance, the overall trend remains generally favorable for our customers, as illustrated by the U.S. Census Bureau sales data for the quarter rising 1% above the prior quarter, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of restaurant sales growth.","Moving to our results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, I'm very pleased with the increasing momentum in our business. For the nine-month period ending in March, we delivered the following results. Total broadline cases grew 3.3% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 1.2% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation and foreign exchange headwinds.","Gross profit dollars grew 3.3% and gross margin increased 35 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased $100 million or about 8% compared to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 10%. These results are in line with our three-year planned financial objectives, to grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million and to grow earnings per share faster than operating income.","Our progress towards the achievement of these financial objectives is being driven by focusing on the following four key levers: accelerating local case growth; improving gross margin; leveraging supply chain costs; and reducing administrative costs.","Regarding the reduction of administrative costs, we recently began to implement a workforce reduction of approximately 1,200 positions. We've taken a very thoughtful approach to this difficult process by focusing on prioritizing all existing work more effectively, reducing layers of management, and expanding spans of control. We believe our approach will allow us to continue supporting our customers with a high level of service, as evidenced by the fact that we are not reducing the number of marketing associates or warehouse and delivery associates who directly support our customers.","During the quarter we also announced our proposed acquisition of the Brakes Group, a $5 billion European foodservice distributor with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France, and Sweden. We're very excited about this opportunity as we will inherit an excellent leadership team, a business whose customer-centric strategy and culture is very similar to Sysco's, and 15,000 highly capable associates. We expect this acquisition will provide a solid trajectory of EBITDA growth over time and excellent platform for further acquisitions in Europe. Equally important, this transaction will not distract us from driving out our three-year plan in our existing business. We continue to target a June or July closing.","As we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level. We have delivered consistent local case growth for the past two years, expanded gross margins for four consecutive quarters, reduced adjusted cost per case in the field, and put plans into place that will reduce administrative expenses. These actions and related results reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives as we move forward.","And now I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my remarks regarding the third quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our three-year plan and how they've continued to positively impact our business results.","As we have mentioned a few times before, our insights-based approach to understanding, meeting our customer's needs, continues to guide our efforts and is clearly driving improved performance. For example, during the third quarter, our U.S. broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.6%, including local case growth of 3.4%, gross profit dollar growth of 4.8%, including an improvement in margin of 39 basis points. And for operating expense, we reduced our adjusted cost per case by $0.08, or $0.03 on a neutral fuel price basis. And we had operating income growth of 11.5%.","We are driving increased case growth through a variety of sales and marketing initiatives that are designed to deliver value to our customers while providing a more consistent experience of doing business with Sysco. I'm pleased to report that the third quarter represents the eighth straight quarter of local case growth.","As you know, improving gross margin is another key driver of Sysco achieving our three-year targets. And our strong performance this quarter indicates that we are making progress towards delivering our long-term objectives.","During the quarter, we delivered solid growth in key center of plate categories such as beef, pork, and poultry. And we continued our growth in produce, reinforcing the benefits driven from a focus on fresh. We also saw a solid increase of more than 50 basis points in Sysco brand sales with our local customers. These efforts combined with other initiatives such as our ongoing work in category and revenue management as well as the impact of deflation contributed to an increase in U.S. broadline gross margin of approximately 40 basis points, the fourth quarter in a row with gross margin expansion.","These improvements are especially noteworthy as we've been able to manage through the current deflationary environment fairly well due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve local case growth as a percentage of our mix as well as our continued focus on our category management process. Separately, the operating expense performance during the quarter was particularly strong. We limited total adjusted expense growth to only 1.5% despite case growth of more than 3% and, as mentioned, we reduced our overall cost per case in the U.S. broadline by $0.03 excluding the impact of fuel prices.","From a supply chain perspective, we continue to make good progress towards our goals to improve overall service to our customers, while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process. We've also seen good progress through a series of indirect spend initiatives. And while there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends and we are targeting a continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year.","In conjunction with the series of initiatives to support our long-term strategy, we are implementing a new market structure that reduces the number of U.S. broadline geographic markets from eight to six, effective at the beginning of our fiscal 2017 year. Each market team will continue to be led by a market president and include key functional leaders across finance, merchandising, supply chain and human resources to provide support to our operating companies to help to drive solid execution of the various corporate initiatives.","We believe that the work we've done in building the capability of the organization through the functional structure over the past two years makes this the right time for us to evolve our structure. This change will reduce overall administrative costs in the field, drive efficiency through a more standardized approach and improve execution to our customers.","In conjunction with this restructuring, I'm pleased to announce the promotion of three strong Sysco leaders. Greg Bertrand has been appointed Senior Vice President, U.S. Foodservice Operations, with responsibility for all U.S. broadline operating companies. We also announced that Scott Sonnemaker has been named Senior Vice President, International Foodservice Operations, Americas, and Bill Goetz has been named Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing.","These are just a few of the key priorities and changes that are positively impacting our operational and financial results. While we need continue to execute at a high level, I'm confident we are on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives.","In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well on the field and our headquarters teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field-ready tools and processes that are enabling our success.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone.","We had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, particularly solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management, achieved in an environment with continued deflation and currency headwinds. We continue to make solid progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our three-year goals.","We grew sales in the third quarter by approximately 2% year over year, despite deflation of 0.4%. We saw continued deflation in center of the plate protein categories such as meat, seafood and poultry, as supply recovers from various events in 2015. This deflationary trend has been persistent over the past two quarters.","Acquisitions increased sales by 0.9% while foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1% in the third quarter. U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian dollar was responsible for the vast majority of the foreign exchange impact. The negative impacts we have been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening as we began to wrap the initial decline in relative value of the Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 3.1%.","Turning to case growth, consistent with our three-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total broadline case growth for the third quarter was 3.3% and local was also 3.3%. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total broadline.","Looking at gross profit and gross margins, we grew our gross profit at a solid 4.1%, while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins which grew by 34 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%.","During the third quarter, we had a few certain items that impacted our results. These include restructuring costs such as charges related technology changes, severance and professional fees of $60 million and about $10 million of acquisition financing costs. On a GAAP basis, without excluding these certain items and the comparable certain items from the prior year, our operating income grew 15% and our diluted earnings per share grew about 27%. The rest of my discussion will focus on the non-GAAP or adjusted for certain items results.","Adjusted operating expense grew 1.5% during the quarter and by 2.4% on a constant currency basis. This increase was mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals and is partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our reduced cost per case.","As a result, adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $438 million, up 16% compared to the prior year and 17% on a constant currency basis. As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.6% compared to 33.9% in the prior year period. Both quarters' tax rates were positively impacted by the favorable resolution of state tax matters. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 10% and adjusted earnings per share grew 15%.","Cash flow from operations was $1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2016, up approximately 15% from last year. Net working capital improved by about half a day during the third quarter compared to the same period last year. This was largely driven by improvements in both receivables and inventory.","Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks was $348 million and free cash flow was $641 million. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $272 million in fiscal 2016 and $128 million in fiscal 2015. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods, and for 2015 include items related to the planning of the merger integration. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew $273 million and free cash flow grew $346 million.","Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we're currently on track to hit our fiscal 2016 financial objectives. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least another quarter. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparisons this year more challenging. And, finally, we now expect CapEx for fiscal year to be approximately $500 million or approximately 1% of sales.","During the quarter, we also completed a successful debt offering, the proceeds of which are to be used for the acquisition of Brakes that Bill mentioned earlier. The very attractive coupons associated with this financing, approximately 3% on a weighted average basis, represents both the strength of our balance sheet as well as impressive work by our team throughout the process.","In addition, Sysco put in place hedges during the quarter that protect approximately half of the purchase price over the Brakes transaction against unfavorable movements and foreign exchange rates.","In summary, we had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the financial objectives for our three-year plan.","We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a higher level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long-term. I feel confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives of our three-year plan and we will aggressively continue to look for incremental opportunities to exceed our goals.","Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is now open.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice quarter here. Just curious if you could talk about the local case growth; continues to accelerate. Maybe just, if you can, provide some historical perspective on when the last time it was this strong. Are you seeing it in both comp restaurant growth or new independent local customers coming into the mix? And then in terms of the private label penetration with that local segment, where do you think you can take that longer term?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Kelly, it's Bill. I'll start and I'll let Tom give you a little bit more color. I think in terms of historical context, this is by far the strongest quarter we've had over the last four or five years. And that's very encouraging and certainly something that is bringing the momentum of the business that both Tom and Joel talked about.","So in terms of where it's coming from, I think it's the same answer as I would give you if you had asked about margin or even expenses at this point. It's coming from a lot of good work over the last few years on the commercial side of the business that Tom can give you a little more color on, and really good alignment I think with our leadership team throughout Sysco. And I would say this particular quarter, we acknowledged it, there were some tailwinds. And I don't like to talk about weather a lot. I think that the last two third quarters we've talked about weather. Two years ago we had a brutal winter at the beginning of the winter, and last year I think it was at the end of winter, and this year was a pretty mild winter. So I think that helped a little bit.","With that said, I think I was also trying to get out there that the data out there right now is a little bit mixed in terms of overall industry growth. So I think we had some tailwinds that we took advantage of. But more than anything, I think it's more and more good execution of key initiatives (22:32) the commercial side over the last three, four years.","On the brand \u2013 and I'll kick it to Tom real quick \u2013 these things tend to go together. When you're growing your business, you're creating differentiation at the customer level, and that's what the brand allows us to do. And so we've brought renewed focus on the brand over the last three years in conjunction with our category management work. And I think we're doing it the right way. And I don't know, we're not really chasing a number here, Kelly. I think what we're saying is the key to all of this is really growing those local cases. And as we do that, we should be able to grow the brand. I don't know that there's a particular percentage that we're trying to get to other than to utilize the brand as a way to differentiate ourselves more effectively. And let me kick it to Tom here and give you a little more color on that.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Bill. And I won't repeat a lot of what Bill said because I think he hit pretty clearly on what the key drivers are. Let me just add on the local case growth. You had asked about current customers and new customers. We spend a fair amount of time looking at what we call new sales, lost sales, and then penetration. And think about that as new customers, any customers that we may have lost some business at or where we've done a better job of selling more to those customers.","And I would tell you that all of those metrics continue to head in the right direction as it relates to our local customers, meaning our new sales continue to be very strong. Our lost sales have declined a little bit over the past couple of quarters. And our penetration sales, which is what is delivering more to those current customers, has also been increasing. And that's a key metric for us because that tells us that we're improving in all those areas with our customers, our current customers, and making sure that we're continuing to satisfy their needs. So we feel good about all those metrics and where the business is heading.","And then lastly, on the Sysco brand, the only thing I'd add to what Bill said is our focus \u2013 a lot of the category management focus is in fact driven towards that local customer. And based on that, the more we bring them differentiated solutions \u2013 we've talked about innovation in the last couple of quarters \u2013 is when we're bringing them new news and innovation, that actually helps us grow our Sysco brand because generally those products are in the Sysco brand lineup. So I think as Bill said, they go hand in hand, and I think this continued focus by us in bringing new and differentiated products to our customers is helping us grow that. And I would agree with Bill, we don't have a number per se that we're targeting. We know that it's important, and we continue to focus on it quarter-in and quarter-out.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf from BB&T. Your line is now open.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Great, thanks and congratulations on the quarter. Bill, I just wanted to ask you on the sales count, the MAs [Marketing Associates] up and down the street. Is that up sequentially or year over year a little bit, or is the organization driving the good local penetration and general growth with the same head count on the sales side?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's roughly the same. I think the mix is a little different. We've put a lot of trainees over the last year and that's begun to level out. Tom, do you got anything?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","No, I think that's the big change. Our base MAs were very much flat versus the past year and this quarter. Actually because we've got good retention with our marketing associates, we're down a little bit in the number of trainees that we have out there because we just aren't using as many in the pipeline. But overall, we're driving these sales with our existing sales force.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The reason it can be flat, Andy, is because of some of the work that we've done over the last two or three years with the CRM tool, with some things we're doing in terms of territory management to be more rifle-like in terms of going after the business, and that will continue to be a point of emphasis in our sales strategy.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, that's an encouraging change, I think, from the way the business has historically operated. Do you think going forward, if you wanted to continue to keep this momentum going forward, you can at least leverage sales, get case growth, local case growth, in a multiple of \u2013 it sounds like you can. I just want to confirm how you think about that. It used to be a one-to-one relationship between sales head count and internal sales growth. It sounds like you've actually gotten to a point where maybe it's a lot better than that.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's a little better than that. I think you'll continue to see that.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","And the other question I just want is for Joel. On the $59 million net total restructuring costs, can you just tell us how much of that was accelerated depreciation related to SAP or anything else?","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say maybe about a quarter of that was, I think even a little less than that. There was a part of that that was \u2013 it's that stuff then what I'll call a one-time write-off of projects that were in process that were associated with the SAP conversion at the time when that decision was made. We took a one-time charge on some of those. Again, it was split up for the most part between, again, the one-time write-off which was quite a bit higher than the accelerated...","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...depreciation, and then again, a couple other severance-related costs that are part of a certain item.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. So the project costs didn't go through accelerated depreciation just the one quarter of that, that's it?","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right. Then something you'll see in the third quarter, not part of the accelerated depreciation, that was a one-time write-off of project costs that were again associated with the SAP.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Because if you \u2013 yeah, so we should take about $15 million or so off of the D&A just to get to sort of a normalized D&A for the quarter? That's what I'm really trying to get to.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's probably a reasonable ballpark, Andy.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So really looking at the change in the org structure, the eight to six markets, what changes does that necessitate for the levels below them right down into really out to the op companies? What are they going to have to do differently? Where do you think you pick up execution benefits? And do you think this is kind of the structure we're going to have going forward? Or do you think you'll play around with it a little bit more and look for some more efficiency?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, John \u2013 good morning. It's, again, the structure hasn't changed, all we've done really is consolidate it from eight to six. When we went to the structure, the structure's really evolved over the last few years. But when we went to the functional structure a couple years ago, we felt eight was important. There's a lot of ramp-up work and change management work to do when you put this type of structure in place and you've never had it before.","We just feel today that in conjunction with everything else that it's a good metaphor, if you will, for \u2013 I talk about in the expenses where we can spread our top people a little bit further. We're further along in a lot of our transformative work. And we just felt that we can run the business very well with six. And it impacts not just the market presence, but all the functional leads as well in the four areas. But it really doesn't change that much at all, if anything, at the operating company level.","Tom, do you want to -?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","The only thing that it adds is a little more geography for each of the markets, which means a couple more operating companies that report into that market level. As Bill said, the reason we're confident now is we've had enough time with this structure and the functional leadership that we feel like we're driving out consistency across the business and a few more operating companies for each market is not going be a challenge for them.","I think that's the only other thing I'd add is this we're very focused on a consistent design. And what I mean by that is both at the market, but also at the operating company and trying to drive a little more consistency which we believe will improve execution and we've seen that so far and we also believe that we'll create a better customer experience because it will be more consistent market-to-market and operating company to operating company.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, John, I think we'll continue to tweak things to Tom's point. But this structure we really believe is vital and I think it's been a key part of the beginning of the momentum that you're seeing here over the last several quarters. So I wouldn't expect this structure to change. These are $5 billion and $6 billion markets. So when you think about that, it requires a fair amount of focus between the corporate center and that opco, and so we think we've got it about right here at six.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then maybe for Tom, where are we now with the revenue management organization? How much of the benefit are we now starting to see flow through? And where do you think the biggest opportunity is if you think about the next 12 months to 18 months? And I guess both margin and case growth do impact either one.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","So great question. So we now, literally last week, had our training for our last dozen operating companies. So basically by the end of the fiscal as we've said, we'll be fully up and running, meaning a revenue manager in every operating company and the market structure that's been in place now for a quarter will be fully operational. So what we continue to believe is that by leveraging that organization and creating a more standardized set of what I'd call routines and they've partnered nicely with our business technology team in creating some tools for these folks to really focus on ensuring that the product costs in a market is competitive and consistent. And we believe that by leveraging those routines and some of those tools out there that we're going continue to see some benefit on the margin side. It's really there as a support or enabler for cases, it's not a driver of case growth per se, other than ensuring that we've got the right market pricing in place.","So we feel good about where we're at. I'm not in a point where I'm looking to peg a number for you, but I think we feel good about the work that's been done and we're continuing to scale it across the organization.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the lean of Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, great, thanks very much for taking my question. Good morning, guys. So I just wanted to ask also for an update on the ERP rollout? I know a couple months back you folks had mentioned a bit of a different approach to that, just wondering if you can give us all an update there?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Vinnie. There's not a lot to report there. It's just been a couple months as you point out. So we're putting together plans, there's 12 opcos that we're going to bring back to this enhanced SaaS platform and we're going to start with one company here in the next couple months. But we're on target from a planning standpoint. We've put the teams in place and got great coordination between the operating side of the business and the BT side as well as shared services. So early days, but still very committed and on track.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And then, just as a follow-up, maybe just going back to your private brand sales that had a nice increase this quarter. I know you mentioned obviously about the independent customer growth volumes coming through. But just in terms of categories that you are seeing, kind of where do you think maybe some of the most opportunity is there? Any expansion plans from the private brands in general? Maybe kind of where you see the bigger changes by our product standpoint?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","This is Tom. I'm not sure there's necessarily any big changes by product category. It's a fairly developed side of our business. And so what I think it allows us to do is, as we introduce new products through the innovation pipeline, most of those are Sysco brand. So that is maybe one new focus area. And I wouldn't say that's necessarily in any specific category. I think the only other thing I'd say is that a lot of what we do in the produce space, and you've heard me talk about the produce growth and this focus on fresh, is in Sysco brand as well. And that, certainly, that continued focus there, that growth that we're seeing in some of those areas are also driving some of the Sysco brand momentum.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just the first on the trajectory of margins, you had the single best EBIT growth I think in over about a decade. As we think about deflation moderating and inflation potentially coming back next year, how should we be thinking about the recent level of top line flow-through, particularly if you see case growth come back on the whole?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Stephen. First of all, I wish I could tell you when we were going to cross over between deflation and inflation as we were pretty cautious in our comments. So I think we said that we expect it to last at least another quarter, it could be longer than that based on what we're seeing. And so I'm not really sure when to make that call.","As far as your question goes, it's one of those great questions that's hard to answer, even whether I'm looking back or looking forward. But I think if you go back and look at some of the things that we've said over the last several months and putting the three-year plan together, our hope here would be, when we can return to a more moderate inflation environment, that we would grow the cases and at least hold margin flat, maybe grow it a little bit. And that's the plan and that's going to take a lot of cohesive execution which we're quite confident in right now between cap man Tom spoken to rev man here a little bit ago, and continue to grow those local cases.","So the key is the local cases and the mix, we need to grow both our local and corporate managed cases, so kind of have that in the right ratio. That will help us on the brand penetration. And if we do that, I think we'll be able to manage our margins well.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And then as a quick follow-up for Joel, when you say that you're going to be lapping this tougher fourth quarter, I guess, is that primarily focused on just the margin? Is there something else that we should be aware of as it relates to top line comparisons? Thanks.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I think you've hit it. And then, again, we had a pretty decent operating income quarter as well in Q4 of last year. So I think we're just calling out that the comparison for this quarter in particular is a bit tougher than we've had over the last three.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Question for you just from a top line perspective, obviously, a lot of good strong momentum here in broadline's case growth. Can you maybe just talk about sort of like where you are within sort of like the runway here, whether it's penetration with existing customers, private brand in general and even new channels? There hasn't been that much talk about areas like retail, for instance, which I know is something that's newer for you and maybe the opportunity that you see there. So I'm just trying to figure out sort of like the sustainability of the momentum that you're seeing today.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me start. I think, again, on the momentum part of it, it was a really, really nice quarter and we did a lot of good things and benefited from that. I think from an external standpoint, there were some tailwinds that I don't think you can plan on every quarter in terms of some of the favorable weather comparisons and that kind of thing. And we may be seeing a little bit of a softening out there right now in terms of what we're seeing in our business and the industry. So I think there's the external aspect of that. We can't do much to manage that. But I think, obviously, we're managing within that environment very well right now and we expect to continue to do that.","I'll get to your question here in a second. The key, I really think is what Tom spoke to earlier in the earlier question, in terms of sustainability, it has to come from the book of business that we have today in terms of our ability to do that. So certainly our ability to continue to fill a pipeline with quality new account business and that may come from different segments to your point. We are doing some things on the retail side. We have talked a fair amount about some good work we've done over the last couple years on the ethnic side and particularly Hispanic. We have some more opportunity there beyond Hispanic and within Hispanic. The whole area of fresh and organic is an area that provides a lot of opportunities. So whether it's customer segments, product segments, trends in the industry, those are all opportunities for us that we are exploring and beginning to get some traction.","With that said, for us to sustain what we've put up here over the last several quarters and, in particular this quarter, we need to continue to penetrate with our existing accounts that's the most profitable business for us, bring in some new accounts from that quality pipeline and do a little bit better and, we're starting to, in terms of our customer retention. So we need to do all of those things and the good news is we are doing those things right now. So I wouldn't overreact to one quarter or another, but when you look at the year-to-date numbers, those are well within the range of what we've targeted for the three years and we remained quite confident that we can deliver that.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just one follow-up for you on something that's quietly becoming a bigger part of your story I guess. So if you look at your free cash flow year to date, just reported-wise to something like 50%, I think based upon what Joel was talking about it, maybe it's up more. But you've obviously had good EBITDA growth, CapEx now trending below your forecast. Can you maybe just talk about where the free cash flow and the CapEx sits within what you're focusing on in terms of improvement within that three-year forecast and what we should be expecting going forward?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's great trepidation. Let me start and Joel will give you his color on it. One of the things we're very careful about and meticulous about in terms of the three-year plan was to lock in two or three key objectives that we have financially that we thought would resonate with our investors and potential investors based upon feedback that we've gotten. So we locked in operating income growth, and we also acknowledged that we would expect to grow our EPS somewhat faster over that three-year period than the operating income growth. And we locked in our return on invested capital, and we set a goal out there for 15%.","Now obviously, that was before the Brakes deal. But we're on track today within the business as it sits today, Ed, to hit or slightly surpass the 15%. Once we close on the Brakes deal, we'll be able to bring that in and give you some color on the impact of that. But we are very, very focused on the return on invested capital. And, obviously, they come together, to your point, in terms of free cash flow and EBITDA growth.","So we don't have a particular delta target, if you will, for EBITDA growth or free cash flow right now, but it's been strong here for some time and I would expect it to continue to be strong. And in terms of how we're going invest it, I think you'll continue to see us invested in the business.","You're right, we're a little under where we thought we would be our CapEx this year. I think Joel commented that we expect to be around $500 million for the year, which is about 1%. In any given year, that could go up or down a little bit based on timing. But I think that 1%, maybe slightly more every now and then, is what you should expect there. And we're going to continue to \u2013 obviously, we're going to be very focused on assimilating Brakes in the right way and even more focused on continuing to run the business here as we've laid out.","So bottom line is I think you'll continue to see us invest in the business, about 1% CapEx, increase the dividend modestly, probably not quite as fast as the earnings go up, continue to look for good acquisitions, and opportunistically look at buying back shares. Joel, do you want to...","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. You called out some of the fresh categories in your prepared remarks as specifically produce and proteins. It seems these categories tend to have more specialty competition, particularly for local customers. First of all, would you agree that fresh is an area that you're taking share? And I'm curious how you think about this as a longer-term opportunity, just given your scale versus the specialty mom-and-pops.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","Why don't I jump in? First of all, it's hard to tell whether we're taking share, but we're certainly seeing good growth in these areas. So as you I think know, we have our own specialty companies in these areas, FreshPoint on the produce side, and also a variety of specialty meat companies across the enterprise. But we're very focused on these categories, and I don't think it's necessarily a new thing for Sysco.","But what we know is if we can perform well for our customers in these maybe more challenging categories at times of delivering fresh meat and produce, then that allows us to do the other things also and also do them well. And so we've had a focus on quality and making sure that we've always got the right products out there. We've got a great program in place through our Sysco brand around traceability, which is also very important. So we definitely believe that even as large as we are, we're able to compete in this space. And we're continuing to focus on how we can be better every day for our customers. And so I think we feel good about our performance to date and feel like we can continue to grow in this area, but it's an ongoing day-to-day management of that business to be successful.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. And just with the volatile inflationary environment right now, can you talk a little bit about pricing guard rails for your MAs? How much autonomy do they have on pricing? And can you talk a little bit about just your approach, to the extent you can, to ensure that you aren't leaving money on the table, yet still being competitive on price?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","What I'd say is that we still believe in pricing is local in this business for local customers. And so while they have some autonomy through our revenue management work, we're continuing to do a much better job of giving them tools and process to ensure that we're competitive locally but that we're also managing the business. So I would say we continue to believe it's important for them to have that flexibility for our customers. We want to make sure we're competitive on the street each and every day. And we're trying to create the environment where we're doing that together, meaning the salesperson and the company with both customers and our objectives in mind.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it, thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research. Your line is now open.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Hi, thanks for the question. I mainly wanted to get some clarification on your outlook for the operating expenses in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2017. So is $70 million still the right number based on your guidance for this year for total charges? And if that is the right number, am I right in assuming that you're looking at $10 million or $11 million in fourth quarter charges? And then the same question for fiscal 2017, are you still looking at, I think it was $130 million in charges for next year?","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","This is Joel. We've talked about when we talked about the couple recent announcements that we've had that we anticipated around $70 million for this year and around $130 million for next year. Those estimates still hold. So I don't know if that answered your question, but the numbers that we talked about earlier, we still feel good about in terms of as we look forward.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. And the severance is on top of those numbers. Is that correct?","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There's an element of severance actually built into those numbers, Ajay. So we made some estimates in terms of severance. The $70 million and $130 million basically were comprised of, the way I think about it, really four different things. It was this one-time write-off this year in this quarter, which we talked about in terms of the construction in progress write-off. It's accelerated depreciation, it's severance and what we call conversion costs, things that essentially are due to moving from the SAP system to our enhanced version of SaaS. So I would think about that really as grouped in kind of those four different areas. And so severance again, we have severance estimate that was actually part of that number for those two years.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay, and I had one follow-up question. I think it's follow-up to one of the questions that was asked earlier on the transition from deflation to inflation, so assuming that there is some inflation that reappears next year in fiscal 2017. So I understand the gross margin percentage increases when you have deflation, but would you say there's also some underlying benefit when you're seeing your cost of goods going down as it's been going down over the past two or three quarters, both from fuel and deflation? So would you say it's possible that your input costs are going down at a faster rate than you're passing along to some of your broadline customers? And does any of that benefit start to get offset as you start to deal with inflation again whenever that happens?","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","There's an element of that, Ajay. I mean, there's the math aspect of it and then there's an element of that. Obviously, in our business where you turn your inventory every 20 days, you can't hold the prices for too long given the competitive environment that we're in. So to Tom's earlier point, we're always trying to strike the right balance there with what the customer's needs are. So that's certainly part of it. But I would also say to you that \u2013 I'm not a big fan of deflation, so I think the longer it goes, the more challenging it becomes. People start to expect prices continue to go down. So it's not a good place to be, but it's explainable. I mean, a lot of it \u2013 the way we've kind of got here is the center of the plate, these protein categories are flat to now down, whereas a year, 18 months ago, they were up double-digit, and the rest of the categories are roughly flat, maybe up a little bit or down a little bit.","So it's primarily being driven in the protein area and that's what \u2013 that's a theory that you will have to watch closely in terms of when we come out of it. But I would just echo what I've said for years and I think what Sysco said for even longer than that, that the best environment for us and for our customers is when you have a moderate level of inflation ideally across multiple categories, 2%, 3%, whatever. And I would say it gets more challenging if you go to where you have 5% or 6% inflation, we've seen that, and it's certainly challenging over the medium term when you have deflation.","So bottom line, I feel really good about how we're managing it. I think a lot of these commercial initiatives I spoke to earlier and as Tom has spoken to have come at just the right time in terms of managing through this process. And, yes, there's some short-term benefits with deflation to your point, but medium to long-term, not where we want to be.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And I would just add one thing if I could, it's Joel. Just as a reminder, the way it impacts our financials, yes, there is some margin benefit to that. However, ultimately the dollars on the gross profit side we roll through are less when we have deflation typically. So that certainly is the headwind for us, just as a reminder of that.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. And one final question if I could. Since you called out the Easter calendar shift in your prepared remarks, can you quantify that at all because of the sales impact?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I don't think the Easter thing \u2013 we called it out just because it was real. But Easter, from my experience, is not quite as big a deal as it used to be years ago. It certainly not as big a factor as Mother's Day, but it was a factor. I think the weather was a bigger factor, Ajay. I think you have to \u2013 when you look at the delta and the case growth, it'd be great to think it was all us, but I think part of it, I think, was driven by just a pretty mild winter in most of the markets that we serve. So to me that was a bigger deal than the holiday.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Great, thanks.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. I wanted to get a gauge for how big the pressure was from those oil-related states? How big is that for your overall mix of sales? And when do you think you'll start lapping out of that?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I have no idea when we're going to lap out of it. Just like I probably can't predict when we're going to move from deflation to inflation. Matt, we haven't talked about that publicly. I think, again, we're making an effort here to give you our perspective of what's going on as it impacts \u2013 as fuel impacts us. So I think on the good news on the tailwind side of it, there's some flow-thorough we believe with the consumer level. It's hard to quantify that from what we see, but it certainly is enhancing discretionary income. Prices started to pick up here a little bit of late. It has certainly helped us on our cost structure, although we've managed costs extremely well outside of that impact. And we're just pointing out that the downside of it is in a good portion of the Southwest as well as you get up into Montana, North Dakota, and into Alberta, Canada, it goes the other way. So it's meaningful in those markets. And I think if it persists and becomes a more meaningful number, we probably will give you some color on that, but right now we haven't.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So what do you think the primary factors are to kind of give you your better performance on a local case volume trends versus these disappointing results we're seeing out of KNAPP-TRACK and some of the other casual dining metrics?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh my, that's a hard question for me to answer. I can speak to our performance and I think our performance comes from continuing to differentiate ourselves relative to our competition and it remains a very competitive marketplace. And so Tom spoke to the penetration and that's big as well as improved retention. Obviously, as I've said now two or three times and as we've said really since there's been a Sysco, that local case growth, that street case growth is a key focus for us, whereas some of the data that you're citing there is more chain-driven. So I think there's a little bit of a customer mix reconciliation there as well.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, great. Thank you. Firstly, could we talk about digital as a percentage of sales either in broadline or local case volume, just kind of where that is? And if you've \u2013 and I don't remember, I'm sorry if you have, if you've publicly stated where you think that can go, let's say, by 2018 and the implications that it may have for your business?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","So we haven't talked about where we think it can go. What we have talked about is that our approach here is to provide the options to our customers to order in whatever manner they choose. And so we continue to believe that's the right approach. We feel great about our marketing associates and the work they've been doing. We know that we need a good viable online system and that's what we've been rolling out through our mobility platform. And, obviously, we still have orders that are placed in other means, called in or faxed in.","Having said that, we continue to feel good about the work we're doing. The mobility piece, think about mobility as more a handheld or the iPad, iPhone type of \u2013 or Android device. We obviously have desktop. And so our \u2013 as I think we've said before, our online purchases are still relatively small in the street, just slightly under 10%, but growing. And we feel really good about the progress we're making there. But we haven't pegged a number by a certain date because we really believe it's going to find its level place based on what the customers' needs and expectations are.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. And, secondly, is there any implication at all if the UK leaves the EU in terms of your Brakes acquisition? In other words, Brakes, which has operations in the UK and the EU, are they completely separate and would that have any impact on your business at all?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, hard to assess at this point. And there'll be an impact, John, there's going to be an impact in Europe obviously and the UK in particular. It's hard for me to tell at this point where we are with Brakes to really give you any specific color on that. So we're watching it and we're certainly well aware of when we entered into those discussions. So there's no point in me conjecturing on that. I think we've just got to watch and wait for the vote and see where it goes, but again, just like in this country, people are going to go out to eat and we're very, very fortunate to be getting ready to close the transaction with a very well respected strong company with a great leadership team that's got a lot of good things going on. So we'll deal with whatever comes there, but right now I think we're very excited about the team that we're going to inherit.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And I would add, just as a reminder, I mean, we're in this thing for the long haul. I mean, we look at that deal as very much a part of our long-term value creation. And so again, as Bill said, we certainly knew that was out there when this was in here, but we're certainly in this for the long term.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Erin Lash from Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on an earlier discussion regarding CapEx. I got the impression that the reduction for this year was related to more timing issues and that would potentially flow into next year. So if you could confirm that? Also then, as it relates to the Brakes deal and I realize that the deal has not closed yet. But the extent to which you can provide some of your initial expectations in terms of whether there's going need to be a step-up in CapEx as you bring that business online, that would be very helpful.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, this is Joel. I'll take that. The CapEx commentary, I mean, there's some element of timing in that, but I wouldn't say a lot. So I mean, wouldn't think about this, that there's going be some big spike next year as a result. It is \u2013 Bill talked about, we specially see this area around 1% of sales, from CapEx being a very normal and reasonable number for us. Again, we've got a very disciplined process for the way we manage that based on the needs of our business. And so again, there's some element of timing in that, but, again, I wouldn't expect something significant changing going forward on that.","And then from a Brakes perspective, the one thing I think we've talked about is that, in general, this company has been well invested in and so certainly as part of the modeling we did for the deal, we factored in some level of CapEx as you'd expect. But, again, I think the level they're anticipating and the level we are, are relatively in line. So I would certainly, again, anticipate \u2013 again, we'll give some more clear guidance on that once the deal's done, but just at a high level, I think you're getting in there in a pretty well invested place and look at CapEx in a relatively similar way than we do.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you, that's very helpful. And then just following up, at the CAGNY conference earlier this year, you discussed the fact that the challenges facing the oil industry were actually benefiting you in terms of your facing some of the truck driver shortage issues that had added to your costs over the last few years. And I wondered if you could discuss that, whether you're still seeing a benefit in terms of an enhanced pool from which to attract truck drivers or whether maybe some of that benefit has been moderating?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Erin, I think we are. I mean I think the markets that we struggled in a year ago, 18 months ago, we certainly have closed the gap there. Now, some of those challenges were self-inflicted and we've gotten better on the talent acquisition side as well over that period of time. So if we were in the business of hiring truck drivers, we'd be in a better place right now. I would have the tradeoff though. I'll take the business and struggle with hiring truck drivers, but to your specific question, that certainly has mitigated or muted over the last several months and it's not a big issue for us right now.","Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Neil A. Russell","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012, and in the press release issued earlier this morning, which is posted in the Investors section at sysco.com.","Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in the presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation, which can also be found in the Investors section of our website. All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to case volume growth include total Broadline and SYGMA combined.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.","William J. DeLaney","Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales of $10.9 billion for the third quarter and net earnings of $201 million. Earnings per share was $0.34, and adjusted EPS, representing our underlying business performance, was $0.49 a share, a 2% decrease from the prior year.","As reflected in these results, the third quarter proved to be very difficult operationally for many of our customers and, as a result, for the vast majority of our operating companies. A number of factors impacted consumers' willingness to spend on food away from home, including higher tax rates, tax refund delays, stubbornly high unemployment, high gas prices and, in some parts of the geographies we service, unfavorable weather conditions.","Consumers appear to have become increasingly judicious with their disposable income, and it's clear from the decline in restaurant traffic in January and February that going out to eat has not been a high priority of late. While an extended winter has continued to challenge us in certain markets through April, we view most of these trends as cyclical in nature and expect overall market conditions to gradually improve as we move into the remainder of the calendar year.","In assessing our financial performance for the quarter, let me be clear on one very important point. Although external headwinds created significant pressure on our operations, we did not execute our business plan across the organization as consistently as we should have. We must memorize the unevenness of our operating performance within Sysco, and we will.","Sales grew 4% for the quarter. While that growth was primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions and pricing, we did experience solid growth with several of our large regional and national customers, especially on the institutional side of the business, by leveraging our broad supply chain capabilities and geographic coverage.","However, many of our restaurant customers struggled to grow during the quarter for reasons I mentioned earlier. Specifically, sales dollar growth with our street customers, who are largely independent restaurant operators, was soft for the quarter. This group of customers comprises a significant portion of our overall volume and an even greater percentage of our profitability because of the high level of value-added services we typically provide them. Thus, even though we did a fairly good job of managing gross margins at the customer segment level, the impact of customer mix changes contributed to our growing gross profit dollars by only 2% over the prior year.","Notwithstanding what we believe to be cyclical industry headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to profitably grow our market share over the long term. The key to our future success will be driving our strategic initiatives in conjunction with Sysco's overall business transformation efforts.","Turning to our multiyear business transformation initiatives. To date, we have completed the rollout of the full SAP system to 5 operating companies. All 5 locations are running their business reasonably well, and we have seen improved system performance in recent weeks.","As we have further evaluated system performance following our 2 deployments in Dallas and West Texas, we focused our thinking on 2 potential paths forward. We could either, one, proceed with our previously communicated rollout schedule and continue to work on enhancements at the same time; or two, continue to accelerate specific functional initiatives, such as human resources and general ledger accounting, while allowing the team to focus all of their time and effort on implementing enhancements to the broader SAP platform. We believe the latter option is the better approach for the following reasons: one, it allows us to continue to make substantial transformation progress while making future deployments easier and less complicated; and two, it also allows us to more effectively balance benefits, cost, risk and speed.","It is important to note that the vast majority of the system functionality is performing as designed. However, as we have previously communicated, we do have issues that need to be addressed, such as pricing complexity and the inventory management functionality, before moving forward with a revised rollout schedule. We have isolated and understand the cause of these issues and are executing against a solid plan to remedy them.","In the meantime, we're continuing our efforts to standardize, centralize and technology-enable many of our business processes. As we announced previously, we recently completed the rollout to all U.S. Broadline operating companies of both our CRM and SAP maintenance modules.","Other similar efforts have been progressing rapidly. We have completed the rollout of the HR SAP module to 26 locations, with 4 going live every 2 weeks, and expect to complete the transition of our general ledger accounting functions to SBS in 42 locations by fiscal year end. We expect to complete the rollout of both of these initiatives to all U.S. Broadline locations by the end of the calendar year.","We've also begun setting up master data files across the enterprise and are bringing locations on to this module in anticipation of the broader SAP rollout. This prepares us for a more rapid deployment in the future.","To that end, we have restarted our operating company deployment preparation process and anticipate the enterprise-wide rollout to pick back up again around the end of the calendar year, and we will provide updates accordingly.","Importantly, I should note that the revision of the rollout schedule will not impact the timing of the approximately $600 million in annual benefits from operating product costs targeted for fiscal 2015. Those benefits do not rely on the ERP system. We believe we are generally on track to achieve those savings within the time line we previously communicated.","Leading our technology transformation effort is Wayne Shurts, who joined us this past October as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. He has extensive experience in leading IT organizations, including large SAP deployments, and I'm confident in his ability to lead us through this period of vital change. Wayne recently began to move forward on a major reorganization, which is designed to streamline and more effectively integrate our IT department and technology deployment teams. In so doing, he has and will continue to recruit individuals that are highly experienced in SAP and large systems implementations.","We also continue to make solid progress on several of our other strategic initiatives. We recently completed the acquisition of Bahamas Food Service, which adds another attractive geographic market to our portfolio and provides a solid foundation for future growth. We are excited about welcoming Ben Frisch and his team to the Sysco family, and Chris will provide additional details on all of our acquisition activities in a few minutes.","Our customer insight work continues to identify opportunities to provide enhanced value to our customers and more effectively establish Sysco's corporate brand. We continue to roll out and train our sales management and marketing associates on our new CRM tool so as to create a more efficient and effective sales process in this critical channel.","We have added to and strengthened our merchandising team at all levels of management in preparation for rolling out our category management process to our customers in the coming weeks. Four categories comprise the pilot wave and represent nearly $1 billion in annual spend.","A key step in building out our capabilities in this all-important area of our business was the hiring of Tom Bene as Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer. Tom joined us in mid-April and will oversee our merchandising and supply chain activities as well as work closely with our sales, marketing and operations teams.","As I conclude my prepared remarks, I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. Sysco is the clear leader in the $235 billion foodservice marketplace. While our industry has recently experienced some pronounced short-term pressures and has not consistently participated in the modest economic recovery to date, we expect this industry to achieve 1% to 2% annualized real growth over the long term. We have consistently grown our market share since our inception more than 40 years ago, and we are committed to continuing to do so in a profitable manner.","Our industry has and will continue to experience significant change. We have proactively developed a solid strategy to expand our leadership position over the long term by renewing our focus on enhancing our customers' experience with Sysco so as to create ongoing profitable growth and strong free cash flow for our shareholders.","We are driving our transformational change throughout Sysco. We must do so in order to realize our full potential as an enterprise. But such change is difficult and may result in uneven performance on our part in the short term. Through the exceptional talents and dedicated efforts of our 47,000 associates, we remain highly committed to, and focused on, providing outstanding value to our customers and shareholders as we move forward.","Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.","Robert C. Kreidler","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $10.9 billion or an increase of 4.0% compared to the prior year, driven by case volume growth of 1.7% and food cost inflation of 2.4%. Acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 1.8%. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.1%.","Gross profit in the third quarter increased 2.1%. Gross margin in the third quarter declined 34 basis points, and roughly half of this decline was due to the shift in customer mix as a result of faster growth in large regional and national customers. The remainder of the decline in gross margin was driven by the difficult sales environment during the quarter and continued competitive pressure.","While we experienced good case growth in our large national and regional customers, our street case volume was particularly soft during the quarter. Overall, our case growth, excluding acquisitions, declined 0.2%.","Operating expenses increased $140 million, or 9.8%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year period. Operating expenses for the quarter include $50 million in certain items, including a $41 million charge to withdraw from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan and $9 million in restructuring items mainly related to the freeze of our executive retirement plans. We provided guidance on both of these charges in an 8-K filed in January as well as during our last earnings call.","Compared to the prior year period, certain items drove $46 million of the increase in operating expenses. Increased Business Transformation costs accounted for an additional $34 million of the operating expense increase. Lastly, salaries and related costs increased operating expenses by $22 million due mainly to increased 401(k) expense, acquisitions and higher delivery costs, partially offset by transformation benefits related to sales organization changes and our IT restructuring.","As a result of all these items, operating income decreased $102 million or 23%.","Net earnings for the third quarter were $201 million, a decrease of $58 million, or 22%, compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.34 per share, a 23% decrease compared to the prior year.","Adjusting for certain items, such as the changes related to the MEPP withdrawal and restructuring retirement plans, diluted EPS was $0.40 per share for the quarter. As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it's important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes the $50 million in certain items but also excludes Business Transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business as we go through our Business Transformation, adjusted operating expenses increased 4.4%, adjusted operating income decreased 4.4%, adjusted net earnings declined 1.4% and adjusted EPS declined 2% to $0.49 per share.","We continue to be very active in the acquisition arena and have surpassed our stated goal of increasing sales from acquisitions by 0.5% to 1%. As Bill mentioned, in April, we completed the acquisition of Bahamas Food Service, a Broadline distributor based in the Bahamas. BFS has annualized sales of approximately $200 million. This acquisition further expands Sysco's international footprint and provides an even greater breadth and depth of products and services for our BFS customers. BFS is the leader in the Bahamian market, which has meaningful growth potential. We also believe that there are some synergies to be achieved between BFS and IFG, our international division that ships products throughout the Caribbean.","Including this acquisition, to date in fiscal 2013, we have completed 11 transactions that, in the aggregate, approach nearly $1 billion in annualized sales.","Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the third quarter, project expenses totaled $83 million, and we capitalized $4 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter, project expenses totaled $49 million, and we capitalized $44 million related to the project.","As Bill mentioned, although we continue to accelerate specific functional initiatives, we are going to implement enhancements to the broader SAP platform before continuing our enterprise-wide rollout schedule. As a result, we will not convert any additional operating companies this fiscal year. Our rollout schedule in fiscal '14 will be determined once we are able to assess the success and timing of the additional changes and enhancements we are making to this system.","Our prior guidance for the run rate of project costs was $300 million to $350 million annually, and we still expect to be in that range for fiscal 2013. We'll be reassessing the ongoing costs over the next several months as we make these additional changes and enhancements.","I want to reiterate that the changes to the timing of the deployment of the broader ERP platform have no impact on the approximately $600 million of annual benefits targeted for fiscal 2015. And as Bill mentioned, we believe we are generally on track to achieve these benefits. Examples of our progress so far include: expenses related to our retirement plans are significantly lower than they would have been had we not frozen all of our old plans, and we expect them to decline further next year; after restructuring our sales organization, expenses are significantly lower than the prior year; after restructuring our IT department, expenses are lower year-over-year.","We're also making progress on our category management initiatives as we begin to roll out pilot categories to our customers, and the ongoing work of additional waves continues at a good pace. In addition, we are enhancing compliance across the organization with existing sourcing programs.","Finally, we are making progress on some of the operations initiatives, including implementing our maintenance module and realigning our incentive plans for our driver and warehouse personnel.","Unfortunately, this progress has been masked by the current difficult business environment and general operating performance of the underlying business that did not meet our expectations.","Turning to our cash flow performance. At our Investor Day and recently again at CAGNY this year, we discussed our plans to gradually reduce capital expenditures back to historic rates. We've made good progress on this objective with capital expenditures declining $260 million in the first 39 weeks of this year compared to last year. We've seen a decline in capital spending related to the Business Transformation Project mainly driven by the fact that we began implementation of the new technology earlier this year. In the underlying business, we've seen lower capital spending because of a reduction in the number of major facilities projects this year compared to last and a more disciplined capital allocation and approval process.","As a result of the reduction in capital spending, free cash flow increased 40% year-over-year to $386 million. We expect the impact of continued lower capital spending this year will contribute to an improvement in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.","Cash flow from operations was flat year-over-year for the quarter and decreased $149 million for the first 39 weeks, primarily driven by the decline in net income.","Turning to a couple of guidance items for a moment. We now believe our capital expenditures for the year will be $550 million to $575 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of $600 million to $650 million, partially due to the timing of certain construction projects, which will increase fiscal 2014 as compared to prior guidance.","We continue to expect fuel expense for the year to increase in a range of $10 million to $20 million. Right now, it looks likely that we will come in at the high end of that range, although fuel prices have been recently trending down.","In closing, the current economic recovery continues to be modest and marked by inconsistent consumer trends and unforeseen headwinds. The foodservice industry environment and our financial results reflect these challenges. However, we are working to improve on those elements of our business that we can control, including enhancing our product and service offering, managing our costs, increasing our free cash flow, achieving our targeted Business Transformation benefits and addressing the requirements of our technology transformation in a prudent manner. We also continue to ramp up our acquisition pipeline. The work we are doing will position us to take advantage of market trends as the health of the consumer recovers, enhance our ability to grow our market share over the long term and expand upon our leadership position in the industry.","With that, operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Karen Short with BMO Capital Markets.","Ryan Gilligan","This is actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. Can you guys talk about the competitive environment maybe by customer type? Is the weakness with the independent customers due entirely to the environment? Or are you losing some share there?","William J. DeLaney","That's -- I would say the competitive environment overall is about the same as it's been the last 2 or 3 years. It certainly feels a little more acute right now just because of, I think, the pressure on a lot of our customers, but I don't know that it's any worse. It's hard for me to really measure that. I would say to you I think the competitive environment may be a little more acute or a little tougher with the smaller restaurant operators, that type of thing, where they're particularly under pressure, but that's more conjecture on my part than anything else. We don't have great data on that.","Ryan Gilligan","Okay. And switching to the category management initiative. Can you guys talk about how your customers and marketing associates are reacting to it, at least in the pilot categories?","William J. DeLaney","Yes. We've spent several weeks, and now months, working internally with our merchandising folks here and our operating companies. We've had meetings at all levels, including the presidents and VPs of sales and merchandising. We've run this out through our sales meetings, and that's still going on. So we haven't launched yet, but we would hope to launch these categories here over the next few weeks, as we said. Now it's being very well received. Obviously, people are very interested to see where the pricing is going to come in and that type of thing, but we've done a nice job, I think, in communicating internally. We're working well with our suppliers. And again, this is a different approach than what we've taken in the past with sourcing, whereas we're focusing on the assortment being broader and less redundant. We're looking to partner with our suppliers and customers to grow the business and take cost out at the same time. So we're optimistic. The one caution I guess would be this is something that we've never done before and really no one in this industry has done the way we're approaching it. So we expect that there'll be some challenges as we go forward, but at this point our people are very excited about it.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So a couple of things. So first, Bill, do you think -- when you look at the macro environment, what, if anything, can you guys do to stimulate demand with your customers and be comfortable that the price elasticity, if that's what drives it, is acceptable?","William J. DeLaney","Yes, I think, John, what we have to do is focus on the micro environment. So the macro -- we've talked for a while now, you're very familiar with us and this industry. What I tried to lay out in my prepared comments is that we still think this industry is going to grow at modest levels, 1%, 1.5%, 2% maybe, but there's going to be some peaks and valleys and we're in a little bit of a trough right now, especially on the restaurant side. Last year, we saw more growth. First half of this year, we saw more growth. So I think the key is these strategic initiatives that we've been discussing, and this is where we're going places where we haven't been before. So it starts with the customer, John. We have excellent service levels out there in terms of how our MAs provide support to their customers, our on-time deliveries, we're in stock, all that type of thing. We perform at a very high level. Now from the customer's perspective, probably the other guys have gotten better over time, so that gap isn't as big. But in reality, we're compared to how we did last week. So we need to continue to do well operationally from a basic service standpoint, but we need to also differentiate ourselves more and more. So it starts with better understanding what's important to the customer. And we've got some good work going on there with Bill Goetz and his marketing team. I think that will take us to some segment work, where, when you look at that 1% to 2% growth, probably most of that is going to come in ethnic segments, and we're going to have to continue to strengthen our ability to focus in on those groups, focus in on certain geographies where we have a lot more upside from a market share standpoint, that type of thing. We believe category management over the long term will be very good for our customers and for Sysco. And again, we're approaching that in a very balanced way, both from a growth and from a cost savings standpoint. And Sysco Ventures, while it's still very much in its development stage, we're hoping to have a platform in place there soon, where we can augment our product offerings with several services and technology-based business solutions that should create greater traction with our customers as well. So when -- again, when I talk about we've got a proactive strategy for a new world, a new environment, those are 3 or 4 of the things that I'm trying to focus on.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","What do you think you get most out of category management? Is that more a benefit in terms of purchasing? Is it more getting the assortment right geographically? What do you think are the one or 2 big wins there?","William J. DeLaney","I think in the short term, there are certainly savings on the gross product cost savings side. But I think over the medium term, it will help us work with our customers and focus more on creating an assortment that is more relevant to their marketplace and will allow them to grow their business more effectively rather than have a lot of redundant SKUs, and not just in our warehouses but, to some extent, in their pantry as well. So I think it starts certainly with the cost savings, but it will only be successful, fully successful, if we're able to grow our business and support our customers' growth at the same time.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Then lastly, the $500 million you talked about, that's a gross benefit, correct?","William J. DeLaney","I'm not sure the -- what $500 million are you talking about?","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, because what I'm thinking about -- as you push out the implementation of ERP, do the -- that -- you would -- that pushes out the cost of the program or no?","Robert C. Kreidler","The actual implementation cost, yes, of course.","William J. DeLaney","Yes. Yes, sure. But where we're focused on right now -- I'll let Chris jump in here. But, I mean, what we're focused on right now, John, is getting a really good handle on what's the most effective way to go forward here over the next 2 or 3 years in terms of deployment, and we'll be assessing the annual cost as we do that. So we've got to look at pace, and we've got to look at annual cost at the same time.","Robert C. Kreidler","John, was your question about the approximately $600 million of annualized benefits we've referred to?","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, yes.","Robert C. Kreidler","Okay.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","What about these...","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes. So first and foremost, both Bill and I have said that those are not impacted by the timing of our ERP rollout. Secondly, we would -- we actually don't characterize those as gross costs. To the extent that we have costs associated with implementation, we're actually -- we have to cover those. But we expect that $600 million to be net.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Over and above implementation cost?","Robert C. Kreidler","That is correct, yes.","William J. DeLaney","And John, I'm not trying to confuse this, but...","Robert C. Kreidler","Well, hang on, John, let me -- I can go -- I'm going to cut you off. They're separate categories. $300 million to $350 million is an actual operating -- or implementation expense, operating expense around ERP, we're going to have that, and we'll continue to give you annual guidance on that. The $600 million is a gross benefit, yes. We don't net the 2 together. If you want to do that, feel free to do that.","William J. DeLaney","Right.","Robert C. Kreidler","But the benefit that we look at is that $600 million, which we would hope to be even more than that as we get further out, we've only given 3 years of guidance, that will be with us forever and ever. The implementation cost will eventually go away.","William J. DeLaney","That's what I was going to say, but Chris said it better. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll now move to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A follow-up on the $600 million savings. I'm looking at the Investor Day presentation, where a little over half was SG&A and the rest from COGS. Is that still roughly how you're thinking of it? Second, Chris, you mentioned restructuring, sales, your retirement plans, other things. Could you give us sort of the run rate of what you have achieved in dollars and I guess build a bridge using the cost of goods sold and category management to get to the $600 million?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, well, I probably won't go so far as to build a bridge for you, but let me start with the top of your question and work my way to the bottom. So we did say $550 million to $650 million. We're just saying approximately $600 million midpoint. We said about 25% of that would be in the first year. So roughly, call it the midpoint, $150 million-ish worth of benefits for the first year. We do believe we're on track in the first year. We laid out kind of how we were going to get there, and you obviously have looked at the slides in terms of there'll be a component that's SG&A, there'll be a component that's lower cost of goods. We've kind of said in different calls we're getting to our number. We're not getting there exactly the way we thought we would get there. So some of the front-end stuff, restructuring our pension plans, et cetera, very painful, very difficult stuff to do, but you can do it rather quickly. So we got to that fairly fast. The SG&A component and specifically the S part of that, the sales component, that's work that's been done. And frankly, we thought it would take longer to get to that, and it happened a little sooner than we thought. And then some of the, what I'll call operating expense reductions and initiatives out in the field, given the environment, those are coming along slower than we thought. They're a little harder. We haven't tried to give you a bridge on the retirement planning stuff. That's a little bit difficult. We did, I think, telegraph what the overall savings are this year compared to what they would have been, which I believe is about $85 million better than what they would have been with the discount rates and the other factors that go into that calculation. On a year-over-year basis, they're $15 million to $20 million worse than last year. So we've given you that. And then the only other thing, I think, we've tried to telegraph to you without numbers is the expenses will be frankly higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year on that increase. So $15 million to $20 million year-over-year higher, but you actually get a little benefit in the first part of the year and detriment in the last part of the year just because of the way the accounting works. Next year, we expect those costs will go down further as the run rate kicks in.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And just on the bridge idea, I can appreciate you not wanting to update that or spend the whole call on that. But is it fair to say the cost of goods sold component is the majority or the largest part of what's to come?","Robert C. Kreidler","I would say actually no. The way we worked out the $600 million, it almost equally balanced between the lower cost of goods and then lower operating costs. The timing of those is different. The category management initiatives are back-end loaded because there's a much longer ramp-up period, there's a testing period, there's a pilot period and then you start delivering wave after wave. So we've talked a lot about the 4 pilot categories. We're now to the point where they actually get rolled out, and then you have waves that come after them. So year 1 is pretty light in terms of lower cost of goods. A lot of what we're getting in year 1 we've said would be from additional sourcing initiatives, specifically better compliance around sourcing. We are seeing that. Category management has ramped up really well, and now we've got to see benefits from category management in year 2 and even more in year 3. So the timing is not equal, but the overall benefit from each of those 2 major components is about equal in the $600 million figure.","William J. DeLaney","Yes. Andy, I think the other thing I would add to that is on the SG&A, Chris is on point we've -- we're off to a fast start there. I think you'll see more of that in year 2 on the admin side as some of the pension benefits kick in again next year. So we're doing a little better there than we planned on the SG&A side. Not quite as well on the operating cost savings. That's turned out to be a little more complex than what we thought. But we are -- we have turned the corner there, and we're expecting to see good improvement. We managed our expenses actually pretty well in the third quarter given the environment at the operating company level, and I think we'll see good results there over the balance of this year and next year. And then the COGS, Chris nailed that as well. We -- the first year, what was implied in those savings was pretty modest, more about sourcing. So year 2 becomes the first big year on the category management. Now look, we haven't even launched it yet, so we'll talk more about it as we get into it and see what's working and what some of the challenges are. A little color on that. It's a massive undertaking. We've strengthened the team quite a bit, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we feel good about the savings. But it may take a little longer to roll this out than what we originally thought, but we also expect the benefits to continue beyond the third year here as well. So we're excited about that, but, again, we've got a lot of work to do here over the next few months.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And just lastly on the same subject, now how do you think about sharing the savings with customers to drive market share or just help their business so they can increase their same-store sales through lower menu prices? And -- or it's sort of being presented, at least the way that I'm hearing it, as if it's sort of all slated to go to shareholders and earnings power directly. But could it go more indirectly through supporting your customers?","William J. DeLaney","You must be talking to our competitors, I guess. That's not the way we're presenting it. Look, what we've tried to do here over the last few years, Andy, we are sourcing work as we've further developed our supply chain work and some of our internal transfer pricing. The whole key here is for us to continue to get better at providing our operating companies with what we call market-relevant pricing. And that's easier -- that's an easier figure to quantify and determine in some categories than it is in others. So what we will do is we will lock in some pretty meaningful gross savings. And as appropriate, we would expect to pass along some of those savings to our customers to make sure that our sales people are properly positioned on the street with good, solid pricing. And I think you'll probably see us, early days, invest some money in promotions, too, just to help grease the skids, here. Because this is change, and we think it's good change, but any change is difficult these days. So I think you'll see us invest in price to some extent, to the extent that we think that's appropriate, and also some promotional activity.","Robert C. Kreidler","And Andy, as we calculated the potential benefits from category management, we made the assumption we would have to, need to, want to pass through some of the cost savings down to the customer level. As Bill said, some just to get the market-relevant pricing and some just more temporary promotional-type spending. So those numbers are built into our estimates. We've already learned in the pilot categories in some places we were a little conservative, in some places we were too aggressive. We expect we'll get that in every wave, but we've made an estimate and it's in those numbers already.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. So you're saying the $250 million to $300 million is net of what we're talking about?","Robert C. Kreidler","It is net of our estimate of what we believe we will need to pass down to make this work all the way through to the customer level, that's correct. Now again, as Bill said, we're at the point where we're going to the customer. So we're about to see how good our estimates are.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Last quick question. Has volume picked up any in March and in April?","William J. DeLaney","I'd say the trends are a little bit better, but the problem is February was just ugly. And so we just saw a significant falloff as you see in some of the restaurant publications in February. So I'd say it's still been somewhat soft here in March and April, but the trends are better than what we saw in February.","Operator","We'll now move to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bill, you talked about volume getting better throughout the year. Is that just based on what you said about sort of March, April? Or are you expecting volume to get better incrementally on top of that?","William J. DeLaney","I think what I'm trying to say, Ed, is we got hit with a lot of things, our customers got hit with a lot of things in this past quarter, and I think some of that will cycle out. So, I mean, if you guys go back and listen, I've probably done 25 calls since I've been back here 6 years. I hate talking about weather. But -- I don't think you'd find that I've talked about it hardly at all. But we have had weather issues going back to last year where it was a very favorable winter. This year, some strange weather in some different places. And even in April, we've seen an extended winter and all that type of thing. So I think some of that will run its course and that, that should help us a little bit. I'm not going to say it's dramatic, but it's a piece of it. I think some things I've touched on the -- however you want to quantify the impact of the FICA taxes and that type of thing, I think that did impact the consumer. So the key for us is the mindset of the consumer. That's what will drive them back into our customers in a bigger way and a more regular way than what we've seen. I'm not really talking about Friday night and Saturday night. I'm talking about family specials on Wednesday and business trade maybe a little bit more during the week. So I just think some of these things we've run into are somewhat more short term or cyclical in nature, and I would expect them to ease over the balance of the calendar year.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just -- I wanted to clarify a couple of things on the cost savings program and ERP. Are you -- I think are you telling us you're still expecting 50% to 70% of the cost savings in 2014. Is that right?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, we've not changed our guidance over the 3-year period. Obviously, we're building our plans right now for fiscal '14, so we're going to be taking a much closer look at where we think we'll be. But our 3-year guidance, the $600 million over the 3 years, we're good with that. The pace and sequence of that, as Bill and I have both said, we're ahead in some areas, behind in others. We've got to take a look at '14 specifically. We typically provide you guidance. To the extent we provide guidance, we provide it in our fourth quarter call so you can expect some more information from us then if we're going to change anything. But right now, like I say I -- we're making good progress in a lot of areas. As I've said in my prepared comments, it's being masked by a lot of the other stuff that's going on, unfortunately.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And to that as well, the costs associated with the program, it sounds like possibly could be higher in '14 than the $300 million, $350 million? Is that a fair way to think about it?","Robert C. Kreidler","I'm not sure what we might have said that led you to that conclusion. We're -- we-- obviously, we've got to take a look at that as we make the changes and enhancements that Bill and I both referred to in the system and start to relaunch. Look, if anything, I'm kind of looking at those costs like this. We took up a lot of pain to get to the place we're at now, which is we're at a run rate of somewhere in the $300 million to $350 million range annually. So that's now built into our expenses, as painful as it was to get here. We're going to be very, very cautious about allowing that number to go any higher, and we're going to work very, very diligently to try to figure out a way to actually implement this thing at a lower annual run rate. That's work that we're doing right now. Wayne and his team are working very hard to figure out ways to do it less expensively. I'm not sure we're going to accomplish it, but that's our goal.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then when you gave 2015 guidance, a lot has kind of transpired between now and then. Should we as investors assume that, that 2015 guidance is good until you were to actively address it?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, that's kind of a normal -- the normal rule is unless we change the guidance, we still believe in it. Look, we're not trying to sugarcoat anything. It's been tough here. When you give 3 years of guidance and your first year comes out of the box weak, it makes it hard to still see a path to your third year. But we're one year into it. So we're going to be relooking at all of that and see whether we still have a path to achieve it. Again, I've talked about the underlying business has to continue to perform. We've got to hit on all cylinders on the initiatives and the benefits we're going to achieve there to get to that guidance. We feel pretty good about the initiatives. The underlying business, unfortunately with the headwinds, we're struggling with a little bit. So we've got to hit on all cylinders to be able to get certainly to the top end of that guidance. Whether we're in the middle or at the low end of that guidance still is something we'll work through as we update our planning.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Just one last question for you on sort of balance sheet, cash flows. Your working capital to, I guess, if you look sort of year-to-date, it's been a little bit of headwind. I was hoping you could just talk specifically about working capital management, especially as sort of inventory up about 8% year-over-year and I think receivables are up 10%, something like that. So just what your thoughts are there.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, it's -- the story has really not changed since my comments last quarter. We continue to make progress on accounts payable, and we actually made maybe another $100 million of ground on accounts payable in this last quarter on a year-over-year basis. But we lost about $200 million combined between inventory and accounts receivable. Part of that is we are continuing to grow with our large regional and national customers, and they typically have longer receivable cycles. And so that -- I'll call that a mix issue, but it's certainly something that's affecting the number. We had some preestablished contractual changes that allowed for days to go out a little further on a couple of customers. So that's in there as well. Inventory is a tricky issue because while we realize it's going the wrong direction or certainly it's going a way we'd rather it not, for working capital purposes, you can't just try to shut it down too quickly because it does affect service levels. So we're being very prudent and careful in how we look at moderating or slowing down the growth in inventory, and we're putting in place or at least working on plans that we can put in place to start to bring that back down. It is going to be slower progress than I had hoped it would be, so we're doing what we can, which is on accounts payable. We're trying to make sure we manage accounts receivable and not let it extend further. And then inventory is something that's going to take a little longer to bring back into control.","Operator","Our next question will be from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'd like to start just with what you said at the very beginning about the change in how you're going to roll out the ERP system. It might be helpful if you could divide up the functions or the tasks that it will do and tell us what's delayed, which I'm assuming is the warehouse management part of it, and what parts of it are still being rolled out, which I think is HR and general ledger. Am I understanding that right?","William J. DeLaney","Okay. Let me start here, Meredith, and I'll let Chris help me out. So let's go back to the beginning. Warehouse and delivery are not part of the ERP rollout. We have excellent systems, and from day one, we never included those in the deployments. So those systems are the best-in-breed and operating fine. Obviously, they need to be interfaced with SAP, and we're -- so there's no issue there. The hub of the system, the operating system itself, is more on the sales inventory replenishment, purchasing side of the business as well as, over time, the financial reporting, all right? So what we're saying -- I'm going to go the end first and come back. So what we're saying is we're making good progress with some things we can do without fully rolling out the entire integrated SAP system with the general ledger system moving into SBS. With our, what we call our human resource module, with our maintenance module that we're using in our shops. And separately from that, with our CRM module, which we've integrated with -- from Salesforce.com. So those things are all moving along well, and we expect a couple of them are fully deployed already, as we mentioned, in the U.S. and the other 2 will be fully deployed, we expect, by the end of the calendar year. Where the delay is or where we're doing more work is on the sales purchasing inventory replenishment side, pricing side of the business. Again, I would say to you the vast majority of the system is highly functional. It's just not -- there's pieces of it that are not as functional as it needs to be for us to run this business at the level that we run it at. And we've made the decision to step back and allow our deployment teams to focus 100% of their time on addressing those issues across-the-board on the SAP platform, while the other teams can continue to drive up these other modules. And we just felt that, that's a more prudent way to go, to get better depth and better focus in terms of what the issues are and remedy these things somewhat more cohesively. Rather than try to continue to -- we could have rolled out a few more companies but to continue to do that and work on these other issues with the system just dilutes people's attention and creates resource needs, and we felt that, that was not the way to go at this stage of the game.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And the category management effort, you don't need to have the SAP system in terms of pricing, inventory management, inventory replenishment, purchasing. You don't need that to do category management?","William J. DeLaney","At some point it would have facilitated a great deal, but we don't need it to roll out category management.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, we have systems that we've operated with for, well, much longer than I've been here, for at least a decade, that can certainly handle everything that we're trying to accomplish with category management. It will be easier, more efficient and faster when we have the new system in place.","William J. DeLaney","So, I mean, at some point, the reason we're going forward here, at some point we do need an end-to-end system to run this business and have visibility to what's gone into a very complex business. But to begin to roll it out, we do not need it.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I have a question, sort of follow to Ed's question about working capital. You had a very big sale of treasury stock in the latest quarter, bigger -- even if you look at the purchase of treasury stock, it was substantially higher. Could you just talk about what prompted you to do that? And it does seem to me that it helped fund the dividend. Is that an alternative to borrowing?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, it's not something we did. It was the exercise of options. And so the stock got to a high place it hadn't been in a while, and we have a lot of employees that have been sitting on options, a number of which were expiring this year. And so we saw quite a bit of option exercise during the quarter to the tune of, I want to say, about $500 million, or I -- actually, I think that's the year-to-date number, about $500 million, a lot of which came in the third quarter. So it's not something we did to finance anything. It's something, frankly, the employees have the right to do whenever they want to exercise as long as they follow the guidelines.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But my -- the second part of my question is if you hadn't gotten that option exercising, how would -- would you have had an issue funding the dividend?","Robert C. Kreidler","No, we...","William J. DeLaney","We have no issue funding the dividend. We have a very strong credit rating, and we have a tremendous amount of debt capacity.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, I mean...","Robert C. Kreidler","We have fewer shares outstanding.","Robert C. Kreidler","And Meredith, we -- I mean, I know you understand our cash flow statements very, very well. We start with just the amount of cash we produce from the business. And then frankly, everything after that becomes a discretionary item and you just determine your priorities. The dividend is a priority for us. So a lot of what we're doing in terms of becoming more efficient with our capital expenditure is to drive more cash to the bottom line in terms of free cash flow. That is just more cash available to do whatever we think the shareholders would like us to do, one of which we know is the dividend. So we have plenty of available cash from operations as well as borrowing capacity.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, no doubt about the borrowing capacity. And then I had a question about Mother's Day. I know you've been kind enough to update us on April. Mother's Day, I believe, is one of the very biggest holidays that impact the restaurant industry. Can you -- and we're less than a week away. I'm a mother, I can say that. Any comment on how that's shaping up? Or do you think it makes a continuation of the weakness that we've seen so far?","William J. DeLaney","Well, first of all, Happy Mother's Day. Yes, it's -- today's day one of Mother's Day Week for us, Meredith. So a little early to tell. Neil won't let me give daily guidance on sales. So typically, the way these shape up is we generally have this week and there's a week right around when the schools go back in session maybe the week before Labor Day, which typically are our 2 biggest weeks of the year. So we would expect to have a big week. But the reality is the toughest comparisons are the big weeks against big weeks. So I'm not sure to what extent there'll be an increase or how big of an increase. But the one thing you can pretty much count on is almost everybody goes out for some type of meal on Mother's Day weekend, and we would certainly expect to benefit from that.","Operator","Our next question will be from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I wanted to just get your feedback on the softness that's -- specifically in your street account business that, Bill, I think you talked about in your prepared comments. I guess, as it relates to the street accounts, that has both sales and margin implications. So is there anything specific you can point to in terms of the underlying volume trends in terms of what was behind the decline sequentially in Q3? And can you also comment on whether you're seeing any pickup in the sales environment in the current quarter? I guess that's another variation of some of the questions that were asked earlier, but I just -- I'm asking in the context of your higher margin, your independent restaurant operators.","William J. DeLaney","Yes, Ajay, well, I can just try to give a little color here. And if I'm nailing it, just follow up. But I think the biggest thing we're trying to bring out -- so if you look at the quarter, it's a -- I think it's largely a sales story. We manage margins reasonably well at the segment level. We actually did a decent job managing our cost per case in the oPCos. That's hard to see with all the back and forth in some of the expense numbers, but I'll share that with you. But the restaurant segment in particular, we saw across-the-board a lot of pressure on most of our restaurant customers, whether they were independent or whether they were contract customers. The difference is that restaurants make up a larger piece, a very large piece, of our \"street business.\" So I think the big story here is right, it was a tough order for restaurants. That's a big piece of our street business, and our street business is a -- has a disproportionately higher profitability in particular on the gross margin line, so -- because of the value-added services that we provide. So if you just do the math, I mean, if you look at the first half of the year, our gross profit dollars were up about 3.5%, I think it was 3.4%. And they're up about 2%, 2.1% this quarter. So I'm not laying all of that on the street side, but I think it's a big piece of it. And so when your street business doesn't grow at the same rate and that, in fact, has very modest growth, that puts pressure on your gross profit dollars, and that's what we saw on both of those lines, both the top line and the gross profit line. As far as trends, I think I addressed that earlier. Technically, I can tell you the trends are better, but that's more  function of February was just very difficult. It's still somewhat soft in our business right now. I still think some of that is cyclical. And to Meredith's question, I think May and June will be a much better barometer in our business.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just shifting gears. On ERP, I think when you gave your preliminary outlook for fiscal '13, it was -- I think it was clear that a lot of the anticipated cost savings were not necessarily related to Business Transformation. I think you confirmed that today from a longer-term perspective through fiscal '15. But with 3 quarters in now, can you just quantify how much of the intended cost savings you've been able to achieve? And I know you're also confirming that you're on track for $600 million of cost savings by fiscal '15, but can you give some frame of reference for again, on where you are year-to-date and if $150 million of cost benefits are -- is that still the right number for this year?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, Ajay, as I think I said earlier, we're on track for the 25% of the $600-ish million in year 1. We're on track to achieve that for year 1. We're not going to get into the quarter-by-quarter assessment of where we are. And frankly, that's always going to be something hard and difficult to pull out of our numbers, but we feel pretty good about where we are for this year. And as we said, we feel good about the 3-year run rate as well. That's pretty much the extent that we're going to go.","William J. DeLaney","Yes, I think Chris said this earlier, Ajay. Look, when you look at the 3 big pieces of what we've laid out here in the road map, there's an assumption of an underlying growth rate of the business. We've talked about 4% to 6%. So if you'd use the midpoint of 5%, then there's the $600 million, which is, as we've discussed now at length, half of that, give or take, is operating cost, half of it is cost of goods, okay? And then there's the investment we're making annually in the deployment of the technology platform. So I think we're generally on track on those last 2. We not as far along as we'd like to be on the deployments, but in terms of expense and benefits, we're generally on track. Clearly, for this year, we're not seeing the 5% growth in the business that's in that road map. So we either need to make it up in benefits, which we're not putting that on the table today, and hopefully we'll get a better market environment here and better execution on our part over the next couple of years.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And just one final question. Now I know you don't want to get into quarterly projections. But on the project expenses, you indicated that $300 million to $350 million is still the right range for this year. But that still leaves a lot of variability for Q4. So is there any way you can give some more specificity on the expenses for Q4?","Robert C. Kreidler","Not on Q4. I'll tell you for the year, based on my current forecast, so I got 3 years of -- or 3 quarters of actual and forecast for 1 quarter. I mean, we're in that -- we're in the top part of that range, but we're -- right now, we're not really at risk of going over that range.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Amod Gautam filling in for John. The first question was on the ERP and Business Transformation in terms of how it's affecting -- whether or not you're getting a better view on individual account profitability. In other words, could your number of accounts and\/or market share potentially drop, but would more efficient pricing and logistics allow increased profitability?","William J. DeLaney","I don't think we're far enough along to really give you a great answer to that question. I think what we will have and certainly one of the benefits of an end-to-end system is we're going to have a better view on what we call or what some people call activity-based costing. So I think we will have a better view of profitability. And I'm sure -- well, we've done a lot of customer stratification here over the last 5 or 6 years, so I'm sure that we will have some earnings there. I think generally, we have a pretty good handle on how we make money. And so I don't know that there'll be significant falloff there in terms of customers. There might be an opportunity to sit down and have a more balanced discussion on our costs versus their costs and how we make the whole thing work together. That's typically how we try to work. I think the key for us really is as we get better visibility to our costs and what our customers' needs are to continue down that differentiation path and explore different channels, that may be more cost effective for our customers. So we're, as you know, a very traditional Broadline distributor, and there may be opportunities, whether it's inside sales or other vehicles for people to purchase food in ways that we typically don't provide to them, and perhaps there'll be an opportunity for us to get into those adjacencies. And that's certainly one of the things that we talked about in terms of how we can grow the potential for the business over time.","Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the acquisitional environment, I know you've talked -- you've got -- both of you have commented for some time that it's been somewhat a favorable acquisition environment that's driving growth above the long-term 50 to 100 basis points that you've talked to. Is that something we should continue to expect? Or are changes to the ERP rollout and potentially some pushout of the -- some CapEx, is that going to affect your acquisitional strategy in any way?","Robert C. Kreidler","It should not affect it. The types of deals that we discuss and that we've been talking a lot about this year are kind of our pipeline deals. They're small enough to where they can be fairly easily integrated into the system. We're not really concerned about an ERP rollout with those types of transactions. And then as far as CapEx, we actually -- when we talk about CapEx, that's kind of a separate line item. It does not include acquisitions themselves. So we still intend to -- I'm sure next year, we'll probably be giving guidance that at least 1% is our goal and our target. As we go forward, we'll update you to make sure that's -- what our guidance is going to be. But I think we've built a robust enough pipeline to feel good about maintaining that kind of 1%-plus range for the foreseeable future.","Operator","And we'll now move to an Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. So I was wondering if you could talk about the marketing relationship that you've had with Chef Robert Irvine and the Food Network in general, and maybe any additional thoughts as to the traction that you're seeing from those efforts or any additional opportunities you see from leveraging that relationship.","William J. DeLaney","Yes, thanks, Erin. So we just completed our first season with the Food Network and with Chef Irvine. As those of you came to CAGNY, he's a very compelling speaker and very enthusiastic supporter of Sysco. We've had very good response. The goal here going in was to create greater brand identity in terms of the corporate brand. Our research told us that 70% -- a little over 70% of our customers actually watch the Food Network in search of ideas to help them run their business better. He has this show, Restaurant: Impossible, that goes out and frankly does what we try to do it in a different way, which is to help our customers be more successful in their business. So that whole partnership is off to a very good start. It's created some goodwill, I guess for lack of a better term, with our sales force and at a time when we're throwing a lot of change at our sales force. And we've talked a lot about the market this morning, so it's been a difficult out there on the street. So very well received there. He has done some in-person functions in different locales that we're located in, and it's just created tremendous enthusiasm and tremendous goodwill, and we do believe that it's resonating with our customer base. So it's still early, but we're very excited about the relationship and hope to continue to grow it.","Operator","And with that, if there are no further questions, I'd like to conclude the conference today and thank you, everyone, for your participation."],"19862":["Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) Q2 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call February  2, 2015 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Shannon Mutschler - Vice President, Investor Relations","Bill DeLaney - President and CEO","Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Fred Wightman - Citi","Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Vinnie Sinisi - Morgan Stanley","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Kelly Bania - BMO Capital","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Operator","Please standby.

We will begin today\u2019s call with opening remarks and introductions.","I would like to turn the call over to Shannon Mutschler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Shannon Mutschler","Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Sysco\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Today you\u2019ll hear prepared remarks from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, please note, that statements made during this presentation that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s SEC filings.","This includes but is not limited to risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 28, 2014, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com or via Sysco IR app.","Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides.

In addition, all references to case volume include total Broadline and SYGMA combined.","To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions today we\u2019d like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.","Bill DeLaney","Thank you, Shannon, and hello, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported second quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased nearly 8% to $12.1 billion and adjusted net earnings increased 6% to $245 million. Adjusted EPS increased 5% to $0.41 for the quarter.","Our second quarter financial results were generally in line with our expectations, as we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance. Most important, our associates remained highly focused on providing excellent service to our customers in what remains an extremely competitive market environment.","We generated nearly 4% case volume growth during the quarter and effectively managed acute inflationary pressures in our meat and dairy categories. Specifically, case growth trends in our locally managed Broadline business were favorable in most of the geographic markets we serve. In addition, we generated solid case growth once again with our corporate managed customers in the restaurant and travel and leisure segments.","Our performance during the quarter was due in part to the benefits we realized from our portfolio of business transformation initiatives, especially category management. As our ability to effectively integrate these initiatives in our steady-state operating activities has improved consistently over time.","While we are pleased with our overall performance during the quarter, we did fall short of our expense management targets. Expense increases were driven primarily by higher incentive accruals, selling cost and delivery cost. Excluding certain items and the unfavorable impact of incentive accruals, operating expenses increased 4%.","As I\u2019ve mentioned previously, Sysco\u2019s single largest opportunity for improvement remains more consistent execution across the organization. We are implementing tools to provide increased visibility to key performance metrics, as well as improved best practices. While we are seeing some level of improvement in this area and believe we are on the right path, we have more work to do.","Regarding overall industry trends, current restaurant data shows modest signs of gradual improvement. NPD, which tracks restaurant trends, recently reported positive traffic growth in the mid-scale and casual dining sectors for the first time since 2008.","This is encouraging news as the casual dining sector includes a significant number of independent restaurant customers, for whom we provide substantial value-added products and services.","In addition, consumer confidence and employment metrics are, for the most part showing improvement. We are hopeful, lower fuel prices will further improve the customers -- the consumer outlook and lead to sustainable increase traffic and spend for our customer base.","We remain intently focused on enhancing every aspect of our business. So that we are able to better support our customers, operate more efficiently and compete more effectively.","Benefits from our category management initiative continued to gain momentum. We expect that all categories representing approximately $15 billion in annual spend will be launched into the market by the end of this fiscal year and that we will achieve the three-year cost savings target that we established prior to the start of fiscal 2013.","In addition, we are working with our suppliers in a more strategic and effective way that we believe provides a meaningful platform for growth and innovation in our respective businesses.","Turning to an update in our technology initiatives, we continue our merger integration planning with regards to technology and have begun certain fundamental projects necessary for integration.","As we move forward in deploying our ERP platform our approaches continue to evolve. For instance, we have focused on broad implementations at the operating companies for several years, with a plan to convert the hub where our shared business services facility last.","However, we have found that this created inefficiencies at SBS that would make further rollouts challenging. Thus, we are now moving forward with the rollout of SAP financial modules for general ledger, accounts payable and accounts receivable, as well as additional elements of the HR module, all of which are intended to make SBS more effectively in the near-term and make future ERP conversions at the operating companies relatively easier.","While focusing on operational excellence is a key area for us we also have important work underway to identify new markets with opportunity for profitable growth. As we discussed last quarter, we\u2019ve developed a robust approach to serve the fast-growing Hispanic restaurant sector.","We estimate that we have 10% to 15% of this $10 billion foodservice market and believe we have a significant opportunity to better serve these customers and grow our sales. We made additional strides of this effort recently with the launch of our new multi-lingual website dedicated to support customers in this segment.","The site includes news, tips, menu ideas and trend data intended to help Hispanic operators drive restaurant traffic, improve their operations and better address their customer's evolving needs. I\u2019m extremely proud of the efforts and accomplishments of our leadership team over the last several months.","As we announced last August, Mike Green retired from Sysco at the end of the calendar -- at the end of the calendar year after 24 years of distinguished service. On January 1st, Tom Bene became Executive Vice President and President, Food Service Operations, succeeding Mike. Tom reports to me and has responsibility for all business operations, sales, merchandising, marketing and revenue management.","Tom is a proven commercial leader with deep expertise and a strong track record in the food service industry. Since joining Sysco early in 2013, he has helped drive major advances in category management, revenue management, sales capability and customer insights from segmentation. We\u2019re fortunate to have such a capable leader to succeed Mike.","In addition and also effective January 1, 2015, Scott Charlton, Senior Vice President, Distribution Services, now reports to me in an expanded role. Scott leads end-to-end supply chain operations, including warehousing, inbound and outbound transportation and replenishment. Scott joined Sysco in 2013 as well and brings great energy and expertise to our senior leadership team.","Turning to an update on our proposed merger with the US Foods. Over the past 12 months, we have worked in good faith with the FTC, providing millions of pages of documents and explaining to them our industry and the merits of our proposed merger. We strongly believe that the combination of Sysco and US Foods will promote competition in where it's already a highly competitive industry by positioning us to provide significant value to our customers, including lower cost.","Unfortunately, the FTC has taken a different view of the potential competitive impacts of the merger. While we respectfully but vigorously disagree with the FTC\u2019s analysis, we announced today a substantial divestiture package that we believe fully addresses their concerns.","At this time, the FTC has not agreed to this solution. So we will now present our position, including this proposed remedy, to the five FTC commissioners and seek to obtain their approval. We remain convinced that the proposed transaction is good for our customers, our associates and our shareholders.","In closing, I'm pleased with our operating performance through the first half of our fiscal year. Case growth and sales growth were up 3% and 7% respectively, while adjusted operating income and EPS grew at a rate of 5% and 6% respectively.","In addition, many of our strategic business initiatives are gaining traction and contributing to these results. As we move forward into the remainder of our fiscal year, we are committed to improving the consistency of our operational execution, successfully rolling out our portfolio of initiatives and further developing our plans to integrate Sysco and US Foods. This is a critical time in our history and we believe the strategic actions we're taking are vital to both strengthening our customer relationships and providing solid returns to our shareholders over the long term.","Now I\u2019ll turn things over to Chris, so he could provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter as well as the agreement we announced this morning with Performance Food Group.","Chris Kreidler","Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $12.1 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to prior year. Food cost inflation was 6%, driven mainly by double-digit inflation in the meat and dairy categories.","Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.8% and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rate decreased sales by 0.9%. Case volume grew 3.6% during the quarter including acquisitions and approximately 3.3% excluding acquisitions. Gross profit in the second quarter was $2.1 billion, a 6.1% increase. And gross margin declined 23 basis points to 17.25%.","Benefits from category management contributed to our gross profit performance during the quarter. In addition, case volume growth advanced from the prior quarter and this increased demand aiding gross profit performance. In our higher margin locally managed Broadline business, case volume growth remained relatively steady and accelerated with our corporate managed customers.","Certain items for the quarter totaled $133 million and primarily related to merger and integration planning expenses. Of this amount, $81 million was recorded in operating expense and $52 million was recorded in interest expense. Merger and integration planning expenses that impacted operating expense were associated with professional fees to assist us in managing integration planning as well as the legal and IT related projects.","Work-related integration planning peaked in the second quarter and costs related to these efforts should decline going forward. Merger and integration expenses that impacted interest expense relate to the debt issuance during the quarter that is intended to finance US Foods debt upon closing of the merger.","We're trading this interest expense of this certain item until the merger closes. After excluding certain items, adjusted operating expense for the quarter increased $108 million or 6.8% compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by $115 million increase in payroll expense resulting from several factors.","First, during last year second quarter, we reduced certain management incentive accruals based on our performance versus our objectives at that time. And this year\u2019s second quarter, these same incentives are generally accrued at higher amounts, reflecting the impact of our recent performance and causing a year-over-year variance of $41 million. Excluding this year-over-year difference in incentive accruals, adjusted operating expenses would have increased only 4.2%.","Second, pay to our sales organization was higher as a result of growth in gross profit dollars. These are costs we would expect to see given our performance for the quarter. Sales cost also increased although to a lesser extent as a result of hiring additional marketing associates over the last year.","As we discussed last quarter, some of this increase in MAs is related to normal hiring to replace attrition and support growth. However, certain markets added MAs because they lost more than they planned when we implemented our sales reorganization a couple of years ago. As a reminder, it takes roughly 18 months for an MA to be fully productive.","Third, as we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters, we continue to experience higher delivery costs in our Broadline operations. As Bill mentioned, we have a number of initiatives that are in various stages of implementation that we anticipate will help to reduce these costs and increase productivity to mitigate these increases.","And lastly, payroll increased due to the newly acquired operations, including Metropolitan Poultry, the joint venture in Costa Rica we entered into last fiscal year and Iowa Premium Beef. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $396 million, up 3.1% for the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 3.3%, down 14 basis points from last year.","Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.1% compared to 35.4% in the prior year period. The majority of this change is the result of reduced state taxes from legal restructuring as well as a growing base of business in international jurisdictions that have lower tax rate. Adjusted net earnings increased 5.5% to $245 million and adjusted EPS increased 5.1% to $0.41.","Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations declined $6 million to $452 million for the first half of the fiscal year. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by two items. First, the cash impact of certain items increased $96 million year-over-year, mainly due to merger and integration planning expenses.","Second, we made a $50 million pension contribution in the first half of this year, compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding, when we make cash contribution each year.","With respect to working capital, our usage increased year-over-year mainly due to an increase in sales and inventory, driven by increased inflation and case growth. Cash tax payments for the first half of the fiscal year were $179 million, lower than last year due to a lower effective tax rate, which I discussed a moment ago and merger and integration planning expenses that reduced the taxable earnings.","Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets totaled $296 million for the first half of the fiscal year, compared to $247 million last year. Roughly, half of the $49 million year-over-year increase is due to the timing of investments in our fleet, with remainder coming from IT projects that are related to integration planning.","Free cash flow was $157 million in the first half of this fiscal year, compared to $211 million in the prior year period. These results include the $96 million increase in the cash impact of certain items to cash flows from operations and the $50 million increase in pension contributions I mentioned earlier, as well as a $16 million increase in capital spending related to merger integration.","After adjusting for these items, free cash flow was $324 million or an increase of $107 million. As we discussed last quarter, in October, we issued $5 billion in debt, the proceeds of the offering are unintended to fund the various elements of US Foods\u2019 transaction.","As we closed on the new debt issuance, we simultaneously terminated both the bridge facility and the related free issuance hedges, both of which were put in place as part of the financing strategy for the merger. Following the unwinding of the hedges, we paid $59 million in September to settle that hedge against our 10-year note issuance.","In October, we paid a $130 million to settle the hedge against our third-year debt issuance, which is shown as the financing activities in our cash flow statement in the second fiscal quarter. The financial impact of the unwind of the hedges will be amortized into earnings over 10 years and 30 years respectively.","Regarding our outlook into the third quarter and the remainder at the year, there were several additional items I\u2019d like to point out. First, as discussed on the last quarter\u2019s call, we continued to implement our category management initiative as planned and are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in integrating this approach to our business. A favorable year-over-year impact has been meaningful to our performance over the last three quarters, but we expect it will begin to moderate in the fourth quarter.","Second, regarding cost per case in our North American Broadline business, we had communicated in the last quarter that we expect that it would be difficult to meet our objective of keeping cost per case flat year-over-year. For the first half of the year, cost per case increased $0.10. While, we expect year-over-year cost increases to moderate in the second half of the year, we no longer expect cost per case to be flat for the full year. Instead, we now anticipate an increase of approximately $0.05 to $0.10 for the fiscal year.","Third, with regard to fuel expense, we have been evaluating the impact on our business of the recent decline in crude prices. While diesel prices have declined more than 20% over the course of the fiscal year, our program of entering into forward fuel purchase contracts smoothes the impact of price changes over time.","As a result, we did not have a material change in fuel expense in the second quarter or first half of this fiscal year. However, we do expect a roughly $15 million decline in fuel expense over the second half of the fiscal year. This modest projected benefit will likely be offset to some degree by lower fuel surcharges.","Fourth, as a reminder, we continue to expect to report approximately $40 million in incremental merger related interest expense per quarter, which we will exclude from our adjusted numbers until the close of the merger.","And finally, I wanted to speak for a moment about our outlook for share repurchases. Our approach to repurchases for the last several years has been to buyback shares throughout the year, with the goal of keeping shares outstanding relatively constant.","However, during this fiscal year, we have not been in the market buying shares due to the pending merger. This is half the effect of increasing our shares outstanding in the first half of the fiscal year due to the exercise of employees\u2019 stock options and RSU grants.","We are not prepared to comment about if, or when we may resume buying back shares. However, if we bought no shares for the remainder of the year, we estimate that our diluted shares outstanding may be greater than $597 million shares for the fiscal year. This estimate is dependent on the level of stock exercises that occur and does not include the impact of the shares to be issued in conjunction with the proposed US Foods merger.","Turning to an update on our proposed merger with US Foods, we believe that the divestiture agreement we announced today fully addresses the FTC\u2019s concerns. Upon closing of the Sysco- US Foods merger, this definitive agreement will include selling 11 US Foods operating locations, representing $4.6 billion in annual sales to Performance Food Group.","Sysco would receive $850 million in cash in return from PFG. The divested markets will expand Performance Food Group's geographic footprint in the U.S. and enable it to compete more effectively for both larger and smaller customers. The divested locations are Corona, California; Denver, Colorado; Kansas City, Kansas; Phoenix, Arizona; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Cleveland, Ohio; Las Vegas, Nevada and Minneapolis, Minnesota.","In addition, Sysco and Performance Food Group have signed a multi-year transition services agreement to ensure a smooth transfer of assets from US Foods to Performance Food Group. As PSA provides various support services and personnel to help Performance Food Group succeed as the new business owner in these locations.","Clearly, this development has implications for our synergy expectations. It\u2019s important to remember that integration planning work has been underway over the past year, which has enabled us to refine and enhance our confidence in our synergy estimates. As a direct result of this work, we determine that growth synergies related to the transaction were substantially higher than previous estimates.","After reducing our revised synergy estimates to reflect the facilities to be divested, we now expect net annualized operating synergies to be at least $600 million after four years. Our current expectation is that operating synergies will begin to accumulate in year two, following the close of the transaction.","In addition to operating synergies, there were substantial financial synergies related to the transaction, including interest savings, totaling approximately $150 million annually and cash tax savings from the realization of acquired NOLs, totaling approximately $150 million. We expect to realize both of these financial synergies in the first year, following the close of the transaction.","We have also updated our expectations regarding the cost to integrate the two companies. We continue to expect that incremental merger expenses will total approximately $700 million to $800 million over four years. In addition, we expect the incremental capital spend to require to integrate with total approximately $300 million to $400 million over four years.","Now, while the actual gross cost to integrate will be higher than those incremental costs I just mentioned, we expect to fund a portion of these costs from our current operating and capital expense run rates. We now expect the transaction to be accretive in the second year following the close of the transaction, excluding cost to integrate the company and deal-related amortization.","And with that, operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.","Karen Short","Hi. So just to focus on the transaction a little bit. I mean, maybe can you give some color on where you think the issues are with the FTC in terms of you both not being in agreement? And then maybe follow-up, just some color on the facilities that are being divested, the customer type EBITDA associated with the facilities, things like that?","Bill DeLaney","Good morning, Karen. I will start and I don\u2019t know how far Chris can go with that second part, but I will give a shot at that. One of the things we want to be carefully of this one is that, we don\u2019t want to be in a position where we\u2019re trying to articulate a point of view with the FTC. They will have plenty of opportunity to do that.","So what I would say is a good, a very high percentage of the conversation over the last several weeks and really months has been around their concern of -- they believe that there is a national market. They believe that there are customers out there that will only buy from distributors who have a national footprint. We disagree with that. We see and live that every day where customers -- some of these larger customers will buy from multiple distributors, they might buy from regionals or multi-regionals, they may buy from us and\/or US or PFG, and they obviously buy from specialty firms. Some may buy from only a few of us. Some may actually put most of their business with one or two of us. But our point of view is that when we compete for that business, we are competing not just with US Food and PFG, but DMA, but with a lot of regionals, who are now multi-regionals.","And even in the situation where certain customers will work with a fewer number of distributors that opportunity to work with more is always in the room when you are negotiation our peer new business. So, I think, again, I can\u2019t make their case for them, but I think that\u2019s been where we spent a lot of the time in the conversation of how we address their concerns about how these customers continue to get good service and appropriate pricing.","And that is why we ultimately, even though we disagree with the position, we are willing to put forth the divestiture package which we believe from our perspective, based on our knowledge of the business, our knowledge of the competitive landscape should allow PFG to go out and compete very well in the way that the FTC would hope. So that\u2019s my best way of describing it today. As we've said, we will have some more opportunity to speak with the FTC and the five commissioners here over the next week or two and I am sure there will be more information coming out of those meetings.","Karen Short","Okay. And can you provide us with any color on the customer types of those facilities and EBITDA dollars? And I guess just a follow-on on that. In terms of the synergy number, is the $600 million synergy, does that actually include any operating profits associated with the TSA PFG?","Chris Kreidler","So on the first part of your question, Karen, I am not going to get into the detail of facilities or the EBITDA, the package, but I will generally say, because I think it addresses what you\u2019re trying to get out there that it is a representative package, if you will, of US Foods. I don\u2019t think there is a disproportionate amount higher or lower of EBITDA or disproportionate type of customer services out of these facilities than US Food as a whole. That is generally correct, but I am going to leave it there just in terms of describing these package of facilities.","I am sorry. Remind me the other part of your question, please?","Karen Short","Well the $600 million, I mean you obviously said during this whole integration process, you\u2019ve identified additional synergies, but you\u2019re very comfortable with the $600 million that you originally put out there? I am just wondering if the $600 million includes operating. I\u2019d assume there is operating profit associated with the TSA, with PFG, does that $600 million include?","Chris Kreidler","No, it doesn\u2019t include any operating profit associated with the TSA. TSAs typically are constructed so that you\u2019re reimbursed for your costs, you don\u2019t technically make any money. If you do, it\u2019s very small amounts of money, but the way these things are constructed, you usually just reimburse for your expenses.","Karen Short","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We will move on to our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So just a few questions on the -- right on the transaction, the $600 million, that does not include any financial synergies, correct? Number two, when you found incremental synergies right beyond what you\u2019re thinking before, is that more buckets that you hadn\u2019t anticipated or buckets that are just bigger? And if there are buckets that are bigger, what might one or two of those buckets be? And then lastly, I assume all other terms of the purchase on your end remain the same, that none of that has changed, that\u2019s it?","Chris Kreidler","Okay. John, if I can, I will take those in reverse order.","John Heinbockel","Yes, sure.","Chris Kreidler","Yes, nothing changes in the transaction that we had negotiated with US Foods. That remains the same in all aspects. You are correct on the first question you asked. The financial synergies I described which the two biggest ones are interest savings over the two combined pro formas and the use of the NOLs, those are not included in the $600 million. Financial synergies, we expect to achieve in the first year after closing the operational synergies, we expect to start occurring in the second year after closing.","And then the middle question there really around where we would find the additional synergies? When we put our first synergy number out on the table I feel like I have to keep reminding ourselves as well as everybody else, it was with essentially publicly available information. We didn\u2019t have a lot of additional information. We had some experience at Sysco dealing with some of these buckets of opportunities. We had done some category management work. We have done route optimization. And so we knew that this is what we\u2019ve been able to do, what can we do if you can buy and then we made some assumptions. And we made prudent assumptions but not overly really aggressive. We are going to be candid about that.","As we\u2019ve learned a lot more about this, I would say every bucket probably increase in size, certainly around merchandising and supply chain, it will say inbound and outbound delivery transportation. Those buckets got quite a lot larger. So we\u2019ve found it across the board, but in certain places we found more. And so we rebuilt synergies from the bottom up using more information through our integration planning efforts. There is still a lot of information we are not allowed to have access to and we are abiding by all those rules. So we expect that when we eventually close and we get access to some additional information, we will true this up again. But we\u2019ve made pretty good assumptions and we are still being what I would call prudent. We are not being overly aggressive or overly conservative.","John Heinbockel","All right. And then lastly, you talked about wanting to sort of tighten up expense control, where are the biggest opportunities? And then secondly, is that something that can be done while you are in the early stages of doing the US Food integration, or is that something that has to come later?","Bill DeLaney","John, I will start there as well. I think in terms of the biggest opportunities, they are generally always going to be on the operational side. So some of our G&A costs are up this year, a fair amount of that was planned some of the work we are doing with these initiatives in the technology area.","Our selling costs are up a little more than we planned, but our gross profit is higher. So that one doesn\u2019t concern me as much. That takes you to the supply chain operations, and we\u2019ve just got more work to do there in terms of improving our productivity at a rate commensurate with where our costs go up. And we tend to be very good in this area but we\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives going on in this area as well.","I\u2019ve mentioned Scott and he has been with us a couple of years. And with our new enterprise structure, his functional group working hand in hand with our operating company leadership to basically strike the right balance between what we need to do support our customers each and every day but also putting better and more consistent best practices, monitor them better, get our compensation schemes in line with our productivity. So a lot of work to be done in that area and more to do but I would say, that\u2019s what the biggest opportunity is.","Bill DeLaney","As far as the merger, I would say, on the merger, Chris talked to this. And I let him address it again. I think we\u2019re seeing opportunities through these synergies to do better. The challenge there will be to do what we\u2019ve done, a nice job so far. I mean, so far, when you hear me speak, we\u2019d be really proud as management team and frankly all of our folks.","We\u2019ve done a nice job of being able to separate all the work and all the hours and the pressure is going on with the integration planning and still be able to run our business pretty well. So that\u2019s the biggest challenge I see post close here as to -- continue to run these businesses but drive out at that point of synergies. So I think, when we get to that point, we\u2019ll talk to you more and we\u2019ll have to come up with some ways to speak to how we\u2019re making progress here and still making sure we\u2019re shipping groceries in the right way to our customers.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Greg Badishkanian from Citi.","Fred Wightman","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. Last quarter you guys mentioned that there were some labor shortages in delivery drivers, has that situation abated? And are you guys seeing any other pockets of labor pressure?","Bill DeLaney","Good morning. We did speak to that. We still have some of those situations. It\u2019s abated some. The source of that is really two-fold, one, over the last few years -- we will see what the next few months bring with the price of oil but over the last few years, several of our markets are very much energy driven or intensive. There is a lot of good jobs out there on the energy side. Some of those jobs are very competitive or more competitive in terms of lifestyle and wages to what we offer. And so in those markets where energy has been strong, we struggled to some extent, too early to tell if that\u2019s going to abate.","The other part quite candidly is we\u2019ve had some internal issues in certain markets where as we\u2019ve centralized some of our hiring practices and begun to coordinate that process between the OpCo and our SBS center.","Certainly, we went pretty fast and aggressively and there were some markets where we didn't execute as well we should have. So we're also catching up in those areas. So there is still a handful out there too that we have some issues but it has abated and I would expect it to continue to improve.","Fred Wightman","And then you briefly mentioned this in your response to the last question but you mentioned that some geographies were performing better than others? Have you seen that trend become more pronounced especially in some of these oil producing regions?","Bill DeLaney","I\u2019d say, it\u2019s pretty pronounced in Southwest and we\u2019re seeing that for several quarters now. I would also tell you -- interesting right now when we look at the numbers up December, January or early February, if you recall, we had some really severe weather last year when we had -- we\u2019re getting more weather now over the last week or two. As you look at the markets, you can kind of see where the weather impacted last year and whether weather didn\u2019t impact last year.","So I would say, the Southwest and the West Coast, in particular, were doing well. It\u2019s hard to tell how much of that is the market and how much of that is our leadership in those markets but those two in particular. And right now looks like quarter is off to a pretty good start in terms of their season.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew Wolf","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to check, Chris, on moving the accretion to your two -- what that means for dilution in year one? I don\u2019t know if you saw but I did put on my own estimate around $0.15 if you divested $5 billion of US Foods service assets and I just used value as I think suggested just their average blended operating margin. Just would like to know, if you think that\u2019s at least in the ballpark in terms of reasonableness?","Chris Kreidler","Andrew, I would -- I have to be very careful to comment about your own estimates and your own modeling, so apologies for that. But look, originally, we believe based upon initial modeling that we thought it would be accretive in year one as we have refined all of our estimates, not just the numbers but the timing of the numbers and then overlaid the divestitures, we think its year two that is accretive.","Frankly, I\u2019m not prepared to talk about year one dilution or anything yet. We\u2019ve got more work that we need to do to pin that down. So best I can tell you is we\u2019ve shifted some stuff based upon when we think we\u2019re going to be rolling certain initiatives and where -- how we think we\u2019re going to go after some of the synergies and that\u2019s affected our -- when we\u2019re going to achieve accretion.","Andrew Wolf","But I mean, you would as well as the divestures, I mean, clearly your \u2026","Chris Kreidler","Yes.","Andrew Wolf","\u2026selling them below what you\u2019re paying for? Okay.","Chris Kreidler","Yes.","Andrew Wolf","Just wanted to ask a procedural question on the FTC, I think it\u2019s all implied but I just want to make sure I understand it. It sounds -- so you secured agreements from the commissioners to meet with them, the five commissioners and to make your case? And does that been -- have they then agreed to vote what they want to conduct their vote at that point, once you've done in the next few weeks meeting with them or the next couple weeks?","Bill DeLaney","Look Andy, I think there is one thing I think at this point of the FTC we do agree on is that its time to move this process forward. And we have plenty of time to talk and educate and listen and negotiate or whatever. So what we\u2019re at is they basically signal to us that it\u2019s time to meet with the commissioners and so we\u2019re preparing to do that. And of course along the way, since they\u2019ve signaled for quite time their concern.","They\u2019ve articulated earlier, we\u2019ve had parallel discussions with PFG. And so we\u2019re able to poll that agreement together here over the weekend. We just fell it would be in everyone's best interest, including our customers and our associates to kind of have better knowledge of what\u2019s really going on. There has been a lot of weeks, so we just fell it made a lot of sense. If we\u2019re going to visit with the commissioners to have this agreement in place so that we can look them in the eye and tell them exactly what we are prepared to do and there is no uncertainty in terms of our ability to do it. So that\u2019s a little color, I guess from my end. Chris, you want to add anything on process?","Chris Kreidler","Actually, I think that covers it well. One thing probably I\u2019m going to speak a lot to is what happened after we meet with the commissioners. There is nothing defined at that point. That is the next step that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about and it\u2019s hard to talk half that point but that\u2019s what we are. Its time to move this thing forward as Bill said.","Andrew Wolf","And just one other thing on this the deal on talking with the commissioners. Now the PFG deal, is it -- how would you think of your sense of how the commissioners view that deal as it stands? You think it\u2019s ambiguous. Have they signaled that that is not enough that could be enough or is it I guess, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to discover. How should we think about whether the deal you struck with PFG is going to way with the FTC commissioner?","Bill DeLaney ","I think you should look at it from the perspective of what we\u2019re saying, which is we\u2019ve had a lot of time and a lot of opportunity to have discussions with the FTC and as well as address remedies to concerns that they have, which we don\u2019t share but which we certainly want to address because, it\u2019s disruptive type business, it\u2019s disruptive to the business that we are acquiring and it\u2019s disruptive to our customers. So, we are trying to find a remedy here and obviously they haven\u2019t agreed anything at this point. So, I think it will be determined.","Andrew Wolf","Okay. Can I just ask one another, just a number question on the adjustment statement? The $78 million in merger integration costs this quarter was about $40.5 million last quarter and talking about the last quarter was mainly consultants. Chris, you might have talked about this, maybe I didn\u2019t understand it. But what is the majority of that stuff up in the merger spending?","Chris Kreidler","Yeah. It is mainly consultants, yeah. But that\u2019s majority of that $78 million is what we call professional fees for outside consultants that are helping us. Some of the uptick came from legal, from the fact that we have started some foundational IT projects that are going to be necessary for integration, so some of that stuff kicked in to the quarter. As we also said though, our merger integration planning it\u2019s -- I think the word we use and it\u2019s probably the word, a peak. It will be coming down from there and so that\u2019s what we work for the quarter.","Andrew Wolf","Okay. Thank you, and good luck with everything. Thank you.","Bill DeLaney","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Meredith Adler with Barclays has our next question.","Meredith Adler","Very informative. I\u2019ll actually go back and talk a little bit about operations and just want to understand. You had 6% food inflation and when you do the simple math, you wouldn\u2019t end up with volume growth of 3.3%. But obviously what that means is that you have the inflation, but your sales didn\u2019t go up necessarily by 6% because of inflation. Is that right?","Bill DeLaney","As you\u2019ve stated that\u2019s right. Is this -- is the question why?","Meredith Adler","Well, I may guess that the assumption then would be that you are still having trouble passing a long inflation?","Bill DeLaney","I think there is many of reasons, Meredith. I think some of it is mix, right. So, lot of inflation is in this higher dollar cost, boxes of meat and dairy this last quarter. So it\u2019s partially mix. It\u2019s certainly is partially, as I\u2019ve talked in the past alone to your point. So one of the things we do with customers continually, especially now is to try to listen to them, understand what their needs are, understand where they are going with their menu. And if there is some more cost effective ways for them to buy from us and to still position their menu, advantage is where and that\u2019s what we do.","So if they can offer more poultry dishes or other types of ally card items that is the plan maybe what they\u2019ve formally done with cheese or with beef then, there is some of that going on as well. I mean, our case growth still is very good in these inflationary categories I think it\u2019s the mix I think it\u2019s -- trying to find the right price point if you will for our customers.","And I think it is hard to imagine inflation, but our point is we\u2019ve been doing a better job of it here over the last year or two. And I think category management speed is beginning to help also and some of our other initiatives in terms of product training, in terms of our sales people being able to sit down have good propel conversations with our customers. So it\u2019s a lot of things, but probably mix would be as big as any.","Meredith Adler","And those comments about mix, is it fair to assume that the category management process has come up with -- I won\u2019t say identical, but similar kinds of things? I mean, you\u2019ve said in the past that it\u2019s not just about reducing SKUs. So category management is about helping the customer buy better items, or more cost effective items?","Bill DeLaney","No, not exactly, what we -- the goal is with category management is to help our customers and ourselves frankly optimize -- in our case optimize their SKUs over time, There is plenty of work still to be down there, help them use those products that we are bringing to them to augment their menu in the right way, maybe changing up a bit makes sense. But for both of us to make commitments for the customer to commit with us and for us to commit with our suppliers to take cost out of the system and to be able to buy these products better, and to realize those savings both on Sysco\u2019s bottom line as well as the bottom line. And I think, we are starting to see nice traction there on that part of it. Longer-term, we as an opportunity to really differentiate ourselves in the marketplace with expanded product lines, maybe broader not as deep, perhaps in some of the SKUs they don\u2019t move as fast where we can have more customize offerings to customers as we better understand their needs and better understand the process. And then also use this platform to bring more innovation to the offering. So in the short-term, I would look at it as an opportunity to partner more strategically with our customers, buy more efficiently, and to pass some of those savings along to the customer base. And for both of us to optimize our SKUs with the long-term goal of being able to really bring more innovation and more differentiation to the product line.","Meredith Adler","That\u2019s very helpful. And then just one quick question, maybe for Chris about fuel surcharges. Can you say how much of the cost -- it\u2019s hard because you\u2019ve been hedged, but if you give up the fuel surcharges, how much does that offset the benefit of lower fuel prices?","Chris Kreidler","Yeah. Let me come at that from this direction. First, I mean, fuel charges are a bit different, when you think about it with our larger customers and our smaller customers. With larger customers, we may have contracts that are pegged to certain fuel price. They may go up, they may go down. They last for periods of time. That\u2019s not something that you just \u201cgive up\u201d because they were structured into the cost structure of the contract. Fuel surcharges on the street are different and obviously they can change on a daily, weekly, monthly basis.","So the concept of quote, giving them up doesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s harder for me to address. I will say this. We look at fuel, when we look at what\u2019s happening to fuel. We did not raise fuel surcharges, when fuel prices started going up and that was kind of one of the luxuries of our forward buying strategy. It gave us time to asses what was really going on before we needed to react. Now that they are coming down, we are looking at it actively to see what\u2019s appropriate in the market and for our customers and we\u2019ll continue to look at that.","But we wanted to flag is, it\u2019s a big story out there. There is a reason why it doesn\u2019t impact our fuel cost because of the way we smooth on an ongoing basis. So it hasn\u2019t in the first half, we are flagging that it will, to the extent at least to $15 million, which is in our overall cost structure is a very small amount. But that\u2019s what we need to look at when we think about the fuel surcharges, how much of that amount might need to be mitigated with adjustments to the surcharge.","Meredith Adler","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move on to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward Kelly","Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning.","Chris Kreidler","Good morning, Ed.","Edward Kelly","Two quick questions for you. Chris, just one follow-up on the $600 million in synergies. Since -- ever since the deal was announced, there was lots of talk around potential negative synergies from things that customer overlap. I don't know to what extent you\u2019ve had the ability to take a deeper look at that and maybe some color there would be good and also the $600 million net. Does that basically contemplate any possible negative synergies as well?","Chris Kreidler","Yeah. Look, we continue to look at that. Early on, we obviously needed to make some assumptions just to figure out what we thought an appropriate, what the return would be in, whether it was an appropriate return to the amount of investments. So, we made some assumptions. As we\u2019ve gone toward the integration planning process, we\u2019ve continued to refine our thinking there and one thing I can tell you is there is no good science around predicting that. I can make a guess, you can make a guesses, and we could be wildly different in our guesses.","And then secondly, there is no real way to measure it even after the fact. So what we\u2019ve done instead is just try to get into what would cause a customer to want to leave and then what can we do reason by reason to medicate that risk. And so we\u2019ve spent an inordinate amount of time through all of our integration planning teams to go after those issues.","Everything that we are working on is based on the principle of we want to make this as at least disruptive to our customers as we possibly can, our customer and US Food\u2019s customers as we possibly can. And so we are not spending a lot of time trying to estimate potential disruption or losses of customers. We are spending all of our time trying to make sure that we know what might cause them to leave and how we\u2019re going to address that right out of the box so they don\u2019t leave.","Now to address your question, we are calling these net operational synergies because we do believe it takes into account what we might see in the way of disruption. But it\u2019s our estimate and we frankly hope that we\u2019re going to be wrong and it\u2019s going to be better than that.","Edward Kelly","Okay. Good. Thank you. And then my just one follow-up question here. You\u2019re growing gross profit dollar per case. Again, this is I think the fourth quarter now that we\u2019ve seen it. So it obviously speaks positively about the business, speaks positively about the industry. But I was curious about is how much of it is sort of internal initiatives, things like category management versus just a better industry outlook as well? I was wondering if you could maybe help parse that out for us.","Bill DeLaney","Great question, hard to answer, Ed. I think we\u2019re hopeful on the -- some of this positive consumer sentiment that\u2019s been out there for a while begins to get to our customer base and that will translate into more industry growth.","Our quarterly numbers as you track them, you see they have been float around between 2% and 3% here over the last few quarters. We do have a positive growth for the locally managed customers now, which we didn\u2019t have a year ago. So that\u2019s a big part of it which coming back to mix and the different way customer mix.","We\u2019ve spent, as you can appreciate, a lot of time and effort over the last 15 months with best practices and how to manage margin better and still effectively deliver customers need in terms of offerings. But clearly the category management is driving a fair amount of it right now. And we\u2019re doing a better job of integrating it as I said in my prepared comments into the everyday business activities. So I would say that\u2019s a large part of it.","Edward Kelly","Great. Thank you.","Bill DeLaney","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on to Vinnie Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Vinnie Sinisi","Hey, great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you guys about the ERP rollout. It seems like parts of it are going to continue to move forward here. I know on the past you\u2019ve said that with the merger pending that you are kind of taking a bit of a step back on some of those processes. So can you just kind of recap for us all in terms of -- is this now going to really restart here or are some parts of it or which parts of it will still be waiting on the outcome of the merger?","Bill DeLaney","Good morning. I think it\u2019s more of what we talked about over the last couple quarters in terms of, we are not doing new deployments right now until we have a better sense for where the merger is going to play out and when and some of the geographic issues that will come with that.","But what we\u2019ve been able to do and we did -- when we talked about in the last earnings call, we\u2019ve been able to go in and put in some significant enhancements into the software that are now being utilized by the 12 OpCos that are on and the core SAP software platforms.","And the other thing we are doing more of, which we spoke to here today, is taking some of the other applications, whether they\u2019re financial or HR, maintenance that type of thing, even for the SA -- even for the non-SAP OpCos bring those into SPS, accelerating network to where SPS is now, supporting in certain areas, not just the 12 OpCos that run SAP, but these are the functional support software packages as well.","So to summarize, I think it\u2019s a combination that we\u2019re continuing to enhance the support around and the software that the 12 OpCos are using as well as beginning to leverage SPS in a different way and as I said. So, A, we\u2019re providing better services to the 12 OpCos today, but also when we do begin to redeploy again, those future conversions can go more, more smoothly. And then we\u2019re still -- we\u2019re going to defer any further deployments until we understand the timing of the merger a little bit better.","Vinnie Sinisi","Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up. Going back to the 11 facilities that were called out today, any further color that you guys can give in terms of perceived market share or the competitive stands in those areas? And then also just as a matter of process, I just want to make sure that I'm correct here. When dealing with the FTC, so those 11, the proposal of those 11 facilities you kind of have already gone to the first level of discussions. And now it\u2019s in a sense being escalated to the five commissioners. I just want to make sure that that is correct.","Bill DeLaney","Yes. So let me be clear or try to be clear. We\u2019ve had multiple discussions over multiple months with the FTC. And we are trying to the best of our ability to understand not just the nature of their concerns and the depth of their concerns and the breadth of their concerns, but also how we think we can remedy those concerns based upon our knowledge of this industry, based upon our knowledge of how to shift groceries to customers and our knowledge of competitive positioning.","So this package is a package that we have developed that we believe addresses their concern. We have received no approval from the FTC at any level in this package.","Vinnie Sinisi","Okay. And then just, I guess maybe you can say so much at this point, but any further color on the specific markets where these 11 are located?","Chris Kreidler","No, we\u2019re really not going to get into the talking about market share and the individual markets.","Vinnie Sinisi","Okay. Now totally understandable. All right. Great. Thanks very much. Good luck going forward.","Bill DeLaney","Thank you.","Chris Kreidler","Thank you.","Operator","We move on to Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Ajay Jain","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess Bill, based on your prepared comments on the merger and the objections by the FTC staff. I'm just wondering if your announcement with Performance Food could really set the stage for litigation with the FTC.","So if the process goes in that direction, do you think you can wrap up any potential litigation and complete the merger process? By the time the agreement is set to expire, I think that deadline is in September if I'm not mistaken. So do you feel like you're potentially running out of time to the extent that's an issue at all?","Bill DeLaney","So I want to make I am answering this right. We think we have ample time if we do end up in some litigation to work through that and still bring that to some type of closure before the expiration of the merger agreement.","Ajay Jain","And just finally on -- as a quick follow-up on the merger-related expenses, can you just quantify little bit better how much you expect that to moderate in the back half of the year?","Chris Kreidler","I would love to be able to have a forecast for merger-related expenses and certain of those line items. I can do that. I can say these consultants were, we don\u2019t need them anymore and these consultants we still do. But a lot of just depends on what we\u2019re doing in the fourth quarter -- in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the year. So it is rather difficult to estimate those expenses on a go forward basis.","So I mean to say they\u2019re moderating, they\u2019re certainly not going to go to zero. There is work that we are going to continue to do to prepare, but we\u2019re certainly looking to stand down any teams that have completed their work. So that we can reduce those expenses and we look at that literally every month to decide how many consultants we need here supporting us. But it\u2019s too hard to call frankly where we\u2019re going to be in the process and what work needs to be done.","Ajay Jain","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Hi. Great. Just really quickly from me at this point. The overall trend of inflation kind of going forward, calendar \u201915 and if not calendar \u201915 at least, back half of your fiscal \u201915 and just in terms of, where you see it trending and from a gross profit per case perspective it was potentially kind of getting back into a place where passing out pricing can be easier to the customer in relation to a previous question? Thanks.","Chris Kreidler","I don\u2019t think we are there yet, John. I do think we are beginning to see some subsiding in the trajectory of the inflationary rate. So, hopefully, we have peaked here at the 6%. It\u2019s still early this quarter. The individual categories are moving around. Right now, the bulk of the inflations we see here today is more in the meat side and dairy beginning to level out.","So we don\u2019t make predictions or give guidance. But I -- you really asked two questions. I think the inflation overtime, over the next six, nine, 12 months, should subside to some degree. I don\u2019t know where it ends up.","But, hopefully, less than the 5% to 6%, because as we always said that\u2019s not good for our customers and that\u2019s why sometimes it\u2019s a -- actually most of time, is how to pass those along as fast as you would like. So I think we are seeing a little early, but too early to call until get into March and April, and we kind of back into the heavier volume months.","John Ivankoe","Thank you.","Bill DeLaney","Welcome.","Operator","We will move on to Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.","Kelly Bania","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just another one related to the merger. Just based on your discussions with FTC over the last year and what their concerns are? I am just curious how you would characterize what you perceive is the likelihood that the FTC will accept this proposal as a remedy. I mean, does this address all of their concerns in your point of view?","Bill DeLaney","I appreciate the question. I don\u2019t think I am in a position to really address the likelihood. There maybe other people out there that can give you a better handle on that. I would just continue to say that we believe strongly in this merger. We believe it\u2019s pro-competitive in what\u2019s already and incredibly competitive industry. We believe it\u2019s good for our customers. Clearly, there will be some disruption.","So I am sure there has been some concerns convey to the FTC and to us from that standpoint. But that\u2019s not unusual mergers. We spend a year and tens of millions of dollars preparing integration plan to mitigate as much disruption as possible and we think over the medium-term to longer term.","This is very good for our customer base. This is going to be for our shareholders. We think it will actually raise the bar for competition in our industry, which long-term is good for everybody in our industry. So we believe strongly in our case and that\u2019s probably all I can should and can comment on.","Kelly Bania","Okay. And then, just maybe another follow-up, how were these 11 DC selected, just give us some quick math, I think, you still have about 80 DCs and these look even like they are either larger or more highly productive than the average? Just any comments there would be helpful.","Bill DeLaney","Yeah. I am going to start and Chris can give you probably little more, essentially, I think, you can see as if you put together all the color we are trying to provide today. We try to put together footprint that would address, the Western part of United States in a way that we complement the current footprint FTC has, which is across the country, but it\u2019s a little less dense in the West compared to U.S. So what you are seeing there primarily is an attempt both with large and medium sized facilities to address that.","Kelly Bania","Okay. Thank you very much.","Chris Kreidler","Thank you.","Bill DeLaney","Welcome.","Operator","We will move on to Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.","Mark Wiltamuth","Hi. Good morning. So, one of the challenges on the divestitures, is there anyway to guarantee that the customers really follow the facility divestitures? And I wonder if there is anyway you could give us from a big picture standpoint, what the market share on the national accounts look like before and after the divestiture?","Bill DeLaney","Well, there is no way to guarantee. But, again, we have done a lot of work on the integration planning and working through this TSA agreement with PFG to address that and Chris has been leading that work. So I\u2019ll let him take that.","Chris Kreidler","Yeah. I mean, one other things, as I said in our integration planning, one of our primary principals was the least amount of disruption to our customers, US Foods customer. We took the same approach in our discussions with PFG and obviously, they care a lot about that as well and so we\u2019ve structured it in a way that we believe it\u2019s going to be least disruptive to those customers.","So if you think about our customer that\u2019s being serviced out of the call it Denver facility for US Foods today, that same sales person or the same trucks, food coming out of that same facility is going to go to that customer ones it is owned by PFG.","So we believe that\u2019s the least amount of disruption to the customer and as long as they continue to get good service at fair prices and value, we don\u2019t believe there is a reason for them to want a change. So I\u2019m agree with Bill, there is no guarantee, but I believe we except this stuff in a way that\u2019s the customers will continue to get good service and good value going forward.","Mark Wiltamuth","Are there long-term contracts that transfer and is there a non-compete agreement or anything like that on going after this customers?","Chris Kreidler","Yeah. There is a lot of things that will be contained in the 8-K, which we will file later this week. So I\u2019d encourage you to look into that. There is an enough in there, I think, keep you busy for awhile. But as you might imagine we intend to and FTC, of course, would want us to set PFG up for success here and again, and do it in a way that our customers don\u2019t feel or experience that disruption. So everything that\u2019s necessary to make that happen we put into the TSA or the agreement.","Bill DeLaney","I think just to illustrate that for maybe -- from a layman standpoint. What Chris and Russell and our teams have done is basically, as you look at, don\u2019t just look at this facilities, from a customers perspective, they are going to be position at the same sales persons, same driver, the same customer service team in this TSA agreement, which you can look at, once we get it out in the K -- 8-K. We have taken a lot of measures to position PFG to be successful as they transition that business. So we have done a lot of things to position them for success early days here.","Mark Wiltamuth","Okay. And I know you\u2019ve address this, the $600 million synergy number, but you stand back and look at the deal from a broad perspective, US Foods have lost earnings power, while it\u2019s been waiting for the transaction to close. If you look at where they are today, add in the synergies, where do you think you will be on EPS accretion by year four or five?","Bill DeLaney","We have not given and I\u2019m probably not going to today give any kind of forecast for earnings accretion. We obviously have re-looked at the transaction based upon everything that\u2019s happened over the year and based upon this divestiture package and we still feel this is a very nice return for Sysco and our shareholders.","We have got to, obviously, get the deal close and then we have got to work on executing against the synergies and we now also and will be a little more, add a little more complexity, we also need to work on the divestiture package and make sure that that set up alright. As long as we continue to service the customers ours and US Foods, we get a very nice return out of the transaction and that\u2019s where we are focused on.","Mark Wiltamuth","Okay. Thank you very much.","Chris Kreidler","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions. At this time that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a good day."],"19729":["Sysco Corp. (NYSE:SYY) Q2 2016 Earnings Call February  1, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Neil A.

DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning Sysco reported a strong second quarter and a solid first half of the year. These results reflect the continuously improving execution of our portfolio of strategic initiatives by all of our associates. Further, our favorable performance over the past several quarters validates that our ongoing focus on improving our customers' experience with Sysco and increasing productivity in all aspects of our business are key to our future success.","From an overall economic and industry perspective, calendar year fourth quarter U.S. GDP and consumer confidence data was mixed as favorable unemployment trends and lower gas prices somewhat offset increased concern about near-term business conditions and global uncertainty. Most recently, the precipitous drop in multiple stock market indices bears watching as it relates to potential adverse ramifications for consumers and our customers.","As far as the restaurant industry data is concerned, the overall trend remain reasonably positive amid sluggish consumer spending. According to the National Restaurant Association, December marked the 11th consecutive month of foodservice sales growth.","This closes out a strong year for the industry where foodservice sales exceeded grocery store sales throughout the year. That said, both NPD and NavTrak have shown some recent modest declines in traffic trends that we are closely monitoring.","With respect to product cost deflation, we saw an acceleration during the second quarter, driven by key center-of-the-plate categories such as meat, poultry and pork, as well as dairy. This trend has continued into the third quarter and we currently believe that deflation headwinds will persist for at least the remainder of the fiscal year.","Now, moving to our second quarter results. Total Broadline cases grew 3.4% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 0.6% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange headwinds of 1.7%. Gross profit dollars grew 3.4% and gross margin increased 50 basis points.","Adjusted operating income for the quarter grew $41 million or 10% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 17%. And importantly, we had solid execution across the business including the U.S. Broadline.","Reflecting on the first half of our fiscal 2016 performance, overall, our team executed well and we are making good progress towards the achievement of our key financial objectives by focusing on the following four key levers. Accelerating local case growth, improving gross margin, leveraging supply chain costs, and reducing administrative costs.","Specifically, we achieved the following during first half of the year. Total Broadline local cases grew 2.8%. We grew gross profit by $121 million, expanded gross margin by 36 basis points, and grew gross profit modestly faster than expenses. We grew adjusted operating income 4% or $38 million, and we grew adjusted earnings per share of 7.5%.","As we enter the second half of our fiscal year, we have strong momentum in the business. We do, however, need to continue to effectively manage the persistent deflationary headwinds that likely will challenge our performance going forward. Further, we are aggressively reviewing all aspects of our business for incremental cost savings opportunities to improve our financial performance.","At our Investor Day presentation last September, we laid out three key results that our three year strategic plan is targeting through 2018. Improve our customers' experience with Sysco, enhance associate engagement, and achieve our financial objectives of increasing operating income by at least $400 million, growing earnings per share faster than operating income, and achieving a 15% return on invested capital. I remain confident that we're well positioned to achieve those goals.","And now I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad to be joining the call this morning with all of you. In my new role, I'm excited to bring our business operations, commercial functions and supply chain organizations together to drive improved execution and a seamless approach to serving our customers. This approach will better position Sysco to provide exceptional service and support to our customers, and ultimately improve our returns to our shareholders.","I'd like to begin my remarks regarding the second quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our three-year plan and how they have already begun to have an impact on our business results.","As we have mentioned before, our insights-based approach to understanding and meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts. Our improved processes and tools in this area are allowing us to leverage our very robust base of information to design a variety of initiatives to improve the retention and penetration of our current customers as well as to accelerate the addition of new customers.","And while we have much work still to do, we are beginning to see positive results. For example, during the second quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.9%, including local case growth of 3%, gross profit dollar growth of 5.5%, including an improvement margin of 57 basis points, and operating income growth of about 9%, supported by solid operating expense performance.","From a geographic perspective, we saw solid year-over-year improvement in both cases and gross margin across the U.S., with specific strength in the Mideast. Southeast, and the Pacific markets. This was somewhat offset by signs of growth slowing in our traditionally-strong Southwest market due to the impact of the downturn in the energy sector.","One example of how we're driving increased case growth is in the area of fresh and local products where we're helping to educate our customers that we have significant capability through our Broadline operations and our specialty companies to bring fresh and local produce to the market. As an example of how we differentiate ourselves in this segment, in order to grow cases, our Sysco quality assurance team has partnered with the Produce Marketing Association to deliver good agricultural practices workshops to more than 800 small farmers since 2011, helping prepare our small local growers to meet our food safety standards.","As you know, improving gross margin is one of the key drivers of Sysco achieving our three-year targets. And our strong performance this quarter indicates we are making progress towards achieving our long-term objectives.","To that point, I am pleased with how well we've managed the current deflationary environment, which has certainly slowed sales dollar growth. Our ability to manage this environment well is due in part to an increased focus on Sysco brand and our category management efforts where we are able to use our purchasing scale along with the more transparent process with our supplier partners to achieve our goals. We continue to see a variety of benefits for our customers, suppliers and Sysco as category management has become a standard part of how we now operate our business.","There are other areas that we know are improving our overall customers' experience of doing business with Sysco as well including the way we are improving the service and the support they are experiencing through our technology solutions.","Our mobile order entry platform, which has been in pilot with customers for the past few quarters has shown strong adoption rates with both customers and our marketing associates. Now that the pilots have been completed, we are in the process of fully deploying this ordering solution across the enterprise. Additionally, we soon expect to begin pilots for the next phase of our digital eCommerce platform, which will bring additional capability, tools, and information critical to our customers to help them better run their business.","Finally, from a supply chain perspective, we have made solid progress toward our goal to improve overall service to our customers while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process.","As mentioned earlier, while there's still a lot more work to be done, we're seeing improved operating expense trends and we're targeting a continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year. These are just a few of the key priorities that are starting to impact our operational and financial results. And while we have much work to do, I'm confident we are on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives.","In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well in the field, and our headquarters teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field ready tools and processes that are enabling our success.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter especially in light of the increased deflation and continued currency headwinds. We also continued to make some solid and early progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our three-year goals.","We grew sales in the second quarter by approximately 1% year-over-year despite going from inflation of 6% in the second quarter of last year to deflation of 1% this year, including deflation of nearly 2% in U.S. Broadline.","We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories as supply recovers from various events in 2015. However, as Tom mentioned, we are managing this environment well, including improved processes and programs such as category management that have helped to lessen the impact of deflation.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.7% with the U.S. dollar's strength against the Canadian dollar responsible for the vast majority of the impact. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 2.2%.","Turning to case growth, consistent with our three-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total Broadline case growth for the second quarter was 3.4%, and local was 2.9%. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total Broadline.","Looking at gross profit and gross margins, we grew our gross profit at a solid 3.4% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 50 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business, and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%.","Adjusted operating expenses grew 1.8% during the quarter and by 3.5% on a constant currency basis. The increase is mainly driven by the previously-mentioned higher case volumes and planned investments in business technology. This increase in expense was partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spend, reduced fuel costs, and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our cost per case in U.S. Broadline, which was down $0.01 from the prior year.","Also note, while we experienced a relatively minor amount of certain items related to restructuring during the second quarter, we do expect to experience additional restructuring charges related to our three-year plan over the next few quarters.","As you know, a key part of our plan is to effectively manage the gap between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth. We achieved that objective during the second quarter, and as a result, grew adjusted operating income by 10.2% compared to the prior year and 11.6% on a constant currency basis.","As it relates to taxes, in mid-January at an investor conference, we disclosed a $21 million benefit to income tax expense as a result of the favorable resolution of some international tax contingencies. This had the same impact on both our GAAP and adjusted tax rates, reducing both to around 31%. As a result, and as mentioned during that webcast, we reported a $0.03 benefit to earnings per share during the second quarter.","Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 12.6% and adjusted earnings per share grew 17.1%, and 19.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher operating income and reduced tax rate. The previously-mentioned tax benefit increased earnings per share by $0.03.","The share count decrease of 24.5 million shares related to the accelerated share repurchase program positively impacted earnings per share in the second quarter by approximately $0.02 versus the prior year. At the beginning of the second quarter, we executed the accelerated share repurchase program and therefore received the benefit from that repurchase for the entire quarter. Also note that we resumed our ongoing practice of buying back shares to offset dilution during the last few weeks of December.","Cash flow from operations was $469 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2016, up roughly 4% from last year. Working capital was a use of cash during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2016, as it was during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2015. The first half of the fiscal year typically requires a seasonal net investment in working capital that is then reduced during the second half of the fiscal year.","Year-over-year, the comparison is favorable as we invested $143 million less cash in working capital during first half of fiscal 2016 than we did in the first half of fiscal 2015. Net CapEx for the first 26 weeks was $237 million and free cash flow was $231 million.","Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $264 million in fiscal 2016 and $102 million in fiscal 2015. Certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with U.S. Foods and from 2015 include items related to the proposed merger itself. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew by $179 million and free cash flow grew $237 million.","Now, I'd like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2016 plan. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least the remainder of the fiscal year. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparisons this year more challenging. Fourth, we now expect CapEx to be near the lower end of the previously-stated $550 million to $600 million range. Finally, we expect a normalized tax rate of 36% to 37% over the remaining 26 weeks.","In summary, we had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from the improved underlying business performance. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve our fiscal 2016 financial objectives and our three-year plan, including effectively managing deflation over the near term and increasing our focus on expenses.","We continue to aggressively review every part of the company, looking for ways to reduce costs. Additionally, we have put in place some more rigorous process for managing expenses, including how we prioritize spending and focus investment on areas or projects that improve our ability to serve the customer better.","And finally, we took advantage of continued lower fuel prices to increase the amount of fuel we locked in over the next 12 months. I feel good about our ability to achieve the first year target of our three-year plan, and we are working hard to be as aggressive as possible in identifying incremental opportunities to exceed our Investor Day targets.","Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster.","Your first question comes from the line of Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. So, question on local cases. With local cases up about 3% in the quarter, I'm hoping you can provide some color here in terms of new customer growth versus higher share of wallet for existing customers? And over time, do you think you can grow local cases in excess of the market rate?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Zack, it's Bill. I'll start and let Tom kind of give you some color from his perspective. We've historically been able to take share year-in and year-out and we do that both on the local side of the business as well as the corporate side of the business. So, yeah, I would expect that we would continue to take share.","Obviously, what Joel referred to in his comments is we're trying to do that in a more disciplined way as we go forward here, so that we give more of a flow through to the bottom line. The way I would look at the local case growth is I talked about the lever of accelerated local case growth. The context there is we've had, I think, seven quarters in a row of local case growth, and the last few have been right around 2% or more. So that lever is relative to where we were in the last two years or three years or four years as we were going through a lot of our change and some pretty tough macro economics.","So that 2% to 3% range, I think, is what we're targeting. I think there's going to be some quarters where we're at the lower end of that range and there will be some we're at the higher end of the range. I think 2% to 3% is very solid growth if you look at what the forecasts are for the industry. But I'll let Tom speak to generally where it's coming from.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, thank you, Bill. I would just add we are seeing strong trends in restaurant traffic and restaurant sales, so that's certainly helping. But we're really focused on promotional activity that actually drives new business.","And also, if you think about some of the tools that we shared at the Investor Day around how we improve our penetration, we are seeing improved penetration with our local customers, driven primarily by some of those initiatives, whether it's some of the local products I've been talking about, some of the innovation we've launched, or even some of the additional services we're providing those local customers.","So we see good performance coming out of them from a variety of areas and believe we'll continue to see that kind of growth.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And just, you had discussed a more rigorous process towards expense management. Joel, I'm hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on this in terms of potential focus areas and whether this would be above and beyond what you laid out at Investor Day.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So couple of comments on that. Number one, the way I think about those types of costs, and I think we've talked about this at other places, we think about it from the standpoint of processes, from people, from technologies, from the types of investments that we put into our company, again, in terms of how we think about prioritizing items. So in other words, one of the key things I called out in here is the ability to really prioritize and then focus on those spends that are going to drive the, again, ultimately what's better for our customers.","And so I think the \u2013 some of those things that we put in place, for example, are different committees to review and focus on technology spend, for example, and the ways to have, again, a very tight process for making sure that we're focusing on those projects that drive, again, the best results primarily and focused on the customer. So, I would say, I mean, again, there's a lot of rigor around that.","And in terms of your \u2013 second part of your question, again, all I can really say to that I think is that we certainly will continue to focus on driving that, certainly with the deflation we're experiencing and the fact that our gross profit dollars are harder to come by. That increased focus on expenses is important. And so, again, as I mentioned I think in my script, that's certainly an area we're going to continue to focus on and certainly look to drive incremental improvements over and above our targets.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think, if I could just add there, Zack, to Joel's comments maybe a little more of a historical perspective. I mean this company has always managed expenses very well, both operationally and corporate. Now, over the last three years, four years, five years, we've invested a lot, in particular on the corporate side, technology, processes as Joel mentioned, commercial activities beginning to end supply chains, so a lot of those investments have been made over the last several years to create this path to transformation that we feel the company needs to go through in which we're pretty far down the road on.","What you're seeing today and what you've seen in the last few quarters is we're beginning to get the benefits of a lot of those investments. So I would expect that the trajectory of that expense, as it's already happened, will flatten out. To Joel's point, we'll continue to get better and better at sequencing and prioritizing spend relative to customer needs and relative to what we need to deliver for our shareholders.","I'd say, the one last opportunity we have, particularly in the field, is to be just more consistent in our execution. And we still see plenty of opportunity there. So, again, historically, we've done a good job, but what we're really telling you here is we think there's opportunity, both operationally as well as on the corporate side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just a follow-up on, I think there was a comment on deflation making gross profit dollars a little bit harder to come by, but it was also a gross margin benefit from a rate standpoint. Can you just elaborate on how deflation impacted the P&L as the quarter progressed? And if it's going to continue, do you anticipate any change in the way it impacts the business?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, deflation impacts the P&L. I don't know that there was a big sequential impact, a lot of variable around the sequential impact as the quarter progressed. What we're saying is we saw a pickup from the first quarter to the second quarter, we're seeing some similar trends here in January. And we kind of felt mathematically that would begin the wrap. We began to see this, if you recall, back in March and then the fourth quarter of last year when the inflation fell off. So we thought just from a wrapping perspective that we would see a little more \u2013 little less deflation as we got into the second half of the fiscal year. And I would say what we're telling you today is it's still there and we probably will expect to see it at least through the end of the quarter.","It affects you in different ways, obviously. On the positive side, generally when our costs go down, we are able to pass that along to our customers. And that's good for them, especially as they are dealing with some of their labor challenges. Your percentages look better, so certainly it contributed to the gross margin expansion.","But the reality is, it's not a great environment because you end up with fewer dollars to pay your expenses with. So to Joel's other point, when you have this level of deflation, it just reinforces the importance of managing our expenses very tightly.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And as an unrelated follow-up, I know there were some comments about eCommerce. Can you remind us where the current perpetration is as it relates to sales and how you think about that as a driver of the business going forward?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So regarding the eCommerce work we have been doing, we've been very focused on our mobility solution. So think about it as an online ordering tool where our customers can use iPad or type device or their phone to order. We've been piloting this across the last couple of quarters. We now are in most of our operating companies with at least some of the customers in some of our districts and so we're going to be expanding it now to the rest of the country and more of a full deployment.","We continue to see improved usage of the tool, but I'd say today we're still in the low, probably 9%, 8%, 9% of the orders going through that process. But we're seeing basically double digit improvement each quarter as we roll this. So the feedback has been very positive, both from our own associates who also use the tool, and from our customers. So we believe we are well on our way to significant increases in adoption and ultimately, a lot more of the orders being placed using that tool.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Hi, good morning and good quarter. Back to the gross profits. So, just sequentially, they grew better even as sales got worse because of accelerated deflation. So I've heard the explanations around mix and so forth, but at least from my view, it looks like the deflation is at least kind of benign. I mean I know it becomes a headwind. But is there some element to sticky pricing where when inflation was increasing the last three years, it's tougher distributors to pass that through all at once. And is there some element where to some degree it doesn't have to come down quite as fast or do you think everybody is just chasing the business and passing it through right away?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Andy, and thank you. You covered a lot there. Look, I think \u2013 as I said, I believe the deflation, as you look at gross margin, i.e., the percent to sales is clearly helping. However, as we've said very consistently over the years, it's not an ideal environment to be in. If you look at this business historically, our customers generally are able to pass along a couple of points of inflation to their consumers year-in and year-out, and they generally do.","So to one of your points, what you're seeing here a little bit is some of the recovery, what we gave up. When we were dealing with 5 points to 6 points of inflation, you can only pass along so much of that so quickly and it's only appropriate to pass along so much of that so quickly. So when you have some deflationary trends, mathematically, it helps you a little bit. Perhaps there's situations where you can bring your prices down a little slower, but ultimately, it's an incredibly competitive environment. So we're out there competing for that business every day and we want to do right by our customers. So I wouldn't put a lot of weight on that.","I just think we're doing a very good job managing it. I've seen different cycles of deflation here over the last \u2013 you don't know how many years, but a lot of years \u2013 and this is by far and away the best we've ever managed it. And I think it goes back to what Tom covered, and I'll let him speak again. We are actively \u2013 we've been working on several commercial initiatives here for the last two years, three years, four years, whether it's segmentation, back to basics, revenue management, category management. These are all things that are allowing us to be more laser like in terms of how we work with our customers and bring more consistency to our pricing. There's more to do there, so I would just say I think we're actually managing it quite well.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Bill, the only thing I would add is we've talked about the impact of the category management efforts we've been embarking on over the last few years. That continues to be a significant driver for us. And we've also shared with you all the importance of our Sysco brand growth and we are very focused on that Sysco brand because we know that not only is it a great quality product for our customers, but obviously, there are margin benefits for Sysco as well. And so I think really that's just one additional thing I'd add, if it helps.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I wouldn't underestimate this mix. We don't have to grow the local faster than the corporate. I mean, I think corporate still grew a little bit faster than local this quarter, but we bring more value to the street customers. We're able to leverage our Sysco brand offerings in a broader way with our local case growth. And so if you go back to Investor Day and some of our commentary there, that first lever of accelerating local case growth and if we can keep it in that 2% to 3% range, that's a very powerful lever for the throughput or the flow through, if you will, to the bottom line of the company.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you. Can I just follow up briefly on the category management that seems to be driving profits nicely? I think earlier on it was really focused for you guys on your vendors and some of the things you were doing there to bring down cost. It sounds like it's more focused now on getting it into the sales side of the business and bringing it to the restaurants. Am I hearing that right as well?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, I'd say, yes. The initial wave you go through and you are obviously doing all the hard work and heavy lifting around the categories, selecting the right products and the right partners to do business with. Now that we're deeply into that and we've been through all the categories, the majority of them, now we're very much focused on optimizing what we have. So, you've heard us talk about innovative products.","We've had some innovation that has been out over the last couple of quarters now that are starting to drive some incremental benefits for our customers and obviously for us. You are also starting to do much longer range planning with a lot of these supplier partners. So it's become more of the way we operate. And I guess based on that or because of that, we're seeing the kind of consistent year-over-year benefits. While maybe not as great as they were in the early days as we started at, we're still seeing consistent benefits from that work.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Ed.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, Bill, can I just start with maybe a big picture question? So last quarter, you sort of walked us through how the underlying business was better than the bottom line results, so to show it, right? And that was, I think, more around like corporate costs and stuff. And now this quarter you've got, it's like your strongest EBIT growth quarter in sort of recent memory. Despite deflation, you've got case growth and better profit per case and lower expense per case that are all lining up. Do you feel that you've kind of reached that inflection point that you were hinting at last quarter? I guess what's the big picture takeaway from this quarter, if there is one at this point.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ed, I think it's a little bit like golf. We got a little bit more out of it this quarter than we did in the first quarter. I think when I talked about that first quarter, that's when we really talked more about the U.S. Broadline than we have in the past. I wanted you and the other investors to understand the quality of the underlying quarter.","I think part of what we're seeing, we've done some work on this, is the trajectory of the corporate spend coming out of last year, coming out of the proposed merger that ultimately was terminated, we still had some \u2013 and we still do \u2013 we still had some trajectory of our spend here at corporate, in particular on the technology side, in particular on some of the areas that Tom's speaking to with the digital and mobile platforms. So those comparisons were not quite as tough in the second quarter as they were in the first quarter. So our corporate expense increase is a little bit less acute.","We got a little more margin improvement, as you can see on the gross margin side, even though we did see more deflation. And perhaps that helped us a little bit in the short term, but we also managed, I think, a little bit better. And you saw better cost management, I think, operationally as well. We're right around that flat cost per case right now. Fuel helped us a little bit there, but. So I just think everything got a little bit better and I just think this quarter is somewhat more reflective of really the quality of the earnings that we've seen.","Now, look at it, what I would encourage you to do is look at the first half I spoke to. And what I see there is I see 4% operating income with improving trends. And that's kind of how we're looking at it. So we think we're in a good place for the first year piece of our three-year goal. Joel can speak to that, but I think we talked about hitting 20% to 30% of our goal here in the first year.","And we've got more work to do to hit or exceed the rest of that goal, both as it relates to continuing to address the deflation, in particular, grow those cases locally the way we are and have been. But we've got some more work to do on the expense side as well, and you've heard us allude to that here. So I wouldn't quite call it an inflection point, but I would call it a validation of what I talked about in the first quarter.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, and just couple of quick follow-ups. One, just on case growth, do you think weather sort of helped case growth out at all? And then a follow-up on deflation. The last period that we saw more meaningful deflation, profit per case was down. And it doesn't sound \u2013 like it sounds like this period, you think you can sort of manage through that without seeing it? And I just want to confirm that that's how you're thinking about things.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think weather played that large a role. It's always hard for us to talk about good weather. December was relatively mild, so it might have helped a little bit. I would tell you (38:04) as far as this quarter goes, we finally had winter. We had it in the Mid-Atlantic area here a couple of weeks ago. So that's hitting us a little bit our last week of January\/first week of February. But so far nothing crazy on the weather side this quarter either.","I just think I'll let the other guys chime in here. I think on the gross profit, look, deflation's a very challenging environment to manage in terms of growing your gross profit dollars. And I just think we're doing a better job there for the reasons that Tom's taken you through. But the reality is we grew 3.4%, which is not 4%.","To Joel's point, it was better than that when you adjust for currency. So I just think a lot of these commercial initiatives that we've been talking about for the last two years, three years, four years, they're in different stages of development and maturation, and you're beginning to see the benefits of them. But it is definitely a challenging environment, and that's why we're just being a little bit cautious in our wording as it relates to the second half of the year.","Joel, you want to add anything?","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think the only thing I would just add to that in terms of the way we think about that is, again, Bill said it. The headwind is there, but the combination of solid volume growth and some of the margin expansion that's caused it coming from some of the initiatives that Tom's talked about, again, the category management, the brand \u2013 the brand within our local case growth. So in other words, we're growing our local cases and our brand within that is growing. And so that's all positive. And so, I think at the end of the day, again, certainly obviously we say we'd certainly love to take a little bit of inflation to pass even more of that through, but I think those are kind of the key levers that we think about as we combat inflation. I think we've done a pretty good job of it.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and we've talked a lot about local, and we need to, because, I mean, that really is what's driving a lot of this along with the initiatives. But we also grew the corporate businesses this quarter as well, and we grew it in a profitable manner. So we actually feel good about the overall quality of the case growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Your line is open. Meredith Adler, your line is open.","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO capital. Your line is open.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Lots of questions on gross margin. But I was just curious, the factors that you called out, category management, local case growth, your private brand, deflation, is that order of magnitude the right way to think about it? I mean, do you kind of go item by item of those four factors and say here's kind of what the impact was? And just wondering if you're willing to share any more detail with us on those.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Kelly, just to be clear. Is that the way we think about what?","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","The impact of those factors on gross margin. Category management, the local case growth, the private label penetration, and the deflation.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, again, just for no other reason than to make me feel good, I think about gross margin, but I also think even more about gross profit dollars. So we're trying to address both here.","You pay your bills with the dollars. I think on your point on the margin, certainly deflation of this magnitude is meaningful. It's impossible to quantify what that is, but we would be less than genuine if we didn't say that was contributing to some of the margin improvement. But I would quickly go to the other things we talked about here today, which is the importance of local case growth.","Again, it doesn't have to be faster than the corporate. It just needs to be significant. The importance of growing the brand, and that's easier to do when you're growing your local cases. And the maturation of the category management work that we're doing, along with some of the work that Tom is continuing to develop here on revenue management.","But I'll \u2013 you could talk to ten people or 100 people in Sysco and probably get a little bit different answer on that question. so I'll let Tom and Joel jump in here.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, again, I think the question was really more around is the prioritization of that the way we look at it. I think we look at all of them coming together. At the end of the day, this local customer, if we are meeting or exceeding their needs, we're going to get the kind of growth that's required there. And we're focused on a lot of initiatives that, in fact, help them be successful.","And I know we said that a few times, but I think what is important for you to take away is that the more they're successful, and therefore the more we're successful with them, that is a big lever on our business, because of the \u2013 what we bring to them and the percentage of their business that is, in fact, Sysco brand, and the way that we partner with them. So I think I would say they all come together, and that's what makes the impact that you're seeing. I don't know that it's one necessarily higher than the other. It's really more about making them work together.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think the other point that Joel's made, and I'll let him make it again, is just obvious point: we've had some challenges here in the last few years, but to keep the right spread, if you will, between the gross profit growth and the expense growth.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think that's the other point I would continue to emphasize. As inflation goes up and down, as our gross profit dollars are driven by the things we've talked about, again to Bill \u2013 the point that Bill just made, one of the really strong focuses we have is to drive the gap between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth, which again, certainly this quarter we did a good job of, because, yeah, whether we have more inflation or less inflation one way or the other, that spread is really important to us, which is why we're going to continue to keep driving certainly on the gross profit dollar growth, but focus on the expenses as well.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, that's very helpful. And then, I guess, in terms of expense growth, what was the impact of technology spend this quarter on your expenses.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think that we historically have really gotten that detail, Kelly. What I would tell you is we still have some expense growth here at the corporate side. It's planned. And virtually all of it's on the technology side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi there. I don't know if this is something that you'd be prepared to answer, but it would help, just because if and when we do return to an inflationary environment, it's just something to keep in mind in terms of puts and takes on a gross margin. So I guess the question is what percent of your sales are priced at cost plus a percentage markup versus a cost plus fixed penny per case? Because obviously, I mean, in fixed penny per case customer, you're going to be benefiting in a deflationary environment from a gross margin perspective.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Karen, good morning. I would just say that you can presume that when we talk about our corporate customers, those large customers, those are all on some type of a cost contract. Some are markups, some are margin, some lines are done dollar per piece, whatever, dollar per pound. And on the local side, a lot of that is priced by the MA (45:36). Some of it is contractual, but we have and we don't plan on getting into a lot of detail on how we price customers.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then I guess just switching gears, two questions. I guess the first is what do you kind of cut back on in terms of CapEx this year in terms of your coming in at the low end of the range? And then the second question I had is just obviously your stock is reacting to your strong results this morning. I'm just curious how you think about the remaining buyback in light of the fact that, obviously, stock was at a better entry point during the quarter than it is now?","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I'll take first one and then I'll maybe clarify your question on the second one. The first part of the CapEx, I don't know that I'd really think about it as something we're cutting back on. I think the way I would just say it is we target our CapEx spend. It's not based on some fixed number that we need to achieve or not achieve, but it's really truly driven by the needs of the business.","And so I think the way I would just think about that is that as we've kind of talked about before, we have a pretty rigorous process in terms of identifying and prioritizing our capital spending needs. And I would just say it to you this way that the way we look at the required spend this year for what our business is needing just happens to fall near the lower end of that range. So again, I don't necessarily look at our target as something that we have to achieve our some number we have to get to. It's just based on the needs of our business and we have the ability to flex as it relates to that.","And then the second \u2013 Bill, do you want to add anything?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me take a shot at the second one. If I don't hit it, Karen, clarify it for us. First of all, it's nice to have a quarter beat. So, it's nice to see the stock reacting. Our experience is it'll take two days or three days for things to kind of level out in terms of how investors see the quarter. We've announced our intention to \u2013 we have done the $1.5 billion that needs to be sold, as Joel said. And today it would still be our intention to do the remainder of the program next year. So if things were to change, we will let you know, but right now, that's still our intention.","I would just reiterate, though, going back to the first part of your question, we're always looking to invest in our business. And we'll continue to do that in a way that supports the disciplined growth that we talked about. Modestly growing the dividend continues to be very important and we continue to look for good solid strategic acquisitions. So we're looking at all four of those opportunities, but I'm sitting here today two hours into this thing, I think we haven't changed any plans.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. I wonder if you can give us an update on how things are going at SYGMA on improving profitability there? And also, just a little more detail on what you're talking about there for the fourth quarter comparisons, why fourth quarter is going to be a difficult comparison for you?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll speak briefly and certainly let Tom give you a little more color. SYGMA, as we've said, is in somewhat of a turnaround mode and we are continuing to see some better trends there as it relates to the customer mix and the expense management and that kind of thing. I would tell you, there's still plenty of work to go there. But we're encouraged with the beginning some of trends that we're seeing, but we're not there yet.","I'll let Tom take the rest of SYGMA and then I'll let Joel talk to you about the fourth quarter","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","The only thing I'd add on SYGMA is we're very focused on specific customers and profitability, as well as improving our operational excellence in that business. And so, the combination of those two things is how we're going to improve and get this thing back on track.","We've had, certainly over the last year, some challenges regarding drivers and driver retention, which is something that we've come out of and we're in a much better place now than we probably six months ago. But it's really those two areas. Making sure we've got the right customer mix and also that we're operating at the highest levels.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure, Mark, it's Joel. The question on the fourth quarter. I think the comment there really relates to the fact that last year in the fourth quarter our adjusted operating income grew nearly 6% and certainly we picked up nearly $30 million of operating income from the prior year. And so I think the comment was really focused around the \u2013 again, I often talk about growth on top of growth, and certainly as I mentioned in my part of the script, I said we're certainly feel very good about how we're looking towards achieving our fiscal 2016 planned objectives. But, again, it's really more of a call out of the fact that the fourth quarter last year, we had quite a strong performance, and that's where the comparatives are up against what we're referring to.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Meredith Adler with Barclays. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, this is Sean (50:50) on for Meredith. How's it going, guys?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good.","Unknown Speaker","I have a question on lower commodity costs. And to what extent that's maybe resulting in restaurants, maybe investing some of that into being more promotional versus them using it to offset high labor expense? I think that's been somewhat of a driver of case growth to some extent.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That would be hard for us to assess and probably not even appropriate. I think Tom sees more customers than I do, but I see a few, and I think this labor cost thing is at the top of mind for them right now. I know it's been the subject of some recent industry meetings. And I think that's where it's helping them. But, Tom, do you have anything to add to that?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","No, not really. I can't say there's a big theme around more promotional activity that I'm seeing. They have lots of concerns out there right now, not the least of which is the labor environment.","Unknown Speaker","Sure. Makes sense. Another question I have too is just on the driver or maybe the drivers of non-Broadline inflation, just because it seems like there was deflation at Broadline at about negative 1.9%, which is approximately 80% of business. So I'm just wondering what's kind of driving the inflation for the remainder of the business?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think what you're saying really is the deflation at the U.S. Broadline's driving the deflation. And some of our other businesses, to Karen's question on cost, SYGMA has more of the cost per piece, that type of fee, type of pricing, so that's not going to be impacted as much. Some of our other guest supply, different type of product line altogether, so Canada not as much. So I think all we're saying is the U.S. Broadline is 80% of our revenue stream, and that's where the bulk of the deflation is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, great. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to circle back a second on deflation. Bill, you said earlier, I know that something to the effect of deflation, of course, remaining a headwind. You initially thought it might subside kind of in the back half of the year, but still kind of there. So just to clarify, are you guys thinking for the next quarter or two, that kind of very similar levels to what you are seeing today, which I guess is similar to the quarter that was just reported? Or do you think that it could get a bit more of a headwind before then moderating?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Vinnie, I wish I knew. I think all we're signaling is we think it's going to be with us at least a quarter or two longer, at least. And it was almost two points in the U.S. Broadline this past quarter. I don't know that it's going to get a whole lot worse than that. We'll just have to see. But I think the real message, and let me be as clear as I can be, is that I think probably if I'd been talking to you, and I was six months ago, I would have thought by the fourth quarter we would've been back more to neutral, and that's really not our assessment right now. But I'm not necessarily saying it's going to get worse. I'm just saying that it's probably not going to get a whole lot better for another quarter or two.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. That's fair enough. And maybe just one quick follow-up. You mentioned about the private brands a couple of times, also some of the newer fresh mix. Just kind of any updates either qualitatively or hopefully quantitatively the current percent of the mix where you may see that going, maybe some new categories that are coming on board?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think as long as we continue to grow the local cases, and continue to, even as we go through the second round now with CatMan with a lot of our suppliers and we work more and more on innovation, that type of thing, that gives us an opportunity to partner with our suppliers with both certainly their brand, but also ours. So, it's hard to move a number, but you'll see in the attachments from the earnings release that we had a nice move this quarter. So I don't \u2013 I'm not going to try to predict how much more it could go up, but there's a high correlation between local case growth and brand movement. And Tom can give you some color on that as well.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, the specific numbers, that I think were communicated, and for U.S. Broadline, this is total U.S. Broadline, it was about 36.5% of the mix. And for the local business, it was 43.5%. And the local, it was up about 43 basis points. So we continue to see growth there. We believe it is a differentiator for us, and it's something that our customers also see value in, both price value, but I think also from a quality perspective.","I think the other thing that Bill just mentioned, we're doing more innovative work. And as we do work with our supplier partners on Sysco brand innovation, that's going to help continue to contribute to these numbers. And I think I mentioned in the first couple of quarters, we had 16 items that we launched, basically, innovative items in the marketplace, and these are all generally Sysco brand items. Not all of them, but a lot of them are. And that'll continue to be a focus for us going forward.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And I would just add that, I mean, this falls into the category of the disciplined, driving disciplined growth and profitable case growth, and certainly across both on the local side and again our multi-unit side. So, again, that disciplined approach on growing profitable cases certainly encapsulates everything that we've discussed here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about the ongoing benefit from fuel in terms of the net benefit. If you can comment on the actual earnings impact in Q2 year-to-date and also your outlook for fuel, maybe in the back half of the year after you've netted out the hedges that you've got in place and along with the impact of lower spot prices. So any kind of quantification would be appreciated. Thanks.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, I think from a quantity perspective, I mean, we look at that as a couple of pennies per case on the fuel side in terms of the impact on what that is. Obviously, as I talked about in my area, certainly we're taking advantage of the fuel prices where they are today, and buying. We typically have executed forward buys and we continue to do that.","And in fact, we continue to increase the percentage of our fuel consumption that has really brought a head on. And so that's certainly something, again, that we see. And I \u2013 we're not in this thing in terms of kind of speculating on fuel prices. It's something we certainly take advantage of where we have an opportunity both from a cost certainty perspective and then what we feel is just a good solid fuel prices. So, again, as I mentioned in my script, we're certainly \u2013 a fairly sizable portion of the fuel we've bought forward for over the next year. And so certainly we anticipate some continued benefit there.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. But on a year-to-date basis, how would you say the pennies per case improved and how does that translate into earnings?","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, again, it's pretty consistent. Again, as I pointed out, we think of it as about a couple pennies per case, that's impacted overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. So wanted to touch on private brand and gross. When you think about the ability to use the private brand portfolio to drive share. And I know there's a lot of things that you're offering to your customers, but just maybe isolate that one. How effective can that be at bringing on new customers? And I guess part of that is the inertia that they might have to the brands that they're using today. And do you think you're using those brands as effectively as you could? Are there things that can be done maybe a little bit differently to drive \u2013 to use those brands to drive some increased share gains? Any thoughts, particularly from Tom on that?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer","So I would maybe reiterate a few comments I made and maybe add a few points. So the Sysco brand, if you think about the Sysco brand, it's a value for a couple of reasons. One, generally, the cost to our customers is a little less than some of the national brands. So there's a natural benefit for them. But more importantly, we're very focused on the quality of these items. And I had mentioned innovation. So we're always looking to ensure that the Sysco brand items are, in fact, not only value added, meaning they bring increased value to the customer, but that they're also driving kind of the base business components that these customers need.","So I'd say, we're getting everything we can. I think we feel pretty good about where we're at today. We feel like certainly we're not out of runway. But I think the more we can continue to focus on quality products, bringing innovation to those items, and making sure that we keep them in front of our customers. And we use \u2013 I think we talked about it at the Investor Day, the business review process that we use. It's a great way for us to actually do cuttings of our products, allowing them to see Sysco brand and compare that to something else they might be using. And it's how we spend a lot of that time is to help those customers see the value that's there and the opportunity that they have to improve their overall profitability by using the brand.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. And then maybe for Bill, if you think about some bigger secular trends, right? So local, private brand, CatMan. I mean you would think, and I know this isn't fully built in your plan, but you would think that there may be a good chance here for secular gross margin rate to be up pretty consistently. Obviously, if the top line is healthy, GP dollars could grow at a nice rate, maybe even higher than what you've targeted over the last three. How do you think about that?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm all for it, but it's a little early to make that call, I think, John. So I think your thinking always is logical. We're six months into this three-year plan. I would just reiterate some things we talked about in September.","The overall industry, I would say, the overall environment and the outlook for our customers is better today than it was two years or three years ago. Now, it goes up and down by quarter. You can actually see in some of the stuff when the stock market goes down, some of the NRA numbers fall off the next month or next quarter, so. But I think if you look at it secularly and go back two years or three years, we're in a better place. So that's a positive. It's still incredibly an acutely competitive world out there, so we need to be very responsive to that.","And I would just echo what I've been trying to articulate here over the last two years or three years, but in particular the last several months post the merger termination, we're extremely well positioned today because of all the work that we've done over the last two years, three years, four years on the commercial side to compete effectively, do the right thing by our customers, but also grow in a disciplined way, as Joel talks about and manage our margins. So, if you look at those four levers, we're talking about improving how we manage it. Ideally, we'll at least hold margin over the next two years or three years. Right now we're up. Hopefully, we will grow it, but I certainly feel we're much better positioned to manage it well than where we were two years, three years, four years ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you. At this point, just a quick one for me. A follow-up on the fuel question. I think you kind of have a cost of fuel that's both embedded in your cost of sales and your operating expenses. So correct me if I'm wrong about that. But my question was, your suppliers that deliver food to you, how much fuel savings maybe was embedded over the past couple of quarters and what you anticipate over the next couple of quarters just that their delivery costs are less to you and therefore your price of product could be lower and that could actually be helping your cost of goods told, if you thought about it in that way.","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, it's a good question, John. What we're speaking to is really our outbound cost of fuel. It's a little harder and we really don't get into that level of detail in terms of our components of our cost of goods. But let me say it this way, lower fuel is good. Okay? It's generally good for multiple reasons.","One, on the margin generally people get some more discretionary income and they'll spend it, historically spend it more going out to eat. Now, I will say this, we really haven't seen a lot of that until perhaps lately and we don't have a lot of hard data on that. So the most powerful thing on the fuel is to the extent it translates to greater discretionary income and the consumer uses it to go out to eat, that's a good thing for us. I haven't seen quite as much of that, but we're hopeful that we'll see more.","But, no, you are absolutely right, it helps us on the cost of goods, and to Joel's point, it helps us on the outbound. We kind of weight average the outbound. So it's definitely a modest tailwind and we're taking advantage of it and hopefully it'll stay that way.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian. Your line is open.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Yeah, just a quick one. You mentioned that the competitive environment \u2013 or the environment is very competitive. And I'm just wondering has that changed any over the last few months? Is it pretty similar? Because obviously you picked up some share, so I'm just wondering if you've noticed any change there or who you think you're taking market share from? Is it broad-based or maybe there's a regional or more national players that you're taking that share from?","William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","What we've been able to grow is, as I said historically, take share for many years. And certainly we've got the local case growth moving again here the last several quarters. We don't have the data for 2015. My sense is we probably have taken some share. I think a lot of the larger multi-regionals are doing well.","And so if I were to conjecture, which is always a dangerous thing on calls like this, my sense is that some of the better operative larger folks are taking share, and it may be coming from some of the smaller players. But the bottom line, I think, in this business is good operators are going to take share. Large, small, good restaurant operators are going to continue to grow and do well, whether they're independent or corporate owned.","And so I think our overall point of view would be the competitive environment remains very acute. It remains very similar to what we've seen the last two years or three years. And the best operators, both in terms of the customer base as well as on the distribution side are going to do the best.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Today you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ in a material manner.

Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today.","This morning Sysco reported second quarter sales of $11.2 billion, the net earnings of $211 million. Adjusted EPS excluding certain items was $0.40 for the quarter, which was flat compared to the prior year.","Market conditions continued to be challenging for many of our customers and competitive pressure remains acute. These conditions were amplified in December by a shortened holiday shopping season and severe weather in several areas of the country. The casual dining restaurant segment was especially impacted experiencing flat year-over-year sales during the quarter as high average check amounts could only offset the impact of declining traffic.","Notwithstanding the ongoing challenging market conditions, we grew our sales 4% over the prior year in the second quarter through both case volume growth and acquisitions. We continued to drive solid growth through our large national and regional customers, while our business for locally managed customers remained soft.","We are seeing reasonably strong growth with locally managed customers in our Southwest market, while underlying market conditions are particularly difficult in our Northeast and Mid-East markets. Operating income fell short of our expectations for the quarter.","Expense management was strong once again this quarter is evidenced by cost per case in our Broadline business being significantly lower than the prior year, but sluggish sales growth with our locally managed customers and ongoing gross margin pressure more than offset those gains.","We have implemented several short-term actions steps and longer term strategic initiatives to both accelerate our locally managed sales growth and mitigate the ongoing gross margin pressures that we have experienced in recent quarters. These actions are gaining traction within our company and we are targeting gradual improvement in these areas through the balance of calendar year 2014 and beyond. At the same time, we anticipate our expense management performance will remain solid as we make additional progress in our productivity improvements and operations over the next several months. While the year-over-year over benefits of our SG&A cost reduction initiatives begin to plateau.","In summary, calendar year 2013 was one of the most difficult years in recent history for our industry and we struggle to leverage our sales growth. While weather conditions have been quite severe thus far this quarter, we believe the market conditions will improve nicely in calendar year 2014 and then Sysco's operating performance results will show steady improvement as well.","Turning to our technology transformation, as we discussed last quarter, our teams have invested significant effort to prepare needed updates to the SAP software to improve both stability and scalability. Last October, we implement performance enhancement that meaningfully improve system capacity utilization as well as functional enhancements and improved order management and other processes. Encouraged by the success of these changes, we resumed our deployment rollout at our Boise, Idaho operating company back in November.","System performance in Boise was favorable upon Goliath and in a weak sense. And importantly, the recently implemented system enhancements have successfully addressed challenges that have previously impacted our large regional and national contract customers. This success provided us the confidence to convert two additional locations Phoenix and Las Vegas at the end of January. These deployments are an important test to both the stability of our SAP solution and our ability to successfully deploy multiple larger size OPCOs simultaneously. But, we are pleased with our progress over the last year, we are working hard to further optimize our SAP solution in the days ahead.","In February, additional updates are scheduled to be implemented that are intended to further improve system stability and scalability. These changes include simplification of the dynamic pricing and purchase order processes. While we continue to monitor progress in the eight facilities now live on the SAP platform as well as performance following the enhancement schedule to take place later this month.","Excuse me, let me say it again. While we continue to monitor progress in the eight facilities now live in the SAP platform as well as performance following the enhancement schedule to take place later this month depending upon success of these next important steps, we would expect to launch two additional facilities by the end of the fiscal year.","We also continue to move forward with our category management initiative. The majority of wave 1 categories have now been launched and we expect the wave 2 categories to launch during the second half of fiscal 2014.","We are applying learnings to the process as we move forward and have seen some improvement in execution and performance recently. We will continue to monitor performance in these categories and remain confident in both the benefits that category management provide our customers and the savings we will revise over the next few years.","We also have multiple initiatives underway targeted at lowering operating cost. While we have previously discussed extensively the SG&A cost reduction initiatives, we also have several efforts underway to reduce cost and improved productivity in our warehouse and delivery operations.","Broadening optimization initiatives are underway in several of our largest operating companies. We expect to implement in the coming weeks a new warehouse scorecard to drive enhanced performance and accountability and are developing a similar scorecard for delivery operations.","Our consolidated parts procurement program has been implemented across the entire United States. We have negotiated a universal contract to procure forklift equipment resulting in significant savings on this category equipment. And we also have undertaken an initiative to right-size our fleet. To-date we have identified 700 pieces of equipment to eliminate and expecting to complete a total elimination of 1500 pieces of equipment. This will reduce our maintenance cost, title on registration expenses, ongoing capital requirements and optimize our overall fleet age.","Turning briefly to an update on the proposed merger with the U.S. Foods, last month we announced several key decisions regarding the integration planning leadership structure. We have formed a steering committee, which I will chair and is comprised of a joint team, the senior executives for both Sysco and U.S. Foods. The role of the steering committee will be to oversee the integration planning work and approve key decisions.","Chris Kreidler has been appointed to lead the integration planning work. Because of his strong business and financial capabilities, Chris is well-suited to provide the leadership, valuable skills and perspective that will be required to successfully bring both companies together. In addition to his integration planning leadership responsibilities, Chris will continue in his current role as Chief Financial Officer.","The integration planning process will consist of four major tracks of order, Greg Bertrand, Senior Vice President of Foodservice Operations has been appointed to lead the sales, merchandising and operations integration planning tracks. And David Schreibman, U.S. Foods Executive Vice President of Strategy will lead the corporate functions integration planning track.","We are moving forward quickly along the path of planning for eventual integration and Chris will provide more details on our progress in a few moments.","In closing, these are both exciting and challenging times for Sysco. We are beginning to see many of our transformational changes take hold and we now look forward to the U.S. Foods merger as the next step in our transformation. Enhancing our ability to serve our customers, strength and supply our partnerships and further engage our employees.","Sysco is unique in its ability to make these types of significant investments which we believe will create a compelling opportunity over time for all stakeholders. We are focused on driving out this change in a manner that contributes to the success of our customers and suppliers and we appreciate the dedication of our Sysco employees.","Now, I will turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter as well as the merger and integration planning work.","Chris Kreidler","Thanks Bill, and good morning, everyone.","For the second quarter sales were $11.2 billion or an increase of 4.1% compared to the prior year mainly due to case volume growth about half of which came from acquisitions. Case volume increased 4.3% for the quarter and case volume excluding acquisitions increased 2.7%. Inflation increased sales 0.8% and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.6%.","Gross margin in the second quarter increased 0.7% and gross margin declined 60 basis points to 17.48%, due mainly to continued weakness in locally managed sales, the difficult business environment and competitive pressures. In addition, sales to large regional and national customers are growing faster than local business and this mix shift drove about one-quarter of the gross margin decline during the quarter.","Operating expenses increased $44 million or 2.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year period. Approximately $30 million of this year-over-year variance was driven by operating expense from acquired companies. In addition, certain items totaled $33 million during the quarter an increase of $12 million over the same quarter last year.","Certain items this quarter included a $24 million increase in the estimate for Sysco's self-insurance reserve of $4 million or $4 million in merger related costs and $5 million in other restructuring cost. If we exclude certain items and the impact of acquisitions, operating expenses were flat year-over-year.","Business transformation expenses were lower in the second quarter compared to last year by $18 million and are lowered by $29 million for the first half of the year. However, expenses in the second half of the fiscal year are expected to be similar to the prior year, as a result we continue to expect total business transformation expenses for the year to be inline with our guidance of $300 million to $350 million, albeit at the lower end of that range. Similar to last year, we continued to see business transformation benefits driving down our operating expenses, mainly in the areas of sales, IT and retirement related expenses. And we expect benefits from category management and operation initiatives to build as we move forward.","As a result of the benefits generated from our transformation initiatives cost per case performance in our Broadline operation was significantly better than last year's second quarter declining $0.11 compared to the prior year. For the first half of the year cost per case declined $0.10 compared to the prior year. As we discussed last quarter, we don't anticipate maintaining this rate of improvement as we lapped the point at which we began some of these initiatives last year but we remain confident in meeting or exceeding our objective of $0.05 decline for the full fiscal year.","In spite of the continued progress on our business transformation initiatives, continued weakness in the underlying business resulted in a decline in operating income of 8.1% year-over-year. Net earnings for the second quarter were $211 million, a decrease of $11 million or 4.8% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.36 a 5.3% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items which mainly related to an increase in estimated self insurance reserves diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.40 which was flat compared to the prior year.","As we have discussed on previous calls we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business which excludes certain items as well as business transformation expenses.","To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 3.4%, adjusted operating income decreased 7.6%, adjusted net earnings declined 4.4% and adjusted EPS declined 4.1% to $0.47.","One housekeeping item to mention, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 Sysco changed its classification of certain inter-company purchases related to our FreshPoint and meat companies from the previous classification used in fiscal 2013. This change impacted gross profit and operating expense that had no impact on operating income or net earnings. In our press release this morning you will find a table showing the impact of these reclassifications to prior year results for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012.","Turning to the impact of the business transformation project for a moment, in the second quarter project expenses totaled $63 million and we capitalized $10 million related to the project. We expect to maintain this level of capital spending in the third and fourth quarters due to ongoing work to enhance the stability and scalability of the system. As a result, we expect total capital spending related to business transformation to be $30 million to $40 million for fiscal year 2014, this is an update to our previous guidance.","Total capital expenditures were $135 million for the second quarter this year compared to $106 million last year. We continue to expect total capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million for the fiscal 2014 year. However, after including anticipated proceed from asset sales, net capital spending will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Free cash flow was $167 million for the quarter increasing substantially over the prior year period mainly due to improvements in working capital performance. For the first half of the year free cash flow increased 64% to $211 million.","Now I'd like to turn for a few minutes to a discussion of our proposed merger with U.S. Foods. In December, we announced our plan to merge with U.S. Foods in a cash and stock deal valued at $8.2 billion. This is an extremely important and exciting combination that we anticipate will generate at least $600 million in synergies over three to four years. As Bill motioned last month we announced the steering committee has been formed comprised of a joint team of senior executives from both Sysco and U.S. Foods and the integration planning leadership had been determined.","Our integration planning team is comprised of leaders from both Sysco and U.S. Foods. We are focused on planning how we will operate as one company and better serve our customers. Our integration planning efforts has three primary goals day one readiness, value creation and long-term organizational design. We're off to a good start and we look forward to working with our U.S. Foods' colleagues on the merger integration planning as we determine how to bring together the best of both these two great companies.","As we've discussed, we expect a thorough regulatory review to take place over the next six to nine months and we recently learned that the FTC will be the agency leading the regulatory review for the government.","As part of the merger consideration Sysco will assume or refinance all of U.S. Foods net debt of approximately $4.7 billion. We have begun to take the steps necessary to secure financing to do that as well as hedge the interest rate risk between now and closing. In December, we secured fully committed bridge financing which will be available upon closing to fund the acquisition and refinance U.S. Food's debt. Shortly thereafter, U.S. Foods obtained consent from holders of their 8.5% notes to waive a provision that would have an effect require Sysco to purchase the notes upon a change of control.","This consent allowed us to reduce the bridge facility to $3.4 billion thereby reducing our financing cost. At the end of January, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the amounts available to us by $500 million to $1.5 billion and last week we entered into agreements to hedge the interest rate risk on $2 billion of the permanent financing.","In closing, while the challenging business environment in the food service industry continues to impact our customers and our financial results. We remain encouraged by the progress of our efforts to transform the way we do business. We strongly believe that the investments we are making in our business are vital to our future success and position us extraordinarily well for the future. The proposed merger steps up the momentum for change and provide many additional exciting opportunities for Sysco and the industry.","With that operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll take John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Bill, a couple of things, one thing I may missed I may not have heard. You talked about some of the actions you're taking on the cost side, but you also mentioned actions taken to drive street sales or street cases? What specifically are you doing there?","Bill DeLaney III","Yes. John, good morning. Well, as I said we're doing several things. I think what I said was we got a lot going on both on the cost side as you point out as well as addressing what our biggest challenge is right now driving sales on the locally managed business as well as addressing margin and those two as you well know are very unrelated.","In the short-term, we've revised our comp plan for MAs about a year ago and that's pretty well fully implemented now in the States and in process in Canada. There is an element of that today that we didn't have before it's not overly significant but it's meaningful which is predicated upon growing cases we just finished up another new account promotion. So we see opportunities to kind of get back in a more regular coordination of business -- new business promotions penetration promotions both with our local marketing people as well as from a national perspective.","We got as you can appreciate a lot of pretty comprehensive margin management training going on in the company at various level both locally as well as coming out of our corporate offices in terms of how do we optimize this whole challenge of quality growth with managing margin. Those are initiatives that kicked off in a bigger way here in the fall. So those will be three that I mentioned the short-term that we think we'll pay dividends for us here to some extent, they're already helping, but I think we'll pay bigger dividends for the second half of the fiscal year.","Beyond that John I think the others are more along these lines of the strategic initiatives we have been talking to you about which is we're doing a lot more work in marketing in terms of gaining objective custom insights, our CRM tools is further along in terms of implementation. We really do believe CatMan is going to help us a lot once that matures both on the sales side as well as on the margin side, it should be win-win for us and our suppliers and our customers.","And we got some other things going that are more pilot stages with revenue management inside sales platform that type of thing and beyond that Sysco ventures are still something out there we continue to grow and we believe long-term will give us opportunity to create traction with our customers. So many of these are more medium term, but as I said, we have heightened up the intensity on some of those short-term initiatives.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","So this is a follow up to that, you said 25% of the margin pressure was mix. So if you look at the others and this is probably hard to tell precisely but if you look at the other 75%, how much of that do you think is proactive, you're doing something versus reactive when you're responding to somebody else? And then the parts that proactive again how do you get your arms around that these are productive efforts right when you look at gross profit dollar performance?","Bill DeLaney III","Yes. Let me take a shot and if I'm not giving to John, just clear about your question a little bit more so. Look so I'd say over the last year, year and a half we've attributed a third to a quarter of the margin erosion to mix because of the larger customers are growing faster. The rest of it, it is difficult to quantify. Obviously, the way our business model works we can't just look at gross margin we have to look at our expenses as well. So we are definitely going to fight very hard for the cases we have today as well as continue to find ways to grow with our existing customers in our new prospects as well.","So I think where we're at right now in this process is I look at even early numbers this quarter is we're beginning to get smarter I think and a little bit more cohesive at the local level and making the right trade offs between volume and margin management. But the reality in this business for us is we need to grow the local business we need to grow the street business and that will contribute significantly to our gross profit dollar growth. We just got to be smart and balanced in how we do it. And so I think we're making strides there, you didn't really see here in the second quarter I think you will see some improvement here in the second half of the year as far as the margin management goes.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","And just lastly then, do you think giving the industry as a whole is behaving rationally in terms of balancing margin and case volume?","Bill DeLaney III","That's one of those great questions I don't know if I can answer as well as anyone of us would like. I think as I said the competitive environment is very acute as we've talked about a lot in the past in presentations and calls like this. There is some growth we believe -- we believe the market grew somewhat in 2013 we'll fine tune those numbers and hopefully talk more about it. At CAGNY, we don't think there was a lot of growth and we were able to take some share but we invested in that to some extent. I think that's rational from our perspective because in the end I think for our medium and long-term success it's important to continue to grow. There certainly are pockets of activity out there where there is some behavior that probably isn't the smartest as it could be. But overall, given the environment I think it's reasonably rational right now. It's just very competitive.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Just turning to cost per case expectations for the full year, I guess your full year expectations kind of reflect flat cost per case in the second half. So I know you've discussed this in the past, but I guess I am wondering with a successful kind of wave 1 behind you, wave 2 about to begin and three more OPCO conversions by year-end. Why wouldn't you continue to see improvements in cost per case for the back half?","Chris Kreidler","Hi, Karen. I think we will continue to see improvements in cost per case in the back half. What we're really commenting to is the fact that we're going to be lapping some significant work that was begun last year. So the quarter-over-quarter performance is not going to feel as good as the first half year of the year. We do think we'll be down at least a nickel, I think I admitted this time it will probably exceed a nickel a case as we look at the full year and we're just not necessarily giving a higher exact number to that right now.","Bill DeLaney III","I think Karen, let me just add. When we talk about cost per case, we're talking about operating cost. So we definitely are seeing reduction in cost per case for the CatMan work and we expect that to continue.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And any color on wave 1 in terms of how your customers are reacting to the initiative? And any color you could give on what they benefit to gross profit or COGS could have been as a result?","Bill DeLaney III","I think it's still reasonably early in the wave 1 cycle, but I would tell you I think our execution, I think, we alluded to this in our comments. I think we are improving our execution there in terms of how we do the conversions, the cadence of the conversions and addressing these opportunities in the most productive way possible with our customers. So I think we've had some challenges with the pilot categories on volume at times. We're starting to see some improvement on wave 1. We continue to see, like I said, significant improvement on our cost of goods which was driving most of the economics on this initiative.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just last question. Obviously inflation came down this quarter which was pretty widely expected but any comments on your outlook for the third quarter and beyond, I mean there is a lot of noise with the drought in California and protein inflation and things like that?","Bill DeLaney III","Yes, I was actually a little surprised with how much it came down. And we hit about one point of inflation which was kind of low. So I'd say sitting here today depending I'm not going to project impact of weather and that kind of thing that's difficult to do. But I would expect it to remain pretty modest somewhere in that 1% to 2% range but we'll have to see.","Chris Kreidler","Most of the external stuff that we read Karen is probably the same as you read expected to kind of go back to a more normal range whether its bills one to two or I guess what the others say out there two to three but we would expect it to be a little higher than where it is today. It's a hard thing to predict as last year or may be 18 months ago remember we had a drought everybody was expecting food cost inflation to go through the roof again and we never saw that materialize.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","Right. Okay. Thanks that's helpful.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Hi, good morning. On your comment that the sales slowed throughout the end of the quarter, how much of that was really the calendar and the weather? And did you see any snap back as you got into January results?","Bill DeLaney III","I think the calendar was certainly part of it Mark, and we did have some weather, it was last couple of weeks in December. I think that impacted us in certain parts of the country. So I would say it's hard to put a number to it but I would say part of the slowdown was that \u2013 we had pretty good growth in the second quarter last year. So when you look at comps \u2013 and we are talking about deltas of 2% or 3% case growth here. So if it goes off a point that's 50% of the delta. So I'd say it's a little bit of \u2013 comps are little more soft but we definitely saw a fall-off in December and certainly from what we see and what we read. I think you'd have to attribute a fair amount of that to the weather.","We knew the calendar but we still saw a little more than what we expected to see. I hate talking about weather especially in winter. We just had our market presence in here couple of weeks ago and really didn't want to hear a lot about weather. But I will tell you weather has been pretty brutal here first four, five weeks that we've had. Four of the five weeks I think have been very difficult last week in particular. You see the weather reports, we had issues throughout the southeast. We didn't ship in New Orleans. You saw the reports in Atlanta. The good news is its January and early February so March is a key part of this quarter and we still have an opportunity to make some of that back. But I'd say weather has impacted us quite a bit so far in January, early February.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Okay. And on the gross margin weakness did you have any pressure on the meats categories, red meat was a pressure for at least one of your smaller competitors out there?","Bill DeLaney III","I can't tell you as any more pronounced in that areas and any place because obviously those are high dollar boxes so you kind of get somewhat competitive depending on the size of the customer. But I wouldn't attribute any particular piece of it to meat category.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Okay. And for Chris, is there anyway you can give us a rough idea of what kind of interest rate we should be looking at for the big refinancing for the U.S. Foods deal?","Chris Kreidler","No. I wish I knew myself our strategy as I talked a little bit about it to hedge interest rates, but I mean this environment we've chosen to basically hedge about half, which means if they continue to languish or indeed decline, we won't give away all the benefit, if they go up, we're partially hedged. So that's kind of where we're hanging out right now. We'll continue to evaluate the markets as well as the yield curve going forward and look for an opportune time to lock in and obviously we've got to get much further along in the deal process and the regulatory approval process as well, but right now, I can't give you much more guidance.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Good morning. You sounded kind of optimistic about this year market conditions restaurants are getting may be back to positive traffic. I just wanted to ask you to explain a little about what you're thinking there sort of generally why you might think that? And then secondly, as part of the same question, have you seen you just talked about Atlanta and what's going on there but between the fourth quarter and the recent snow events and cold weather in the east, have you seen a bigger variance in the performance between places that had normal weather out west let's say versus the east you could share with us that might give us a sense if that is the case?","Bill DeLaney III","Andy, I will. So, let me start with the second one. I tried to give you a little color on that in my prepared comments. And so right now yes, I'm looking very hard at the West because we haven't seen that kind of weather out there. So we're seeing, I think, I called out the Southwest and to be fair I'd say the Southwest, if you go back the last two or three years has been probably the strongest part of the market.","If you look at some of the more industry-wide survey work that's done on consumers, the Southwest shows up quite strong. And I would say right now we're trending -- it's hard to do this Andy because I have to adjust for that variability you were alluding to, in terms of our individual performances.","But I'd say, if I just look at the West right now, things are a little bit better there, which gives me the confidence that some of this actually, clearly is being driven by weather in terms of early days here in this quarter. So with that said, the other thing I called out was, we've seen now for several quarters that the Northeast and what we call our Mid-East markets have seen more pronounced sluggishness and it's not to say we don't have opportunities to execute better in those markets but at the same time when I look at them across that entire geography that seems to be a tougher part of the country in terms of growth right now.","As far as why I'm optimistic, I would say it's interesting when you read all these reports that some of you published and that we all read, the state of mind consumers is reasonably good right now. The state of mind of our customers is reasonably good, when you look at forward-looking feelings about the future. So any time people are optimistic, that gives you reason to be optimistic, and that's part of it.","I think there's some technical issues that are somewhat clouded by the weather right now with some of the tax hits that the consumer took early last year that I'm hopeful that those will turn into positives here as we get towards spring and into summer. So I think the mindset is better and it's fragile. I'm not going to kid you on that. And when you look at the economic data, it's good at a certain level of macro and not so good in our piece of the industry, but I'm basically going off of, some of the sentiment surveys that we see in terms of the consumer, some technical things that we see in terms of what happened last year, early part of the calendar year.","And I would say, even though we're somewhat challenged here in terms of our performance for the quarter, haven't had a chance to talk to a lot of our people, I think we really believe that we are gaining traction on our initiatives and that we will see improvement here as we get deeper into the calendar year. Was that good?","Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","It's interesting, do have any, and last question but it's a follow on to what you just answered. Do you have a sense of the same store sales for your independence and is that something also you have by geography? And could also shed light on in the context of regional variance?","Bill DeLaney III","I don't have a great sense of that. We will obviously have our sales data where we can look at that at various levels of details in terms of what we call penetration that doesn't tell you what the accounts same-store sales are right?","I would tell you it varies. So whether you're talking big change, or whether you're talking about more street oriented type of operators, the stronger operators I think are holding up reasonably well in this kind of market and the people that are more on the margin are struggling more.","So we see a fair amount of variability across customers as it relates to penetration. My best judgment and I don't have any data on this Andy is that it's reasonably flat right out in terms of restaurant sales overall, same-store sales. I think if you \u2013 some change, we're doing better than others obviously.","Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald","Hi, good morning. I had a variation of some of the previous questions, but it's more specific to the outlook for the current quarter. I think at least some of the casual dining names, it looks like traffic was down significantly in December. I think it even turned negative in a few cases. So my guess is that that trend probably continued into January because of some of the cabin fever or weather-related issues that you talked about.","And then it looks like you're also getting the benefit of some inflation and you talked about inflation a little earlier. But I think some of the government data suggests some deflation over the last three of four months. So from your prepared comments, it sounds like you are more optimistic about sales trends for calendar 2014. But do you foresee potential for incremental volume weakness in the current quarter from the combination of even potentially deflationary pressure or and also sort of the continuation of some of the weather-related impact? Thanks.","Bill DeLaney III","Yes. Good morning, Ajay. I would \u2013 I think I'm on at that thing, well, I tried to get across to my comments. I'm pretty cautious on this quarter right now on the top line just given what we have been dealing with the first four or five weeks. As I said, the March drives this particular quarter. So if we catch up a break with the weather and maybe we've seen the worst of it. In terms of parts of the country where you don't expect to see this kind of weather that's really the issue.","So when weather affects us is when you have these freezers and snowstorms in the Southeast and the Southwest that's a problem, okay. When they carry into April that's a problem, when they started early November that's a problem. Winters going to be winter in the Northeast and the Mid-West and we understand that. So I'm somewhat cautious because of the weather and how we started out this quarter. But, there is still a lot of good weeks ahead of us in terms of volume as we get toward later part of February and March.","I'm more optimistic on the year just for reasons I discussed earlier there I think the consumer is in a better place and I think with the break here and there that's going to be good for our customers and we are very well-positioned to leverage that terms of our business.","Deflation, we're not always seeing deflation. We are seeing categories that are maybe down a little bit, up a little bit. We have got some inflation in meat and seafood I think going right now. So deflation would not be good for us. Again, what we \u2013 was more ideal for us would be to have that inflation number get back around 2 maybe even a little bit higher that gives us a little more room to maneuver in terms of our expense management and at the same time work with our customers and the way that they can handle the cost increases.","So deflation would not be good but I don't necessarily think we are looking at deflation. I think we are looking at as we said earlier moderate inflation continuing.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald","Great. Thank you.","Bill DeLaney III","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays. And your line is open. Please check your mute button. Again, check your mute button, your line is open. Due to the silence on this line we will take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Hi. Thank you. The question is how your customers might be responding to the merger, or I guess the news of the merger. I mean is it situation, I guess FTC excluded one plus one could equal two or do you sound some nervousness of your \u2013 within your customer base or consolidation of power and that's the case what will you do maybe differently in six to nine months to retain some business that some of your competition might otherwise be trying to get?","Bill DeLaney III","Good morning, John. Look, I would say this, from the day one of the announcements through today and going forward to close and then beyond close, certainly one of our big goals here is to have a very active, effective communication program with all of our stakeholders. So it's our customers, our suppliers, our associates, shareholders, government media all that type of things.","So we are early days of dealing with that. We are in constant contact with our customers. We have equipped our OPCO presidents and there sales leadership with pieces to communicate with the local chefs associations, restaurant associations. So I would characterize that early days as we got good ongoing discussions with our customers, certainly there is some that have some concerns we work through those. I would say many are excited to understand what the benefits are. And how long it will take to close and when will all that happen.","And I would say largely customers are pretty open minded and they are looking for those benefits. So whether it's going to enhance their business from \u2013 how they might order product with us or wider assortment of innovative products. The fact that we will take cost out of the system over time how that translates to their opportunity to work with Sysco. Those are all things that we are taking with our customers about. We clearly see this as a very good thing for our customers, frankly I see this as a very good thing for the industry over time and certainly we will see as a good thing for Sysco.","So I think generally it's very open-minded and constructive. Obviously, there are some people out there that don't like this, they tend to be more on the competitive side of the ball and they are having those types of conversations and we are addressing that as appropriate.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Thank you.","Bill DeLaney III","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Thanks for taking my question. First, I just would like to talk a little bit about how much of that category management are done with -- finished wave 1. I think you made some comments about what the impact was, you think it's recovering. Could you just be more specific about what happens with revenues or customer reaction, with the category management?","Bill DeLaney III","Yes. I will take a shot at that Meredith. So essentially the whole idea of category management is to optimize the assortment of pricing theory in an effort to help our customers optimize and enhance the products that are available to them as well. Along the lines, we certainly see opportunities here to enhance our relationships with our suppliers and prove product development innovation and reduce our SKUs where that make sense. And to take cost out of the system as relates to our cost of good. The challenge as you would expect as you go into something like this is the conversion process.","So I would say to you in the pilot wave or pilot categories there was four of them. We did a very good job working with our suppliers; we did a very good job identifying opportunities for cost savings and we are realizing those. What we are learning as we go is to strike the right balance in terms of the cadence and the conversions with our customers and to make sure we are equipping all operating companies' sales management and the MAs with the tools that they need to have the conversations about conversions with the customers in the right place.","So where we are making process at this point I think it's on the conversion and we expect to continue make process as we get deeper in wave 1 and wave 2.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","So when you say you are running more about how to do the conversions, does that mean that there was unhappiness initially?","Bill DeLaney III","Meredith, anytime you sit down with a human being and tell them they are \u2013 and you got an idea and you are going to ask them to change what they are doing, there is some challenges to that. So I would say yes, as we got into it, even though we have done I think a tremendous job in terms of developing the communication pieces training our people there is always the dynamic that you deal with across the table from a customer. So we ran into some challenges there. We still have them.","But, I would say this in a more straightforward way as I can. It's really more about just making sure, since the conversion is relevant to that customer many of them are. We are not converting every item for every customer. But to make sure that we are having good constructive dialog in terms of why it's different for the consumer. And as you play that out over 7,000 territories with 10s of 1000s of customers and something you have done for the first time certainly there are challenges. But, I would tell you again, I'm seeing improvement on that and performance there as we get into wave 1 and expected to continue to improve.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Okay. Thank you. And then another just sort of food question that confirms something Chris said about the cost per case, I think you set down 5%, I wasn't sure if he was saying down 5% for second half or down 5% for the full year?","Chris Kreidler","Meredith, I actually said down $0.05 per case will be down at least \u2013","Meredith Adler - Barclays","$0.05?","Chris Kreidler","$0.05 per case for the full year.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Okay. And this, do you include the pension change as part of the cost per case?","Chris Kreidler","Yes. That's an all end case per case.","Operator","And we will take our next question with Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Yes. Good morning guys.","Bill DeLaney III","Good morning.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","I just have a \u2013 I guess a lot of my questions are sort of around modeling and how I think about the back of the year. But, the first one is on mix and I guess the impact of negative mix on sales which seems this quarter to be higher, I only say that because we sort of like try to figure out what your volume growth is based on the data points you give, right. We would come up with a lower number by about 70 basis points. We are not typically that high. So is the negative impact and mix accelerating and then would you expect it to stay at this level or could it even be higher?","Bill DeLaney III","I'm going to start and then let Chris do that. I can't speak to the modeling part of that. I would say it's not accelerating. What I would say is, as we said in our prepared comments, we are still seeing good growth with a larger customers regional and national customers. We are just not seeing enough growth here on the local side. But I wouldn't say that it accelerated at all.","Chris Kreidler","I'm not sure. I can add a lot. Your question was negative mix on sales, correct?","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Correct. You know, Chris, it's just that if I think about your dollar sales and I adjust for acquisitions and I adjust for inflation, right, I'm going to come out with a 2% volume growth number, right? You get 2.7.","Chris Kreidler","Right.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","70 basis points it's bigger than what its been historically and I'm trying to figure out if that is the number I should be using going forward?","Chris Kreidler","Yes. We had that conversation before. I understand that how folks come up with what I get, they call real growth and that's just not a number that we would ever \u2013 put much credence in, which is why we start giving you actual case volumes. So that number is going to move around for a variety of different reasons. And we frankly just don't track it.","Bill DeLaney III","I would say the bigger issue on this quarter rather than some of the sluggishness in December that we have already talked about. If you compare the first quarter to the second quarter your inflation number went from 2 to 1. And that's probably the bigger \u2013","Chris Kreidler","Inflation and actually your ForEx was a little higher as well. When you put both of those in there and your sales number is not a significantly off of where we were.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Okay. Then the other question relates to a sequential change in the business is, this notion of looking at your volume growth right relative to your gross profit dollar growth. And that spread seems to have widened a bit. So which I guess could be \u2013 could be competition market or whatever. But, I guess, how do you think about that. I know you typically don't want it. You would like to grow gross profit sort of closer to volume, right? So going forward should I be using this type of spread, do you think it can improve?","Bill DeLaney III","As I said, we came up with somewhat short of our internal goals here for the quarter and that was on the gross profit dollar line. But, I would the spread was about the same as it was in the first half. We had a top line miss and we will continue to have gross profit pressure and margin pressure on all categories to customers actually so I \u2013 what I'm looking at the spread is about the same as in the first quarter.","Chris Kreidler","Obviously, you got to do your own modeling. Our plan certainly don't call for or allow for a 0.7% gross margin growth number. We are clearly higher than that. We clearly have higher expectations for that. And Bill explained that's where we got a tremendous amount of focus and we talked about it for a number of quarters here. So that's not in our short or long-term projections.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","All right. And Chris, you are going to lapse in acceleration and the acquisition benefit in the back half year?","Chris Kreidler","Yes.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","So I guess you would expect that benefit to slowdown, I guess is that, right?","Chris Kreidler","It will. We kind of expressed what we think the full year benefit will be. We -- just the carry over deals themselves would boost us by at least 1% in terms of sales and then new transactions every year are targeted at least 1% say you get about half point impact for the year. So add those up and generally our expectation is about 0.5.","So we still have a significant pipeline of transactions. We got this major one that we have to work our way through of course. And so U.S. acquisitions may slow a bit but we still have focus in Canada and focus in other geographies.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Nice. And then just one last question for you on SAP. Now that it looks like you got through Boise, what's the next big OPCO going to get done, is that \u2013 within the next group and are you comfortable now that some of the changes you made get you over the hurdle to get a big OPCOs on just as well now?","Bill DeLaney III","We just as I mentioned we just did Phoenix and Vegas last weekend. Actually so we were work week two there now add so we are early days but we are feeling good about that. I think I also mentioned if things stay on course both with the next round of enhancements as well as what we see in these last three companies, we expect to do a couple of more in latter part of this fiscal year, they would both be very large companies.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Bill DeLaney III","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Greg Hassler with Bank of America.","Greg Hassler - Bank of America","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And apologize if I missed this earlier. I think you may have addressed and it was cutting out a little bit. But in terms of the refinancing that you guys intend to do, should we just expect that to be closer to the time of the closing of the transaction? I think you've said, you expected to take or at least the FTC review to take 9 to 12 months, so just trying to think of this from a timing perspective.","Chris Kreidler","It will certainly be closer to the time of the transaction whether we take advantage of market conditions and confidence levels prior to that. It will depend upon a number of factors and terms of when we'll actually pull the trigger to do some of this refinancing.","Greg Hassler - Bank of America","Okay. And then, in terms of the overall size, you've got a pretty big chunk of legacy U.S. Foods that's here to refinance, but then at Sysco, you also have some shorter term borrowings. You've got a 2014 and a 2015 maturity coming up. So we expected, you kind of do that all at once, or could you be coming to market multiple times here over the next couple of years?","Chris Kreidler","Obviously, our goal was not to be -- to come to market a whole bunch of different times. It will -- it tends to cause a little inefficiency in terms of pricing as well as disruption. At the same time, we've got something that comes due and we see an opportunity to refinance a chunk of it, both our side as well as pre-refinancing the U.S. Foods merger consideration we may look for an opportunity to do that.","Greg Hassler - Bank of America","Okay. Thank you very much.","Chris Kreidler","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's Sysco second quarter fiscal 2014 conference call. We thank you for your participation and have a good day."],"19929":["Sysco Corp. (NYSE:SYY) Q1 2018 Earnings Call November  6, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Neil A.

We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions.","I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.","Neil A. Russell - Sysco Corp.","Thanks, Tiffany. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. Joining me in Houston today are Bill DeLaney, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Ben\u00e9, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause the results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2017, subsequent SEC filings, and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at Sysco.com or via Sysco's IR app.","Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found in the Investors section of our website.","Additionally, due to the Brakes Group acquisition that closed in July 2016, we've previously referenced financial performance results both including and excluding the acquisition for our fiscal 2017. Beginning this quarter and going forward, as we now have a full year's worth of financial results, we will be referencing financial results for Sysco in total. The one exception will be for operating income, as we still plan to give visibility on our original three-year plan target which did not include Brakes.","Additionally, we have scheduled our Investor Day for December 7 in New York. We look forward to seeing you there.","To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our start to fiscal 2018 as reflected in the solid financial \u2013 as reflected in the solid first quarter results Sysco reported earlier this morning. For the quarter, sales increased 5% to $14.7 billion; adjusted operating income increased nearly 6% to $662 million; and adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.74. These results were achieved in the midst of several devastating natural disasters during the latter part of the quarter which adversely impacted our business and that of our customers in several key markets. We estimate that our operating income for the quarter would have been approximately $10 million higher if not for the lost sales and reduced productivity caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Tom and Joel will provide additional perspective on the financial impact of these unprecedented events later on in the call.","Additionally, I'd like to take a moment to express our gratitude to all of the first responders, volunteers and charitable organizations who worked tirelessly to support those in need. I'd also like to thank our dedicated associates who sacrificed personally to ensure delivery of product to those customers with critical needs such as hospitals and shelters. Further, it has been incredibly gratifying for me to witness the tremendous outpouring of support amongst thousands of our associates for one another through Sysco's Disaster Relief Foundation.","Moving now to the current economic and market environments in which we operate. We are hopeful that the recently reported and improved GDP trends in the United States could ultimately lead to demand lift for our domestic customer base. While it's difficult to totally isolate the impact of the extreme weather experience in Texas and Florida in September, it appears that current market conditions in the United States for foodservice operators are modestly favorable. Larger check sizes at restaurants continue to offset somewhat lower traffic counts while consumer sentiment remains at relatively high levels.","Conversely, economic growth in the European markets we operate in is more muted. In addition, significant foreign exchange-driven food cost inflation in our UK business continues to pressure our pricing, which has impacted our volume growth and gross margins. We are highly focused and actively engaged in addressing these challenges in a manner that is beneficial both to our customers and to Sysco.","Turning to Sysco's current state, we continue to execute our customer-centric strategy at a high level. The fundamentals of our business are strong and we are well-positioned to achieve disciplined, profitable and sustainable growth in the future. I'm confident that we will be able to continue to leverage quality sales growth in our domestic Foodservice business by continually improving the implementation of our commercial, supply chain and cost reduction strategic initiatives. The prospects for our international businesses are also compelling as we see significant potential over the next few years to penetrate the markets we currently serve, enhance operating best practices, and further expand our geographic footprint.","To summarize, we're off to a good start in fiscal 2018 and remain confident in our ability to deliver another strong year and achieve our current three-year plan financial targets. In closing, I would like to express my appreciation to all of our associates for their ongoing efforts and contributions as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco: to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.","And now I'll turn the call over to Tom Ben\u00e9, President and Chief Operating Officer.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect solid operating performance and continued progress against several of our key multi-year initiatives. While we did experience some temporary headwinds, including the impact of the hurricanes on some of our customers, rising inflation, and a challenging inbound freight environment, we remain on track to achieve a successful year and ultimately deliver on our three-year operating income target.","Looking at our first quarter results by business segment, beginning with U.S. Foodservice Operations, sales grew 3.9% for the quarter, gross profit grew 3.8%, and gross margins remain flat. Adjusting for the hurricanes, gross profit dollar growth would have been approximately 4.3%. The growth in gross profit dollars can be attributed to the continued focus on category management including positive momentum from Sysco Brand and a balanced approach to pricing with our ongoing revenue management efforts.","For the quarter, local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business remained strong at 2.8% and has now grown for 14 consecutive quarters. Adjusting for hurricanes, we believe that local case growth would have been over 3%. Our multi-unit customer segment declined, driving overall case growth to a modest 0.3%. As we've discussed, we have proactively managed our business in a more disciplined, profitable manner with multi-unit customers. We have recently begun to add some new customers and should see multi-unit growth begin to build in the second quarter and continue throughout the remainder of the year.","While we do see customers' preference \u2013 consumers' preferences in restaurants continuing to include new, unique and customizable options that are fresh and healthy, we also see relative strength in concepts that offer convenience, low cost for consumers, and familiarity. These combined preferences benefit both our local and emerging multi-unit customers who provide value in terms of quality, dining environment, and a reasonable price point.","From a product perspective, we continue to invest in our Sysco Brand as part of a larger brand revitalization effort including a reinvigoration of our portfolio that offers cleaner, fresher images for our branded products. These changes, along with new innovation, have positively contributed to brand growth, up another 82 basis points versus prior year.","Regarding our supplier community, there were many examples during the recent storms where our supplier partners were there to support us and our customers who were in need. And I also want to share our thanks to all of those who supported us.","Our digital ordering presence continues to grow and has now improved to approximately 40% of local cases ordered. This increased utilization is a result of our solid technology platform including improved product images and content, enhanced system capabilities, and increased levels of training. Also, as we centralized our support model for multi-unit accounts with tools such as order guide management, both Sysco and our customers have begun to see the benefits of working together to drive efficiencies in the business.","Turning our attention to cost, our adjusted operating expense growth for the quarter was 3.2%. While there were some definite headwinds that drove our supply chain costs, we continue to see positive momentum from productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements. We are now implementing next evolution of tools to help streamline hours, improve delivery, and drive warehouse efficiencies. From an administrative cost perspective, we continue to focus on managing these expenses throughout the organization. Effectively managing overall cost structure remains a key priority for us, and we continue to focus on a variety of opportunities to deliver improvement.","A key pillar of Sysco's strategy for growth and value creation is the continuous assessment of new market opportunities. As many of you know, we recently acquired HFM FoodService, a Hawaii-based broadline distributor with approximately $290 million in annual sales. HFM has been providing quality service to Hawaii and Guam for over 50 years. We're excited to welcome them to Sysco family. Acquiring HFM provides Sysco with direct access to the growing Hawaiian market and is in clear alignment with our strategy for disciplined, profitable growth of the business. We will report this business in our U.S. Foodservice segment going forward.","Moving to International Foodservice Operations, we had mixed results for the quarter. With sales growing 6%, gross profit growing 3%, and adjusted operating expenses increasing 5%. Driven by investments in our European supply chain transformation, transition costs associated with a new large customer in Mexico, and currency translation in Canada. Overall adjusted operating income declined by 8% for the quarter.","Our business in Canada is off to a great start this year. We are experiencing local case growth in most regions, especially in major markets. We are also thoughtfully sharing and implementing strategic initiatives from our U.S. business, such as revenue management and other customer-centric solutions, including online ordering, to their business. These capabilities, along with a more focused approach to local customers, have translated into accelerated local case growth. Additionally, we are effectively managing our cost structure and improving supply chain efficiencies to help maintain a healthy gap between gross profit growth and expense growth to drive our overall performance.","Our European business is facing some macroeconomic headwinds, as customers are experiencing slower restaurant traffic and an overall slowdown in Food Away From Home in the UK. Additionally, the UK continues to experience acute inflation due to weakness in the pound sterling, which resulted in high food cost inflation of about 9% during the first quarter. While we expect these headwinds in the UK to continue throughout our fiscal year, we are actively managing the business to mitigate these impacts.","As for our business in Latin America, we are excited about the growth opportunities in this region, although there were some weakness due to the recent earthquakes in Mexico City and expenses related to the addition of a large customer in Mexico that I mentioned earlier. In Costa Rica, we continued to see solid growth as we continue expanding our Cash & Carry footprint. Additionally, subsequent to the close of our first quarter, we have completed the purchase of the remaining 50% of the Mayca business in Costa Rica. We will use cash to complete this transaction, and our debt levels will not be affected. We initially purchased 50% of the business in 2014, and we are very pleased with the performance thus far, as adjusted EBITDA has doubled in the past three years. We look forward to continued success with the Mayca team.","Lastly, our SYGMA segment continues to grow. We are focused on implementing operational improvements that will contribute to long-term operating income improvement.","In summary, we feel good about the fundamentals of our business and about the trajectory that we're on for fiscal 2018, to close out our three-year plan.","Despite the severe weather-related challenges we faced in Q1, we continue to make progress on our customer and operational strategies to improve our customer's experience, and I remain confident in our ability to deliver the high end of our adjusted operating income growth target of $600 to $650 million.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter. Our earnings growth reflects continued momentum from our business, including strong local case growth and good gross profit dollar growth and cost management.","This morning, I'll start with our quarterly results on a comparable 13-week basis. For the quarter, sales grew 4.9%; gross profit grew 3.8%; while adjusted operating expense grew 3.2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 5.6%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 10.4%, to $0.74.","During the quarter, our results were impacted by both the impact of multiple hurricanes and a lower tax rate that, when factored together, would have resulted in operating income growth of more than 7% and earnings per share of $0.72, which is in line with our planned expectations.","For the first quarter fiscal 2018, we saw inflation of 3.8% in our U.S. Broadline business. The pace of inflation has been rapid for a few categories, such as meat, poultry and dairy, ultimately driving overall inflation.","During the quarter, we had gross profit growth of 3.8%, driven by local case growth and improved Sysco Brand penetration. Adjusted operating expenses grew 3.2% for the quarter, driven by increased transportation expenses and unusually lower bad debt expense in the prior year. In addition, our expenses include the impact of labor and related costs during the storms that we continued to pay, despite lower volumes in those affected areas.","We continued to maintain a gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth. While the gap was not as strong as in prior quarters, we still feel good about the performance and the ultimate translation into adjusted operating income leverage and continued progress toward achieving our three-year plan objectives. Part of the compression of that gap can be explained by the impact of hurricanes and inbound freight, which negatively impacted cost of goods. In fact, adjusting for the impact of the hurricanes, the gap between gross profit dollars and expenses is approximately 1 point.","As it relates to taxes, effective tax rate in the first quarter was 32.7% compared to 32.9% in the prior-year period. Cash flow from operations was $83 million for the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2018. Net CapEx for the quarter was $135 million or about 1% of sales which was roughly flat to last year. Free cash flow for the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2018 was negative $52 million. It's important to note that the first quarter often produces negative free cash flow, largely due to investments in working capital. However, we continue to expect strong cash flow for the full fiscal year 2018.","Now, I'd like to transition to three (sic) [four] (18:10) business updates. First, regarding second quarter expectations, we expect to see further softness in the International segment followed by a modestly stronger second half of the year as we align the Brakes Group calendar year to our fiscal year. Second, as we previously discussed, we will realize a one-time net benefit and depreciation expense related to technology changes. This benefit will be approximately $50 million recognized evenly over four quarters. Third, regarding share repurchases, we've been aggressive in the market as we've seen opportunities to repurchase shares this quarter. We've maintained our approach in purchasing shares opportunistically, but we do not expect that pace to continue for the balance of the fiscal year. Finally, a new accounting standard became applicable in fiscal 2018 that requires access \u2013 excess tax benefits or detriments from stock compensation to be recognized within the income statement in the income tax line.","For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized the benefit of $15 million (19:25) as a reduction of income tax largely from stock option exercises that occurred in the first quarter. These tax benefits are difficult to predict and depend on factors such as our stock price and option exercise activity. Absent these tax benefits, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 35% and 36%.","In summary, we had a solid quarter that reflected the continued momentum in our business. I remain confident that we are on track to achieve our three-year plan financial objectives, including the high end of the $600 million to $650 million range of improved adjusted operating income comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015 excluding Brakes.","The fundamentals of our business remain strong as we continue to deliver strong local case growth and good gross profit dollar growth and cost management. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business.","I'll now turn it back over to Bill before we go to Q&A.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thanks, Joel. As you know, I will be stepping down as Sysco's CEO at the end of the calendar year, so this is my final earnings call. I'm the sixth CEO in Sysco's 47-year history as a public company, and serving in that capacity over the past nine years has been an honor. In addition, I have been truly privileged to work alongside hundreds of committed and highly-capable associates throughout my nearly 30-year career.","Today, I would like to especially thank all of our associates who have supported me throughout my tenure as CEO. We faced many challenges together. Most importantly, we have together, as one Sysco, driven significant and much needed transformational change, expanded our international and domestic footprint, increased revenues by nearly $20 billion, and doubled Sysco's market capitalization.","The great news is that there remains a lot of opportunity ahead and really good work to do. Tom Ben\u00e9 is the absolutely right person together with our leadership team to take Sysco to the next level, and I am confident you will be well-served by his leadership going forward.","In closing, I just would like to note that I've been actively involved with Sysco's Investor Relations program during much of my career, including my early years in various Treasury functions and, of course, the past 11 years as CFO and now CEO. To those of you whom I've crossed paths with over the years, thank you for your interest in Sysco and for the respect you've provided me both in good and challenging times. I wish you all the very best.","Operator we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. John Heinbockel, your line is open.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Can you hear me?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Yeah.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Can you hear me, guys?","(22:45)","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, I was going to say in light of the 4% inflation rate in the U.S., flat gross margin was actually a fairly decent outcome. So, maybe talk about where we sit with the evolution of revenue management. And kind of what you're doing at the margin here on price elasticity?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","So, John, good morning. It's Tom. What I would say is that we talked a lot over the last couple years about all the tools that we've been building in the revenue management area and that we felt good that they were going to help us both in deflationary and inflationary times.","And what I would just reiterate is that a lot of those tools \u2013 because what we are seeing in some of these categories is fairly heavy inflation in a couple of the ones that Joel highlighted: meat, poultry, dairy. And so what they really allow us to do is effectively pass on the pricing where we can, but do it in a balanced way such that our customers aren't feeling significant impacts over the short-term as well. So, it's really a matter of week-by-week providing our salespeople the right information, insight and guidance on how to basically price and be competitive in the marketplace.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, the \u2013 when you look at what needs to be done at Brakes, right, and I know you've obviously made some management changes there. If you think about the two or three things that Sysco can bring to Brakes in terms of best practice sharing, what are they? And what is the margin opportunity at Brakes today when you look at the delta versus where you guys sit in the U.S.?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","So, I assume \u2013 let's start with margin. When you talk about margin, you're probably talking about gross margin. And generally speaking, the margin \u2013 gross margin in Europe tends to be higher than what it is in the U.S. But their cost structures tend to be a little higher as well, which ultimately affects the operating margin.","A lot of the activity that we've started to share, they have their own kind of category management approach and program, but we're starting to share more information between the European team and the U.S. team around how we might think about that process going forward. So, there could be some benefits regarding the product costs. But I'd say the bigger areas are probably around how we leverage some of the solutions we've built around the sales model here. We've talked over the last couple of years about the solutions that we've built out, whether it be things like business review or the revenue management capability, or even how we think about building out the branded portfolio in our Sysco Brand, and those all remain, I think, opportunities for us to help leverage some of that learnings out of the U.S. and share those best practices in Europe. And we've started that process already with that team.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","And, Tom, if I could just add one other thing to that. It's Joel. I think the supply chain piece is probably the other part that I would just add to that. I think, obviously, some of the investments that we've talked about that we continue to make are around continuing to enhance their transformational work on the supply chain side as well as, again, to (26:00) around putting some of those best practices in place. So, I think, just to add one other thing to Tom's point. I think I would \u2013 the other part I would single out is an opportunity for us.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And, Bill, congratulations on your retirement.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo","Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. And, Bill, good luck in the future as well.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thank you.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo","So, I just wanted to start it \u2013 start on SG&A, particularly within the Foodservice side of the business. It was certainly higher than what we were expecting, up 3.2% on basically 30 basis points of case growth. Can you just provide more color on the impacts here? How much did the hurricane actually hurt that line item? The bad debt expense that you mentioned on the comparison side, what did that mean? And then can you talk about diesel costs and the impact that that had in the quarter as well?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yes, sure, Ed. This is Joel. I'm going to start. I think a couple parts to that. Number one, there was some impact on our cost per case as it relates to, again, what I'll just call overall productivity. In other words, there's certainly as part of that, there are admin costs that we continue to pay where we're not shipping case volumes in those areas. And so, that would have a negative impact on that leverage.","From a bad debt perspective, a lot of that's related to some actually positive bad debt results we had in the prior year that were, I would say, significant relative to what would be normal for us. So, when that comparison hits, it actually elevates what would be a growth in our admin costs for this year on that side of it.","I think a couple of other pieces of that, again, certainly from a segment perspective, as what I've talked about mostly relates to the U.S. side. We certainly did have some higher levels of expense growth in our International businesses, so much we've talked about. There's some start-up cost with a new customer in Mexico and some investment costs that we've put into the UK Again, all of that now is actually factored into our cost structure, which would not have been something you had been used to seeing as much last year because we'd always talked about ex Brakes but, obviously, includes all that and \u2013 so, I would say those are really some of the primary callouts and, again, the hurricane, again, did have some productivity impact there, without a doubt. But I think it's a few \u2013 collection of a few things. We still feel good about our ability to manage costs still in this area going forward.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","The only other thing...","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo","Yes, got it.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. The only thing you mentioned...","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo","I'm sorry, Tom.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","... was fuel. And so where's (28:48) about a penny detriment on fuel versus prior year. And the buildout, the cost comments that Joel made from an operating perspective, when you think about the way we run our business and the impacts of the \u2013 some of the storms, we still are basically paying all of our associates, drivers, warehouse, et cetera, without any case activity during those times. And so, that's what drove some of that incremental expense from an operating perspective as well.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo","Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up. Profit per case on U.S. Foodservice has been really strong the last months \u2013 been strong for a while, but the last couple of quarters seemed notably strong. Can you just talk about that acceleration and the momentum? And then how does that change over the next few quarters as you have some new business coming in?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","So, Ed, I assume you're talking about gross profit per case.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo","Yeah.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. So, it's a really good question given the inflationary environment we're experiencing. So, we continue to see our gross profit per case improve, even though, obviously, we haven't seen margin expansion during this time of inflation. So, we continue to feel good about that and that's a combination of things. It's the category management effort we've had going. We talked earlier about the increase in Sysco Brand, another 82-basis-point improvement with our local customers, which is again, as you think about the challenges on inflation we're seeing, our ability to give customers options, including Sysco Brand, and help them maintain their cost, while also delivering improved margins for us, is a kind of a win-win in there. And so, as we see our case volume increase, we would actually expect to see us continue to be able to manage that accordingly. And so, we do feel like you're going to see some improvements there, predominantly in this multi-unit side, as we continue to go forward throughout the year.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to elaborate a little further on the international comments. I think you mentioned some further softness expected in 2Q, but an improvement in the second half? Did I hear that correctly, if \u2013 and can you elaborate on that?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yes, Kelly. I think, again, as I talked about \u2013 I mean, some of this is really related to what I'll call some timing elements of the fact that the previous fiscal year with Brakes was on a calendar basis. And just essentially moving that now to where their fiscal year aligns with our fiscal year does cause some changing of the way some things are recognized. And so I think, from a timing perspective, again, that impact is going to most notably hit us in the second quarter, which again, used to be their \u2013 the final quarter of their calendar year. And again, \u2013 but certainly we'll expect some level of pickup in that, in the second half of our year.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, and the other question I wanted to ask was just on the corporate multi-unit trends. Do you continue to expect those to improve, I think, starting next quarter? Can you quantify the magnitude of that there, and is this a positive or a negative for gross margin within the U.S. Foodservice?","32:10: So, I guess \u2013 let me take that at a high level, Kelly. It's, definitely, from an improvement \u2013 the trend's going to improve, okay? So, what's been going on as we've talked, we've been very thoughtful about the way we approach the multi-unit segment of our business. And we have had, obviously, some situations over the last year where we've not renewed some business, or lost some business there. And so, what we now are getting ready to do is lap some of that as we go into Q2, and we have picked up a couple of new customers as well. And so you \u2013 the combination of those things will in fact improve the multi-unit sales trends that we've been seeing for the last kind of three to four quarters.","As far as gross margin, obviously, overall, that business is a lower margin than our local customers. As far as us sharing a specific number with you, it would be really difficult for us to do that. But you certainly will expect, as we get overall customer growth volume growing, that there will be some benefits to the gross profit dollar line. And it could have some impact on margin.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question and, Bill, of course, best of luck to you in the next chapter here.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Vinnie.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just \u2013 absolutely. Just wanted to \u2013 I guess, just first going back to inflation. Just to kind of get your sense versus what you guys were expecting heading into the quarter. Obviously, 3.8% was a bit above probably most of our estimates on the line here. Just wanted to see kind of versus your internal expectations, and if any changes have happened since. And maybe \u2013 I know you mentioned there's been some kind of changes where you can promote some of your private label. Has that been kind of a meaningful change with the higher inflation?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Here, let me take the first part of your question and then I'll let Tom chime in on the other. I think the \u2013 it's Joel. I think the \u2013 certainly, Vinnie, I would say that the level that we've seen here in Q1 \u2013 say, it's fair to say, is higher than we anticipated. And I guess I would say that the speed to which it actually happened in a few of the categories we called out was, I'd say, something that happened faster than we anticipated.","But I think, at the end of the day, it certainly, as Tom pointed out, I think that some of the things that we've done, in particular, RevMan, CatMan, certainly provided us with the tools and resources, and certainly provided our sales team with the opportunities to manage this fairly well and, again, I certainly \u2013 somebody called out earlier, I mean, the fact that our U.S. Broadline \u2013 our U.S. Foodservice, excuse me, segment was relatively flat from a margin perspective, I think, is pretty strong relative to where (35:02) \u2013 despite, again, as you pointed out, things that happened probably faster than we anticipated. Do you want to add anything to that, Tom?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. I think the only thing I'd add, Vinnie, is that obviously, we continue to see some inflation through at least the balance of the calendar year. There are some things, like produce, that we think might be impacted more, given the recent fires in California. So, there are going be some continued areas we're going to have to deal with. And again, as w talked \u2013 from the first question \u2013 I think we feel good about the tools we've got in place to manage through this. But as Joel said, these categories that move fairly quickly and fairly aggressively is where we run into the biggest challenge and we just \u2013 always you (35:42) need a little time to maneuver around that and work through it, but I think we're doing a pretty good job.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then, just a fast question on the International side, and I'm sure we'll get more color in December. But just around Brakes \u2013 it seems like the UK, obviously, has more of kind of the macro issues there. Would you say, though, that kind of the basis (36:07) of the business now, just over a year into the integration here, has been going relatively according to plan? And maybe just if there's any changes in any of the regions, more just on a competitive front or pretty much in line with your expectations?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Hey, Vinnie. So, yeah, I would say it's relatively as we had expected and on plan. Now, having said that, we are making investments over there, as we've talked. The transformation efforts in the UK continue. We're looking to make some other investments in some of the other parts of Europe, including France. And so, I think we continue to believe that it's a great business, and one we see lots of potential out of. But there are some things we've not \u2013 need to get in place and operating the way we'd want, to get that type of growth in the future. The only other thing we already talked about with the UK in particular, and some of the macroeconomic challenges they have, the inflation there driven by the currency issues are significant.","So, 9% inflation is a massive number. And we are seeing impacts from that. And we see that unfortunately, continuing for some period of time here. So, I'd say that's the only other piece of this that \u2013 that's different than what we had hoped or expected. Obviously, with Brexit happening, we knew there was going to be some impacts but it's sustained at fairly high levels for quite a while now.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Best of luck, guys.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Thanks.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is open.","Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. It's Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. And thanks for taking the question. Did you say what operating profit was excluding Brakes? We're just trying to get to what the three-year incremental operating profit is now and by our rough math it seems like you're up to $460 million, so you would need to generate almost $200 million the rest of this year to get to the high end. Does that sound right?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. So, this is Joel. I mean, we actually \u2013 if you want to take the dollars ex Brakes, we added $52 million operating income dollars, again, ex Brakes and so that takes us to a total of $469 million for the \u2013 for, now, the nine quarters of the three-year plan.","Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And would the $50 million D&A (38:19) benefit contribute towards the plan as well?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yes. Yes and, again, that's going be spread evenly across the four quarters of the year.","Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And on tax reform if it's passed and corporate rates are lowered, what are your views on whether or not incremental profit dollars will drop to the bottom line versus get computed (38:37) away?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Well, yes. First of all, it's \u2013 to you speculate on anything coming out of Washington right now is a little bit interesting. But I think the \u2013 yeah, look, we're a company that obviously has a large percentage of our profits in the United States and so, certainly, just based on that fact it certainly seems like a positive opportunity for us. I think the \u2013 in terms of passing some of that along, I \u2013 to be honest with you, I get asked this question a fair bit. I don't know that most of our customers spend a whole lot of time thinking about the correlation of prices and tax reform necessarily. So, I don't personally anticipate that being a significant issue either way, as it relates to this. But, certainly, again, overall, from our company's perspective, again, were that to happen, I think there's certainly some positive opportunities for us.","Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you, and congratulations, Bill.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Ryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. Just on the private label or brand penetration itself, if we think about it over the next three to five years within both Broadline and local, where do you think that ultimate penetration goal could go? And maybe in that context, when you guys are having your conversations with your suppliers, how are those discussions going these days? Do you feel like maybe you're able to receive some greater concessions out of them if they're not necessarily providing innovative or value-added product?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Chris, from a Sysco Brand perspective, as you know, we've continued to see this grow over the last couple of years and our total business is up 62 basis points and 82 basis points with our local customers. So, we continue to see opportunities there. And we get asked this often is how high is \u2013 could it go? And I don't think we really have a good view of that. And the reason I say that is what we continue to focus on is bringing very high quality products to the market at very competitive pricing. And I think as our customers continue to feel different impacts whether that's the cost of labor, wage rate increases or other challenges they might feel in their business, product costs' always going be there. And we bring them alternative solutions with Sysco Brand.","So, the other thing we've done \u2013 we've talked about is we've been focused on bringing innovative solutions and products with Sysco Brand to the market. And I think the combination of those things continues to be well-received by our customers and that's why we see these increases. So, I know that didn't answer you directly, but what I'd say is we continue to invest here. We feel good about it. I talked about this brand revitalization effort. We've been doing a lot of work around refreshing the look and the feel of those brands and making sure that they're on trend whether that's with fresh and local products or that's with the ripe (41:37) types of products, whether that be organic or wholesome type products. So, we \u2013 we're doing a lot of work in that area and it's \u2013 appears to be resonating nicely with our customers.","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","All right. And the last one for me very quickly in terms of ROIC in the quarter as you calculate with and without Brakes, what was then numbers for those?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, the number, I think, in aggregate was 12.3%, as an overall enterprise. Actually, Chris, off the top of my head, I don't have that number without Brakes.","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","That's okay. We can follow up. Thanks, guys.","(42:14)","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the U.S. Broadlines business. When you exclude inflation in case growth, it looks like there were some other negative pricing impact to U.S. Broadline sales growth. So, can you just give us a little bit more detail on this and was it related to an inability to pass through all the inflation or was it a decision by Sysco to get sharper on pricing or was it a more competitive environment? Just more color there would be great.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Hey, Marisa. I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to. I think we feel really good about the U.S. Broadline business and we talk about it in context here of our U.S. Foodservice Operations segment. And given we talked about some of the impacts of the storms on both volume and on gross profit dollars, and obviously the impacts on costs as well. So, I think when you think about everything that that business went through in this first quarter, we continue to feel very good about how we're managing it, including some pretty significant inflation in the quarter. So, I \u2013 the fact that we're basically flat on our gross margin given all those circumstances, we feel actually very good about that business.","Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. And then have you \u2013 are you at the point where you're getting any push back on the ability to pass inflation onto customers now that it's close to 4%?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Again, I'd say as we always talk, that's an average. So, category by category, sure, we run into some challenges from time to time and that's where we leverage things like Sysco Brand. And, candidly, we share a lot of information with our customers, so this isn't about just us moving our pricing. We share a lot of industry information with them, what's going on in the various categories and why the costs are going up from suppliers the way they are. So, it's \u2013 we're pretty transparent in that area and we try to spend a fair amount of time educating our own people so they can obviously educate our customers.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","And the only thing I'd say, Marisa \u2013 I mean, again, we had a \u2013 despite all those things, we still had a very strong local case growth as well. So, I mean, when we combine that with some of the \u2013 again, holding a flat margin during this time, I can overall \u2013 certainly, on a customer-by-customer basis, could there be some pushback? Sure. But I think overall we've done a good \u2013 really good job there.","Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then, just lastly, I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the sales performance of your non-restaurant customer and how you're thinking about sales and margin opportunities within that segment.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","When you say non-restaurant customers, are you just talking about other segments within...","Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Like hospitals. Well, it'd be like hospitals, schools, kind of the \u2013 some of the institutional customers.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","We feel good about them. I think that we continue \u2013 we're fortunate that we've got this broad segment that we operate in, our customer segments, and our mix is such that while restaurants certainly represent a big chunk of it, there are lots of other customer segments. As we've talked in the past, we see growth in areas like the foodservice management and also in the retail foodservice. So, I think the other segments continue to grow. Healthcare's always been a pretty good-sized segment for us and we are performing well there also. So, I think we feel great about the balance that exists across the segments. And I'd like to mention (45:47), other than making some decisions around certain multi-unit customers, we feel really good about where we are.","Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks so much and best of luck, Bill.","William J.

One quick housekeeping one. Could you give us an idea of what the blended interest rate on your debt was this quarter?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. Karen, we'll have to get back to you on that.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, looking at some of your commentary earlier about seeing strengths in brands that are familiar, convenient value, is that really a comment on maybe some strengths in fast food relative to casual dining as a category with what you're seeing in your customers?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","I think it's commentary not necessarily on fast food but on independent restaurants and what we continue to believe is why they are positioned well to grow. And so, there are, obviously, more flexible menus, more ease of creating the right environment for consumers. And so, it has more to do with just acknowledging that there are lots of things still happening in that restaurant space and these newer concepts, whether they're independent or small multi-unit chains, they are continuing to see growth because they are bringing the kind of things that consumers are looking for to the market.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then one other quick housekeeping. Are there any calendar shifts we should be thinking about into the next quarter with Christmas switching \u2013 moving off of the weekend? And then also, I think you lose New Year's Eve compared to last year?","Joel T.

First, Bill, congrats on your career.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thanks, Andy.","Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC","And best of luck with everything. You're very welcome.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC","So, I think, Tom, in your introductory comments, it sounded like ex hurricane, the U.S. business accelerated a little on the case side and was a little better on the gross margin side. So first, just to kind of check that, if you take the markets that were not impacted by the hurricanes, was case growth in fact \u2013 the local case growth, over 3%?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Yes. In many cases it was.","Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay. But in total \u2013 I mean, I'm just trying to get some \u2013 because, obviously, estimates are one thing and then there's other ways to sort of get...","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Well. (48:38)","Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC","I guess, another way I want to ask it is \u2013 and it's sort of related so, is \u2013 how are these hurricane markets doing post hurricane? There's a lot of different theories, some is people are pent up and they want to go out to eat. Others is businesses are closed, people are moving. Are those markets normalizing? And are they running decently?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. I would say, ex a couple of key geographies, right? So whether it's here in the southeast where there are restaurants that are still closed or in parts of Florida like the Keys, where things are \u2013 many things are still closed. Much of the market is starting to get back to a normalized state. So, I would say yes, in general.","Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And related to that, the math, if you just take the math of what you said, it looked like the $10 million hurricane impact to the operating profits really came out of the case side and the gross profits. But it also sounded like, from what, Joel, some of your commentary, it might have also been in the OpEx side which I also would have expected. So, could you talk a little about that $10 million? Is it a, kind of, a hard estimate or how did you get to that?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Well, so look, it's a fairly \u2013 I get it. It's high level. It's ball park. It's directional. I \u2013 it's, I think, again reasonably, and accurate, I think it is \u2013 yeah, we looked at it mostly all along the lines of what you said, from a volume and gross profit impact. Certainly from a productivity impact, again, as we described it earlier, it's interesting, I mean (50:14) our costs to some extent didn't go up, if you want to call it that. Because we had \u2013 we're paying people, whether it's drivers, whether it's administrative people, we're paying them, irregardless of whether we're shipping cases or not. And so, I would say, in general, from a productivity standpoint on a per case basis, we actually had some impact there. But I \u2013 so again, it's \u2013 again, Andy, it's not an exact science but we certainly got what we thought was a pretty reasonable view of it. And what we quantified was mostly on the gross profit piece of that. And probably, maybe a little conservative on our part but we thought it was a reasonable view of what happened.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","And, Andy, that was all based on case...","Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Got it.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","All based on case volume, right. We didn't project any impact on a rate basis from gross profit per case. We just looked at purely at cases. And you asked about the 3%, we think that's a fairly conservative estimate, given what our run rates were in those markets.","Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you. And just wanted to follow up on Brakes, and my last question is \u2013 just like, as you look \u2013 Joel, you mentioned you're reconciling or harmonizing the fiscal years, and that obviously has some tweaks to it. But is most of the slowing from just what's going on there with the cost inflation and consumer \u2013 fundamentals side, with what's going on in the UK? Or how would you portion it, between timing reconciliations and a little fundamental slowing, or some fundamental slowing?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I'll start and Tom can chime in. I'd say, Andy, it's really some of both. Again, I think what I would say to you is that some of the timing issue is going to become more accelerated in the second quarter, which is why we're calling that out. Which again, will then rebound to some extent, in the second half of the year. But I would say for this particular quarter, it was some of both.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","I don't have anything really incremental to add. I mentioned earlier some of the other impacts from \u2013 as you mentioned, from inflation and some of the macros in the UK.","Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Could you talk a little about the rationale for the recent deals off mainland U.S.? You gave some details on HFM, but how do you think about this deal and the completion of the Costa Rica stake versus opportunities that would be, kind of, more in and around your core or existing infrastructure?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Let me \u2013 I'll talk about those two, and then I'll let Joel embellish on kind of our broader strategy there. The \u2013 let's start with the Mayca in Costa Rica. So, as I mentioned, that was a business that we went into a joint venture with back in 2014. We feel great about the partnership we've had with the folks at Mayca. And as I shared, the results have been very positive over the last couple of years. So we exercised our option to basically acquire that business completely recently. And so, that's an example of where we started down a path with a partner and liked the way it progressed, them leveraging what they could from Sysco, and obviously them doing a great job in their marketplace.","Separate that from HFM, which is just an outright acquisition and a market within the U.S. that's been white space for us. Other than some export business into Hawaii, we don't really have much of a footprint. We'd have no footprint there, and we didn't really do a lot of business there, so it's a white space opportunity that we're very excited about. They're a terrific distributor with businesses on a lot of the islands, and are really excited about what we can do together in Hawaii. As far as other types of acquisition, I'll let Joel talk a little bit about how we think about it and where you might see us focusing.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. I think the way I would characterize it, I mean, it's a little bit coincidental, I would say, in terms of timing, that we had two acquisitions we announced that were both on islands here. But I think in general, I would tell you that our overall strategy around M&A, it's \u2013 those are both very consistent with that. We're very \u2013 continue to be very focused on opportunities within our own domestic and core markets, or areas that might supplement our existing businesses, as well as geographic expansion.","And so, I would just say, again, the timing probably a little coincidental on those two things, but our acquisition strategy has remained very consistent. And those two deals are very much a part of our overall strategy.","William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. That's it for me.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, good morning. Just a question and some clarification here, on how the local case volume trends were during the quarter in the markets that weren't impacted by the hurricanes? Did those accelerate throughout the quarter?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Shane, did they accelerate? So, I mean, when you think about this, we're \u2013 we break our U.S. out into six markets. And so, as you guys know, I mean, different things drive the business in different markets, not the least which is overall population growth, economic impact. So, what \u2013 as we said earlier, we saw good growth outside of those other markets, generally speaking, in the U.S. And so, we feel pretty comfortable with the numbers we've shared regarding the impacts due to the hurricane in primarily what we call in our South and Southeast markets.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And how are case volumes trending 2Q to date?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","We continue to feel very good about the growth that we've had in the \u2013 both local, and as I mentioned, change in multi-unit.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. And just had a question on the \u2013 you guys called out some challenging inbound freight environment. Could you just give a little bit of color on kind of what changed there during the quarter, and what you guys are doing to mitigate these headwinds?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I would just \u2013 I'll take that. It's Joel. And I would just say in general, the way to think about it is that there's been some level of shortage of drivers in inbound freight, and that's something that was happening somewhat prior to the hurricane, and then that got accelerated by the bad weather. So, lots more sheetrock being moved, and I would say carriers are taking the opportunity to move more expensive loads, and that doesn't always necessarily \u2013 that pinches supply on our side.","And so, that was something \u2013 again, at the end of the day, our product costs is basically the cost of our products plus the costs of inbound freight. There's some increases there from an inbound freight perspective and, certainly, that's something, as we move forward, continue to find ways to mitigate that \u2013 it's continued somewhat here and as we moved into this quarter.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then congratulations, Bill. That's it for me. Thanks.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Bill, I also wanted to say congratulations and wish you good luck in your retirement.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Ajay.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Now that you've anniversaried Brakes, would it be possible to break out the actual currency impact, both in terms of revenues and operating profit? Maybe you already mentioned that earlier and I might have missed it, but it would be nice to get a sense of the actual operating performance in International after stripping out the currency impact, especially for the markets that Brakes operates in. So, if you can comment on case trends for International and also the overall currency impact, that would be great. I'm assuming that you can track those things a lot more easily now that you've cycled Brakes.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yes, so Ajay, again, so the breaking out specifically \u2013 again, we're \u2013 we don't \u2013 we don't typically do that. What \u2013 here's what color I would give you, though. I mean, and actually general, the impact of foreign exchange overall for us has been relatively negligible for this quarter. So, there is \u2013 some of this stuff we've talked about that Tom referred to in terms of the weakness of the sterling really has played itself out in the selling margins. Because there's a fairly sizable percentage of products that the UK, or that are bought outside the UK, which has impacted the selling margins, but if you actually look at the overall impact of foreign exchange \u2013 again, the U.S. dollar's been somewhat weaker out there, the Canadian dollar, as well as the euro. Then there has been some impact where the sterling has continued to weaken. But \u2013 yet overall, on the top line and certainly on our operating income line, there's been a relatively minimal impact overall on foreign exchange. More on the top than overall, but again, not much on our operating income line when you aggregate everything.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. So, going forward should we infer that you're not going be breaking out the currency impact based on the year-over-year comparisons?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Well, I guess, I would say in this particular case, it's \u2013 it was not significant and we didn't do it. If it's something really significant, we'll probably break it out.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. And just one follow-up in terms of the U.S. local case growth, you've had a pretty impressive run now in terms of local case volume. So, over the past couple of years since the start of your three-year growth plan, has there been any noticeable shift in terms of where that volume is coming from at this point? Are you selling more cases to existing customers or is the local case growth coming more from new business? I'm sure you'll probably say it's a little of both, but if you can comment, that would be great.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Sure. And it is obviously both. We track both penetration which means more sales to existing customers as well as new lost business. And I would say in each of those areas, they've continued to grow. In Foodservice and generally, new business is very important because there are a fair amount of customers each year that cycle for various reasons. And so, I'd \u2013 it's a pretty good balance actually of both though. And I'd say the thing for us that we've really tried to focus on is penetration because we believe that the more products and service that we can provide a customer, obviously, that also provides more \u2013 what we call maybe stickiness or loyalty from those customers. You heard me talk in the past about loyalty and we continue to have a positive trend in our loyalty metrics, including about a 3-point improvement in the first quarter. So, we feel good about what we're hearing from our customers as far as what we're providing them.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I think at this point my question is limited to some comments that Tom made in, I think, his prepared remarks around not just the move towards healthy, local, organic in terms of consumer preferences which is pretty easily understood. But also the comment around convenience, low cost, and familiarity. I interpreted that either in terms of traditional fast food which is obviously done very well over this cycle, but it could also mean things that aren't necessarily restaurants, like convenience stores or maybe other types of Foodservice operations that are more hybrid in terms of what their approach is. So, could you elaborate on that sub segment and how big of an opportunity that is relative to the business that you're currently serving?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Sure. First of all, I think you articulated it actually pretty well. And so, I think that that's \u2013 it was good to hear that what we said is \u2013 was translated, I guess, by you in the right way. I think, there's some of this is certainly the retail segment that we've talked about. We do see it continuing to grow. But the other segment that we all know is growing is this \u2013 kind of think about as prepared meals and this ability to get your \u2013 whatever your favorite restaurant is delivered to you now versus having to either go there to dine in or even to go pick it up. And we continue to see that movement happening. And there are lots of different folks getting into that space now in these prepared foods that are both retail, but also in many cases in foodservice outlets that are handling that. And so I think the more those folks continue to grow, that just provides more opportunities for our customers to grow and for consumers to get access to things that they like and enjoy. And so, that's really \u2013 is what we were trying to refer to there.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, that sounds more independent restaurants and chains or maybe that also includes some smaller chains in that segment? And are you alluding to meal kits as well? Or is that a different segment than what you want to be doing?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Yes to your first part of your question and comment. And as far as meal kits, yeah, it's part of it. It's a fairly small segment and while I think it's still got some growth in it, as we've all seen, there's a lot of movement going on in that space right now. I think what we're seeing, though, is there are \u2013 think about it, instead of someone like a Blue Apron where you're having to get something shipped to you, there are local outlets that are accomplishing that same type of solution for customers or for consumers on a local level, whether that be an independent or a chain who are providing that same type of service.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","William J.

[Operator Instructions].","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Ben\u00e9.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, Sysco announced that we concluded fiscal year 2018 with a strong quarter that ultimately translated into a successful year. Fiscal 2018 was also the final year of our three year plan and I'm excited to share that we exceeded the various metrics that we initially outlined during our Investor Day back in September of 2015.","Many of you will recall that when we initially announced this three year plan, we had three targeted objectives we wanted to achieve. The first was to improve the customer experience of doing business with Sysco through enhanced service levels, improve sales retention and higher customer loyalty. The second was to enhance associate engagement through improved workplace safety and associate retention by providing attractive career growth opportunities for our associates. The third was to achieve our financial goals of growing adjusted operating income by at least $400 million, which we raised twice since then, ultimately to the high end of a $650 million to -- $600 million to $650 million range while targeting an adjusted return on invested capital of 15%, all of these excluding the impact of the Brakes acquisition.","Specifically, for our financial goals, we had three key levers that would help achieve those metrics: Grow gross profit through accelerated local case growth and gross margin expansion, leverage supply chain costs and reduce administrative expense. I'm proud to report that our team was able to successfully execute on all of these objectives, which has translated into steadily improving financial results over the past three years.","At the conclusion of the three year plan, local case growth was 3%. Gross profit dollar growth outpaced operating expense growth, creating operating leverage of 2 points, and we delivered $665 million of incremental adjusted operating income, excluding Brakes and based on a comparison of fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015. Additionally, we grew EPS faster than operating income and we surpassed both our adjusted return on invested capital and working capital targets.","We achieved these goals by staying focused on our customer-centric vision and driving consistent execution at the operating level. Our objective to improve the overall customer experience has been a core element to our success over the past few years and will continue to be a key focus for us as we move forward. As we described at our Investor Day in December of last year, we continue to build on the momentum we've achieved against our strategic objectives, and we'll strive to accelerate our current growth guided by four strategic priorities: First, enriching the customer experience of doing business with Sysco; second, delivering operational excellence in everything we do; third, optimizing the business, what we like to call The Sysco Way; and finally, activating the power of our people.","The overall macroeconomic trends continue to be positive in the United States and the underlying economic picture remains encouraging, including a strong employment market. This has resulted in a healthy consumer that is driving a positive trend in restaurant sales. We also see continued growth at local customers as they increase their reach through flexible menus, innovative concepts, and additional delivery options to reach consumers. Looking at our results for the year, sales grew 6.1% to $58.7 billion driven by strong growth with local customers, the addition of some new customers which helped accelerate our national customer growth, a few key acquisitions, and continued product cost inflation.","We continue to be focused on M&A activity as a part of our strategy and also closed several acquisitions during the year, including HFM in Hawaii, Doerle Food Service in Louisiana, Kent Frozen Foods in the U.K., a small transaction in Sweden as well as acquiring the remaining 50% interest in Mayca, our Costa Rican partner. For the year, local case growth for our U.S. Broadline business was 3.6%. It was the strongest in the fourth quarter at 5%. Overall gross profit grew 5%, driven by a few key factors: First, the acceleration of local cases to improve processes and training of our marketing associates and continued growth in our digital platform; second, the growth of Sysco Brand, which now comprises nearly 46% of U.S. Broadline local cases; third, Cutting Edge Solutions, our product innovation platform, which features our exclusive product offerings has now delivered 1 million cases of new on-trend innovative products to our customers; fourth, the continued success in category management as we continue to introduce new categories to capture value; and finally, effective ongoing management of product cost inflation using our suite of revenue management tools. These positive results were partially offset by continued challenges from inbound freight costs driven by overall industry factors such as driver shortages and adjusting to electronic regulation of hours driven.","From an expense perspective, adjusted operating expense for the year grew 4%, driven by ongoing strategic investments in the business and a few operational challenges that impacted the year. Some of those investments included supply chain transformation work occurring in the U.K., the investment in marketing associates in the U.S. and the continued investment in technology solutions that will translate into a more enriching experience for our customers.","Overall, we delivered adjusted operating income growth of 8.4% to $2.5 billion. With the addition of tax benefits, EPS growth was meaningfully higher than the prior year as adjusted EPS grew 26.6% to $3.14. The operational improvement in our business is a direct result of the hard work and effort of our 67,000-plus associates who executed our business strategy that is predicated on disciplined, profitable, and sustainable growth.","Transitioning now to our annual results by business segment, beginning with U.S. Foodservice operations. Sales grew 5.4% for the year, gross profit grew 4.6%, adjusted operating expenses grew 4.7%, and adjusted operating income grew 4.3%. Top line results were strong as local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business was 3.6%, including the acquisition of HFM and Doerle Food Service. Organic local case growth was 2.8% and has now grown for 17 consecutive quarters. Total case growth was 2.9%, of which 2.1% was organic. The solid case growth performance translated into healthy gross profit dollar growth of 4.6%, driven by a combination of customer mix, product mix, and inflation. Additionally, the previously mentioned growth in Sysco Brand also contributed positively to the gross profit dollar growth.","Turning our attention to cost. Our adjusted operating expense growth for the year was 4.7%, driven by rising fuel costs and increased supply chain costs in both the warehouse and transportation. These costs were largely due to a combination of a tight labor market, weather impacts throughout the year, and ramp-up costs for new business. Additionally, we had ongoing investments in our selling organization to better penetrate underdeveloped markets.","Moving on to International Foodservice Operations. Sales grew 8.5%, gross profit grew 7.1%, adjusted operating expenses grew 9.7%, and adjusted operating income declined 7.7%. Top line growth was strong for the year across all our international businesses. Our business in Mexico added a new national customer, and Canada performed well as we implemented strategic investments from our -- initiatives from our U.S. business, which led to accelerated local case growth for the year. However, in the U.K., we continue to experience acute product inflation in the mid-to-high single digits.","From a cost perspective, we continue to make investments across Europe. The supply chain transformation work in the U.K. to transition from a single temperature warehousing fleet into a multi-temperature network is progressing well and we feel good about the progress that has been achieved. We are also making good progress on the integration of Brake France and Davigel to create Sysco France and are excited about the new capabilities and the unique multi-temperature service that will better adapt to our customers' growing needs. Additionally, the integration of Pallas Foods and Brakes in Ireland is nearly complete and we've achieved good cost synergies throughout the year. We are also making technology investments to improve the infrastructure and to enhance our suite of customer-facing tools. And finally, in Mexico, we absorbed the cost of adding a new large customer during the year.","The overall decline in adjusted operating income is a direct result of the strategic investments we are making in the International segment along with the impact of foreign exchange currency translation. We continue to focus on executing against our long-term plans by investing in necessary capabilities across the International business and by leveraging our position as a platform for future growth.","And finally, SYGMA showed continued top line growth during the year with sales up 6.1%, driven by inflation, along with fees growth of nearly 3%. However, the business continues to struggle with operating expenses related to increased transportation costs and a reduction in backhaul revenue due to driver availability.","I'd now like to briefly discuss the announcement that will be coming out later today. Today, we're announcing our 2025 corporate social responsibility goals. These newly defined goals set a clear path for the future and demonstrate Sysco's continued commitment to care for people, supply products responsibly and protect the planet. We believe it is our responsibility to operate in a manner that meets the needs of our customers today while producing positive lasting change. We are leading our industry with our CSR initiatives and by including specific long-term goals that align with our strategic business priorities, we're living our vision of becoming our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.","In summary, we are excited about the results achieved in fiscal 2018 towards our three year plan and are encouraged by the solid fundamentals across our business, specifically the top line growth trajectory we're on, while continuing to be able to invest in our future. Our success is a direct result of the dedication and hard work of our associates executing on our strategic priorities.","As a reminder, fiscal 2018 is an overlap year in that it was the final year of our initial three year plan and the first year of our new three year plan. We are pleased with the results for the year and remain confident in our ability to deliver the financial objectives associated with our new three year plan that we described in our December Investor Day.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Joel Grade","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned earlier, we are excited about our performance in achieving our initial three year plan and pleased with the results for both the fourth quarter and the full year. This morning, I'll start with our quarterly results. Sales and gross profit growth were strong at 6.2% and 5.7%, respectively, as we saw positive impacts from overall and local case growth, continued Sysco Brand growth and a benefit from inflation and foreign exchange. Adjusted operating expense growth was 2.5%, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 15.7% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.94. In addition, we continue to generate meaningful free cash flow as we achieved $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2018.","For the fourth quarter, we saw a foreign exchange benefit to sales of approximately 1%. Sysco also experienced inflation in our U.S. Broadline business of 1.1%, driven by a few categories, including dairy, frozen potatoes and vegetables and paper disposables, partly offset by deflation in poultry. Within our International business, inflation was driven by a combination of both product costs increasing and currency translation in the U.K. During the quarter, we had gross profit growth of 5.7% driven by overall and local volume growth and improved Sysco Brand penetration. Adjusted operating expenses grew 2.5% for the quarter. The increase in expense was largely driven by supply chain costs in both warehouse and transportation, which were mostly related to increased fuel costs and a tighter labor market and the previously announced investment in our selling organization in our U.S. operations. ","Additionally, we continue to make investments in transformation and integration in our International business. These costs were partly offset by favorable comparison in corporate expense versus the prior year that we previously mentioned. As a result, we saw a gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth of 320 basis points this quarter. And while we don't expect to see that trend to continue, we do expect our three year plan gap to be approximately 150 basis points.","As it relates to taxes, our net earnings for the fiscal year were impacted by lower tax rates from U.S. Tax Reform where our U.S. federal rates went from 35% to 28%. Other favorable impacts include additional credits and tax benefits from stock option exercises. Cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion for fiscal year 2018. Net CapEx for fiscal year 2018 was $666 million or about 1.1% of sales, which was $3 million higher than last year. Free cash flow for fiscal year 2018 was $1.5 billion, which was $83.6 million lower compared to last year, primarily due to a pension plan contribution we discussed last quarter.","As Tom mentioned earlier, we also achieved results that exceeded our original three year plan targets, excluding any impact of Brakes. This includes an adjusted return on invested capital, excluding Brakes, of 20.2% and our working capital improvement was 5 days or 1 day better than the original target.","Now, I'd like to close with some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2019. As Tom mentioned, fiscal 2018 was the first year of our current three year plan concluding in fiscal 2020. For this current plan, we continue to feel confident in our ability to achieve our goal of $650 million to $700 million of operating income improvement. The inflationary environment has abated throughout the year and while we can't predict the impact that macroeconomic factors will play in the cost of our products, we believe modest levels of inflation will likely continue for at least the next few quarters. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 1.2% to 1.3% of sales. And from a cash perspective, as we previously stated, our U.S. federal tax rate will drop to 21%. With the addition of state and local jurisdictions, we expect our overall effective tax rate to be approximately 25%, similar to the rate for this year due to some tax benefits that occurred in fiscal 2018 that we anticipate will not fully repeat in fiscal 2019.","In summary, we've had a very strong performance over the past three years and the fundamentals of our business remained solid. We are excited about the future as we kick off fiscal 2019. We expect to deliver continued strong top line fundamentals and improved cost management, building on the momentum from the prior three years. Our strategic priorities of enriching the customer experience, delivering operational excellence, optimizing the business and activating the power of our people will accelerate our current growth and position us well for future success.","Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo.","Edward Kelly","Tom and Joel, I want to start really with gross profit and gross profit per case. The per case result this quarter was a little bit weaker, I guess, than really kind of what we've seen in some time, although there was, it seems like, more M&A benefit this quarter than what we've had. You have a harder comparison there. I was just wondering, is there any real change in the underlying rate of profit per case growth? Or are there -- does this more relate to one-off issues? And I know freight plays a role within all this, so if you could help out with all, that will be great.","Joel Grade","Sure, Ed. I'll start. And I think the answer to that is there really is no, what I'd call, fundamental changes in our view of that. I think you've hit on a couple of the points. I mean, certainly our contract growth was again a bit higher this quarter as well as the freight certainly has still continued to have an impact. And again, we certainly anticipate that continuing, but in terms of any other fundamental impact to that, Ed, I -- there's really none I would call out there.","Edward Kelly","And just as it relates to freight, there's been talk about incremental freight challenges from one of your largest competitors. Can you just maybe talk about what you're seeing in regards to getting product from vendors on a timely basis, filling open driver positions? Any disruption that you are seeing related to any of this or how you're mitigating it? Is it reflected in the top line at all? I mean, it doesn't seem like and maybe you're actually benefiting, but just some help there would be great.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Yes. Good morning. This is Tom. Look, we've been talking about this for a few quarters now. I mean, the freight challenges out there are real. I think that every industry who's moving freight is dealing with them. And so what I'd say is -- and I think we went all the way back to our probably second quarter when we first started feeling the impacts of this. We struggled a little bit early on, making sure we were getting our lanes filled. We were getting our service levels from our suppliers where we needed them. We started a very aggressive approach back then and continued on through our third and fourth quarter, trying to really make sure we get the right relationships in place with carriers. We've got the right plans in place with our suppliers so that we don't have the type of service issues that one could expect or might expect in dealing with this situation.","So I think we've done a lot of work as a team to mitigate that as much as we can. That doesn't mean we don't have some of the cost impacts because we got to get the freight there. In some cases, we're still having to go to spot market. We're still having to pay higher rates than we were a year ago, but from a service level perspective, I don't think we're having nearly the challenges that maybe some others have talked about.","What I'd say as it relates to our own drivers and more on the outbound side, we do have challenges filling driver roles in certain markets where the labor market's just very tight. We see regularly drivers being offered significant upfront incentives to join a company. We're having to do some of that same type of thing. So there -- it is very real that there's a tight market out there for drivers and we're experiencing some of that just like everyone else is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville from Jefferies.","Christopher Mandeville","Tom, on the case growth acceleration, trends improved really quite nicely on both the one and three year. What would you attribute that to? In terms of influence, how would you rank things? Was it similar to what you outlined on gross profit dollar growth? And have you seen some momentum that was observed in Q4 in 2019 thus far?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Chris, yes. So regarding case growth, I'd say really a continuation of a lot of things we\u2019ve talked about, but certainly, e-commerce, as it does grow, we're now at about 50%. We have seen some improved penetration with customers who are buying on the e-commerce site, so that's certainly helping. But I would say the additional MAs that we added in the year and we've talked a bit about that as well as the training programs we now have and the way we can get our MAs up to a rate of productivity a little faster maybe then we've historically been able to would be maybe another driver.","We talked a lot about our focus in this area. And I think it really is about, one, applying the resources in the places where the biggest opportunities exist. That's some work we've been doing now for a while. And then additionally, making sure that they've got access to the right resources, whether that's specialists to help them grow the parts of their business where maybe we're underdeveloped or even accelerating our business review process we've talked to you all a fair amount about. So it really is a lot of the same fundamental things, but I think as we -- all those things start to come together, we see that acceleration there.","I also mentioned and I think this is true that, that independent customer continues to be kind of well-positioned. And we're seeing that work out for us, too.","Christopher Mandeville","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Joel, just for the three year plan into 2020. This past year that you just completed, you were just shy about 8.5% EBIT growth. Can you just provide some color on how we should think about progression for fiscal '19 that need to show a little element of acceleration in the growth rate? And then what may be the primary drivers are that we should be thinking about for the coming year?","Joel Grade","Sure. So I think one of the things that we've spent a fair bit of time talking about is the idea that, to some extent, FY '18 was certainly a strong finish to the last, but it was also an investment year. We talked about the fact that if you kind of rewound about 1.5 years ago, given the trajectory we're moving on, in the last three year plan, we got a lot of questions on, \"Hey, do we -- are we actually extrapolating that out to an even stronger end of the three year plan than we even ended up?\" And part of the reason we continued to emphasize that the high end of the range that we were -- had talked about was just the fact that we continue to -- we do have some investments in our business we're planning to make that we anticipate will continue to benefit here over the next three year plan and then certainly beyond. So I would just look at '18 somewhat -- and again, it was something that we had a view of and then talked about of some investments that we've made that we called out in our sales force, in our International business in terms of some of the transformation work from technology, from the integration of the merger from the supply chain in the U.K. And so I think I would look at it that way.","And so -- and as we move forward, obviously, the main impact this year that I would say we anticipate accelerating over the course of the three year plan is really somewhere around this gap between gross profit and operating expenses. This year came in at a gap about 1% and, again, much of that was related to some of the investment that we talked about. And so I would anticipate, as we move forward a -- as we called out earlier in the call today, a 1.5% gap as we go through that three year plan and certainly that means, from an expense perspective, probably some improvement there as we move into that three year plan.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Chris, the only thing I'll add is, I mean, I think what you should take away is we're committed to that three year plan number that we talked about last December. And so as Joel just said, there's some things we need to accelerate and improve on in '19 and '20 and we feel comfortable we can do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judah Frommer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Judah Frommer","Maybe just to follow-up on some of the questions so far. So for the three year plan going forward with that 1.5% gap between gross profit dollars and OpEx dollars, how should we think about the flattish gross profit per case in the U.S. in Q4 and extrapolating that forward versus the control you have on operating expense and your ability to leverage that line?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","So Judah, I think, let me just start and I'll let Joel jump in. I mean, when you say flattish gross profit, we are on our kind of gross profit or actually above our gross profit target for the three year plan. So I think we feel good about our ability to deliver the gross profit growth. And obviously, if we can get some help from what's happening with products and inflation, we might -- we feel comfortable we can get there. I think you're raising the point that Joel was just referring to, which is the cost side. We need to continue to focus on the cost to make sure that we can, in fact, keep that 1.5-point gap that we have alluded to over this three year plan. And we've got some work to do there, but I think we feel good about our ability to get there.","Joel Grade","Yes. And again, Judah, just I think the question that you made actually was on the gross profit per case and, again, that's -- as I mentioned earlier, I mean, I don't know that any -- there's a bit of a flattening out at this particular this quarter. Again, I'm not overly concerned about that on a long-term basis. And as Tom said earlier, we certainly feel very good about the -- about our outlook for our three year plan moving forward.","Judah Frommer","Okay. Great. If I could sneak one more in on that national competitor Ed mentioned. So beyond the freight implications, clearly they struggled in this calendar second quarter. Is there anything you'd call out in terms of a benefit from their struggles on cases or kind of business as usual?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","No. I'd say, look, you guys know, we talk about this pretty often. It's very competitive out there. It remains very competitive. I wouldn't say that -- anything that they talked about was necessarily a similar impact for us. And I'm not necessarily sure we, in any way, benefited by the challenges they were facing. So I think it's pretty much we see the same competitive environment we've always operated in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays.","Karen Short","Just a couple of questions. And in terms of -- I'm going to ask the case growth a little bit differently or the gross profit growth question a little differently. So your case growth was up 5.3% and gross profit was up kind of 5.2%, which is definitely the narrowest gap we've seen in a long time so -- I mean, looking back 8 quarters kind of thing. So is it really just a function of freight or is there anything else you could point to?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","We talked about there are a couple of things driving that. So if you think about the freight impact for sure on the inbound side; the customer mix, which as Joel talked about earlier, the fact that we had more growth in our national customers or our contract business; and then product mix also comes into play there some so which products are inflating versus not. So I'd say those 3 things and combined probably affect that, but we still feel really good about those numbers. And we're able to basically hold our margin flat given everything else that's going on. We feel actually really good about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk from RBC.","William Kirk","So in the quarter, your expense control in that final period of the first three year plan, it was very strong. So can you help us better understand those year-over-year improvements? And how do you make sure you aren't cutting resources that may be needed somewhere in the future?","Joel Grade","Sure, this is Joel. So I think a couple of points on that. I mean, number one, as we've headed into this quarter, one of the things that we've given a heads-up to people on is the fact that we anticipated this quarter being in -- this sort of this gap being very strong as it relates to last year due to some things that were in last year's expenses, particularly on the corporate side, that were not in this year. And so -- and we also, I think, made a point today of making sure to point out that, look, this -- obviously, the 3 points -- the 320 basis point gap is extremely strong. That's not something I would look at as a long-term trend, but really settling in around over time, again, this long-term view of 1.5 points between GP and OpEx.","And so I -- this is not a matter of somehow doing something that is a onetime expense cut that hit that. It's simply something we anticipated coming. We've continued to improve, again, our management of our expenses. We had a strong year in general in our corporate expenses and so that was something that, over the course of the year, certainly helped us manage the gap that we had and, again, make some of those savings and investing them in our operations as we've talked about throughout the year. But in no way, shape or form should you interpret the strength of what happened in this fourth quarter as somehow anything that was a management or resource that's going to impact us negatively moving forward.","William Kirk","Got it. And on the inflation commentary, I think you said you expect a little or a modest inflation for the next few quarters. Do you expect something different after those next few quarters or that's just the time frame you're comfortable commenting on?","Joel Grade","Yes. I would say that's typically how we comment on these things. Obviously, much beyond that is not really any basis on anything and wouldn't be responsible in our part so that's just our typical comfort of how we look forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","Wanted to just go back to the sales force investments. Could you just kind of give us an update? I know you said kind of part of the solid case growth this quarter was due to that, but kind of where are we, what inning in terms of the low investment? And then just any color you can give us in terms of productivity, what may be the newer class of folks versus years past are looking like? And I know you said kind of e-commerce around 50%. I'm guessing that's the local restaurant cases. I feel like not too long ago it was 40%. So kind of where are some of the better productivity tests going toward, that would be helpful.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Sure, Vinnie. I'd say you actually hit on a few of the things yourself, which is e-commerce has continued to grow. As you said, we're at 50% now and which has been kind of an ongoing move. As we talked a lot about how we think about e-commerce, it's really been this customer choice platform. And so we -- the good news is we're seeing more and more customers wanting to migrate to e-commerce.","And so the other big thing with our sales force, and so we go back to the MAs. We talked through the last couple of quarters that we've added marketing associates. And we're kind of at that point now. I wouldn't say we're necessarily adding more, but we still have some of the expenses associated with those new marketing associates in our numbers. When I think about getting those more -- those marketing associates more productive, what we're really talking about is how do we get them into a territory where they're actually delivering results. And I think the training programs we now have, the way we bring them on board and the type of more focused effort we got around that is really helping us get them into a territory starting to produce, if you will, on a much quicker basis. We used to talk about that would take 18 months to two years to get someone up to speed and we're -- we've cut that in about half now. We believe that, that is certainly something that we're going to continue to get better at.","Part of what helps drive that is the support resources we give them as we try to move them from being order takers to more consultative sellers. And I think we've made really good progress there as well. And our people -- so our people's capability is growing. Therefore, how they're investing their time is getting better. And that's translating into not only larger territories, but more importantly, more effective and productive selling resources.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay. Super helpful. And if I could just slide one other one in here. Just turning to International for a second. Granted, I kind of knew the currency translation and inflation, all that was continuing to be a part. Just more on the kind of what's more under your guys' control with the temperature zones and more of the fundamental changes, where would you say we kind of are with some of those investments from an inning perspective?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Sure. I think we're still early days on a lot of those investments. Now, we kind of break up some of the countries in Europe. We talked about the Irish business where we had owned Pallas Foods for quite a few years now. That integration between Brakes and the Pallas business in Ireland has actually gone very well and I'd say in that place where we're close to the end of our full investment as well as benefits that are coming out of there. In the U.K. and France in particular, both those geographies, we still are kind of early days and are investing there to get these distribution businesses and the operating environment, we talked about our multi-temp, up to where we'd like it to be. The good news is, in both places, we think once we get there, that will be a competitive advantage for us, but we do have a few years ahead of us of investments and really bring that organization along to some of those changes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays.","Karen Short","My follow-up quick question would be on International, when we look at obviously the improvement throughout the year, as we look to '19, how should we think about the kind of run rate? Should we think about it as more related to the back half of this year or do you think you'll actually start getting to see a little bit more profitability?","Joel Grade","Yes. And so, again, I think you remember the -- some of the calendar challenges that we outlined in the beginning that actually had certainly a more positive second half than the first half of the year, but I would anticipate and think about that business more along the lines of what you saw in the second half. The first half was clearly impacted by a fairly negative calendar impact. And I think there's certainly an expectation that we continue to grow profits there. I think that's a more reasonable run rate to think about within second half of the year.","Karen Short","Okay. And then just to follow-up on inflation. I know you've talked about modest inflation. So is it -- is there a chance though, do you think, that we end up going back into deflation, I guess, in your fiscal '19? And then also thoughts on inflation, both from an FX perspective and just product cost in International?","Joel Grade","So in the U.S. Broadline, just to your first question, again, our current view is that we anticipate a modest level of inflation. So at this point, we're not seeing what you're suggesting in terms of deflation, but I would say a modest level of inflation. In the European, primarily in the U.K., again, depending on the variability of the sterling, we certainly still anticipate some challenges there given the fact that, I think as we talked about, probably half their product is procured from outside of the U.K. Obviously, they're working hard to do things to manage that more effectively, but that still continues to be an issue and we anticipate that to carry forward a bit.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Karen, just on that inflation in the U.S., it has gotten less throughout the year. So the beginning of the year, we talked it was a couple, 2 to 3 points. It has slowed to kind of 1 to 1.5. So it is slowing. We don't necessarily believe that's going to go deflationary, but you're right in assuming that it's mitigating some.","Joel Grade","Well, I think just one other comment on that. I mean, the categories, Tom mentioned earlier in his comments, it does matter in terms of the categories. And we have seen some deflation in some of the center of the plate categories, poultry are less inflation, I would say. And meat has been another one of those, as of late, we've seen some of that. So I think there's -- that gets back a little bit of the GP per case as well and -- but there's been some level of that, that we experienced.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets.","Andrew Wolf","I wanted to focus on the U.S. Foodservice and the big step-up in the organic case growth for the local customers. Could you kind of help allocate that? I know you hired -- you're hiring sales folks. How would you allocate that between the existing customers doing a little better because it looked like the restaurant sector picked up in the second quarter, account penetration and maybe your sales folks bringing in some new customers?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Andrew, I think it's a combination of all those things. We have seen -- which is good news -- we have seen our penetration, which is that same-store turn going up, which is good. That's some of the hardest growth to get, but we have seen penetration improve, which does speak, I think, positively around some of the trends we're seeing in the industry. And then obviously, we continue to focus on new customer growth and that's always an opportunity and certainly something that's the lifeblood of this business. So it's really a combination of both.","Andrew Wolf","And I don't know if I missed this, but could you give us a quantitative -- like, how much -- what is your growth rate in the sales force?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","We don't necessarily comment on the number of salespeople we've added, but again, we're much more targeted today than we were in the past and we feel good about how we approach the focused kind of resourcing that we do out in the market.","Andrew Wolf","And just one follow-up. Can you give us a sense of the cadence of the acceleration in the organic case growth and sort of sustainability and how's it going quarter towards to-date?","Joel Grade","Yes. So I'll take that. We're actually -- I think we've got also a decent start here in the first part of this year. So in other words, this wasn't some type of a onetime shot at the end of the year. We continue to see some good progress here in the first part of this year.","Andrew Wolf","Okay. So would that -- so the cadence was kind of moderately up and it's maintained or something along those lines?","Joel Grade","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America.","Marisa Sullivan","I just wanted to touch on gross margin outlook for fiscal 2019 and just kind of talk through some of the puts and takes. For freight, how should we think about your assumptions for freight if you start to lap the step-up post-hurricanes last year? Are you kind of assuming steady state? Are you assuming that it could potentially get better or worse? And then on customer mix, how should we think about the headwinds and tailwinds? You've brought on some new chain customers that I assume are lower gross margin. How much of a headwind would that be and what are some of the offsets?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Sure, Marisa. So I think the -- as you think about the freight, look, I think we do know we're going to start lapping some of that here in our second quarter. I think that based on that, we kind of think about that maybe flat to maybe up slightly. Again, hard to predict what's going to continue to happen in this space. And then as you think about customer mix, that obviously will continue to play a role until we cycle some of that new national customer business. But we look to -- continue to look at obviously category management as a way to offset some of that as well as our Sysco Brand, which we continue to be very focused on. So if you think about the combination of inflation, the work we're doing around category management in our Sysco Brand, our revenue management tools we talked about to help us manage through that inflation and even deflation, if it flips on us, we feel like -- we feel pretty good about our gross margin focus. We are not looking to see a step-up necessarily in gross margin on a percentage basis, but we aren't necessarily looking to see it go the other way either. We're just looking to manage it as best as possible in the new year.","Marisa Sullivan","Got it. Just as a follow-up on private label, you've obviously seen some nice growth in the penetration. How much more runway do you think there is for increasing private label penetration? Will it come more from the local customers or do you actually see some opportunities on the contract customer side?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","I think we see it actually on both. And there probably maybe even more opportunity on the contract side. I think there's work we still have to do there to create the environment that's easy for all those customers to participate more in Sysco Brand, but we still see an opportunity in the local customers as well. It's really a balance of making sure we're bringing out the right type of products. You heard me talk about the Cutting Edge Solutions and we're now at 1 million cases. A majority of those items are Sysco Brand items and we can continue to bring innovative solution-type products to the marketplace. We are seeing good traction there and we think that creates even more runway for us on the Sysco Brand.","Joel Grade","Yes. And Marisa, again, just as a reminder, that's -- we don't necessarily -- we don't set a target per se in terms of it, but we certainly do expect -- anticipate some continued runway there. And again, it's all driven by our ability to continue to drive value-added products in the marketplace. That creates a pull on our demand for those products and ultimately grows our percentages.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse","A couple of follow-ups to things that you've talked about already. First, on the International business, should we think of next year's year-over total investment dollars could still be going up or still high but maybe a step-down from this year?","Joel Grade","Karen, this is Joel. I would think about that as still having some level of increase next year.","Karen Holthouse","Great. And then just maybe remind us as we're looking into the third -- or the fiscal first quarter, any sort of things we should be keeping in mind in terms of laps related to hurricane disruptions last year, either on the case growth or the cost side?","Joel Grade","I don't know that I'd sort of overemphasize that. I mean, there may be a little bit of it, but I mean, the reality of it is, I mean, we managed our way through that pretty well. Again, over the last question, Marisa, on the freight, there's probably going to be a little bit of overlap when we saw some of that big impact in the second quarter, but in general, I -- we're not anticipating anything real significant there in terms of the overlap.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital.","Kelly Bania","Curious in terms of both freight and fuel prices. I guess, in the context of your performance this quarter and as you look out over the next few years and part of your three year plan, can you just help us understand the magnitude of the pressures from those factors? Are there items that are coming in better than you expected to offset those pressures? Or are you just maybe conservatively forecasting those areas with some cushion in order to still kind of beat or meet your targets?","Joel Grade","Well, I guess, I'll start. And I think the main way I'd think about that from a freight perspective, I mean, obviously the three year plan and there's a lot of puts and takes on a lot of these numbers. We certainly have committed to a level of growth in gross profit and OpEx in a relative basis and certainly feel good about the fact that we have -- again, feel strongly about achieving those numbers. In other words, some of the takes that we may have on fuel in terms of the freight from the gross profit area, we certainly anticipate strong results in growing our local cases and our brand, our category management, our revenue management. There's certainly all these things that we've factored into this whole thing, realizing not everything goes exactly how you think it's going to all the time, but feeling very good about that number.","On the fuel side, again, from a magnitude perspective, I mean, there's a couple of cents per case in fuel that have been impacting us here. But certainly, and as we've talked about, we've done a lot of work around some derivative hedges to make sure that we're giving ourselves some consistency, some stability around those numbers and that's certainly, if it's kind of on a rolling basis, a year ahead. And so I think that's certainly good -- at least 2\/3 of our fuel purchases are covered by some of that and so there's certainly some level of consistency we achieved through that.","So I guess, what I would say to you is, I mean, the -- we are -- one of our roles in running this company is there's a lot of puts and takes that go into some of this stuff and we certainly believe there's enough levers to pull in different places to -- that neither of those two things are going to have any dramatic impact to us as we look at our three year plan, but challenges nonetheless.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Kelly, the only thing I'd add on the operating expense side is with that fuel pressure that Joel talked about and this more our side now, the delivery driver, retention and hiring along with some just challenges we're seeing starting to see in that same way in the warehouse, we just have to be really good at driving productivity in our supply chain. And so those are real headwinds that we'll be dealing with. And what we're very focused on is how do we cover those through productivity improvements, whether that's in the way we -- our cases that we deliver per truck and per route and all the metrics that we really focus on to improve the overall productivity of our operation. So that's -- to Joel's point, we have a lot of that, that we try to build in. We've got a lot of work to do. And we probably have more headwinds than we've had in a few years, mostly driven by the tight labor market and some of the recent fuel increases.","Kelly Bania","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe, Joel, just one other one for you just in terms of the quarter, the operating income growth. If my math is correct, it seems to imply that the Brakes operating income was kind of flat year-over-year. Is that the right way to think about it for the quarter?","Joel Grade","I think it's roughly that. I think it's not the -- if you kind of back out all the FX impacts and on an adjusted basis, our whole International operation was up a little bit. And so I think Brakes was probably off a bit. I would not -- I'd call more down slightly than flat.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim.","John Heinbockel","Two things. On the selective, very surgical MA hiring that you did over the last year, were those predominantly experienced distribution foodservice salespeople? And, I guess, those investments have worked. Were those markets kind of one-off or is there opportunity to do the same thing very strategically in other markets and get a similar return?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","John, so I think there -- the approach we now have, I would tell you that there's opportunities in many markets. And some markets are bigger than others where we've got -- where our -- maybe our market position is a little stronger, but many markets have those opportunities. And as far as the type of individual we're hiring, I'd say it's a combination. We certainly are still finding folks who are looking to join Sysco who got experience either in the industry on our side kind of the industry or even on the operator side of the industry. And then we also, with our new program, have brought in some folks more earlier in their career and we now have a program, a development training program and onboarding program that allows us to do that. And so it's really a balance of -- we're looking for the best people in general, who we feel like would be successful working for Sysco.","John Heinbockel","Is the greatest impact of that -- of this hiring cycle, say the last, I don't know, 6, 9, 12 months, is that still ahead of us or we're at that run rate now?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","If you're talking about from a total number, we did a majority of that this last year or the year that we're in, right, that we're talking about. So there's little bit of an overhang as we go into '19. We continue to hire obviously. We have -- we turn up a bit of the sales force every year. So we're always in the market hiring and we're always going to look at putting those people where the biggest opportunities exist. And so you should think about it more as we're going to continue to use the tools we have now to deploy a selling organization in the right places. As we talked earlier, hopefully, continue to drive more productivity because of things like e-commerce and focusing them more on consultative selling versus order taking. But generally speaking, I wouldn't think about a further ramp-up of more MAs in fiscal year '19.","John Heinbockel","And then just lastly, the outbound driver shortage. Do you think -- has that had any adverse impact on top line over the past, whatever, six months, one year? Or is it really more throwing more cost and more dollars at the situation? And then what can you do as you think about giving drivers sort of an ability to do more? Is there any way to restructure how you load trucks, how you lay out the processes so that the existing drivers can actually do more out on the road?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","John, it's a really good question and an important point. I think -- if you think about one of the things we've talked about recently is we even got an initiative out there. We talked about small vehicle initiative. And part of the reason for that is there are really couple of drivers of it, not the least which is the fact that it enables us to get around with smaller drops to customers to increase our -- and improve our service level. But one of the things we're also learning is that because those trucks don't require a certain class driver, that we -- the pool of potential candidates to fill those routes is larger. And that's something that we're going to be accelerating in fiscal year '19 because we've gotten the learnings now and seen some of the benefits. So that's certainly one way that we're going to try to deal with this ongoing challenge.","And then additionally, you talked about -- look, anything we can do to move more effort into the warehouse and make it easier for that delivery driver to do his job not only creates satisfaction for them, but also helps us deliver and meet the service requirements of our customers. Ultimately, as you articulated, I think it had probably maybe a small impact in certain markets when we can't get the drivers that we need from a top line perspective, but more importantly, I think it's affecting our cost and it's why we've got to continue to look for new and different ways to manage that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain from Pivotal.","Ajay Jain","My question is more industry-specific. So even if it's not evident in your results, I'm just wondering if there's any industry-specific softness that might be impacting your competitors more than Sysco. So in terms of overall spending in independents, traffic and based on net unit growth for independents, are you seeing any change at all from an industry perspective as you're heading into fiscal '19?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Ajay, I actually think we see a lot of positive trends still in the industry. So I don't think we see really a lot of negative headwinds relating to industry performance. If you look at the quarter 2 for various parts of the industry that were fairly positive, certainly still some traffic challenges across some of the segments, but the spend was up very nicely. And so I think we continue to feel pretty good about it. The food-away-from-home, while growing less maybe than it did for a while, is still positive. And so we're seeing pretty good trends. And we think that not the least, which is like this delivery trend, you think about food delivery, the results we're hearing is they're seeing pretty significant growth, like 40% to 50% growth in that area. So that just creates more opportunities for consumers to get the products they want from restaurants. So we're seeing a lot of positives.","Ajay Jain","Okay. And obviously, you finished the three year growth plan on a high note. And I think, Tom, you mentioned in the prepared comments that, that figure excludes Brakes. So if that's the case, I estimate you did something like $105 million of operating income growth in Q4 alone. That's 3x more than the prior quarter. So does that sound right? I think you were at $526 million through Q3.","Joel Grade","Yes, Ajay. I'll take that. It's Joel. I mean, so obviously, part of that is some seasonality. Our third quarter typically is a smaller quarter. So it's just purely -- excuse me, compare Q3 and Q4. Again, I wouldn't expect that to actually be similar. And as we talked about heading into this quarter, I guess, you're correct. It is -- there is no impact whatsoever Brakes with that number. It is a -- we had a strong quarter. We anticipated some year-over-year impact on some corporate expenses that we had in the prior year versus this year, but in general, we had a strong quarter and certainly finished the year and the three year plan out in a strong way.","Ajay Jain","Okay. And just finally, I think you had some kind of calendar shift in the reporting for Brakes. So Joel, I think you mentioned that Brakes didn't play a role in the fourth quarter performance, but I thought that there was some kind of a change to conform to your fiscal year ending in June from December at Brakes. So can you quantify if there was any benefit as a result of vendor allowances in the latest quarter for Brakes in terms of the year-over-year incremental impact, if there was any?","Joel Grade","Sure. So we don't quantify specifically. What I can say to you is you're correct. We did talk about a calendar shift that impacted, I'd say, negatively the first half of the year and more positively the second half of the year for Brakes. However, that had zero impact at all on our three year plan. The vendor allowances you're referring to in any sort would actually be anything would be in their business and that would all be within Brakes and so there's no impact at all in any of the numbers that we had as far as our three year plan. It's a very pure number and we exceeded it, what we actually had called out earlier. We came out ahead. We feel very good about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan.","John Ivankoe","I wanted to go get back to a couple of questions ago and tie that in to your prepared remarks where you mentioned the additional delivery options. I mean, clearly, we understand some drivers don't necessarily need CDL licenses and they can be in sprinter-type vehicles. But I wanted to get a sense, are we beyond pilot at this point and you're kind of thinking about doing that where it makes sense nationally? And secondly, does this type of service make sense to be driven in that your main operating companies? Or are you considering a number of smaller distribution facilities, I guess, kind of spokes, if you will, within different metropolitan areas can actually be closer to the customer to where the driver can go back and forth and reach more customers in a day than just operating out of the operating company itself?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","So I'd say, look, we've been in pilot mode for a while and we've looked at both what I would call metro urban markets as well as more standard operating companies and we have learnings from each of those. We will continue to add these in the market. We feel like it's -- the results have been positive. And it's really -- there's no one set situation. These are not fill-in -- these are not recovery-type vehicles, meaning if we have something that's missed or a product comes in late that we get it out to the customer, this is actually part of our everyday delivery and routing. And so we're seeing lots of different benefits in different markets for different reasons, but a little bit of all the things you talked about are certainly options for us and something we'll continue to learn about and as we expand it.","John Ivankoe","And when you look at the total addressable market, I mean, how much do you think that the total addressable market for Sysco grows just because you can -- it's a different kind of customer, it's a different amount of case volume requirement, maybe in some cases, you actually pay for delivery? How big of an idea is this, if you're ready to talk about that?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Well, first of all, it's still very early as we're going through this learning, but I don't necessarily think it opens up a new market for us. I think it's just being more efficient with what we do today. And whether it's the size of the drop and we have a smaller vehicle than a larger one making that drop or allows us to get into some places that are a little harder to deliver to, but I don't think necessarily opens some new market for us.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation."],"19857":["Sysco (NYSE:SYY) Q4 2013 Earnings Call August 12, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Neil A.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We'll begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to introduce the call -- I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Neil A. Russell","Thank you, operator, and good warning, everyone. Welcome to Sysco's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2013 Earnings Call. Today, you will hear prepared remarks from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings.

In addition, all references to case volumes include total Broadline and SYGMA combined.","[Operator Instructions]","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.","William J. DeLaney","Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Sysco's financial results, announced this morning, reflect a year that has both produced several significant successes and provided us with many challenges. While we have seen a slow and steady economic recovery, it is clear that the foodservice industry, as a whole, has not fully participated in that recovery.","At the same time, we are driving on a much-needed transformational change throughout Sysco. This change has broadened scope, will permit us to enhance the products and services we provide our customers and will allow us to build upon our industry-leading position for years to come. Successfully implementing change of this large scale requires strong leadership, substantial effort by our associates, and more often than we would like, patience from our various stakeholders.","Starting with the market, it is clear that certain elements of the overall economy appear to be recovering. Consumer confidence is near its highest level since 2008, housing sales and prices have consistently improved this year and unemployment levels are declining. However, a deeper look at the data reveals that consumer confidence remains well off its historic highs, unemployment levels do not fully reflect the number of individuals who would like to work but have given up, and personal income is stagnant.","As a result, we believe many consumers have become much more disciplined in their spending habits, and this has directly impacted our business, particularly our street business with independent foodservice operators.","Today's consumers are more actively allocating their disposable income, and eating out has been deprioritized from some consumers' personal budgets. We believe this trend is more cyclical than structural in nature, but acknowledge that greater consumer confidence will be required to reverse it.","Reflecting these factors, this morning, Sysco reported its sales for the fourth quarter increased 5% to $11.6 billion, and net earnings were $283 million. EPS declined 11% to $0.47, in part due to increased costs from business transformation and restructuring items. Excluding these costs, adjusted EPS, representing our underlying business, was $0.59, declining 6% compared to the prior year.","Sales for the fiscal year were $44 billion, a record for Sysco, and net earnings were nearly $1 billion. EPS declined 12% to $1.67, which was mainly due to increased costs from business transformation, multi-employer pension plan withdrawals and restructuring. Adjusting for these costs, adjusted EPS, representing our underlying business, was $0.01 lower compared to the prior year at $2.14.","Cash flow from operations grew by 8%, and free cash flow increased significantly to $1 billion. Our sales growth for the year was driven by case volume growth of 3% and product cost inflation of 2%. Earnings growth did not meet our expectations, as pricing pressures and lighter street sales growth resulted in only modest gross profit dollar gains.","Helping to mitigate these pressures, we did achieve our overall targeted business transformation benefits for the year, with reduced selling and administrative costs providing the most benefit. We expect to achieve our overall targeted benefits in the new fiscal year as well.","As we close this fiscal year, it's an appropriate time to reflect on our successes, as well as those areas where we need to improve. We should start with the fact that our industry is being impacted by many developing trends and realities. Growth in foodservice is projected to remain modest, about 1% to 2% real growth per annum, and our customers are increasingly value-focused. As a result, we expect pricing pressures will likely continue, and in addition, nontraditional competitors have become more of a factor. And lastly, consumer spending trends in our space are gradually shifting more to fresh, natural and sustainably produced products. We continue to focus on ways to respond to and capitalize on those trends in our own business, as well as in partnership with our customers and suppliers.","One of our most significant challenges continues to be gross margin compression. Several of the trends I know that are contributing to this challenge, in addition, are shifting customer mix in recent quarters has adversely impacted gross margin, as our more value-added local and street customer business has not kept pace with our larger but lower-margin multiunit customer business.","This area has management's full attention, and we expect to improve our gross margin trends as fiscal 2014 progresses by effectively implementing our category management initiative and gradually improving our street growth performance.","Another significant challenge during the year was the unanticipated delay in deploying our SAP technology platform. However, we are now making progress in developing required system enhancements. This work primarily focuses on simplifying certain processes to improve response times and to reduce system loads, which will lead to improved system stability and will also lead to improved ability to scale the system as we go forward.","We expect to restart convergence of the broad SAP rollout around the end of this calendar year at our Boise, Idaho company. And as our system enhancements in our 5 SAP operating companies take hold and the products' successful deployment in Boise, we would anticipate deploying additional operating company locations beginning early in calendar 2014.","Notwithstanding all these challenges, I'm encouraged by several of the key successes we experienced during the past year. We grew sales at our corporate managed customers by 6% for the year, with the Broadline portion of this business up 9%. We completed acquisitions during the year of 14 companies, representing annualized sales of over $1 billion. These deals contributed significantly to our sales growth during the year and enhanced our international market presence and product capabilities.","We exceeded our targeted business transformation benefits for the year. The majority of the benefits achieved were driven by changes in our retirement programs and sales and IT organizational changes. We're making significant progress in our category management initiative. Our pilot waves include 4 categories: french fries, dressings, shrimp, and tissues, towels and napkins. 3 of the 4 categories were launched in the market in June, with the fourth, shrimp, planned to launch in the fall.","Customer acceptance of the new assortments in the pilots has been encouraging. Conversion rates are running ahead of where we expected to be at this point in the process, and our customers appreciate the increased variety and value offered by our new optimized assortment.","Our supplier partners are highly engaged in all phases of the process and also appreciate our approach to this initiative, in particular, our focus on building strategic partnerships, which we believe deliver benefits for all parties. We and our suppliers are sharing customer insights to enhance product innovation and improve our response to customer trends. And our ability to commit volumes to our supplier partners allows them to more efficiently service the business.","As is true in all pilots, we've learned along the way, and we appreciate our customers' and suppliers' engagement as we move through the process. We have a very aggressive implementation plan, and we'll continually improve our processes as we move forward with each successive wave.","Cost per case in our Broadline business declined year-over-year, demonstrating our continuing efforts to reduce our operating cost structure. We reduced our cost, in particular, in our selling and administrative areas. Specifically, we aggressively drove cost-reduction initiatives in selling by implementing a customer relationship management platform, or CRM; flattening our sales management organization structure; modifying compensation plans for our marketing associates, or MAs, to incentivize growth; and reducing the number of unprofitable sales territories.","Some of our operating companies executed these initiatives better than others. And while we realized significant cost savings, we no doubt experienced some sales loss in certain markets as well. We believe the impact of all of these changes has now been largely absorbed, and that our local sales organizations are well positioned to accelerate growth as fiscal 2014 progresses.","We generated free cash flow during the year of $1 billion, exceeding our expectations. This was a direct result in improvements in working capital trends, as well as renewed focus on better prioritization of our capital expenditure opportunities. We will continue our work to improve our working capital metrics, as we believe there's ample opportunity to do so.","We've also made significant progress on many other individual elements of our business transformation initiatives. Specifically, this year, we completed the rollout of our CRM module to all U.S. and Canadian Broadline operating companies. We completed the rollout of the SAP maintenance module to all U.S. Broadline locations. We expect to complete the rollout of the SAP human resource module to all U.S. Broadline locations by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2014, and we expect to complete the centralization of our general ledger accounting functions for all U.S. Broadline locations by the end of the calendar year. And we have begun implementing enhancements to our routing technology and processes to further improve delivery efficiencies and expect this initiative to be completed in fiscal 2015. Pilot locations have completed the enhancements of experienced reductions in mileage of approximately 5%.","We increased our dividend during this past year to 44x since we went public in 1970. In total, we distributed nearly $650 million of dividends to our shareholders during fiscal 2013. We recognize that our dividend represents a significant component of Sysco's shareholder return, especially as we navigate through our transformational changes.","Lastly, we have strengthened our management team this year in several strategic areas throughout the company. In addition to other key initiatives -- in addition to other key additions I've mentioned in previous calls, we recently welcomed Scott Charlton to lead our Distribution Services team and fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Fred Lankford. Scott brings significant supply chain experience from the retail grocery industry, which will greatly benefit our company over time.","As we look forward, we'll be managing our business by aligning around several core metrics: case growth and mix, gross profit dollar growth and cost per case. But we expect a modest level of continuing gross margin compression in the year ahead. We also expect to grow both our corporate and locally managed customer business and to once again reduce our overall cost per case. Considering these improvements and additional benefits from our business transformation initiatives, we would expect our earnings performance trends in fiscal 2014 to gradually improve.","In closing, I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. With the support of our customers and suppliers and through the talents and efforts of generations of committed associates, Sysco has grown into a company that last year produced $44 billion in sales, as well as approximately $1 billion in both net earnings and free cash flow.","We are proud to be the leader in the $235 billion foodservice industry that we participate in and take our leadership role very seriously. We recognized a few years ago that our industry's growth rate would begin to plateau, that the industry would undergo significant changes over time, and that we would need to change our business model if we were going to continue to expand our leadership position.","We are currently in the midst of a multiyear business transformation that has touched nearly every part of our business, sales, marketing, merchandising, operations, technology, finance and business development, in order to continue the success we have enjoyed historically. We're making good progress on this journey, but that progress has not been as consistent as we would like, and there had been setbacks along the way. Driving change at this scope and magnitude is challenging.","While a great deal of work lies ahead, I believe our strategy is sound, our execution will improve and that we are extremely well-positioned to solidify our foundation for delivering best-in-class customer service and profitable growth in the years to come.","I want to thank all of our associates for their efforts this past year in supporting our customers. Their contributions are critical to fully realizing Sysco's vision to become our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.","Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he could provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.","Robert C. Kreidler","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, sales were $11.6 billion, or an increase of 5% compared to the prior year, mainly due to acquisitions, which increased sales by 2.1% and food cost inflation, which was 2%. Case volume increased 3% for the quarter; and case volume, excluding acquisitions, increased 0.8%. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.1%.","Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased 1.2%, and gross margin declined 66 basis points. Roughly 1\/4 of the gross margin decline was due to the shift in customer mix as a result of faster growth in sales to large, regional and national customers. The remainder of the decline was driven by the difficult sales environment during the quarter and continued competitive pressure.","Operating expenses increased $80 million, or 5.4%, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by an $18 million increase in retirement-related expense mainly due to higher 401(k) expenses and an $18 million increase in business transformation expenses. As a result of all of these factors, operating income decreased $56 million, or 10.8%.","Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $283 million, a decrease of $26 million, or 8.5%, compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.47, an 11.3% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items, diluted EPS was $0.50 for the quarter.","As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which excludes certain items, as well as business transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 4.9%, with the increase in retirement-related expense accounting for roughly 1 percentage point of the increase. Adjusted operating income decreased 7.3%. Adjusted net earnings declined 4.2%, and adjusted EPS declined 6.3% to $0.59.","Turning to the year-over-year comparison. Sales increased 4.8%, or $2 billion, due mainly to inflation of 2.2% and acquisitions of 1.5%. Case volume increased 2.6%; and excluding acquisitions, case volume grew 1.3% for the year. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not have a meaningful impact.","Gross profit increased 2.5% during the year, while gross margin decreased 39 basis points year-over-year to 17.7%. Approximately 1\/3 of the decline was due to the shift in customer mix mentioned earlier. The remainder of decline in gross margin was due to weak restaurant traffic and competitive pressures.","Operating expenses increased $423 million, or 7.3%, in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. The increase in operating expenses was driven by several factors: first, business transformation expenses increased $137 million; second, certain items increased $58 million, mainly due to MEPP withdrawals and restructuring items; third, payroll costs, excluding retirement-related expenses, increased $48 million, driven by acquisitions, increased volume and higher delivery costs, partially offset by lower IT and sales costs as a result of our business transformation initiatives; fourth, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding business transformation expenses, increased $36 million due mainly to facilities and fleet put into service, as well as amortization on acquired intangible assets; fifth, fuel expense increased $19 million; and lastly, retirement plan expenses increased $10 million due to higher 401(k) expense, partially offset by lower pension expense following changes on our retirement programs that became effective this year.","With regards to the last point on retirement-related expenses, it's important to recall that we had previously estimated that the pension expense would've been more than $100 million higher this year. However, due to our retirement plan restructuring, actual pension expense was more than $30 million lower year-over-year.","While expenses from our enhanced 401(k) plan offset this benefit somewhat, overall retirement-related expenses, which includes both pension and 401(k), increased only $10 million this year.","Our operational focus on expense management resulted in good cost per case performance for the year. After adjusting for certain items, cost per case in our Broadline organization declined year-over-year by more than $0.03, which is very difficult to do.","Operating income declined $232 million, or 12%, for the fiscal year. Excluding certain items, operating income declined 9%. Net earnings for fiscal 2013 decreased $129 million, or 11.5%, compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2013 EPS was $1.67, a decline of 12%. Excluding certain items, EPS was $1.78.","To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 4.1%, adjusted operating income decreased 1.7%, adjusted net earnings grew 0.1% and adjusted EPS declined 0.5% to $2.14.","Fiscal year 2013 has been a very active year for us in the acquisition arena, and as a result, we surpassed our stated goal of increasing sales from acquisitions by 0.5% to 1%. We completed 14 acquisitions during the year that, in the aggregate, totaled more than $1 billion in annualized sales. These acquisitions will enable us to better serve our customers, further expand our product offerings and service footprint and profitably grow our business. Each transaction has expanded our footprint in both current and new geographies, with 6 acquisitions in the U.S., 5 in Canada, 2 in Ireland and 1 in the Bahamas. They also spanned a number of different service capabilities, with 6 Broadline companies being acquired, 5 seafood specialty companies, 2 produce specialty companies and 1 systems distributor.","Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. For the fiscal year, project expenses totaled $331 million, including $77 million in depreciation and amortization expense. We capitalized $20 million related to the project. The cash outlay on the project was $274 million, or $48 million lower than prior year. All 3 of these metrics, expense, capital and cash, were in line with the guidance we gave for the year.","As Bill mentioned, although we continue to accelerate specific functional initiatives to advance our business transformation efforts, we plan to implement enhancements to the broader SAP platform before continuing our enterprise-wide rollout schedule. We expect our next conversion to occur around the end of the calendar year. Our rollouts scheduled beyond that time will be determined once we are able to assess the success of the additional changes and enhancements we are making to the system.","The transformation benefits achieved this year include significantly lower pension expenses, which we expect to decline even further in fiscal 2014. After restructuring our sales and IT organization, SG&A expenses are significantly lower than the prior year. We also enhanced compliance across the organization, with existing sourcing programs. In addition, as Bill mentioned, we made substantial progress on our category management initiative and expect to see specific benefits from these efforts in fiscal '14.","Finally, we made progress on some of our operations initiatives, including completing implementation of the SAP maintenance module, beginning the realignment of incentive plans for our driver and warehouse personnel and beginning the implementation of enhanced routing processes to reduce miles traveled.","As you'll recall, we had stated that we would achieve approximately 25% of the total targeted benefits of $550 million to $650 million in the first year fiscal 2013. We actually exceeded our targeted business transformation benefits for the year. Unfortunately, this progress has been masked by the current difficult business environment and general operating performance of the underlying business that did not meet our expectations. As a result, we no longer expect to achieve our previous EPS guidance of $2.50 to $2.75 by fiscal '15.","Turning to our cash flow performance. Total capital expenditures were $512 million for fiscal 2013, in line with our guidance. We made good progress on our objective to better prioritize our capital expenditures this year, enabling us to reduce our spending by $273 million compared to last year.","We've seen a decline in capital spending related to the Business Transformation Project, mainly driven by the fact that we began implementation of the new technology earlier this year and stopped capitalizing much of the expense. In the underlying business, we've seen lower capital spending because of a reduction in the number of major facilities projects this year compared to last, and a more disciplined capital allocation and approval process. In addition, a few construction projects moved from fiscal '13 to fiscal '14.","As a result of the reduction in capital spending and increase in operating cash flow, free cash flow increased more than 60% year-over-year to $1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion for fiscal '13 compared to $1.4 billion in the prior year.","Now turning to fiscal 2014 guidance for a moment. Regarding our acquisition activity, we expect acquisitions to add at least 1% to our sales growth each year going forward. Due to the amount and timing of acquisitions during fiscal '13, we will exceed this goal during fiscal '14. We expect just a carryover effect of deals done during fiscal '13 to add approximately 1% to fiscal '14's sales growth. And of course, we also expect to complete new transactions in fiscal '14, which will add additional sales growth during the year.","We believe retirement-related expenses will decrease $75 million to $85 million overall in fiscal '14 versus fiscal '13 and $50 million to $60 million net of certain items which we recognized in fiscal '13. As a reminder, the change in retirement-related expense includes the impact of our defined benefit pension plan and our defined contribution, or 401(k), plan.","As you'll see in the chart provided in our slide presentation, the majority of the reduction in the adjusted portion of these expenses, or the portion of the expenses excluding certain items, will occur in the second half of fiscal 2014.","We expect fuel expense for the year to increase in the range of $10 million to $20 million. We currently have about 2\/3 of our anticipated fuel needs locked in at prices lower than fiscal '13. We also expect to continue our trend of strong expense management in fiscal '14, with cost per case in our Broadline companies expected to decline by $0.05, aided by the reduction in retirement-related expense.","We expect our capital expenditures in fiscal '14 will be $550 million to $600 million, including business transformation CapEx. This is somewhat higher than our actual spend this year and the guidance we've provided earlier this year because a few projects were reprioritized and shifted from fiscal '13 to fiscal '14.","We currently expect business transformation expenses in fiscal '14 to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million, capital spend to be in a range of $5 million to $20 million and cash outlay to be in a range of $225 million to $275 million. All 3 of these ranges are consistent with our prior long-term business transformation guidance.","Lastly, we continue to expect the approximately $550 million to $650 million in annual business transformation benefits to be achieved in fiscal 2015. As mentioned earlier, we exceeded our goal of realizing approximately 25% of the total benefit during fiscal '13. This increases our confidence in achieving our long-term guidance, which is to deliver a cumulative benefit of approximately 50% to 70% of the total targeted benefits in fiscal '14 and 100% of those benefits in fiscal '15.","In closing, while we have seen recent positive developments in the overall economy, the recovery continues to be modest. We believe that, as a result, consumers had not yet fully recovered from the economic downturn. The foodservice industry is continuing to feel these effects, seen in generally low growth and strange traffic patterns.","While our financial results reflect these challenges, we are working to improve on those elements of our business that we can control, including enhancing our product and service offering, improving our execution on the gross margin line, managing our costs, increasing our free cash flow, achieving our targeted business transformation benefits and addressing the requirements of our technology transformation in a prudent manner.","The work we are doing will position us to take advantage of market trends, enhance our ability to grow our market share over the long term and expand our leadership position in the industry.","With that, operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of things for you. I was just hoping maybe we could start with the guidance and the 2015 guidance not being valid. You haven't really changed much. I don't -- from a business transformation standpoint, from a cost saving standpoint, so it sounds like it's, I guess, more sort of industry-related. When you gave the guidance, things weren't great, right? So I'm just trying to figure out what the moving pieces are on the difference today. Maybe you could just sort of help us frame that.","William J. DeLaney","Thanks, Ed. I'll start. I'll let Chris kind of get into it in a little more specific way. Obviously, we've given that a lot of thought as well. So if you go back to the way we've presented it, we had 3 buckets, we said A plus B equals C, and with A being a view of what we felt we could continue to grow the underlying business at a steady state. And that the implied guidance there was 4% or 5% growth. And then we had the $550 million to $650 million in cost savings, both on the operations side as well as product, with the goal being to get back to what Sysco's historically been, has been a company that's been able to produce consistent earnings growth. I would say this to you, obviously, the market's been difficult, but we've had some execution challenges, as we've acknowledged here today. I think the biggest thing I would say to you is the market and just the environment itself, I think, has just proven to be a lot tougher than what we thought it was going to be. We had baked in, like I said, 4% to 5% expectation that we would be able to continue to grow the business x the transformational cost savings, and that's not the case. So sure, there's been a lot of distractions and a lot of change going on. But on the one hand, it's disappointing to pull the guidance back. On the other hand, I think it reinforces the direction we're going in, which is we have to change this business model because if we hadn't gone down this road with business transformation in the broadest sense, we'd probably be looking at flat to very modest single-digit earnings growth. So I don't want to put it all on the consumer or the economy, but clearly, this market is tougher than what we anticipated at the time we put the guidance out. I'll let Chris give you his insights.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, the only thing I'll add is unfortunately, just math, which is, as Bill said, A plus B has to equal or should equal to C. We didn't expect A to be stagnant or go backwards. And so when you lose a year on a 3-year guidance, it just means your growth rates have to be that much higher. And when I just do the math with everything we've got going on, we expect to do good things. We expect there to be improvement, but I don't expect to see enough improvement to overcome that first year. So, as I said, we don't expect to achieve it in fiscal '15.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And when you say sort of lose a year, is that kind of how we should think about setting our expectations? And from a -- I know you're not giving a number, but is it more or less kind of like a year delayed, is that how to think about it?","Robert C. Kreidler","Ed, I'm going to go with the comment you made. We're not giving a number at this point. Look, we're -- we've been at it, doing long-term projections. There's still a tremendous amount of uncertainty in what's going on out there right now, so we're not prepared at this moment to put a new set of guidance on the table. Look, what we said a number of years ago, I think, is still true today. We're trying to set this company up for long-term sustainable growth of a certain level. We've never really said what that level is because we've got to get at least some way through this business transformation to know what we're capable of achieving. But the whole goal is to set us up for long-term sustainable growth, not to hit a particular number, but to be able to grow a certain percentage or a certain amount every single year, regardless of what goes on in the market and what we're doing. And that's where we're trying to get to. So we're reassessing what we can achieve and by when, and we'll certainly come out and talk about that probably at the next Investor Day.","William J. DeLaney","Ed, I would echo that. The only thing I would add to it is, we've talked about '13 being a year of transition. And as I think about it, I think you need to look at '14 as the year that we begin to turn this thing, all right? So while we are not giving you specific guidance, I think we're signaling to you that we expect to see better trends on the top line and the bottom line. We've got our challenges, certainly, on the gross margin line. We've got a lot of good things going on, we think, in expense initiatives. So we feel good about the direction, we think we'll begin to turn it here this year. But to Chris' point, we need a little more time deeper into the year to see how we start the year out, get further along on the technology deployment and the CatMan working. We hope to come back with you with a little better perspective here later in the year.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then if I could just had one follow-up on that, Bill, thinking about gross profit per case, which I know is a metric you guys care a lot about, I mean, the best way we have to look at this, right, is to just look at volume growth versus gross profit dollar growth. And this quarter, we haven't seen it at this level really kind of since we saw deflation. So I was hoping you could just maybe talk about -- you mentioned competitive pressure in the marketplace, talk a little bit more about that. What's going on from a pricing standpoint on your end of the new business that you're bringing in, and just how you get this to improve next year.","William J. DeLaney","Sure. So if it's okay, I'm going to really combine the last 2 quarters, I think. So if you look at the third and fourth quarter, they were more similar than they were different. Things kind of bottomed out in February, I think, in terms of the market, from our perspective, in the third quarter; it began to trend up a little bit in terms of March and April; and we saw a fair amount of softness in June in terms of restaurant numbers and that kind of thing. So again, we're talking about a very choppy market here, but the reality is we only grew our gross profit dollars 2%. So while gross profit per case is an important metric, I would say again, what I look at the most is volume and the mix of that volume, locally managed within that street and then corporate managed, and then look at gross profit dollar growth. And the reality is the first half of the year, we grew it over 3%; in the second half of the year, only 2%, or maybe even a tad less; and then cost per case. So all those go together, but those are 3 high-level metrics I would continue to look at. And as you saw, we gave you a little more color on some of those this particular earnings release. I would say, as we start out the new year, there's tremendous emphasis within the company on that top line. I mean, you can grow your gross profit dollars in a lot of ways. So right now, we're very focused on the top line. We're focused on reenergizing our local and street sales growth, while still maintaining very strong corporate managed -- some of those high-volume chain business. So we need to keep the top line going in order to leverage the business. We need to drive our category management very effectively. We're off to a good start and it's early. We've got some other things that we're working on that we think over time, not so much this year, but in subsequent years, can help us mitigate some of the margin pressure. And we need to continue to look at the cost structure of the company. So again, I think you'll see gradual improvement this year. And to Chris' point and my point, I think we'll create the foundation for that to become more consistent in the years to come.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Bill, a couple of things with regard to pricing. So it looks like things got a bit worse this quarter. Was that -- do you find your investments, are they more proactive or reactive? And then maybe talk a little bit about analytics and ROI, because I always hit you guys on price elasticity. Did not look like a good ROI this quarter, how can you manage that better and maybe not make some price investments that are not productive? So that's kind of the big question.","William J. DeLaney","So, John, when you say ROI, you're talking about the ROI as it relates to pricing? Is that what you're getting at?","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, so when I think about it, you gave up 66 bps, and what you got back for it, it doesn't look like you got back what you'd like for it.","William J. DeLaney","No, we didn't. I mean, that's very fair, we didn't. And again, I would just repeat what I said a moment ago that, that has not escaped us. And we thought we were beginning to make some progress, but as the quarter unfolded, June in particular, we fell back there. So the way we're structured today, John, there's 2 ways to go at it. One is to continue to standardize and centralize more and more of what we're doing in terms of how we source the product, how we work through category management, how we create [ph] transfer pricing within the company to give our operating companies and our sales people as true a cost as we can and as competitive a cost as we can to price off of over time. Driving out these initial waves in category management will help us a great deal. And as I just alluded to, there are some other things we just need to do over time, very early days, very early exploratory work, where we need to bring more consistency to how we price. Not take pricing -- so think about it this way. A little under half of our revenue stream is priced by our marketing associates, so they have a fair amount of latitude there. And we want that because they're dealing with different customers at different points in time with different priorities, so we don't want to overly limit their latitude. At the same time, if you could see what we see, which I'm not going to let you see totally, there's a fair amount of volatility in those -- in that pricing that doesn't need to be there. And so I think not so much this year but over the next 2 to 3 years, we have an opportunity to standardize that with some things like scientific pricing, I will use that term for today, but there's other things as well. And so the idea would be to take some of the volatility out of the pricing, have more consistency, but still position that marketing associate to adapt to the needs of the customer locally. We don't want to move away from that because that is our bread and butter, and that really is part of how we think we differentiate ourselves. But no doubt about it, tough quarter, tough couple of quarters, and we're just going to have to dig ourselves out of it. And as I mentioned in my script, I think that gradually, you'll see the trends improve. And look, the bottom line here, John, is we need to do all that and continue to grow the top line and take cost out of the business.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Do you think the MA pricing volatility, is that more then being reactionary or proactive? And how good a visibility do you think they have into their competitors' pricing?","William J. DeLaney","I don't know that much about the latter. Certainly, most of the accounts they call on are probably -- use probably 2 or 3 other competitors, so I certainly -- they certainly have some sense of it depending on the Items, obviously, the more competitive items. I don't know that it's proactive or reactive. What I'm getting at is not so much the volatility with a given MA, although there's some of that. What I'm talking about is the volatility -- or the variability, maybe is a better word, between MAs, between OpCos and similar items, and that just comes from having 7,000 different people pricing. So we need to strike a better balance between that variability but still being responsive to the needs of the individual customer. And we will, but it's going to take some time.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then lastly, on category management, do you think -- is one of the thrusts here going to be fewer SKUs, you buying -- giving more volume to certain vendors plus your costs going down and your ability to take pricing down along with that. Is that a key thrust to you or is that secondary?","William J. DeLaney","I wouldn't say it's secondary. I'd say it's in tandem with a broader goal. There's different ways to go at this and different people call category management or define category management in different ways. We've taken a more deliberate, what we think very thorough approach, which starts with gaining insights from our customers, from our suppliers in terms of what the needs are in the market, what the trends are in the market, and using that as an opportunity to not just eliminate SKUs but to create new SKUs as well. So certainly, there will be a SKU reduction aspect to it but that should be more of a benefit as opposed to a targeted goal as we position our inventory to be more in sync with what the marketplace demands. And then as you go through that, that should allow us to grow more effectively with our customers, bring more innovation to the work itself, address some of these trends more effectively, that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And certainly, along the way, when you're able to identify those supplier partners who want to make the commitment to go down that road with you, you're able to identify shared savings that are good for both us, the supplier and the customer. So it's all of the above, John. To do this just to save money for 1 year or 2 is not enough. We need to do it, don't get me wrong. It's part of our cost savings initiative, but we need to do it in a way that we can grow the business over time as well.","Operator","And we'll go next to Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I would like to chat about cash flow. You did increase your free cash flow this year, but you also increased your spending on acquisitions, which was clearly a driver of revenues. So I'm just wondering about one of the benefits in the fourth quarter was working capital. How long do you think that lasts? What kind of -- what were the drivers of the better working capital? And is it a concern at all that if you take out of free cash flow, the dividend and the acquisition costs, you really were almost flat here, actually slightly negative, I think. So first, working capital and then the overall thoughts about cash flow.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, I'll start in your order. So on working capital, we did see some improvement in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, just looking at it year-over-year, it was actually pretty close to flat for the same type of discussion we've had before. Our trends prior to the end of the year, we're going the wrong direction. Said another way, accounts receivable and inventory, we're going the wrong direction. We were making up for some but not all of that with accounts payable efforts. At the -- by the time we got to the end of the fourth quarter, we had balanced it out. And I believe working capital was a positive of only about $10 million at the end of the year. So working capital wasn't a significant driver on a year-over-year basis. And Meredith, I don't spend a tremendous amount of time looking at the quarters because there's seasonality in those numbers for working capital from one quarter to the next. But year-over-year, it was basically flat. Your -- second part of your question, do I have concerns about free cash flow being able to support dividend and acquisitions? I look at it differently. Acquisitions, we're actually adding EBITDA. As we bring those acquisitions then and we integrate them with the company early in the standalones whatever they are, they generate additional cash flow, which supports additional debt if we want to maintain the same debt to equity and debt ratios, if you will. Said another way, unless we're planning to continually reduce debt over time, we actually have the ability to leverage against acquisitions. So I look at acquisitions as being something we can buy with cash, we can borrow money, that's more of a financing discussion. That's why free cash flow doesn't take a deduction for acquisitions because you're actually buying new cash flows into the future.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's fair. Maybe you just talk a little bit then about buybacks. It doesn't look like you did much this year. And you do -- not only are you buying additional EBITDA, but you're not a very leveraged company. Is there any thought about leveraging up a bit to buy back stock?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, we have and we'll continue to look at, our capital structure to make sure that it's appropriate for where we are and our strategies, et cetera. As I've said, and Bill has said, as we've talked on these calls and at conferences, we expect to generate additional free cash flow. You've seen it this year. We'll see it as we continue into the future. And we're constantly evaluating how we're going to put that new cash flow to work. Our goal would be to find strategic opportunities for that cash to put it to work for future growth. Barring that, we've got to look at other options.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And I just had one sort of housekeeping question. You had an unusually large amount of other income, I believe, this quarter. Was there anything in there that was unusual? Or should we expect a higher run rate of other income going forward?","Robert C. Kreidler","Now the only thing in there that was different, if you will, is we had an equity investment in a small company, HotSchedules, which we divested, and that was a gain -- there was a gain on that sale of, I want to say, $6 million, $6.5 million. Other than that, it wasn't significantly different than the run rate.","Operator","And next we'll go to Andrew Wolf with BB&T.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I think, Bill, you mentioned that the conversion rate in the category management area was ahead of what you expected. What's driving that? Could you talk a little bit about that? Is it a price offer? Or is it sort of take it or leave it because you're taking out SKUs. Could you just give a little color around that?","William J. DeLaney","Yes, it's not take it or leave it. And again, the SKU thing is important, but the SKU is more -- the SKU reduction is more of a byproduct of the overall process, which, again, is to find ways to grow better, share savings with our suppliers and our customers. Look, Andy, we've had some big initiatives over the years, so I think we're getting a little bit better at being more realistic early days on what our expectations should be, so we didn't assume 100% conversion here. So what we're saying to you is early days. We're pleased with the response we're seeing with our sales force and with customers. And no, it's not take it or leave it, because customers always have options. So I think all I'm saying there to you is that we're pleased, and I think it's really attributed to there's a year of work that went into this in terms of preparation, work with the suppliers, work with the customers, and, in particular, with our sales force and operating companies. So we're moving fast, as I said, and there's a lot to get done. But I think our team at SMS has done a great job preparing our people to drive this out and that showed up in our results so far.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I didn't mean to sound so much that way, but because to me, the conversion being above plan is actually a positive. Is it fair to say -- there's a lot of 1 column quite dead SKUs but very low productivity SKUs certainly for Sysco, and that some of the challenges to maybe tell the customer why that might be also a low productivity SKU for the customer?","William J. DeLaney","That's absolutely right. That's exactly what the deal is, Andy, and so that's kind of the opportunity that we have with each customer, whether they're street or, say, a big contract customers to sit there and go through their assortment, look at their movement, look at ours, look at these trends and these insights that we've been talking about and then jointly, make good business decisions on how they should move forward with their assortment. And as you do that, you're doing a fairly methodical or scientific way, you identify a lot of slow moving SKUs. You also identify, believe it or not, SKUs that we don't have or that the customer doesn't stock that they should be stocking in terms of where the marketplace is. So it is a double-edged opportunity, so to speak.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And just one follow-up. I think it's more for Chris because -- Chris, I think I heard you say there's going to be -- your plan is to have 50% to 70% of the cumulative savings you identified, the middle -- the midrange. It seems like a pretty large variance. And what kind of unknowns are around that variance? Is it more of the execution side at Sysco or with SAP? Or is it more what the dynamics of the marketplace and maybe pricing and things like that?","Robert C. Kreidler","I'll start with the sector or the first point you made. It's not SAP, because, again, these initiatives do not rely upon the additional rollouts of the ERP system. We've tried to make that pretty clear. Yes, there are some uncertainties. So first and foremost, we're expecting a lot out of our category management initiatives. So as you'll recall, we have benefited in all 3 years from lower product cost. The first year was mainly higher compliance of sourcing. But during the first year, which we just completed, we had to ramp up all of the work that was necessary to start delivering real dollars on category management. Now we're right into the middle of that. So we're expecting a lot out of category management. We have a lot of assumptions and the models that support and justify what we think we're going to achieve. Now, we're out executing against those. So as Bill said, early weeks look good but we've got a long way to go on that one. We have additional operating initiatives, additional benefits that we expect to derive throughout the operational part of the organization. That's a lot of execution work. And so those are going to be the main headwinds, if you will. It's just a lot of execution work throughout the organization to get these things done and accomplished. The first year, I don't want to say it was easy. Nothing we did the first year was easy, especially when you're starting to play around with retirement costs and things of that nature. But there were things that were vastly within our control and we could execute on them fairly quickly. Now it's the harder stuff. It's into the trenches and doing all the down-and-dirty work to get the rest of the stuff done. So that's why we still have a fairly big range on that. I will say we gained a lot of confidence in the fact that we exceeded the first-year goals, so that certainly sets us up going in with some surplus. So we feel better about hitting that range.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Very helpful. And I just wanted to double-check my takeaway on that. I didn't hear the -- you didn't talk about pricing. It was all sort of internal and execution. So it's not like Sysco could execute fairly flawlessly, head towards the higher end of that range, and yet the market got even more competitive or stayed as competitive as it is, and some of that, let's say in category management in particular, or all of it, the whole bucket, I should say, could go into the marketplace. I'm just thinking in terms of how you're thinking about things. I know obviously, anything could happen. But just how you're thinking of that variance?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, Andy, look, I'm going to back to our A plus B equals C. I mean, the way we account for the initiatives, as you kind of have to have a starting point and you've got to challenge the teams to realize their product cost savings, or operating cost savings versus that starting point, where we thought things were going to go based upon kind of trends, et cetera. And that's how we measure them. If something goes on in the underlying business, if something goes on in the marketplace that's definitely going to impact A, and so the overall numbers, the C part of that equation, are definitely going to be impacted as well. But the way we measure the benefits has to be off of a base case, if you will. Otherwise, it's a constant moving target and I have no way to talk about those, our success in that area or our progress in that area. So, again, I'm not avoiding your question at all, but B has to be measured off of the base case. The impacts you're talking about, pricing, competitiveness in the market, et cetera are definitely going to impact A.","William J. DeLaney","Yes, I think, Andy, I'll just add, and I don't want to get this thing too complicated. There are really 2 different things, as Chris points out. So we're out there, it's not just that we track it separately, we're creating the opportunity to grow and to create these product cost savings separately, we ultimately distribute those savings, the ones that -- so we share some of those with the suppliers and customers and then we keep some. And so the shared savings that we keep go out to our operating companies, but they also have a profit plan for the year as well. So they're not just going to unilaterally -- I know you're not suggesting that but I just want to be clear -- they're not just going to let that stuff leak in other than, to your and Chris' point, competitive conditions are going to be what they're going to be. So there's the pressure of the marketplace, which we need to continue to address in multiple ways, including enhancing our differentiation and everything else we've talked about earlier this morning, and then there's the savings themselves. So the way I would look at is I would look at these initiatives as being significant. I think that they can go on beyond the 2015. I think that's a big opportunity for Sysco. And they certainly mitigate the pressure that we see in the marketplace.","Operator","And next we'll go to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I think they're related questions, and maybe, Bill, they -- you touched on them in your prepared remarks. Firstly, could you -- you mentioned nontraditional is more of a factor than it has been. I mean, I don't know if that's being referred to like warehouse club or an Amazon or something like that. So just kind of flesh out that statement that you made and what Sysco can do to respond to that, and then I'll have the follow-up as well.","William J. DeLaney","Sure, John. I think why I was doing that part of the prepared remarks was just trying to set an overall trend line over the last few years. So certainly, we're seeing group purchasing organizations have a bigger role over time. We work with a lot of them in contract business. To some extent, they are more involved in some larger street businesses today, which requires us to have a much more competitive bundle of goods and services. Certainly, the club stores and the cash and carry have made an impact, in particular, in this type of economy over the last 3 or 4 years. Amazon or Amazon-like business, we're certainly appropriately respectful of that channel and attempting to find ways that we might be able to participate in it. So that has not been that big of an impact to date, but it's all around us. We see it. We recognize it. And we're watching it very closely and, as I said, trying to identify areas where we may be able to participate. Certainly, one of the challenges with that channel was how do you do it profitably. And with our model, that's clearly very important. So those are 3 examples that we'll be talking about. And so it all comes back to us continuing to enhance our business model, perhaps over time finding the right type of acquisition opportunities that supplement our current capabilities.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And are most of your contract businesses that have franchise organizations on co-ops to date? Or is that something that you see as a risk of increasing in overall volumes?","William J. DeLaney","No, a lot of the big contract -- not a lot, but a few of the big contract folks we work with have their own purchasing or good purchasing organizations. And we're partnering with some of them in the large contracts. You see a lot of that in health care. We're not talking about is when it goes beyond that into some of your larger independent-type of business operators. So that's a trend that's been gradually moving over the last few years. And we combat it, but the best way to combat it, as I mentioned, is to continue to work on a very complete bundle of goods, services, pricing, all the things we're talking about. It's really -- it's somewhat disruptive but it's just another form of competition that's different than what we would've seen, say, 8 or 10 years ago. But in the end, you end up at the same place, which is this trade-off of value and price and that type of thing.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I'll try to ask this question delicately. Sometimes, recently in the marketplace, you hear a certain marketing associate or a group of marketing associates didn't like some of the changes at Sysco made maybe to one of your competitors did something else and took some of the customers with them. So I mean, the question is with the changes how stable has your marketing associate organization been? Is it more stable now than it was, for example, 6 months ago? And I'm happy if you'd want to publicly correct me, I mean, to what extent has this really been kind of an issue that's been happening within the organization?","William J. DeLaney","Yes. So let me give you some context. I think in a normal year, we would have about 15% turnover of marketing associates, and that's considered good and that's what you want. I somewhat, delicately in my prepared remarks, talked about reducing unprofitable territories. So we are down significantly more marketing associates right now year-over-year. And that's been a trend over the last 12 months. We haven't talked a lot about it publicly because it's been gradual, and from a competitive standpoint, it didn't really make a lot of sense to talk about that stuff publicly. But I would acknowledge what you said. Certainly, when you lose people, any associates, but particularly salespeople, sales managers, and if they were to go to the competition, that does create some challenges for whatever, 3, 6, 9 months. Not all of them go to the competitions, some of them leave the industry as well. So yes, what we are trying to signal there -- and I appreciate the question, is that we initiated that change in an effort to optimize our sales force and to improve productivity. And there's a downside to that on the top line. And that's lingering here a little bit, but I think to answer your question, what I also said is we're through most of that right now. Certain operating companies dealt with it better than others. And so I think as '14 unfolds, the sales force, sales management structure, all that's beginning to stabilize and we're in a much better place than where we were 6 or 9 months ago to go forward.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Bill, I think you indicated in the past that with all of the industry headwinds and even some of the more company-specific challenges that you're dealing with, that all of those issues further justify the investment in business transformation. So I just want to ask maybe a variation -- maybe Andy's question earlier, about your confidence level on getting the projected cost savings in fiscal '14 that are supposed to offset the continued spending. I mean, clearly, pension and retirement-related expenses should be a tailwind for you. But I think the guidance you provided calls for about $200 million of incremental cost savings. So it sounds like, in response to Andy's question, that you're fairly confident about the cost reduction goal. But could you maybe discuss the different components of the incremental cost saves and how much of that you expect to get from procurement benefits specifically?","William J. DeLaney","I might let Chris take or dodge the second part of that. But just in general, I would agree with your initial caveat in terms of the assessment. I would say this to you: If you look at it, we call this out pretty much in our remarks in the last couple of calls. We've made very good strides on the SG&A side for all the reasons you just cited. So pension, some of the things we've done in IT, and there's been some pain along the way with that. Our folks have done a good job rolling that out, but we've had some challenges and our customers, at times, had to experience some of the downsides when you move quickly in some of those areas. Where we didn't do a particularly good job in the expense side this year was on the operations side. Right from the get-go, transportation got away from us and we actually backed up during our cost per case in operations. I think that came out on one of the slides that Neil and Shannon presented here this morning. So I think as the year goes along, the SG&A cost savings will begin to plateau out. I think you'll still see some in the early part of the year, they'll begin to plateau. And I think you'll see -- with one exception, which is the pension that Chris talked about. So if you just look at basic SG&A x pension, you'll see some in the early part of the year, I think, that will plateau out a little bit, cost per piece. I think you'll see operating cost per piece begin to improve. In fact, I think it already has begun to improve from a trend standpoint. But we're still up versus a year ago. So I think that will improve as the year goes along. And then, yes, we are looking for significantly more on the product cost savings to the category management as the year goes along as well, particularly in the, I'd say, the second 2\/3 of the year.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And I think you guys indicated that you came in ahead of your expectations for fiscal '13 on the cost savings. Would it be possible to just confirm the actual number?","Robert C. Kreidler","No, we're probably not going to give out the number. Here's -- let me try to handle it this way. I'm not going to completely dodge your question, Ajay, but there is a slide in the presentation. I don't know if you've actually seen it yet. I encourage you to pull it up afterwards. It's already posted, it's Slide 14. But it's an update to what we showed you at CAGNY. And what you'll see on there is we kind of put buckets for '13, '14 and '15 on the savings we expected from each. And the '13 bucket is full, and you'll actually see that we started filling in the '14 bucket a little ways. And that represents kind of the overage. So if you want to take out your slide rule, maybe you can interpolate, I'm not encouraging you to do that, but we did deliver more than we expected in '13, and that's what we're trying to represent there. And that's why we have confidence that we'll get to our range midpoint, high-end, wherever. We'll get within the range of our goals for '14 as well. We never have broken down exactly how much the benefit is going to come in each of the areas each of the years. What we did say early on is that the $600 million, half of it roughly would be in lowering cost of goods and the other half would be in lowering cost of operations. We've also said that we got ahead in our SG&A initiatives. Our operating cost initiatives were slower to come. We were roughly on track with our category management, frankly fell behind a little bit at the end of '13, mainly because the way I track those is I assume that the benefits are going to cover the direct costs of doing that, and we had some additional consulting costs that, frankly, we didn't cover. And so we don't believe that we actually hit all of that number in '13, which was primarily sourcing, as I said a few minutes ago, not category management. So we'd cast them to make up some ground in '14 and I understand that. So as Bill said, the big things for '14, category management is going to deliver a lot and we're counting on that. But we also have a lot of operating initiatives that we're counting on similar to deliver benefit. So we talked early -- or at least I talked in my opening remarks about a $0.05 cost per case reduction, which is our expectation for the year, and that's inclusive of initiatives and everything else. That's hard to do, and the way you accomplish that is, first, offsetting the natural cost increases that come every year, which -- so we got to cover those, and then also find ways to drive that cost down. So retirement, restructuring helps doing that -- helps us do that, and then some of the stuff that we still have left to do this year in terms of routing efficiencies, warehouse, things of that nature, that's got to continue to drive those costs down. So I know that's not a lot of specifics for you, Ajay, but I want to keep it in context with the guidance that we provided you in the past.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. That was actually very helpful. I just had one final question around issues related to customer mix. I think you had mentioned that one aspect of the mix issue is your sort of end market exposure to independents. But in terms of what's mostly behind the gross margin performance, it sounded like -- Chris, like based on your prepared comments, roughly 1\/4 of that decline was purely mix related, and then the rest was impacted by underlying demand from your street account customers and based on market condition. So I just wanted to ask how much of the gross margin weakness do you think is market-share driven, loss of share to other Broadline distributors? And to the extent that you're dealing with competitive headwinds to other food service distributors, I also wanted to ask if you expect any relief on competitive pressures heading into fiscal '14?","William J. DeLaney","Ajay, you hit a nerve there, so I'm going to start and I'll let Chris dive in. Look, I don't think we're losing any market share to other Broadline competitors, okay? We don't really know where the industry is at right now, but there's no reason to believe that this industry is growing the first 6 months of the year. So there may be some other people, some of the nontraditional ones, that are taking share from the Broadliners as a group. But on an overall basis, I would say to you we believe we're continuing to take share. I would acknowledge on the local and independent operator side, there's some markets where we're getting beat a little bit right now. But overall, I don't think we're getting beat. And I just wanted to kind of get that out there before Chris cleans this up.","Robert C. Kreidler","I don't know that I'm going to touch that one now. Look, Ajay, good question. There are a lot of ways that we can cut up, chop up gross margin changes year-over-year. And some of that makes sense and some, frankly, that I don't believe do make sense. All we're really trying to pull out now, because we're not trying to put a bunch of excuses out there, is mix. Because we continue to say mix is somewhat, frankly, it's not one we're going to apologize for, because as long as we continue to grow our business in all quadrants, we have the potential for mix reduction. It's not that we're disappointed that we're growing in our corporate managed sales, it's that we're not growing fast enough in our locally managed sales. So we're not really apologizing for the mix, we're just kind of cutting it out so that you all know what the impact is. I mean, similarly, the acquisitions that we've done, the vast majority of them were done right around the calendar year end. Those things typically come in at lower margins, right? And it takes a while for us to get them to our margins. So that's part of the impact. I'm not calling it out because I'm not asking to present it as an excuse. I don't have the analytics around it. But there are things like that, that impact that margin, in addition to a dozen other things we've talked about, in addition to competitive pressure, et cetera, et cetera. All we're really saying is, what we were trying to, I don't know, 8 quarters ago, delineate all the different things that are impacting gross margins, frankly, they're all in the same set of competitive pressures that we've got to continue to fight and overcome. And we're just going to call out the ones -- the one that we talked about, which is mix, which is kind of very real and that we should be able to give you more insight in as we go forward.","Operator","And we'll go next to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG","Just a couple of questions. In terms of your comments on fiscal '14, I think the term or the wording was fiscal '14 is kind of a year where things start to turn around. Is that assuming no change in the economic environment or a slight improvement? Can you just give us a little color there?","William J. DeLaney","Well, we would hope for slight improvement. That always helps. But no, that would assume pretty much the same environment, Karen. Maybe little bit of improvement, but what it's really geared at is just we feel we have locked in some of these cost savings that Chris referenced. We recognize that we need to continue to work on the gross margin. But we just think we're better positioned going forward today than we have been in some time. I think the cash flow performance from last year could serve as a leading indicator of the type of progress, hopefully, we can make. We'll see. But bottom line is -- I know it's hard to see sometimes when you're looking at the numbers being reported. But in this type of business, you feel things getting better before you see it, and then you see it and then it shows up in the numbers. And what we've tried to signal today's comments and Q&A, is we think we can grow the top line, we've got a lot of good things going on in acquisitions. We think we're on top of our cost structure, we'll continue to make strides there, and we need to manage the margin better. And we've got good initiatives going on there to do that.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. And then the next question is given that you are kind of starting to get, I guess, out of the woods in terms of this SAP implementation, wondering what your appetite might be for a larger acquisition? I mean, you've obviously demonstrated an appetite for smaller ones. But as you can kind of shift gears and maybe focus your attention on something else, do you have an appetite for larger acquisitions, if it were available?","William J. DeLaney","We have an appetite for larger acquisitions, the right kind of acquisitions. I would break it down into 2 different times. I mean, if there was an opportunity to do some things, say it was more adjacent or maybe different geographic markets of size, those would probably be easier for us to absorb at this point in time. If it was in our core space, I'd like to see us get further down the road on both the technology deployment and the category management. But assuming that those initiatives go well here over the next 6 to 9 months, I think we'd be in a better position operationally to absorb something like that.","Operator",".","And we'll take our last question from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.","Mark Wiltamuth","Question, you had mentioned in the transcript there that you've seen more attention from customers asking for fresh and natural products. And how do you really address that since you seem to be more focused on packaged and canned and products of that nature? And are you losing any share to some of the more specialty purveyors on perishables?","William J. DeLaney","Okay, Mark, it's Bill. Look, this is a trend that we've seen coming for quite a while. We're doing -- just as an aside, I mean, we're doing a lot of really nice things in our sustainability work, which -- I'll let you review that report, it's out there online. But in terms of the business itself, I would just remind everybody, we're a full Broadline distributor and we have several specialty companies; meat, produce, imports, et cetera, et cetera. So there's really very little product out there that we can't distribute. We work very closely both with local suppliers and farmers as we do with regional and national suppliers. So the challenge there, really in all honesty, is to identify where the demand is and the volume, and create enough volume to justify bringing the SKU in and the cost of distributing those SKUs. So it just comes down to essentially locking in on the right opportunity for the right customer, and there's no reason why we can't participate there. I will acknowledge that, that's an area that we maybe historically have not been as strong at, but I think you'll see us continue to grow there, both through our core business, as we said, and potentially, through more acquisitions, as we've made in the past.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Is the challenge there that it's really a diffuse set of expectations from the customers, you can't really hone in on a set of SKUs that works across the board?","William J. DeLaney","It's multiple challenges. One is that, yes. And I think -- but I think to me, frankly, the bigger challenge is just breaking down what do the words mean. So fresh is one thing, natural is another and local's a third. And so, is local better? Is it fresh? That kind of thing. So it essentially just comes down to really understanding the needs of the customer, why they are looking for that product and making sure we're all clear on what the advantages are. So some of these words tend to get co-mingled but they're all very different in terms of what they mean. So we're just trying to create as much clarity as we can with the customer, and then we can work with all types of suppliers, as I've mentioned, to be responsive there.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And on the SAP issue, what is really tied to that in terms of the cost savings? Is it accounting duplication that you'll be getting rid of? Or what things are gated there? Because you are hitting your marks and exceeding them on the cost savings to date, but there must be some things tied to the SAP that you're aiming at for the next couple of years for cost saves?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes. Once we get the full SAP platform rolled out, there will be some additional savings. Now some of it, at least some of the savings that we originally identified, we accelerated. The maintenance module is already out and installed, so we are accelerating that. The HR module will come out. We will accelerate that. What's left is going to be a few areas, one, yes, finance will be one of them. There'll be some additional labor savings out in the field as we consolidate more work into our shared services center and a few other functions. There will be some ancillary savings from having that fully rolled out and being able to fully ramp up our shared services center and get the labor arbitrage that usually comes with doing that.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference.

This morning Sysco reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results. Our performance reflects both the soundness of our strategy, the commitment of our associates to supporting the success of our customers and the consistently improving execution of our three-year plan.","For the quarter, on a comparable 13-week basis, Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of 5% while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to less than 2% which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of approximately 15% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 15% as well. These results were achieved in a market environment that is experiencing uneven trends and appears to have softened somewhere off-late, while consumer confidence in unemployment data points remain relatively favorable compared to a few years ago. The current sentiment for customer spending and meals away from home seems to be trending slightly downward.","Turning to specific restaurant industry data, overall sales trends weakened as reflected in current NPD and KNAPP-TRACK Traffic and spend data. That said, according to National Restaurant Association, restaurant operator expectations remain somewhat favorable.","Moving to our results for fiscal 2016, I'm very pleased with our performance during the year. The improving momentum in our business is a result of strong local case growth, gross profit growth, with gross margin expansion and solid expense management. Specifically, for fiscal 2016, on an adjusted 52-week basis, we delivered the following results.","Total broad line cases grew 3% and local cases grew 2.7%. Sales grew 1.5% to $50 billion, even with the unfavorable impact of deflation and foreign exchange headwinds. Gross profit grew 3.6% to $9 billion and gross margin increased 38 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased 10% over the prior year to $2 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 12 %. In addition free cash flow approximated $1.4 billion. And adjusted return on invested capital was 14% for the year. I particularly encourage our progress today toward the achievement of our three year plan financial objectives, especially our goal-to-grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2018. ","Our strong progress towards the achievement these financial objectives is supported by a foundation that was built over the past several years through a series of commercial, supply chain and administrative initiatives. We continue to build on that foundation throughout fiscal 2016 by accomplishing several key objectives, including, Leveraging customer insights to create new and enhanced sales marketing programs, advancing our progress in several key commercial areas; including category and revenue management. Shifting our technology strategy and related spend to a more customer centric focus, And restructuring our business to drive greater efficiency including; Streamlining our market structure, introducing a standard field organization model, and further developing a functional structure in key support areas such as merchandising, supply chain and human resources.","All of this is been accomplished by consistently improving the execution of our strategy, that was centered on five fundamental points. Partnership, too profoundly and receive experience of doing business with Sysco. Productivity, to continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business; Products, to enhance our friends through a customer centric innovation program; People, Leveraging talent structure and culture to drive performance and portfolio, continuously assessing new market opportunities and current business performance. ","Regarding the latter point; we recently close the acquisition of the brakes group a $5 billion European food service distributor, with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden. Brakes is a highly regarded company whose management team and strategy are well aligned with the vision we have for Sysco, to be our customers most valued and trusted business partner. This acquisition will serve as a platform for future expansion in Europe. We're looking forward to working together with the entire Brakes team to execute their business strategy and we feel fortunate to welcome them into the Sysco family. ","Joe will discuss with you in a few minutes anticipated contribution of Brakes to Sysco financial results. As we enter the new fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level working effectively together as one Sysco and we remain committed to the success of our customers. We have even bigger goals for fiscal 2017. And I'm confident our ability to achieve our financial and business objectives in the year ahead and throughout the three year plan. ","The new fiscal year brings expanded global presence, enhanced technology and continued focus on our customers. Specifically we intend to deliver solid local case growth, increase our gross profit, reduce costs in the right way and put crosses in tools in place that will further enable our associates to provide our customers with industry leading service and support. Our past and future success is driven by the ongoing dedication and commitment of all of our associates. And I think each of them for their effort to deliver a very successful year in fiscal 2016. ","And now turn the call over to Tom. ","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Thank you, Neil, and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2016 was a great year for Sysco and I'm proud of the contributions made by all of our associates throughout the year. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance and excellent progress on several key multi-year initiatives that begun to provide a strong foundation for success. Our payroll operating performance was driven by our ongoing focus on the key drivers of our three year plan, including accelerating our sales with local customers by providing them with exceptional service, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses. ","This morning I provide an update on some of the initiatives related to our three year plan and how they have continued to positively impact our business results. The first of which is our focus on accelerating local case grow. During the year we grew U.S. broadline local cases 2.6 % unadjusted 52 week basis. Strongest performance we've had several years, also an adjusted 52 week basis gross profit in U.S. broadline group 4.7 % for the fiscal year in gross margin increased 47 basis points driven by our focus on profitable case grow, revenue management activities and improve Sysco brand penetration. ","The focus our sales teams had on helping our customers succeed and grow has been further enhanced throughout the school year 2016. During the year we remain focused on improving our industry leading category management practices, only deploying revenue management in the field and enhancing our sales training and support tools to continue to free up our marketing associates time to better support our customers with business building solutions. We also rolled out various promotional programs in key initiatives throughout the year, including those that highlight product innovation and reinforce the Sysco brand which delivers tremendous value to our customers that values delivered through an unrelenting focus on the highest quality products, investing class traceability from a food safety perspective. ","Finally, we continue to focus on delivering new and improved customer facing technology solutions, that value to their business and all our associates to be more efficient. On the cost side, the expense management throughout the year was also solid remains a key area of focus moving forward. For U.S. broadline during fiscal year 2016 we limited total adjust expense growth to only 2.2 % on a compatible 52 week basis compared to gross profit growth of 4.7 %. We also reduced our overall cost per case U.S. broadline by $0.04 during the year. I just think of the impact of fuel prices are just a cost per case in U. S. front line was flat. ","As we discussed, we've been very focused on reducing costs and improving productivity while continuing to deliver improved service levels to our customers. In fiscal 2016 we reduced expenses and a number of key areas. The supply chain area, we have reduced indirect span will continue to focus on maximizing transportation and warehouse sufficiency. We've also standardized organizational design and reduce the number of our markets in the U.S. from 8 to 6. And throughout the organization we have reduced overall SG&A cost.","In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly reclined around improving our customers experience, engaging our associates of the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our three year plan. In fiscal year 2016 we made significant progress in all areas, now remain extremely optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success. ","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer. ","Joel Grade","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results of the fourth quarter and the full year. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case grow, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management.","I begin my remarks by speaking to our fourth quarter. For the purposes of matching your models our fourth quarter results reflecting next week include; Sales growth of 10.0 %, gross profit growth of 12.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 9.6%, adjusted operating income growth of 23.4% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 23.1%. Excluding the extra weeks on a comparable basis, the fourth quarter results include; sales growth of 2.2%, sales profit growth of 4.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 1.7%, adjusted operating income growth of 14.6% and adjusted earnings per share growth a 15.4%. ","Sales during the quarter negatively impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange of 0.5%, partially offset by an increase in sales from acquisitions of 1.2%. Our comparable 13 week basis total broadline case go through the fourth quarter was 2.2%, Local is 2.4%. And corporate manage growth was 2.0%.","During the fourth quarter we had some certain items that impacted our results. In the prior year we've acquisition costs $390 million, in the current year. We have re measurement of foreign denominated cash due to lower exchange rates a quarter as well as the premium foreign currency option contracts for the Brakes acquisition. As results other expenses net for the quarter was approximately $141 million primarily driven by certain items from fiscal 2016. ","As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35% compared to negative 6% in the prior year. Both quarter tax rates reduce primarily from the impact of certain items, which lord of net income and resulted in lower tax rates. A similar event occurred last year related to the U.S. suits termination costs which drove an unusual gap tax rate. On an adjusted for certain items basis our tax it would have been approximately 36.8% in both years. ","Now turning to our results for the year; our fiscal 2016 including the extra week included sales growth of 3.5%, gross profit growth of 5.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 4%, adjusted operating income growth 12.1%, and adjusted EPS growth of 14.1%. To provide a relevant comparison the prior year all income statement measures I discuss from this point forward, will be adjusted for certain items and presented on a 52 week comparable bases. ","Looking at our full year results; we grew sales by 1.5 % year-over-year despite deflation of 0.7%. We saw continued deflation and sat in center of the plate protein categories, such as meat and seafood along with deflation in diary. Sales from acquisition increase sales by 0.7%. During the year we closed five acquisitions including Gilchrist & Soames, and North Star Seafood.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.3% largely driven by the US dollar's strength against the Canadian dollar. The negative impact we have been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening, as we begin to wrap initial decline in relative value to Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis; sales would have been up 2.7%. ","Turning to case growth; consistent with our three year plan to achieve discipline case growth, we had strong performance for the year. On a comparable 52 week basis, Total broadline case growth through the year was 3%, Local was 2.7%, and corporate managed was 3.3%. ","Looking at gross profit and gross margins for the year we grew our gross profit on a solid 3.6% we'll also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 38 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvements include a category management, more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit growth is 4.8%; adjusted operating expense on a comparable 52-week basis is 2% for the year and by 3.3% on a constant currency basis. This increase is mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals; and is partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending; it is still cost and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in a reduced cost per case as Tom mentioned which is flat, excluding fuel price changes.","As a result adjusted operating income for the year was $1.96 dollars, up 9.6% compared the prior year, and up 10.6% on a constant currency basis. Compared to the prior year on 52-week basis, adjusted net earnings grew 8% and adjusted earnings per share grew 12%. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion off approximately 24% from last year. It is important to note that a timing difference in tax payments impacts our cash flow during fiscal 2016.","Net working capital improvement by six times a day for the full year compared to last year. This was largely driven by improvements in inventory. Net CapEx for the full year was $504 million and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $280 million in fiscal 2016. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods.","Lastly, we improved our adjusted return on invested capital to approximately 14% during the fiscal year, up from approximately 13% in the prior year.","Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2017. The deflationary trend has been persistent over the last four quarters and will likely continue through the remainder of the calendar year, creating modest sales and gross profit headwind for the first half year. The restaurant environment appears to be softening and as a result, we anticipate modest case volume growth for the next quarter or two. Capital expenditures during 2017 are expected to be approximately 1% of sales, including Brakes.","We intend to continue to improve working capital days to achieve our three-year-plan goal of four days' improvement when comparing fiscal year 2018 to fiscal 2015. And we expect to complete our $3 billion, two-year share repurchase program during fiscal 2017. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal 2017, driven by a reduction in average shares outstanding. Regarding the addition of Brakes to Sysco's financial results, we expect the combined company will have roughly $55 billion in annualized revenue on a pro forma basis. ","In our most recent fiscal year, ending December 2015, Brakes reported nearly $5 million in revenue, up roughly approximately 6.5% from 2014. They also reported an approximate 5% adjusted EBITDA margin with a double-digit growth rate. Roughly two-thirds of their revenue comes from the United Kingdom, where they have a leading share. We continue to believe this acquisition will be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share by lower- to mid-single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in fiscal 2018 and beyond. This acquisition is also expected to reduce our normalized effective tax rate to about 35% to 36%. ","In summary, we had a strong quarter and year, reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives in our two-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I feel confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan.","Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Merissa Sullivan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Merissa Sullivan","Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about gross margins and see how much [Technical Difficulty].","William DeLaney","It's challenging when to answer that specifically. I think you will see some correlation over the last four or five quarters, where as we see some deflation, the more margins moved up. We're making good progress on relative margin trends before that, but I would tell you that we believe a significant amount of the improvement is coming from a lot of these initiatives I referred and that Tom spoke to in more detail along the lines of category management, revenue management, the work we're doing in segmentation, tools we're providing our sales force, so I can't quantify exactly but I think it's coming from multiple sources.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Yes, I think the only thing I would add is you heard me talk about fully deploying revenue management. We're now at a place where we've got it within our entire organization. And so I think we continue to believe that, as Bill said, a combination of all those things are allowing us to manage the difficult deflationary environment that we've been in.","Merissa Sullivan","All right, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. You mentioned the uneven environment. I just want to see if you can comment further on the restaurant industry trends and specifically what you're seeing from both your independent customers and your chain customers. Thank you.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Well, it's not just what we're seeing -- I think it's what we're hearing from other folks that are speaking to their results, both in the operator side and some of our peers in the industry. So I think it's just a little bit softer. I think the good news here: People are still relatively optimistic, both the consumer confidence in general and the restaurant operators. When you look at those indices and compare them over the last couple of years, generally, the outlook is favorable, but we're just seeing some softening in terms of the slope of the growth, and specifically, we're seeing it in traffic continuing to be flat, and check size up in some segments, flat in other segments. So it's no one place, it's a relative comment. We're still seeing growth but it's just not the same trajectory that we saw a couple quarters ago.","Merissa Sullivan","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","John Heinbockel","So let me start, either for Bill or Tom, I guess a lot of your end customers are struggling a little bit with the value of creation relative to eating at home, and if you think about the next several years with wage inflation likely to increase in the restaurant space, what do you do today or, more importantly, if you look out over the next two or three years, to help them deal with that? So what are the opportunities as it relates to more Sysco brand, selective price investments. How do you think about helping them compete and maybe drive some market share for yourself?","William DeLaney","Good morning, John. I'll start but I'll let Tom kind of get into the meat of that a little bit more. I think just from my perspective, this market place has been extremely competitive for most of my career and even more so since 2009, and we continue to see that. I think some operators are doing fine. And the best operators are going to do well and the best distributors are going to do well, and I think that will continue to play out. So I think it's -- everyone has their own unique challenges, but if you're investing in your business, if you're listening to your customer base, and if you can scale what you're good at, I think you're going to continue to have good success here. So you hit on a couple things that we're doing, but I'll let Tom take you through and remind the group here all the different things that we're doing to differentiate ourselves to our customers.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","John, maybe just to build on a couple things; while you're right, there are some reports out there, some traffic headwinds for some of these folks. The good news for them obviously is that in a deflationary environment, is their cost of products in general are not necessarily going up. So that's been a good thing for those restaurant operators. But from our perspective, we spend a lot of our time trying to think about what are those areas where we can help them be more successful. You mentioned labor rates potentially going up; that's obviously a key concern of many of these operators today.","And so whether its Sysco brand, where we bring not only value but also things I talked about which is great reliability and traceability and high-quality products. That's a big area of focus for us. The tools, think about some of the innovative products we're bringing. We're focused on how do we reduce the labor costs for these operators. So if there are products that are labor-saving type of products in the preparation, that allows them to leverage some of those things that offset -- maybe some potential labor increases they're seeing.","And as Bill said, I think technology and tools in general that allow them to manage their business more efficiently are also things we're focused on. So it's really a combination of things but it's -- you're right, there's a lot of things that they're dealing with and I think the more we can focus on helping them be successful, that's a good place for us to be.","John Heinbockel","All right. And then secondly, I know it's early, but have you seen any reaction or change in Brakes' performance or their end demand post Brexit? Or that ends up being kind of an overblown issue?","William DeLaney","I don't think it's overblown, John, I think it's just too early to tell. Heading into Brexit, I would say as we got into March and April, we did see through their eyes or get some feel for it and the data out there, there was some slowing in their business in the UK just in general, and a lot of that was attributed to the uncertainty of Brexit. And I think the implied thought would be that once there was certainty, that things would kind of bounce back a little bit. I think that assumed that the certainty would remain. And obviously the vote went the other way, so now what you've got is continued uncertainty. So I just think it's going to be an extended period of time here. And I think it'll play out politically, it'll play out economically, so it's a little slower in the UK right now. The good news for us is it seems to be -- we seem to be seeing some good things coming out of France and Sweden; I believe that's about a third of their business. ","So I think as far as Brexit's concerned, I think we're all watching it and to this point, I don't know that I've seen clear analysis in terms of what the specific impact is going to be at a certain point in some. My judgment would say that it's going to play out over the next two or three years; it will become business as usual here over that period of time and it'll be somewhat of a headwind in the context of uncertainty that our people will work through in their market place.","Joel Grade","Yes, and I think this one thing I could add -- it's Joel -- I'd just remind you, certainly while there's some short-term instability that this creates, to some extent, we certainly again remain very bullish of this, as a long-term value creator for this company. And a great management team, great platform for future growth, and again, just an overall good long-term view, despite some of those slight -- again, some short-term instability as a result.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward Kelly","Hi, good morning, guys, and nice quarter. I'd like to start with just the outlook. So you guys took 20% to 30% of the $500 million EBIT target in 2016, I think, which at the high end of that would be $150 million. You just did $173 million, excluding the extra week, $217 million if you include it. I guess the first part of this question: So what drove that upside to how you were initially thinking about things? And then as we think about 2017, you talked about 50% to 60%, which is probably like $300 million at the high end of the range. That does now seem kind of low, so how should we think bout 2017, given that you're ahead of where you thought you'd be at this point? Thank you.","William DeLaney","Thank you. I'll start. I'll let Joel get into detail a little bit more. I would say in terms of why our performance for 2016 was better than originally what we projected, I think part of it is just having the time to refine the plan and to go deep on the plan. And our execution was just very good. So if you put all this into some type of context, our merger agreement with US Foods was terminated in late June, we regrouped as a management team very quickly, in July we put together the framework of a three-year plan and shared that with the investor group in September, along the way with our Board.","And so I wouldn't say we were cautious, but we certainly were thoughtful in terms of what we were leading people to and as we built some momentum, if you'll recall, first quarter, we had a very solid quarter, U.S. broad line, but there's some tailwinds with incentives and it kind of -- or headwinds with incentives and the first quarter was a little flattish and then very strong, second, third, and fourth. So we built momentum as the year went along. To bring it back to numbers, we've been able to manage this deflationary environment very well and create a good spread between our gross profit growth and our expense growth, by managing our expenses very smartly and thoughtfully. ","So overall, I would just say the execution has been good and -- very good, and as we got deeper into the year we were able to raise our estimate to $500,000. Not quite ready to do that right now, I'd like to get further into this plan; we're a third of the way through it, so I'd like to see another quarter or two and see how we perform, see how the market place performs, and reassess that outlook at that point in time. Joel?","Joel Grade","Yes, I think that's really the context that I'd put that into. Is that we're through the first year now of our three-year plan, to the point that you made and Bill certainly reinforced. Good momentum to business, and in the end, a little bit of softness that we're seeing in the industry, but certainly feeling good about where we're at. I think the comment Bill kind of closed with is what I would close with, as well. Is that again, it's still early on, and I'd like to give it a little bit of time under our belt before we take a look at if there's anything else we wanted to do there.","Edward Kelley","Okay. And just, I wanted to follow up. One of the, to me, more impressed with sort of under the radar accomplishments for you guys is this dramatic improvement in the free cash flow. Can you talk just a little about what's been driving that and the opportunity that you see left here, no payables, there seems like there's a fairly large opportunity. Just thought on sort of where we can expect that line item to play out over the next couple of years. ","William DeLaney","Yes, sure. I think, a couple things on that, and certainly number one, we had strong operating performance. And so that's certainly generated by a good part of the free cash-flow, you talk about the focus we had on working capital. You know we've had some we aggressive goals the start of a three year plan, and I think one of a primary benefits this year was in focus on inventory and we made some good progress in that area. And I think you'll continue to see the opportunity there again both on the table's area as well as inventory and someone they are as well so we got some continued focus on working capital of that I believe we're making good progress on and will continue to drive that. We did some benefit this year of as I mentioned.","And some timing issues on cash taxes, things that were related to of the timing of payments and ability to accelerate some deductions having so that we are we also did have something in some going the other way in the U.S. foods payments that we made the first quarter of this year. so I would guess what I would say in general as I think the level of free cash-flow you are seeing that we experiences years is a pretty reasonable view of what I believe this business can generate here as we move forward, over the next couple years and so I think I think we're good place we're going to continue driving initiatives that were driving improve that performances as well. ","Edward Kelley","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Zachary Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Zachary Fadem","Good morning, it looks like there was a conversion in in total broadline versus the local case growth in the quarter can you talk about the driver's hearing how trends played out just throughout the quarter and you mention already the performance of chains verses independence but what about your institutional customers like the healthcare and WeCare vertical power they trending. ","William DeLaney","Zach, would you be more clear what you mean by conversion. ","Zachary Fadem ","Well, I mean when you look at the broadline case trend and the local case trend, they both converged at that but you know.","William DeLaney","The numbers okay. And. So I would think for times about the segments a little bit. I think it's just what you said. You know we and I would say by this business understands that where we have the opportunity to bring the most value, it isn't that look we managed highly street-oriented customer base and we continue to focus there in a myriad of ways that we spoke to in terms of a commercial initiatives, supply chain, and all that type of thing. And that's continued to pay dividends force or less than two years plus. As we feel good about that we also want to continue to grow the corporate managed business in the right way, and so you are seeing the slope of the growth of the fall of somewhat but it's still positive and there is still very, very important relationships with others with some very large customers, That work for us as well from profitability standpoint. ","So the balance is always the key here and it's -- this is key if you're running an operating company and its key from a -- from the overall corporate standpoint which as you saw here's quarter with pretty good balance, so in any points time one segment you called that for a moment may be going a little faster than the other and that's okay but generally we're looking to grow both in the right way with good discipline and that we've been making great strides are last a year two. So I'll let Tom speak a little about this segment performance.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Yes. The only exact I'll add is, around this segment you think you mentioned chains and also healthcare, we continue to feel good about each of the segments in their growth potential for us, honestly healthcare's continued to be growth segment for this industry and I think the chain business while it's going to have it choppiness depending on which customer you're talking about overall that business, I think is going to continue to be solid out there. For us I think it's a really is built on a balance in so looking at different customers in their relative profitability and where we can actually have the most value was where we trying to focus our efforts. And clearly, that's in that local restaurant segment certainly, probably more, so than in the chain restaurants segment. But overall I think we don't see necessarily other than some of the chain number you've seen, from some of those companies we see fairly consistent a performance across these segments. ","Zachary Fadem","And then to touch on breaks out quickly can you talk about just margin opportunities there you mentioned it's a 5% adjusted EBITDA margin, but can you talk about some of the facility and productivity efforts there and how do you think about the long term margin opportunity, and how that can play out. ","Bill DeLaney","Well Joe said, we made significant investment here for the long term, we certainly expect and will grow their business on the top line, they have very similar approach as we do especially in the UK in terms of a disciplined approach, they are as we've alluded to in the past and going through some significant transformative change of their own, a fair amount which is played out in the supply chain in the United Kingdom, where they're consolidating warehouses into warehouses that look more like ours where you have multiple capacity -- storage capacity all in one building which in and of itself what will create cost savings, improve productivity that kind of thing.","So certainly, the supply chain in particular and UK is an opportunity for Brakes to expand their margins. But there's other opportunities as well starting with growing with the right customers and making sure that those customers are interfacing with them and ordering product in the way that they want to the chances they prefer. So they've a lot of the same opportunities that we have. ","Zachary Fadem","Great, thanks Bill, appreciate the color guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Ann Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kelly Bania ","Hi, good morning. Wanted to just follow up on the independence, I realize it is moderated slightly but still very solid growth I think if you look over the past several years the lease, so just wondered if you when you analyze that segment what are you seeing there that's really the drivers there that is it still pretty broad based, are there any ethnic categories or regions or when you talk to your customers there is there any difference in take out or dying in trends, just trying to understand what you think the real drivers are for the independent or local case growth. ","William DeLaney","Sure, I'll take that. The thing about the independent segment there's been a lot of discussion around whether it's growing or not the growing, I think the way we look at it is we have significant opportunity to grow in that segment and I think if you think about the fact that there are many distributors in the industry, there's opportunities for us is to earn additional share of that business from our customers. So we're very focused on delivering the kind of things that they need which we talk about a lot of those value drivers for our customers and whether things like Sysco brand of some of the tools that were bring them help them manage their business better. In addition you mention some segments you heard us talk about some of the ethnic segments, we obviously there's been a nice tailwind in the Hispanic Latino restaurant segment, it's been a focus area for us and so we continue to look at those types of opportunities where there's nice kind of tail winds that week can provide incremental value to those folks and also grow our business. ","And I just say that overall that segment feels like they're picking up some share potentially in this away from home and whether it additional opportunities for home deliveries you talk about, we here and we all see some of these trends taking place with some of these folks who are creating that opportunity for those local restaurants, and I think they are back benefiting from some of those technology solutions as well. ","Kelly Bania ","Great, that's very helpful. Then in terms of deflation I think you know it was called out as one of the drivers or maybe not drivers' one of the factors that favorably impacted gross margin this year, and I think you called it out of the gross profit headwind for the first half of next year. So just curious is that just because of the sales impact or is there a change in how you expect the deflation to impact your gross margin in the first half of 2017. ","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Hi Kelly, Joel will explain it to you better than I can but it's just the way you think about math. Alright so gross profit is dollars, so when you're selling a case for whatever 0.7% or 1% less than you did same time Lasher you're obviously taking fewer dollars to pay your expenses with that said from on a percentage basis so that they can contribute to an expansion of your margin for saying, I think that's really the main point I mean if you think about portion of our business is being on cost plus. And just in general they were the cost of goods, there is again some margin percentage increase but it is a tip of the headwind on the gross profit dollars themselves of course. Having said that certainly there's great work being done by Tom and his team and our associates actually offset some of that to the extent we can. ","Joel Grade","Tom made an interesting point, which I am I think our customers perspective well we're now a fan of deflation and this is -- we're now as we speak in our fifth quarter of that so that's we don't think that's particularly give thanks for our customers or for us certainly over the medium to long term with that said, if it was going to happen try came the right time for customer bases are dealing with some wage inflation as well, so it's probably been good on the customer side we've been able to manage it well, but we would certainly prefer to see no inflation, modest inflation that type of thing in a more steady state environment. ","Kelly Bania ","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research. Your line is open.","Ajay Jain","Bill, in you're prepared comments I think you mentioned a slowdown in traffic up from NPD and I think you cited nap crack also and I think last week case growth was also sequentially weaker slightly U.S. foods. so I just wanted to ask apart from the software industry wide trends are there any kind of company specific factors in terms of any slowdown in case growth and has there been any change in the trend line quarter-to-date in terms of traffic in average check, is there any incremental change in the trajectory a quarter-to-date, thanks. ","William DeLaney","Well, again we're talking about earnings from the June quarter, but what I'm telling you is we've seen Softening and the customer base, both from the date usage side as well as what we see, so well obviously what we're seeing here is there there's some softening in the business, as I also said we're still seeing growth and I would expect that will continue to see growth, perhaps not the same trajectory but also has a big secular development I think it's just we go through these cycles of time will tell whether so many site we're not, but if you -- if you agree all the data that we also are exposed to what you're seeing in this industry is pretty consistent, when you're seeing in the economy right now that its growth but it's modest, and I think that's where customers are dealing with right now.","So our focus continues to be you know how do we support our customers to grow their business profitably and do the same for us at the same time and I've never felt better about our ability to do that, we've got a great team here a very solid strategy, we're executing well also you were going to impact and control what we can control and will work through cycles as they come and go.","Ajay Jain","Okay, and I just have one follow up question on Brakes, I think you already got several questions on Brexit. Can you specifically talk about the currency impact and just on restaurants spending overall in the UK because I guess the currency impact could be viewed as threefold you've got to direct P&L impact which is fairly you know straightforward but then the currency also impact the purchasing power of the UK consumers and it also affects your purchase price for the acquisition. so I think you're partly hedged on the currency impact, can you just comment on how big of an incremental impact there is from Brexit compared to what you anticipated, when you consummated the other merger and can you also just talk about current case trends that at Brakes, I think you mentioned that they took a little bit of a step backwards. Can you confirm whether they're positive or negative based on year-over-year comparison, thanks? ","William DeLaney","There are three questions in there; actually I think what I said about Brakes is the UK market in general. What we've seen it is as if from March and April and I was connected to Brexit the uncertainty of the Brexit vote by and instant the vote you know we see some softening over there in that market and the data in the government it will perform -- support that as well [indiscernible], the position I was to come in their numbers you just a because that -- last month but will talk more about that certainly in November when we release for the first quarter, we feel good about this show so we feel very good about this acquisition, about the leadership investing for the long term, acquisition platform all the things we said on from the beginning, so Brexit I'm going to let Joel take you through the currency issues I think we manage it quite well actually as far as the transaction goes, as you said there's normal translation of earnings and that type of thing. ","And I wound up in dispute all your points I would just say from my perspective the bigger issue as far as Brexit concern is always is what it comes down to here in our markets as well, is what's the impact on the consumer. I think it's less about foreign exchange at the consumer level. And because of some of the uncertainty we see some softening over there. The weather I mean you hear all the same things whether in London you know in the summertime there kind things, so I think there's going to be some ups and downs will be the better position to talk about in November but overall we're very pleased the acquisition. We have a lot of work to do there and we're very excited about it.","Joel Grade ","Yes, I would just add a couple things I mean the translation impacts again certainly will be something will be dealing as we move forward in terms of the prices also as we mention there was actually we had a foreign currency re-measurement that basically resulted from the fact that, at the end of the year, we were holding strong on our balance sheet for the purchase price. Of course, the deal closed right after the year, so we had -- the balance sheet needs to be revalued to the exchange rate that exists at that point in time. Our team did a great job of hedging to protect us on the upside and purchasing currency opportunistically to maximize our ability to minimize that foreign exchange devaluation.","But we did experience some of that, and some of which was also reflected in the end purchase price. But overall, again, I would just tell you we'll continue to manage through that stuff and, as Bill said, continue to focus on driving -- focus on the customers and the operational performance of that company.","Ajay Jain","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.","Karen Short","Hi, just going back -- sorry to harp on this softness -- recent softness question. I guess if you had to fill -- kind of rank potential causes, I mean, I would think value equation maybe being out of whack is on the list, but maybe recent unrest, terrorism domestically, Olympics, people staying home\u2026any way you can kind of rank any of that?","William Delaney","I don't know that I'd rank any of that in my top three, but Karen, I'll share a view[ph part 14 1;29] on some of that. You know, we read a lot and try to learn as much as we can from folks that follow all the components of the industry. I just think it's a little bit of a malaise. I just think it's -- you know, you're going to have these cycles and sub-cycles in any point in time, and some of it, we've been going up against some stronger numbers a year ago, so there's some math in it. But it just feels a little bit softer out there. I think people are being a little more cautious with their spend. Maybe the election, maybe -- I'm not sure. ","So I guess I wouldn't want to just conjecture here, but I don't think it's the Olympics, I don't think it's any one thing in particular. I just think it's a little softer and it seems to be showing up in multiple places, so I don't think it's a certain type of customer per se or anything like that. I just think it's one of these sub-cycles we're going to go through and time will tell whether it's a three- to six-month deal or longer. But again, from our perspective, we've been managing through some pretty significant headwinds this year, and I couldn't be more pleased with how we've been executing. So, again, we can't totally control the industry top line, but I feel good about what we're doing in our space and how we're driving earnings and at the same time, staying very close to our customers and focusing on what's important to them. So that's the best I can probably give you from our stance.","Karen Short","Okay, that's helpful. And then I'm just curious. One of your competitors recently gave some data on percent of sales from independent restaurants coming from an e-commerce platform -- from their e-commerce platform: at a pretty high 50%. I guess I'm just wondering if you can give some color on where you stand on local penetration as a percent of independent sales and just an update on where you're at with that.","William Delaney","I'll let Tom speak to that more specifically. I would just remind you that our strategy is really predicated on being the most valued, trusted business partner. So we're not setting goals per se for certain percentage of Sysco brand or certain percentage of orders through mobile or digital. With that said, we certainly understand that we need to make the experience with Sysco as easy as possible and certainly, being able to order online when you want to order, the way you want to order, that those are very important and increasingly important to our customers. So we've got a lot of good work going on with our digital platform to make that experience a more positive one and a productive one for our customers.","So our numbers are modest but they're beginning to grow but, again, the overall target is here, is to drive the business in the right way, it's not necessarily to hit a particular percentage. Go ahead.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","So Karen, I'll just build a little bit on that. I think in the past, we've talked about we've been somewhat in this kind of high, single-digit just below 10% through the fourth quarter. Now we're seeing over 10% of our orders for these local customers coming through this mobile or digital platform. So we do see some progression continue to happen, but as Bill said, it's really for us about creating the environment where they can order how they want, when they want, and where they want. And so there were also a few tools we needed to build to be able get in place, to enable them to do that more effectively. And we've got some of those tools now in place, and that we believe we'll continue to see that number grow as more customers have that interest.","But we also know from a lot of the work we do that our marketing associates are one of the most highest valued resources we have and that we provide our customers. So we're trying to make sure that we balance the how they order with the service and support they need to get day in and day out from our selling resources. So we feel good about the progress but certainly we'll probably see that continue to grow, but we're very focused on the overall customer experience and letting them choose.","Karen Short","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mark Wiltamuth","Hi, thank you. Can you give us a little color on the deflation by category, and are there certain quarters where you're going to start lapping at some of the bigger headwinds?","William Delaney","We're lapping them, so it's started. I think generally it's in the meat, seafood, and some dairy. Joel, is that about right?","Joel Grade","That's correct.","Mark Wiltamuth","So is the deflation cooling for you now or is it still as heavy? I mean, it's a pretty big deflationary number this quarter.","William Delaney","Yes, I'd say it's moved around a bit these last three quarters but I'd say relatively steady from where we were half a year ago, six months ago.","Mark Wiltamuth","Okay. And just to get into the softening of the backdrop a little bit. I wanted to get your thoughts on restaurant store growth out there. Because a lot of the health indicators you're looking at are same-store sales measures, so I'm curious: Do you think there's over-storing going on out there as part of the problem? And what's been your percentage of business from new stores over the last several years?","William Delaney","You know, Mark, I think when you go back to 2009, 2010, clearly there was oversupply and overcapacity, and I think there's been a pretty good correction since that time. I believe we've seen some modest reduction in restaurants -- number of restaurants here over the last year or so. But nothing to the degree we saw for or five years ago. There may be a little bit of a modest correction, but I don't think that's an overriding issue, I think it's somewhat self-correcting.","We don't really track our sales to new stores. The way we track them, Mark, is we track new business for us, which is make an account to an operator that we didn't sell a year ago this time, and we track watch business, which is just the opposite where we had a sale a year ago and we don't have any. And then we track penetration. So the softening, if you will, is probably showing up a little bit more on the case penetration side right now.","Mark Wiltamuth","Okay. And do you think the strength you've had in local is enough to kind of overpower some of the broader industry softening?","William Delaney","I feel very good about our three-year plan and I feel very good about how we're executing the business and if that's your question -- the bottom line is we feel good about the momentum we have, we feel really good about the year we just passed. And, if it is a little softer, we've got good things going out. We're handling expenses very hard right now and we're very committed to the plan.","Mark Wiltamuth","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Stephen Grambling","Good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in, a couple of follow-ups to earlier questions. I guess, first, related to -- I had a question on EBIT growth targets. I think you had previously looked for 55% to 65% of the goal coming from gross profit and the remainder in supply chain and administrative costs. As you think about the better execution driving the upside, where you think that has impacted those buckets most and where is the biggest opportunity going forward?","William Delaney","Stephen, I think both those lines are critical lines, but certainly you have to start with gross profit. I mean, we make $9 billion in gross profit. That's more than the sales of many, many of the people we compete with head to head. So that's a huge number that we've been able to grow very nicely on an adjusted basis over the last year to two years. And how do we do that? It comes back to the levers we've talked about. Case growth, with a particular emphasis on local case growth, managing the margins, utilizing a lot of the tools, many of which are technology-based today, and taking a good hard look at where our potential is in terms of territories within each district, within each opco. ","So assessing the opportunity for growth by territory, by district, by opco; taking advantage of some of the revenue management tools that Tom and his team are -- have put in place over the last year and are just now beginning to mature; continuing to utilize the category management process, both from leveraging our spend but also bringing innovation to that product; staying close to our customers, refining our customer insight where -- to be as current as we possibly can in terms of what the needs of those operators are as they face the challenges, so you have to start with gross profit and the ability to grow those dollars, and we've done a nice job there and I expect us to continue to do well.","With that said, as I said in terms of the pillars of our strategy, we need to be more productive in everything we do. And we set some goals out there and certainly running the business at a flat cost per case for yet another year here is a very appropriate yet aggressive goal and it's going to be paramount for us to have success this year to do that. So we've got some good momentum there in the supply chain. We're managing our SG&A very well. So I feel very good about our corporate spend as well. ","We're still spending some money in business technology to kind of create those tools that we've been talking about here in particular on the commercial side. So I think we're spending the money in the right place. Over time, we'll continue to flatten out that corporate spend, try to keep the flat cost per case flat in the field. And that combination of good, solid gross profit growth and well-managed expenses should serve us very well.","Joel Grade","I think that one thing I would just add to that even -- if you think about the model and how we looked at that spread between gross profit dollars and operating expense dollars, I think one of the things that we remain focused on is that delta between those two. So even in times when we've had some impact of deflation on the gross profit dollars, again, we've continued to focus on driving the expenses to where we look at that spread. And on a year-to-date basis, we're up a little over 1.5% in terms of that delta between those two. And so the only other thing I may call out is just that to think about -- because that's certainly the way we think about that. And again, whether deflation goes up or down, that relative spread between the two is certainly a key part of our model and something we've done really well on the point Bill has made.","William Delaney","Yes, and I think the difference in this conversation we're having today versus three, four, five years ago is what I spoke to in terms of the foundation that we've built with a lot of our transformative work, a lot of the initiatives that we put in place. We have tools today, we have structure, we have the right people to do this. It's not easy, it's still a very competitive environment out there, but we're in much better position today to accomplish these things than we were five years ago.","Stephen Grambling","Thanks. And within that, you talked about the good work on the digital platform. Where do you think your systems are relative to peers and does this shift away from SAP changeability to implement some of these tools? Thanks.","William Delaney","Well, clearly a big part of our ongoing strategy here was to reallocate what we call our business technology spend more to the customer-facing side of the business. So I think the direction is right, the spend is right, we've making good strides. But we've got some work to do to get the -- not just the digital platform but all the tools we use behind the scenes, both to operate the business and to assess the performance of the business. We still have some good work to do here to improve and that'll be a perpetual opportunity. So good work to do, but I think strategically we're spending the money in the right place and we'll continue to invest appropriately in that part of our business.","Stephen Grambling","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Sinisi","Great, thanks very much. And nice end to the year, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the M&A landscape and in particular, with your more of an entry into the fresh and the ethnic products, Trinity, North Star, to name a couple this year. Just kind of how you feel your traction's going where you are from an assortment standpoint and how that factors into your thoughts as you look at any potential further opportunities going forward.","William Delaney","I think over the last several years, we've done a lot with specialty meats, specialty produce, gas supply. In terms of bringing those businesses into our company, they're now what we think of as core. Five or ten years ago, they would have been adjacencies. So certainly we've got the foundation there as well and what you've seen here over the last three to five years is we're integrating it much better. I'll let Tom speak a little more specifically, but there's still opportunity out there, particularly on the geographic side, I think, where we have some holes we'd love to fill in geographically but good momentum with the recent acquisitions.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","I think I'll just add that as Bill said, we really view those specialty areas now as more than a quarter of our business and I think our ability to round that portfolio businesses out across the U.S., we'll create those opportunities like with North Star in Florida. And so we'll continue to look for those opportunities as they come up, but I believe that's an important part of our growth. This whole fresh, the local, those that you've been hearing about and seeing out there are something that we are very focused on through both our produce and specialty meat and seafood companies.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Maybe just a superfast follow-up here. On the ERP, the 12 that are being converted back to the enhanced ERP systems. I think you were at kind of the first, second one a couple months ago. Just a quick update there. Where you are in that process?","William DeLaney","Yes, it's a 12-month process and we've done one of them very well and around schedule. So we're in a good place.","Vincent Sinisi","All right, great. Thanks, Bill.","William DeLaney","Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one last question. And our last question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe","Hi, great, thank you. Obviously you ended the year at a gross margin high for the year and it's actually one of your highest gross margins that you've had in many year. So when we think about fiscal '17, is the right run rate of cost of goods sold or gross margins, is it the fourth quarter or should we still consider that we can -- that year-on-year might play an effect as oppose to taking just that fourth quarter result and running that forward?","William DeLaney","I would never take one quarter and extrapolate too much John. I think you look at the year, you look at the trends, you look at the environment that we just described and obviously we have plans to grow the gross profit and manage the expenses very well but I wouldn't try anything off in one quarter, good or bad.","John Ivankoe","And are you at the level when you do look at that percent where you're kind of in a competitively good place where it's a good gross margin for you and in terms of the relative value that you're customers are getting and how you're competition is competing against you? In other words, is there any risk like we've seen in previous periods that some of your competition starts to ease their gross margin in an effort to gain traffic share?","William DeLaney","I can't speak for that. I mean as I've said, I think for a long, long time; it's a very competitive environment out there. There is a lot of sales people out there in the street and lot of very sophisticated customer, so pricing is always going to be a key part of how customers look at value. I think what you've heard Tom say, as we look at revenue management in which pricing is a component, but nothing more than a component, we're getting better in terms of strategically and tactically facing up with each customer one-on-one and really understanding what is key for them but we have the tools that make sure we're highly competitive in their key items but also where there is opportunities in growth.","So when you look at our economic model, it's really about having the right price for the right item and the right day for that customer for the street business and remain very competitive with our contract customers. And to do that you need to continue to take cost out and become more efficient. So I wouldn't say that there is anything in particular going on right now that's different than what we've experienced sort of last two or three years. And I wouldn't -- and I also think we still have opportunity to be more consistent in our pricing and that should be a win for our customers and win for us.","John Ivankoe","Very helpful, thank you.","William DeLaney","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

The reconciliation of these another non-GAAP measures to the corresponding measures are included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found on the Investors section of our website.","Additionally, our results for fiscal 2017 incorporates the financial performance of the Brakes Group, as such we will reference throughout our presentation today Sysco\u2019s financial results both including and excluding this acquisition. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we would like to ask each participant to limit for time today to one question and one follow-up.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.","William DeLaney","Thank you Neil and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning Sysco reported strong fourth quarter and excellent fiscal year-end financial results. For the quarter on a comparable 13 week basis, we delivered sales growth of 14% to $14.4 billion, adjusted operating income growth of 14% to $667 million and adjusted earnings per share growth 20% to $0.72.","For fiscal year 2017 on a comparable 52 week basis sales grew 12% to $55.4 billion, adjusted operating income grew 20% to $2.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share also grew 20% to $2.48. These results were driven by our 65,000 associates providing our customers with the products, services and business solutions they need to run their businesses successfully.","I'm especially pleased with our local case growth performance in the United States, our overall gross profit growth while expanding gross margin the right way and our focused expense management throughout the Company.","In addition our European acquisition of the Brakes Group at the beginning of the fiscal year contributed meaningfully to our sales and earnings growth. Our results for the quarter and the year were achieved in a modestly growing U.S. economy, disparate regional economic conditions in Canada and mixed economic backdrops in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Sweden.","While we continue to transition some large contract customers in our U.S. foodservice operations. Our case growth with local customers in that business segment improved during the second half of our fiscal year. Favorable consumer confidence throughout much of the country contributed to restaurant check size increases, even though year-over-year traffic trends were unfavorable in certain customer segments.","Taking a moment to reflect on our steadily improving and strong business performance over the past few years, there is no doubt that our customer-centric strategy with a one Sysco approach has been executed at a high level and that we are well positioned to deliver disciplined, profitable and sustainable growth moving forward.","We aspire to be the most valued and trusted business partner for all of our customers and are committed to delivering on our targeted financial objectives for Sysco\u2019s shareholders. We will continue to develop new and refined current key strategic initiatives such as category management, revenue management, enhanced customer facing technology and multiple productivity improvement measures in order to further differentiate our industry leading customer offerings.","We will do this by deepening our customer insight work, continually enhancing our technology capabilities and by attracting and developing highly capable and increasing diverse leaders and associates.","In closing, I would like to thank all of our associates for contributing to our success this past year and for driving our strong performance through the first two years of our 2016 to 2018 three-year plan. I'm confident that we will achieve the high-end or a $600 million to $650 million adjusted operating growth goal, which excludes the impact of Brakes.","Further we look forward to presenting our new 2018 to 2020 three-year plan later this calendar year. In the spirit of looking forward and positioning Sysco well for future success, we recently announced that Tom Ben\u00e9 will become President and Chief Executive Officer of Sysco effective January 1, 2018.","Tom is a strong accomplished leader and most deserving successor. I look forward to working closely with Tom together with our senior leadership team over the next few months to ensure smooth transition process.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Thank you Bill, and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2017 was a successful year for Sysco and I'm proud of the results our associates have accomplished this year. They are executing at a high level as we continue to achieve the key strategies levers of our current three-year plan, including delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, growing gross profit dollars and managing overall expenses.","Fiscal 2017 was marked not only by our strong performance in which we continued our relentless focus on the customer, but also because of the some important highlights that include the addition of the Brakes business in Europe, a completion of the successful transition of 12 operating companies from SAP through enhanced version of our legacy ERP system, and validation of our customer-centric approach to our business as reinforced by the improvement in our customer loyalty scores.","An example is our approach to giving customers a choice in how they want to interact with us, whether it\u2019s through our best-in-class sales force, via our mobile platform or through a phone call.","I would now like to discuss our segment results starting with U.S. Foodservice Operations including some highlights of key strategic initiatives that are helping to differentiate Sysco in the marketplace. In addition, I will speak to the performance of our International Foodservice Operations.","Our U.S. Foodservice segment had a solid year with fiscal 2017 results on a comparable 52 week basis of sales growth of 1.5% and gross profit growth of 4%, while adjusted operating expenses grew 1.7% resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 7.8%.","We once again experienced strong growth in our local business, up 2.4% in U.S. Broadline. This was partially offset by declines in case volume for our multi-unit business due to our efforts to deliver disciplined profitable growth. This resulted in approximately 1% total case growth overall.","As we progress through the next year, we expect to see those trends around our multi-unit business begin to improve. Importantly, as we strive to provide value for our local customers through innovative product offerings and value-added services, along with e-commerce capabilities, we are seeing them reward us with growth for the 13th quarter in a row.","Looking at gross profit growth for U.S. Foodservice Operations, on a comparable 52 week basis, we delivered growth of 4% and gross margin expansion of 48 basis points, as we manage the deflationary environment in the first part of the year very well and are now working our way through an inflationary environment.","Poultry, produce, seafood and dairy are driving the current inflation and we expect inflation to continue for the balance of the calendar year. Our strategic focus on accelerating growth of local customers is working. It all starts with an insight-based customer-centric approach that permeates everything we do.","For example, we have improved the capabilities of our sales force through investments made in training, technology and targeted specialized resources and as a result our marketing associates are spending more time working with our customers on value-added activities and consultative services such as menu analysis, inventory management and business reviews.","These services foster a deeper relationship with our customers and further enforces the importance of sales force play in helping our customers succeed. From a cost perspective, within U.S. Foodservice Operations our expense management was solid as we limited growth to 1.7% on an adjusted 52 week comparable basis for the year.","Looking at U.S. Broadline, cost-per-case for fiscal 2017 improved by approximately $0.01 compared to the prior year. And on a fuel price neutral basis, cost-per-case increased by one penny. The consistent performance we have been to achieve is driven by key strategic initiatives which are supported by the expansive network of dedicated hard working front line associates in the warehouse and those team members delivering our products; through their efforts we have consistently been able to deliver a high level of service to our customers.","Looking at the overall performance for the U.S. foodservice operations on a 52 week comparable basis, I'm pleased with how all of our associates executed our plan; as our adjusted operating income performed well and we were able to improve adjusted operating margins by 45 basis points for the full-year.","Moving to international foodservice operations; on a 52 week comparable basis sales and adjusted operating income nearly doubled both largely driven by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group.","During the year Brakes performed reasonably well in midst of challenging environment in the UK as they exceed our expectation for EPS accretion contributing $0.14 per share. They are also making good progress in their supply chain transformational efforts as they move to multi-temp capability across the UK.","Growth in France remains steady and Sweden continues to produce favorable results. We also continue to see long-term opportunities for growth across our new European business. Additionally we are in the process of integrating our Ireland businesses and things are progressing well; we expect to achieve modest benefits from these activities.","Looking forward, we are excited about the long-term opportunities to create value for our customers in the European business. Over the next few years we will invest capital and resources to build on the existing foundation of the business as we continue to work on key strategic initiatives that will position us well for the future.","We remain pleased with our performance in Canada despite the continued softness in Alberta which has been driven primarily by the energy market decline. Our Canadian business has seen positive momentum in the growth of its local business driven by improved sales execution and implementation of our customer focused initiatives such as category management and revenue management.","In addition we are effectively managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses to improve productivity. As a result, we expect the Canadian business to continue to deliver positive performance.","Turning to Latin America we are excited about the new facilities in both Costa Rica and Panama. Specifically in Costa Rica, we recently opened a 180,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility with the test kitchen and training facilities. This new space is enabling new products and full product lines to be available to our customers and we are excited about the accelerated growth potential those offerings will deliver.","As we enter the new fiscal year, we do so with strong momentum and I believe fiscal 2018 will bring opportunities for Sysco. Our ongoing focus on customer insights and delivering against their needs for innovative products and consultative services will enable our sales force to continue to add significant value and deliver growth with those local customers.","We will need to effectively manage the ongoing transition to an inflationary environment with our customers while staying focused on gross profit growth and we will continue to focus on driving efficiency from our supply chain through our expansive network that is built to provide a high level of service to our customers.","In summary, fiscal 2017 showed important progress against our customer-centric strategy for Sysco. Our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering on our financial objectives.","Finally, as I work through the leadership transition with Bill, I'm personally honored to be given the opportunity to lead this amazing Company and I'm incredibly excited about the future for Sysco.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade for further details.","Joel Grade","Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. As Bill and Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and for the year. Our quality of earnings growth for the year reflects continued momentum from our business including strong case growth, excellent gross profit dollar growth and solid cost management.","This morning, I will set with our quarterly results on the comparable week 13 basis excluding Brakes, where we delivered sales growth of 3.4%, gross profit growth of 4.2% which included margin expansion of 14 basis points and adjusted operating expenses growth of 2.6% resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 9%.","As Tom mentioned earlier, we saw inflation of approximately 2.6% in our U.S. Broadline business for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The pace of the transition from deflation to inflation has inferably rapid, as produced, poultry, seafood and dairy were increasing and driving overall inflation.","We do not see negative impacts on our ability to grow gross profit dollars. However, it is important to note that this change from deflation to inflation pressures gross margin as a percentage of sales.","Shifting gears, I would like to transition to our results for the year on a comparable 52 weeks basis excluding Brakes. Sales grew 1.6% and gross profit dollars grew 4.1% which included margin expansion of 43 basis points and adjusted operating expenses grew 1.7% which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 12.4% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 13.6%.","We continue to maintain a healthy gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth, which translated into an strong adjusted operating income leverage and continue to progress towards achieving our three-year plan objectives.","Cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion for the year, up approximately $309 million from last year. Free cash flow for the year $1.6 billion, which is about $150 million higher compared to last year.","These changes are largely due to improved business performance, improve working capital management and favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the U.S. Foods termination payment last year offset by higher fiscal 2017 cash taxes due to prior year deductions related to the U.S. Foods payment and a deferral from flood relief.","Net CapEx for the year was $663 million or about 1.2% of sales, which is $159 million higher than last year primarily due to ongoing capital investments and the addition of Brakes. Net working capital performance has continued to improve.","We have nearly achieve our three-year goal of four days and have improved our net DSO by 3.8 days compared to FY 2015 driven improvements in all three areas, payables, receivables and inventory.","Our fiscal 2017 results include certain items that were related to the Brakes acquisition including amortization associated with the transaction and accelerated depreciation related to our enhance business technology strategy. The accelerated depreciation related to technology has concluded and will not be part of our fiscal 2018.","Lastly I\u2019m pleased with our adjusted return on invested capital performance which ended the year approximately 13%. Excluding Brakes our ROIC was approximately 16% which exceeded our original three-year plan objective of 15%.","Now I would like to close with some commentary and the outlook for fiscal year 2018. After two years, we have been able to achieve $417 million of operating income growth since fiscal 2015 and I share Bill's confidence that we will achieve the high-end of our $600 million to $650 million adjusted operating income growth goal which excludes the impact of Brakes.","As such, we anticipate another solid year in fiscal 2018 driven by gradually improving results throughout the year. The return to an inflationary environment will likely continue for the balance of the calendar year creating a gross margin headwind as a percentage of sales, but it should not hamper our ability to grow our gross profit dollars.","As we have previously stated, our capital allocation priorities include key focus on investing in our business. Capital expenditures will increase during fiscal 2018 and are expected to be approximately 1.3 to 1.4% of sales including Brakes.","The increase compared to our recent run rate is driven by a few factors, including increased investments and facility expansions and improvements and increased technology investments. To accelerate the success we are having with customer facing technology and increased investments in technologies to support our shared services organization.","Even with the increase in capital spend we still expect continued strong cash flow performance for fiscal year 2018. As such, we expect to continue to grow our dividend in fiscal 2018 and finally we have completed our $3 billion two year share repurchase program during fiscal 2017. Our share buybacks in 2018 were in line with our capital allocation strategy and involve opportunistic purchases and buybacks that offset dilution.","In summary, we had a strong year, reflecting continued momentum from our business driven by strong local case growth, excellent gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. We achieved a healthy spread between gross profit growth and expense growth that has led to strong leverage for our earnings. We also have been able to effectively turn those earnings into cash and grow our free cash flows.","These results are just the ongoing commitment of our associates to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business. We remain committed to those high levels of service and executions translating into enhanced financial performance in both the near and long-term.","Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital, your line is open.","Kelly Bania","Hi, good morning, just wanted to go back to the comment about the operating income targets and the confidence in reaching the high-end I guess implies an acceleration, you mentioned kind of some gradually improving results in terms of expectations for next year. So I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that where that is. It sound like may be some of the multi-unit trends may be could improve next year or just could you walk us through the thought process there?","Joel Grade","Sure, absolutely. This is Joel. So yes. Number one, I think the key point as I have talked about is, we certainly as Bill and I both said, are constant in our ability at the high-end of that target. And I would say that the acceleration that I talked through the year really is partially related to some of the improved multi-unit volume throughout the year.","In addition to that, in terms of timing, there are some elements of incorporating the Brakes business into our business that will result in some level of increasing transition between the first half and the second half of the year. And so, again that I think as we have kind of talked about here, I wouldn\u2019t look for anything dramatic there, but just a gradual acceleration I think over the course of the year is what we are really talking about.","Kelly Bania","Great. And then just to ask also about the independents, the growth with independents again was strong. Just curious if in your discussions with them if you are sensing any change in their confidence or any change in how their outlook over the next couple of years?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Hey, Kelly. Good morning, it\u2019s Tom. I think we continue to feel that the independent segment is well positioned to continue to perform at a decent level. Obviously as we talked, there is been some I would say some softness in restaurants in general, but I think we still feel like the independents are well positioned whether it\u2019s the product offering that they have, their ability to be flexible to meet the changing consumer needs.","I think the other thing just as always a reminder is because of our - whether it\u2019s our current share of the market or the fragmentation that exists generally in foodservice, we continue to believe that there is lots of opportunity for us to grow and whether that\u2019s in independent restaurant segment or other segments of our business.","Kelly Bania","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","John Heinbockel","So, Tom, I\u2019m curious, if you look out the next year or two, what is the prognosis on accelerated growth in some of the centers of plate categories, seafood meals or produce, given that you have made some changes organizationally, is that maybe we see an acceleration in part of the business or is that going to take a little while longer?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Good morning, John. What I think specifically to those areas we are fortunate at Sysco, we have got an organization and a business structure that is exists around specialty meat and produce that positions us well. And so, I think we continue to believe that center of the plate is an important category and I think we look at that and say whether it\u2019s the way we have structured ourselves now or the fact that we have got those capabilities that we are well positioned to grow.","And so, whether or not that\u2019s going to be a significant acceleration or not probably has much to do with what is going on broadly in the marketplace, but I think we feel like we are well positioned and we continue to work on improving even our current position in those areas.","John Heinbockel","Okay. And then something completely differently, if you think about the international business again framing first, relative to the U.S., I know the goal has been right U.S. to grow GP 100 basis points above SG&A. Is that something that you can duplicate internationally or given where Brakes is can the spread be wider for some period of time?","William DeLaney","Well first of all John its Bill, good morning and I'm not sure that we have spoke into a 100 basis points [gaps] (Ph) going forward, but we certainly have talked a lot about that we are pleased with the way we are growing the GP relative to the expenses and we certainly do need to continue grow that faster.","I think when you look at internationally, we will continue to report that segment and you have got a mix of things going on there; certainly a mature business in Canada where as Tom just said in U.S., we still see a lot of opportunity for growth up there and to leverage some of these strategic initiatives that we have rolled out for the most part in the United States to do that over in Canada, and we are swiftly here moving forward.","Brakes itself, you heard Joel kind of alluded to it, we have owned it now for about a year, we are really pleased with that acquisition, there's a lot of upside potential, we are in a normal part of a transition process now where we are going to be continuing to invest in some of the transformation work that they had already started to make their warehouses more efficient to put to a big merger that they did in France together and to continue with our integration work in Ireland.","So I think Europe is a little harder to call on it, but you know certainly growing the bottom line the right way both in terms of top-line as well as leveraging the GPs is that mantra will continue there just as it will in the U.S.; and then in Latin America, smaller markets to be sure and we are really building for the future there with some of the countries that we are in, with the management team as we are partnering with them there. And as Tom mentioned we have got a new facility or two coming along.","So I would look at international as a little bit more variable relative to the U.S. side, but certainly our overall levers that we talked about here over the medium to long-term which is to grow volume and to leverage that volume and to get a good return on invested capital, those will continue throughout the Company.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Kirk from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","William Kirk","Hey guys, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to go back towards the inflation in food, it looks like restaurants their pass through or their pricing hasn't been as strong in the last couple of months as it had been over the last call it two years and that's happening at the same time their food product inflation has now arrived. So that sounds to me like something that's hard for the vertical to manage. Can you help me understand if that dynamics is important and maybe what tier of the vertical it would impact the most?","William DeLaney","Yes I will start Bill, its Bill here. I'm not as familiar with some of that data that you're just referencing, and I would just tell you generally what we have seen over the years and we have talked a lot of about this on calls like this. When you have an inflationary period and where that overall inflation is in the 2% to 3% area, it's usually at a level just for the customer in a particular restaurant were able to pass along.","So generally a 2% rate is a kind of sweet spot for our customers and not a huge challenge for us; now we did point here earlier that the transition from deflation to inflation has been a little more rapid than normal, and there are certainly some categories where we are seeing more than 2% to 3% inflation. So that becomes a challenge both in terms of how we work with our customers and they work with their patrons, but I wouldn't say we are seeing anything out there today that would be overly difficult for our customers to pass along.","William Kirk","Okay, and related to that during this transitional period gross margin percentage comes under a little pressure. Would there be any way to discern - is increased competition is part of that or if that\u2019s just a natural pressure during the inflection?","Joel Grade","Yes. let me just address that, it\u2019s Joel. I think the main reason really calling that out is really more of what I will call a mathematical function of the inflationary pricing and so I think even in the previously deflationary periods we have talked about that that there was an element of that that was driving a margin as a percentage.","So I think the main thing for you to take away and just have to remember, our key focus is on gross profit dollars and so while again there maybe some mathematical pressure on the margin percentage, at the end of the day we feel good about our ability to generate gross profit dollars which is ultimately the focus that we will continue to go after.","William DeLaney","And look, I think that\u2019s a really key point, we continue to make it - we are going to be going through and we are in the midst of going through transition now in this environment and our revenue management tools, this will be the first time that we have really utilized those in an inflation environment.","So, that\u2019s an opportunity to continue to manage the price movements more effectively than perhaps we had in the past, but if I really want to emphasize, our ability to grow the gross profit dollars to 4% in a deflationary environment that approach deflation of 2% over most of the fiscal year. It\u2019s really an extraordinary achievement and its one that in my judgment we would have not been able to produce those numbers if we didn\u2019t have the tools available to us that we do today in terms of [CapMan] (Ph) and [RevMan] (Ph) a lot of the sales concentrated work that Tom was speaking to.","So, obviously our job is to manage and to work closely with our customers through these dynamic periods, but we are much better positioned today to work through this, but the key here really is gross profit dollars that is what we pay our bills with and that\u2019s what drives the earnings growth that John Heinbockel was referencing earlier.","William Kirk","Okay. Thank you for that that context. That was useful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Marisa Sullivan","Question. Wanted to touch on Brakes and to get your thoughts on accretion that you are expecting for next year and where you see opportunities both on top-line and then also in productivity?","William DeLaney","Yes. So, I will start with the accretion number. I think as we have talked about when we originally had announced the deal, we have anticipated in the first year, a mid single-digit accretion and the second year, I think in the low double-digits of accretion. We certainly believe that continue to be the case. So, I think I would look at that as probably roughly similar to the current year as far as that goes. Tom, I don\u2019t know, if you want to talk about the top-line.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Yes. And then regarding just generally how we are feeling about it, as I mentioned the UK market certainly had some choppiness in it, but I think we are feeling good about where we can be positioned there. We had good movement in growth in France and we feel good about our business in Sweden and obviously with what we are doing in Ireland we continue to feel pretty good about that as well.","So, I think overall we feel like we remain pretty well positioned and I think we are just obviously going to have to keep an eye on what is going on from a market perspective, but I think we are positioned how we are performing we feel pretty good. We do have some investments we need to make over the next year there and we feel like that\u2019s an important part of us continuing to build on the work they had started pre-acquisition and we shared and talked a little bit about that earlier.","Marisa Sullivan","Got it and just to change topics, want to touch on the Sigma business. Can you comment on the sales growth trends excluding 53rd week question and also was curious to see the gross margin up a little bit year-over-year, wonder if you could give some more context on that.","William DeLaney","Sure, I mean related to Sigma, we had good top-line growth from Sigma perspective. We had some new customers that have come on board in that business over the last year and so I think that's driving some of that top-line, obviously very competitive out there still in this space and we continue to work through that part of it. From a margin standpoint again I think that has much to do with some of the - think about how that business has managed on a cost plus basis, there's some margin impact of that, but it's mostly driven by new business that is driving the improvements there.","Marisa Sullivan","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shane Higgins from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Shane Higgins","Thanks, good morning guys. Just wanted to get a sense of how local case or both U.S. Broadline and local case has kind of trended during the fourth quarter and what you guys are seeing in terms of trends, any color you can give 1Q to-date?","William DeLaney","Hey Shane how are you. Well as we said, we had solid, what was it Joel? 2.4 for the year and 2.7 for the quarter coming off of the third quarter we were over three on the local side, so we were pleased with that. You know as I mentioned and Tom alluded to I think as well, we have been transitioning some large contract customer business, some of it our own choice, some of it not, we are in the midst of continuing to do that but we are in a good place there and we expect those trends to gradually improve as we talked earlier you know later in the year. So overall cases flat to one, but local cases 2.5 to 3.","Joel Grade","I would just remind you too, I mean it\u2019s part of our - again this is now the 13th quarter in a row we have grown our local cases and in addition to that if you think about the range that we said at the time when we thought about this original three-year plan, I think that you know this range is 2.5%-ish was right close to where we are at and so I think we feel good overall above that.","Shane Higgins","Great and just a follow-up on the gross profit dollars and impact of the transition to inflation. Did that actually benefit that 4% type number that you guys put up for the quarter, the return to inflation and how should we think about that impacting your gross profit dollar growth in the first quarter.","Joel Grade","Yes, so I think the way I would think about that for this quarter, I think certainly again we are pleased with the 4% plus growth. I think the transition as I mentioned and Bill mentioned as well was fairly quick and so while we don't have a real significant lag in terms of turning over pricing there is some lag and so what I would just say in general is that in fairly rough and rapid uptick in a few categories that I would say again slow to little bit the acceleration of the gross profit growth. So that's how I would think about that in terms of how it impacted this quarter.","But again, as we talked about going forward, we certainly are confident in our ability to grow our gross profit dollars despite that inflation as Bill talked about. The overall inflation number is well within the range of modern inflation that we think works in this industry well and so feel good in general, but to answer your question directly there wasn't I'd say a major impact in this quarter on that.","Shane Higgins","Great. Thanks, I will get back in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks. Joel just to clarify one thing in terms of the Brakes accretion, mid single-digit year one, I think you said low double-digit year two, is that pennies or percent?","Joel Grade","Pennies.","Karen Short","Okay. And then I guess I was curious on a couple of things. One of your competitors last week commented on Technomics outlook for independent restaurants. And it just seemed very counter intuitive, I mean when you talk to any restaurant analysts that independents are actually slowing. So wondering if you could give some color on that and I just had one other housekeeping question.","William DeLaney","Yes, I will take a shot of that Karen. Technomics you know there is a lot of different sources as you know in the industry that we all rely on to get as much data as we can, and a lot of the data crosses over between custom segments and is somewhat defined differently by different people.","Technomics has been kind of that consistent barometers, it\u2019s been out there for years and they do a good job. But the reality is while their data comes from people in our industry that they interview and talk to and so I would characterize it as directional and I would tell you six or nine months ago people were saying that the independent was going to grow a lot faster and be in the upper 2% and I don\u2019t know if that totally bought into that. And now we are seeing that their forward view in the medium term, even short-term is lower than 2%.","So from our perspective I think it\u2019s good information, it\u2019s consistently done. You have got an economy out that\u2019s growing at about 2%. And I think in industry there is no big shocks in this industry right now, so there is nothing going on anywhere close to similar to what we saw in 2009.","So what I\u2019m trying to say is that I think there is no big secular trends going on, there is some cyclical things, there is always weather, there is comparisons. But I think I 1.5% to 2.5% range out there at different points of time is where we have historically have been and that is certainly how we are looking at it in terms how we work through our strategy and how we plan the business.","So I wouldn\u2019t get too excited about it being where it was six months ago and I wouldn\u2019t be too excited about the most recent forecast. And the key is growth here and the business is still growing and it\u2019s growing - those check sizes are growing and we are well positioned to take advantage of that growth and Tom pointed out.","Karen Short","Okay, thanks. And then I just was curious, I know you don\u2019t want to be pinned down to a spread between gross profit dollar growth versus OpEx growth, but as we look kind of to the next three-years, once we get into 2018, just may be qualitatively could you give us a sense of where you think operating profit growth will come from more, is it more on the OpEx opportunity side or do you think it\u2019s still fairly down the same gross profit, or gross margin, gross profit opportunities in OpEx?","Joel Grade","Yes, I think the way I would think about that Karen first of all, as we talked about, we will certainly give more guidance on our next three-year plan later this calendar year. But I would look at this as a very balanced approach to growth, which certainly we have talked about our three-year plan and I would certainly think about as we move forward.","Again I think both from the focus on local customers, growing local cases and overall profitable cases, focus on growing our gross profit dollars and again being very effectively, aggressively and thoughtfully managing our costs is really a very balanced you know is how I would really think about this moving forward.","Karen Short","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.","Ajay Jain","Yes, hi good morning. Joel I think you mentioned that you're at $417 million in operating income growth towards that three-year target. So I wanted to first confirm that number and I was also wondering if you can confirm how much incremental growth you had in the latest quarter. Correct me if I'm wrong, I thought you are already close to around $410 million at the end of Q3, so that might imply not much incremental growth in the fourth quarter?","Joel Grade","So, first of all $417 million Ajay is the number, now keep in mind when you're looking at comparatives you're looking at a quarter of last year that had the additional week versus this year. So the incremental growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis purely is not something you're going to be able to look at just directly. So the incremental growth - Neil if you want to take that during the quarter?","Neil Russell","Yes sure Ajay you're right. If you're looking at 13 week versus 14 week it's relatively modest, but if you look at 13 weeks versus 13 week comparable the rate of operating income growth is pretty much in line with what you're seeing throughout the year.","Ajay Jain","Okay. I was asking about the sequential increase from Q3 and Q4?","Joel Grade","We had $52 million ex-Brakes, so if you're comparing to the $417 million again is part of the three-year plan; so $52 million on a comparable quarterly basis what we added in the fourth quarter this year when you factor 13-13.","Ajay Jain","And I just had a question about the U.S. case growth, can you talk about the sequential decrease, typically total case growth should be higher compared to case growth in the street business and that wasn't the case in Q4. I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that they always had transitioning of the less profitable business about 1%, but if you adjust for the calendar shift and the transitional impact for those multi-unit accounts, what was the case growth for the non local portion of the U.S. Broadline, can you quantify that or at least confirm its positive or negative?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Yes. So, a couple of things, as we talked, we had consistent improvement in the local growth over the last 13 quarters quite honestly, but we talked about the 2.7% in the fourth quarter for local; the contract business or the CNU we talked about it was in fact negative for the quarter and that's consistent with what we have talked about as we have looked at our portfolio and as Bill mentioned earlier we had certain customers we made some decisions on and there are customers who had made some decisions around doing business with us.","But we continue to feel really good about the overall number that 1% comes from a combination of the contract business declining and the local business continuing to be strong; and my comment about improving is we do see some lapping of that happening in fiscal year 2018 and we also have some new business, will be coming on later in the year.","Ajay Jain","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Christopher Mandeville","Hey good morning. The majority of my questions have already been asked, but I guess I was hoping you could touch on wage pressures and the availability of qualified labor, has that worsened at all over the last 12 months or what kind of level of growth can we expect as we look to 2018?","William DeLaney","Chris I will start and I will let Tom and Joel jump in here too. I think there's two things going on as it relates to labor, certainly with our customers in certain parts of the country there continues to be some pressure to source employees as well as labor wages and rates to pay and of all that. So, that continues to be phenomena out there that we are working closely with our customers on.","And on our end of it, when you hear us talk about flat cost per apiece in the most simplicity way what that really is about especially on the supply chain and the operation side of the business is to be keep our wage and benefit increases in line with our productivity increases and productivity obviously comes in a different way. But it\u2019s largely productivity in the warehouse on the truck how we manage overtime all those types of things.","And so, we are pleased with where we are there right now. I would say most of our contracts and most of our annual increases are in line with that productivity goals that we have set, but it something we have to manage very aggressively and very hard, but over the last few years we have done a nice job of it.","Joel Grade","Yes and I think as Bill covered the financial part of that, from a retention standpoint, we measure employee retention and we feel good about where we are today and where we have been as it relates to lot of those types of roles. So, I think the marketplace is I guess in a decent place and obviously I think we as a employer doing a nice job of attracting and retaining the people we need.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","I think the only thing I would just add, just lot of the questions that we get - questions on minimum wage loss and this and that and the other thing and that\u2019s an impact on our customers in terms of the things they are dealing with that doesn\u2019t necessarily or doesn\u2019t really impact us at all and that most of our labors as well double or wage rates.","Christopher Mandeville","All right. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess I have got a random one for you. I\u2019m curious as the Brakes business is been affected by the recent [Agra call] (Ph) in Europe and if so can you help us understand how and whether or not that\u2019s incorporated into the new outlook?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","I don\u2019t know if we can help you with that one today, Chris. So we will come back to you.","Christopher Mandeville","All right. Thank you again guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe","Hi. Two questions if I may. Firstly, the restaurant industry or at least some of the public data that we see show June is kind of one of the softer months of the quarter and that softness continuing from June into July it\u2019s not actually getting a little bit worse. So, just wanted to get a sense in terms of what you are seeing just in terms of the broad industry and independent restaurants specifically?","William DeLaney","Hey, John. Look, I think what we see is it moves around, okay. So there is periods where you have a couple of months where it\u2019s spikes up or at least goes up somewhat and then it comes back down and sometimes it\u2019s hard to explain from one quarter even one month or two months stretch to another.","So, I don\u2019t know that I would get overly excited about one or two months of data, it\u2019s somewhat mixed out there. Consumer confidence is positive for the most part our restaurant operators and customer feel good about the business not quite, maybe is feasibly good as they were a few months ago, but my experience tells me that these numbers move around and they are still very much on a range that as I said earlier it translates to go to the industry and that\u2019s certainly good for us.","John Ivankoe","Okay. And then secondly regarding the CapEx, I think the guidance is 1.3% to 1.4% of sales and I do understand for you that that moves around. Maybe a little bit forward looking on that comment, I mean is that\u2019s the new level of CapEx as a percentage of revenue as we think about your capital needs over the next couple of years where might 2018 be kind of a peak or a trough I guess and the level changes in the years after?","Joel Grade","Hey John this is Joel. I think you're first comment was probably the right one in that that does move around somewhat. I don\u2019t know that I wouldn't look at that necessarily as the new norm, I think I would characterize it as the fact that we have strong cash flows, we have opportunities to invest as I have talked about in some things to continue to transform the Brakes business as well technology initiatives and some facility opportunities we have. So I would certainly look at that, I would call as much opportunistic and again just really consistent with our priorities of continue to reinvest in this Company and we will benefit if that is long-term rate.","John Ivankoe","And is there anything discrete, I think you said a number of things in your prepared comments, but is there anything discrete that we can point to in terms of capital spend on 2018 that will be a material benefit in 2019 or beyond?","Joel Grade","No, I wouldn't look at it that way. Again, across the category as I talked about, again our return on invested capital continues to grow, we certainly feel good about the investments we are making but there is nothing I would finger point as one discrete item.","William DeLaney","I mean I would say the aggregate John, the incremental part of that will be a benefit in 2019 and probably more beyond 2019 to be fair, these are capital investments we are making.","John Ivankoe","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wolf","Thank you, just a quick housekeeping to start with and I might have missed this, but did you say how much acquisitions helped sales in the U.S. foodservice segment.","William DeLaney","We did not.","Andrew Wolf","Did you provided that number so is...","William DeLaney","Andy I guess the biggest acquisition - we certainly talked about Brakes, which is clearly been a significant acquisition for us, but in terms of any small fold ins we didn't get it. Its minor I will tell you just in general, it certainly remains a point of focus here for us going forward in terms of our teams and we see opportunities there're different opportunities.","As we talked earlier, we still see some fold in opportunities in this country and in Canada, both on the Broadline but in particular on the specialty side of the business. Certainly with Brakes we have a platform over there now in the countries that we are in as well as some other countries to grow and invest overtime.","You know it's a long-term investment and then what I spoke to as it relate to Latin America that's probably although modest in size at this point in time, you know probably will be the most wide open area that we have for acquisition opportunities.","Andrew Wolf","Okay, so I mean I'm sort of throwing in a number of somewhere less than 1% for the whole business not just for the U.S...","Joel Grade","It's well less than that, again when you take the Brakes number out again for this year that's was with a key focus. Bill talked about certainly a focus for us moving forward.","Andrew Wolf","So on the inflation side for the case growth slowed yet the gross profit dollars were the same as last quarter, so clearly there is some pass through or lot. Could you speak to the cadence of that, did it improve or are there any other players out there who might be struggling, looking for share and maybe using price as a lever. Could you just give us a sense of what's going on in the market as you see on price pass through.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Andy this is Tom, I think the first thing I'd start with is when we talk we talk a lot about this, it remains very competitive out there. We have lots of competitors in general and from a market perspective I think we continue to look at leveraging all of the capabilities we have whether it\u2019s things like the category management we talked about to make sure we have got the best cost on products or its revenue management tool, so we make sure that we are pricing products appropriately in the marketplace and making sure we are taking care of our customers.","We still feel really good about obviously our ability to grow and our ability to do it in the right way and I think that\u2019s really what you are seeing. I don\u2019t think there is any specific thing that\u2019s happened in addition to that. This is really about a balanced approach, making sure we are focused the right levers of the business that starts with that local customer where we can incremental value and doing the things that help basically get recognized and rewarded by them for providing the right products and the right services in a right way. So I don\u2019t think there is anything beyond that that you should read into it.","William DeLaney","No, I don\u2019t think so either, I mean guess I\u2019m going to go back and reiterate a couple of points I made in my prepared comments that as you know the way we look at this business is we are in a sort of long haul here and we have got a very customer-centric strategy that\u2019s predicated and more and better growing customer insights in terms of what they need to run their business better, how do they deal with commodity pressure, how do they deal with price increases, how do they deal with non-traditional competitive forces in the marketplace.","And so, that customer insight work that we have done over the years we are going to continue to invest in that, deepen it, broaden it, accelerate it where necessary. And that\u2019s what brings us to where we are today and where we have come over the last several years which is a strategy and a platform here that starts with the customers.","But very much is about differentiating ourselves in the marketplace from all types of competitors, and in particular, utilizing our sales force more efficiently, more productively providing them tool they need to provide consulted service that Tom referenced to our customer base and leveraging our supply chain.","We have got a footprint globally now today and growing brand and differentiating products and services in a way that provide values to those customers, but also providing that wide range of products fresh, frozen, dry whatever folks are looking for, utilizing the brand in a way that provides value for them, but also where we can source from around the world. And then obviously technology is another area that we continue to hear from our customers. Anything we can do to help them run their businesses more efficiently, we need to do.","And that\u2019s where you have seen us pivot here over the last couple of years and on the margin, invest more of our spend on the technology side, in the customer facing side, in the things like supplies on fly, cape, Sysco Labs that are trying to stay current at least with the evolving needs of our customer base.","So clearly it\u2019s a competitive business and clearly a lot of competition, but we feel we are very well positioned here not just for today, but continue to go forward as long as we stay close to our customer base.","Andrew Wolf","Thank you. And a similar question just to follow-up. On the multi-unit side, it sounds like you are stacking better trends there with both sales and profitability. And it sounds like some of the other large players at least one of them sounded sort of has the same expectation. Is it kind of tough market for I think the distributors, but sort of lacking price discipline. But it seems like - just want to get your sense, do you think that might be changing somewhat either from your perspective or again from the market perspective?","William DeLaney","I think what we have been really consistent on Andy is that we continue to see opportunities for growth, we are about growth, but we look at growth a little differently than we probably did 10 or 15 years ago, it\u2019s about profitable disciplined, sustainable, i.e. repeatable growth and doing it in the right way in the communities that we serve.","So I don\u2019t know that there is anything really different out there, this is a strategy that we have put together and executed I think increasingly well over the last few years. It\u2019s going to remain competitive out there and we all go after the business hard, but I think everybody understands it we have got shareholders out there that we need to provide returns for as well.","Andrew Wolf","Yes, thank you.","William DeLaney","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Sinisi","Hey guys, thanks very much for taking my question here. I wanted to just go back to the comment that you made that - you have made in prior quarters as well of course about some of typically the larger customer exits, some that you decide some maybe not, just trying to get a better sense of kind of the dynamics of the competitive environment like are you able to kind of follow some of those customers like where do they go or if you're getting them from others where do they come from is that more kind of shifting between the three larger players or are there any other dynamics to be aware of?","Joel Grade","So, Vini I assume we are back talking about really the contract side of the business here. I guess we have said and I will reiterate is that Bill just said this as well. We are very focused on kind of disciplined profitable growth and wanted to make sure that we are making the right decisions and sometimes those decisions that we make drive a customer to make a different decision; we certainly know when we lose the customer where it goes and we certainly know when we gain a customer where it came from.","But I wouldn't say there's anything unique or different going on in the marketplace, it's always been competitive, it continues to be competitive and it's really about making sure that we are making the right decisions for Sysco and for our shareholders and that's how we try to approach this business and so aside from that I wouldn't say there's a whole lot else to say.","William DeLaney","Yes, and we stick close them Vini. I mean this business what goes around comes around in this business, sometimes in that part of it takes a while, but we certainly maintain a relationship as best we can and we are investing for the long-term so it's not unusual for a customer perhaps to move on and then come back to Sysco at some point in time in the future.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up to the comments on the 2018 CapEx, I know you guys have said in the prepared kind of facilities expansion, tech investment things of that nature, I'm sure we will get more color in the fall, but anything you could tell us today in terms of anything that we should be kind of be expecting with any of those and also maybe a split between the U.S. and in the international sides of the business?","Joel Grade","This is Joel. I think as we have talked a little bit before, I mean it's a pretty broad portfolio of investments we are planning to make that we certainly anticipate benefits from in aggregate over the upcoming years.","Again, it's really focused around just broadly opportunities to reinvest in our facilities, add capabilities and expansions there, technology again really focused to the most part around our customer facing technologies and the customer experience as well as opportunities to enhance our shared services platform to drive further efficiency and then from the standpoint of investing in the continued transformation opportunities in Brakes.","I think again that would be broadly characterizing the high points of that and so I think you have a little bit of a sense from this year's earnings where the amount of investment that we put into Brakes, we called that out as we talked of our FY 2017 CapEx, it's probably reasonable and fairly consistent here over the next year.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay. Great, thanks Joel and Bill, Tom best of luck to you guys over the next few months here preparing for the transition.","William DeLaney","Thanks Vini.","Thomas Ben\u00e9","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Zachary Fadem","Hey good morning, thanks for fitting me in. Quickly on the three-year plan, you said you're tracking at the high-end of the six to 650 range, but as you look at the year ahead with a little more clarity on the current operating environment is there still potential to come in above the high-end and if so what are the drivers that need to happen to get there?","William DeLaney","Hey Zac. There is always potential, but I think where we are at right now is we are trying to signal that we feel good about the high-end and that\u2019s where we would like to leave that for today, but certainly we are not going to stop at 650 if we don\u2019t have to and that\u2019s really our message for the day.","We have said now several times that the markets are going to be somewhat fluid here, but overall we now operate in several large markets, we are well positioned if not the leading player in all of those markets and we see plenty of opportunity for growth and we are much more disciplined about how we go after growth today.","So, if you put all this in some type of historical context that 650 is about $200 million higher than where we started two years ago. So, I\u2019m not ready to go above that today, but we certainly feel good about the number.","Zachary Fadem","Fair enough. And is there any directional commentary you could provide on Broadline case growth in the next year, for the national account level should we anticipate further calling here? And then second, should we think about continued share gains for the local customers in 2018?","Thomas Ben\u00e9","So on the contract side, as I said earlier, I think you will see us showing some improvement in those numbers as we get into fiscal year 2018, because of the both lapping some of the decision were made last year and also we have some new business that will be coming on. So, I think you should feel like there will be some improvement there.","Regarding the local business, I mean we continue to feel really good about how we are positioned and as we talked about why we feel like we are able to succeed in that space has really more to do with how we are focused on delivering the value for those customers. I did say in my prepared comments about our loyalty score is going up.","And I think one of the things as we think about what drove that, we talk to our customers a lot and what we have heard was everything from they are feeling about our marketing associates and continuing to add a lot of value through our selling resources and that means we are accomplishing the things we said, which is making them much more capable on and be more consultative and how they are working with our customers.","We also heard good things around our technology platform, so I think we feel really good about the types of strides we are making the strategic initiatives we have been talking about. And so I think to us that\u2019s confirmation that the things we are trying to do for these customers is working.","Zachary Fadem","Got it. Thanks so much Tom, really appreciate the time guys. Best of luck.","William DeLaney","Thanks Zack.","Joel Grade","Thanks Zack.","Operator","Our last question comes Bob Summers from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Robert Summers","Hello. Thanks guys for squeezing me in. I just wanted to a dig a little more into the deflation, inflation dynamic and better understanding and maybe you have something here from the customer insight work that you have done. But, the situation seems unique and that overall product cost have been coming down in aggregate for the last you call it 20 months against that backdrop restaurants have generally been taking pricing. I\u2019m not really sure what that pass through has been to the end operator. But as you think about the resistance to price increases what is the risk, hat there is more margin risk here than you have seen historical in inflection points?","William DeLaney","Hey, Bob. I think the risk is that it spikes in some high cost boxes. In another words, - if it were to spike into double-digits as it has in the past with meat or poultry that type of thing. That would move the number overall and those boxes tend to be expensive and that puts a little more pressure on our customer and we have to manage that the right way.","So, as I said earlier I think the range right now is still in that range that is manageable, but I think the bigger issue is one or two key categories that are high dollar categories may spike. Things like produce and dairy they are going to move around. They move around multiple times within a 12 month period generally.","So that would be maybe my contingent caveat there that if it were to spike up in meat, poultry, seafood not as big a category obviously that would put more pressure on the customer, but right now it's in the manageable range.","Robert Summers","Okay, thanks.","William DeLaney","Sure.","Operator","Thank you for joining us today. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"19863":["Sysco Corp.

We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions.","I'd like to turn the call over to Shannon Mutschler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Shannon Mutschler - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Today, you'll hear prepared remarks from Bill DeLaney, our President and CEO; and Chris Kreidler, our CFO.","Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially.

DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported third quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased 4% to $11.7 billion. Adjusted operating income decreased 3% to $377 million, adjusted net earnings increased 7% to $238 million and EPS increased 5% to $0.40 for the quarter. Net earnings and EPS for the quarter were in line with our expectations, as solid volume and gross profit dollar growth along with a favorable tax rate offset the impact of moderating inflation trends on favorable foreign exchange translation and higher than planned operating expenses.","Case volume grew 2.5% for the quarter and we were pleased with our growth both with locally managed and corporate managed customers. Overall, weather was not a major factor in our year-over-year comparisons for the quarter as we benefited from favorable comparisons in January and February, but were hampered by severe weather in the Northeast and Mideast in late February and most of March. This last point is important to note, because March provides a disproportionately large portion of our third quarter volume and was a relatively mild weather month last year. We experienced similar trends in April, but expect the year-over-year monthly impact of weather will dissipate as we move into May and June.","We continue to roll out and successfully execute our category management initiative and the benefits from this process contributed to our gross profit dollar growth during the quarter. Through category management, we were able to support our customer's growth by lowering our product cost and developing innovative product development ideas. This is vital to mitigating gross margin pressure as we move forward in what remains a fiercely competitive market environment.","Regarding expense management, we established appropriately aggressive goals for cost per case management for fiscal 2015, after a very strong expense management performance in the prior year. We experienced modest improvement in sequential trends in the third quarter, but will fall short of our original goals in this area for the year. With that said, our entire leadership team in intently focused on enhancing productivity in a sustainable manner while delivering exceptional service to our customers. I expect our performance trends in this area to improve modestly in the fourth quarter and more so in fiscal 2016.","Moving to our multi-year business transformation initiatives, we are pleased with the progress we've made on achieving the steady state cost saving goals we set as we began fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2015 is the third year of that financial roadmap and we have already exceeded our original target of $600 million, which was comprised of approximately $300 million in annual savings in both operating and product costs. While pleased with this progress we've made over the past three years \u2013 on these initiatives, it is more clear than ever that transforming Sysco's business will be a perpetual process as we strive to fully realize our vision of being our customer's most valued and trusted business partner.","Foundational to our ultimate success is further developing and continually enhancing our technology platform. We have now embedded this work in the overall scope of our Business Technology group under the leadership of Wayne Shurts. We have learned a great deal from the challenges we encountered in deploying SAP and all of the standardized processes it requires.","Over the past two years under Wayne's leadership, we have refined our business processes, strengthened our technology support capabilities, stabilized the SAP system and enhanced its efficiency. While there is more work to be done, we are well-positioned to move forward with a cohesive enterprise-wide module centered approach rather than our previous OpCo-by-OpCo multi-module approach. As our deployment process matures and evolves in the future, we expect this change to result in smoother conversions, better execution and an improved experience for our customers.","On the acquisition front, we recently completed our previously announced agreement to acquire 50% of Pacific Star Foodservice, a leading food service distributor in Mexico. We have developed a strong relationship over the past several years with the ownership and management team of Pacific Star and we are very excited about the potential opportunities that this partnership will provide to profitably grow our business in Mexico.","Regarding our pending merger with US Foods, the hearing related to the FTC's motion for preliminary injunction begins tomorrow, May 5, and will last up to seven business days. If we receive a ruling in our favor, we will proceed to closing unless the decision is appealed. In the event of an unfavorable ruling, we would assess together with US Foods' ownership whether to pursue the case further. We remain resolute in our belief that this transaction is pro-competitive, good for our customers and will accelerate Sysco's business transformation.","We announced in April that Joel Grade has been named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective September 1, 2015, following Chris Kreidler's decision to leave the company. Joel is a veteran Sysco leader with nearly 20 years of experience in key finance and commercial roles. He is uniquely suited to step into the CFO position because of his deep knowledge of our local operations and people. We are fortunate to have a leader like Joel ready to take on this key position and I look forward to working closely with him in his new role as we move forward. We appreciate the numerous important contributions Chris has made on Sysco's behalf since joining us five years ago. He has agreed to remain as CFO through August and he will work closely with Joel and Sysco's senior executive team to ensure an orderly transition of his responsibilities, including staying on through the end of December as an advisor.","In closing, I am pleased with the consistent case growth we've seen in our locally-managed and corporate managed business, which demonstrates our associates' unwavering focus on providing consistent and excellent service to our customers. In addition, our leadership team is making good progress in driving out initiatives to enhance both gross profit dollar growth and expense management. Our ongoing work to fundamentally reshape our company is challenging but gratifying and we strongly believe that the steps we are taking will reinforce our leadership position in the ever evolving food service industry.","Now, I'll turn things over to Chris so that he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $11.7 billion, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. Our sales growth rate was substantially lower than the 7% rate we saw during the first half of the fiscal year because of the rapid decline in food cost inflation and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Food cost inflation declined significantly from 6% in the second quarter to 3.7% in the third quarter. Our estimate for food cost inflation represents the weighted average change in Sysco's cost of the same products year-over-year. At 3.7%, it would appear we are getting close to what we normally describe as the sweet spot for inflation of 2% to 3%. But the 3.7% is an average across all of our product lines and sometimes averages don't tell the whole story as is the case here.","Specifically, the meat category experienced low double-digit inflation in the quarter and poultry inflation was in the high single digits. On a weighted average basis, these two categories accounted for 3.2% of the 3.7% of inflation we experienced across all of our categories. At these levels, passing along all of the inflation can be painful to our customers, putting gross margin under pressure. In addition, rapid declines in food cost also make it challenging to leverage our fixed costs.","The impact of changes in foreign exchange rate had a much larger impact than usual this quarter. Similar to many companies with significant operations outside of the U.S., the strengthening dollar depressed our foreign sales as we converted them to U.S. dollars. This quarter's decrease of 1.3% was the highest in the past three years. The impact has typically been in the range of zero to 0.5%. Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.6%. Case volume grew 2.5% during the quarter, including acquisitions, and approximately 2.2% excluding acquisitions. Gross profit in the third quarter was $2.1 billion, a 3.1% increase, while gross margin declined 17 basis points to 17.52%.","Benefits from category management contributed significantly to our gross profit during the quarter. In addition, case volume growth for our locally managed Broadline business continued to increase slightly on a sequential basis as it is done the last two quarters.","Solid local case growth is important to drive gross profit dollar growth. Case growth for our corporate managed customers remains strong, but competitive pricing pressure in this segment contributed to gross margin pressure. Certain items for the third quarter totaled $91 million and related to merger and integration planning expenses and interest on the merger debt. Of this amount, $50 million was recorded in operating expense and $41 million was recorded in interest expense.","Merger and integration planning costs that impacted operating expenses were mainly related to work to prepare for the integration of the two companies' technology platforms. These expenses in total were lower in the third quarter compared to levels in the first half of the year, as we scaled back our integration planning work in certain areas where a significant amount of work has already been completed. Merger costs that impacted interest expense relate to the debt that we issued last October that is intended to refinance US Foods' debt upon closing of the transaction. We are treating this interest expense as a certain item until the merger closes.","Adjusted operating expenses for the third quarter increased $73 million, or 4.5%, due to a $61 million increase in payroll expense. Payroll expense increased mainly due to higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit, investments in new administrative support capabilities, higher incentive accruals and newly acquired operations. These increases were partially offset by lower delivery costs, mainly driven by savings in fuel expense. After excluding incentives, adjusted operating expenses would have increased 3.9%.","Our cost per case performance improved modestly from earlier in the year, but, as Bill mentioned, expense management remains a challenge for us. Adjusted cost per case performance for the third quarter in the North American Broadline business, which is the portion of the business we have given guidance on previously, increased only $0.03 in the third quarter. However, excluding the benefit from currency translation, cost per case would have increased by $0.09.","We have previously said we expect cost per case to increase between $0.05 and $0.10 this year. We would expect to be in the low end of this range, including the impact of foreign exchange, and on the high end of this range, excluding foreign exchange. We are focused on driving improvement across our operations with multiple initiatives that implement best practices, enhance our operating training programs and improve our ability to measure and analyze our performance. Adjusted operating income from the quarter was $377 million, down 2.7% from the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 3.2%, down 23 basis points from last year.","Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 34%, compared to 39% in the prior year period. This quarter's rate was positively impacted by the favorable resolution of a state tax matter. In the prior year, the rate was elevated due to the non-deductible portion of a $20 million legal settlement that we disclosed at the time. Normalizing for these types of discrete events, our tax rate would be roughly 37%. This is lower than our historical rates due to the increasing amount of business earnings in international jurisdictions that have lower tax rates, as well as reduced state taxes from legal restructurings. Adjusted net earnings increased 7% to $238 million and adjusted EPS increased 5.3% to $0.40.","Cash flow performance in the first 39 weeks of the year was relatively strong after taking into account the cash impact of certain items. Cash flow from operations increased $12 million to $860 million versus last year. This increase reflects the negative impact of two items. First, the cash impact of certain items increased $82 million year-over-year, mainly due to merger and integration planning expenses. Second, as we disclosed earlier this year, we made a $50 million pension contribution this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contributions each year.","Cash tax payments were $135 million lower than last year, due to a lower effective tax rate, which I discussed a moment ago, and merger and integration planning expenses that reduced taxable earnings. Free cash flow was $439 million in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2015, compared to $484 million in the prior year period, or a reduction of $46 million. However, after adjusting for the cash impact of certain items and the increase in pension contribution I mentioned a moment ago, free cash flow was $617 million, an increase of $86 million or 16% from the prior year period.","Capital expenditures for the first 39 weeks of the year, net of proceeds from sales of assets, increased $58 million to $422 million. About $53 million of this increase is due to IT-related merger integration planning and the rest was due to timing of investment in our fleet.","Our cash flow from operations and free cash flow are always impacted by foreign currency translation, but the impact for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2015 is much greater than the last few years. You will see in the cash flow statement a $77 million impact this year compared to less than $0.5 million last year. This means our cash flows would have been $77 million higher on a constant dollar basis.","Turning to an update on recent acquisitions, last month we completed the previously announced transaction to buy 50% of Pacific Star Foodservice, a leading foodservice distributor in Mexico. Pacific Star has operated since 1989 with distribution centers servicing customers in the major metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Tijuana. It primarily services chain accounts, including fast food and casual dining restaurants, casinos, theme parks, movie theaters and hotels throughout Mexico. This partnership fits our international expansion strategy, allows us to enhance service to our U.S. customers who operate in the region, and provides growth opportunities in an important region of the Americas.","In addition, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced our agreement to acquire Tannis Trading in Canada. Tannis operates in the Ottawa market, the fourth largest in Canada. This acquisition, which remains subject to regulatory approval, will allow us to better serve our customers and achieve our goal of increasing sales in Canada.","Regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year, there are a few additional items I'd like to point out. First, as we discussed last quarter, because of the pending merger during this fiscal year, we have not been in the market buying back shares to offset dilution from incentive-based compensation as we would normally be doing. This has had the effect of increasing our shares outstanding in the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year due to the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units. As a result, both adjusted and reported diluted EPS were lower by half a penny in the third quarter and a penny and a half over the first 39 weeks. Unless we repurchase shares during the fourth quarter, we estimate that our diluted shares outstanding may be greater than 597 million shares for the fiscal year. This estimate is dependent on the level of stock options exercises and RSU vesting that occurs, and does not include the impact of the shares to be issued in conjunction with the pending US Foods merger.","Second, please note that we plan to pay off $300 million in bonds that come due in mid-June. We currently anticipate using cash on hand to fund this payment.","Lastly, our forecast for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from asset sales, remains at $500 million to $500 million \u2013 sorry, $500 million to $550 million for fiscal 2015. But we now expect to be at the high end of this range for the year.","In closing, while our top-line has been negatively impacted by lower levels of inflation and a larger impact from foreign currency translations, we are pleased that the business continues to generate solid case volume growth, in particular, in the locally-managed portion of our business. We have opportunities to improve our operating expense management and have begun to make some progress in this area. But importantly, the business continues to generate strong free cash flow. While we have work ahead of us to transform the business, there are many exciting initiatives underway that will enhance our customer's experience, strengthen our operating performance and increase profitability.","With that, operator, we'll now take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hello. Bill, actually a tactical question and then a strategic one. So, Bill, on the tactical side, it would seem that inflation probably moderates a bit further from here. Can you offset that with cost reduction, or is the uncertainty around US Foods and kind of where the business sits today, hamstringing you from doing that? And then I have a strategic one.","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","John, we have to. I mean, so yeah, do I think we can? In the past, we've been able to adjust our expenses accordingly and I agree with your premise. I think you can see the inflation come down a little bit more just for the reasons, Chris said, we've got a couple of categories that are pretty high and the others \u2013 dairy's very volatile, as you know, so dairy is down a little bit. Seafood is down a little bit but seafood is not a big part of the overall mix. So, I think essentially you're looking at an environment today where you've got two categories, meat and poultry, that are high, which is difficult to pass along in a fast way and the right way, and the others are pretty much neutral, if you put them all together. And yeah, I expect that to continue here at least for the \u2013 whatever; a few \u2013 couple or three months as far as we can see out.","As I said in my comments, we are seeing improvement on the expenses sequentially, we're just not seeing it as fast as we had planned and I think you will see more expense improvement here in the fourth quarter relative to the first part of the year and we're certainly planning to do even more for next year.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then, strategically, I know you don't have a lot to talk about this, but have you done much planning if US Foods doesn't happen? And what would you do differently than you're doing today if that doesn't come to fruition?","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, one of the things I feel really good about is we have done a nice job here. We spent some money doing it separating, running the business day-to-day and keeping our people \u2013 the vast majority of our people focused on taking care of their customers and running their business and not having them be distracted by the merger. And then we had another group of people and outside support folks who have done a great job under Chris's and Greg Bertrand's leadership driving out a very sound integration plan. So I feel good about what we've done to date. Yes, we have done some contingent planning and it's not fully developed. We have had discussions as a management team and with our board and we will continue to have those discussions and once we have a ruling, then we'll probably take some more time but not a lot of time and go forth from there with some other strategic directions. So yes, we've done some planning, but not in a position today to really talk a whole lot about that.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right, thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank. And Karen Short, your line is now open. Please check your mute function. And we'll move on to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. I just have a follow-up to John's question here. Bill, in the past, you guys have mentioned international M&A as an area of interest. I mean, obviously, the U.S. market is top of mind right now. But if material consolidation is not possible here, where are your heads today on international relative to where they were in the past? Is it still something that you would be interested in?","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Certainly. As you heard, we are pleased with the joint venture that we just finalized with our partners down in Mexico and we have gradually built out some small footprint in Costa Rica and now Mexico, Bahamas, Ireland, Canada was the first one, obviously. So, I think where we are there, Ed, is I think it's just a matter of pace of place. So we definitely, when we talk about the strategy of the company, that fifth point we talk about is always looking for other areas to expand, whether it be through adjacencies or geographics. And I just see it more as something we need to do continually, and over the next three years to five years, I would like to think we'll continue to find good partners in different parts of the world where our customers value our capabilities and find ways to grow there primarily to lay a foundation for the future beyond that.","So I see international more as something we need to do. We need to continually build it for the medium to long-term. Short to medium-term, obviously, US Foods is a big, big part of our strategy. It's not our strategy. It's a big part of our strategy. If that were not to work out, we would revisit other strategic opportunities that we looked at in the past and look at our capital structure and all those types of things. I'm just not in a position today to talk a whole lot about it.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And, Bill, when you think about the U.S. business now, there is obviously always puts and takes on what impacts the earnings. I mean, the backdrop doesn't really seem to be too bad right now with what's going on with restaurant sales and lower fuel. But this quarter, you're back to EBITDA actually being down a little bit year-over-year to a couple of quarters of good growth, and I guess the question is, what is it really saying about the outlook for the business, I guess, absent a deal? And you touched on a little bit, but is there a need for some larger strategic refresh or restructuring if the transaction were not to happen, or are you really just \u2013 is it more really more about fine-tuning?","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think both, all right? So we need to manage what we have the ability to control the most, which is our business. And we're pretty at running our business. Obviously, as we've said for a while now, the market environment we are in, it's difficult. It's very competitive and it's not unlike many other industries and we don't expect that to change. So again, to kind of recap how we look at the world, we see modest medium to long-term growth in the industry. We expect to grow faster than that. To do that, we need to differentiate ourselves ongoingly with our customers and we need to take costs out of the system. That's one of the reasons why this merger is so important to us. If the merger doesn't happen, we'll need to find other ways to continue to do that. We may not get there quite as fast, but I'm confident we'll continue to go in the right direction.","Specifically to this quarter, you can look at in a lot of different ways. The bottom line is we didn't manage our expenses as well as we would have liked. If we had managed our cost piece maybe just a nickel better, I think you would have seen a different result here and I would have been \u2013 I wouldn't have talked as much about planned expenses. So we're going to have quarters where there is inflation and less inflation. And we had good volume growth. As I've said, we managed gross profit reasonably well, given the environment. We just didn't bring our expenses in line as fast as we planned and I expect it will get better with that here over the next two years to three quarters.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you and good luck with US Foods.","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Sorry about that before. Just guess curious, I mean, I know we've talked a lot about the expense issue and I guess I'm still confused as to why it's been a problem for two quarters in a row. I mean, I know you pointed to some things in terms of comps that affected expenses, but anything else you can kind of put some color on?","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'll do my best, Karen. I would say this quarter was a little different in that our selling expense was higher than where it was the first half of the year. We were up a couple pennies the first half of the year in selling and that was fine. We had a lot of gross profit dollar growth and that's going to drive selling expense. So, this quarter was up more than that. It's still probably fine but it just can't be sustained. I mean, it's just we just a situation where seasonally it's a low volume quarter. It's also a time that we bring MAs on in terms of training, and we had some operating companies that were behind in their head count and I think that put some pressure on us here as well.","So, selling costs is a little higher than what we planned. On the operation side, we're making progress. We're driving out a lot of change there, Karen, and we've been driving out very aggressively over the last year to two years. And that puts a lot of stress on the operating companies at a time when they still need to provide really solid service to our customers. And so there's been some challenges in terms of how fast you can drive that change and how well it's received by our workforce and how well our leadership, including me, are able to drive that out. So, what we're doing here is transforming a company and we're bringing more standardization to our best practices in the field. We're functionalizing that part of our business in terms of the OpCo and our end-to-end supply chain organization now, and it's just taken a little longer to get where we want to go. The good news is we are seeing sequential relative improvement and that's what gives me some confidence here.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Karen, this is Chris. I'll jump in and just elaborate on one point Bill made. Remember, a couple years ago, we talked quite a bit about some of the changes we made in our sales organization, and we saw that disruption. We saw that disruption and slowed growth in terms of case volume on the local side especially and we talked quite a bit about it at the time. We pushed through a lot of change and it took a while for all that change to kind of be accepted and understood and appropriately reacted to in the field.","I think what you're seeing now is somewhat similar going on, on the operating expense environment. We are, as Bill said, pushing out a lot of change. It's for the good. It's going to lead to better results in the future, but it's going to take a while for some of that change to actually drive all the way down to the operating company level. And I think that's part of what we're experiencing right now. Not an excuse. We need to manage it better, but I do think we're seeing some of that.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I mean, to your point on MAs and progress on the top-line, I guess independent sales definitely seemed fairly strong, although SYGMA was weak. But anything to point to on what was driving the strength in independent?","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that's the good news. I mean, when we talk about initiatives, they're not all about cost savings. And I think what you're seeing there is some \u2013 several things that we've done over the last two years or three years, starting with the CRM tool, category management. We're getting better executing that; some basic things we're doing in terms of working with our MAs and training and how to segment more effectively our customers and product categories. And just creating more continuity, if you will, between the corporate sales organization and the field sales organization, as well as the OpCos overall. So we're pleased both on the local side and the corporate side. If you go back four quarters or five quarters, we had no growth on the local side. So, I think that's a bright spot and that's certainly something we've emphasized and something we need to continue to emphasize.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, just last question on the expense side. What's driving the merger and integration increase? Because I guess I was under the impression that you had kind of completed all you could from a merger and integration expense perspective until you know more \u2013 or until, hopefully, you close the merger, and it still seemed to be-I mean, it's still increasing.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, it's actually not increasing on a sequential basis. It's starting to decline. We hit our peak last quarter, Karen, and it's coming down from there. But I'll take your question to where I think you want to go, anyway, why is it not perhaps dropping faster? There are a couple reasons.","I mean, the interest portion of that, obviously, is not going to go anywhere, but even on the operating expense portion, there is a lot of work that continues to be done to prepare the two IT systems to be able to merge. We're not touching the US Foods system or vice versa, but we're creating the conduits that will be necessary to allow them to merge. Unfortunately, as this deal has drug out, we were able to stand down certain aspects of what we were doing from a planning perspective because we can stand them back up rather quickly; but a lot of other areas, we need all the time we could possibly get to be prepared for merging and integrating, and we continued some of that work. So it's come down somewhat. I expect it to not increase again, of course, until we complete the transaction; and, of course, we'll give you new guidance.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about cash. I spent many years in fixed income land and cash is cash. You can't really define it. And it just looks to me like, in fact, you're not covering your dividend, or didn't for the first nine months of the year. And then \u2013 so I'm wondering, you have a $300 million payment you're going to make this year. Could you talk about: are you going to borrow? Do you have a revolving credit facility that you're going to borrow under?","And sort of the same thing holds true if the deal does not go through, you probably will have your bonds will be put back to you, the $5 billion, but you're not sitting on that much cash. So what do you think happens? How do you fund that put if it happens?","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Let me take the two pieces of that, Meredith. First, the $300 million, as I mentioned, we will pay that out of the cash that we have sitting on the balance sheet, which is just shy of $5 billion. That's what we'll do, initially. If we then repay the bonds, because you correctly point out if the merger agreement terminates there's a process for those to be redeemed, we would pay those back out. Whatever we can't pay out of cash, we would put into our credit facility. We do have a very large commercial paper line backstopped by a credit facility, about a $1.5 billion. So we have got plenty of capacity to put on the balance sheet.","We would then look at whether we have enough capacity for just general working capital needs and we'd look at whether we need to term out some of the debt that we've taken on the balance sheet the last couple of years, the acquisitions we've done, et cetera. We would do that after that point in time when things settle out.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, just have one other question. You said that...","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Meredith, do you mind if I just jump in still? Just on the cash point, I was just going back to the earlier questions we had. First of all, we're going to cover our dividend here. If you adjust for the merger related expenses and things like that, we're going to more than cover our dividend from free cash flow this year.","Second of all, the way I look at cash is, strategically, we include debt capacity. So obviously, as you well know, we're very highly rated company from a debt perspective. We have plenty of debt capacity and certainly want to utilize it prudently, but I'm very confident in our ability to fund whatever we need to fund.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm not actually worried about liquidity. You're not going to run out of liquidity. My next question, just quickly, is about category management and cycling the improvements you've seen so far. I think that we'll cycle some in this next quarter, but it sounded like you had more coming. How do you think that balances out in terms of the benefit to the gross margin?","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, you're right. We're finishing up the third year and we said from the beginning category management would be somewhat backend loaded, and we've seen those benefits this year. I think the key that \u2013 the way to look at that, Meredith, is just we are now maturing to a point where, well, we speak about category management, it truly is embedded in how we merchandise and we have centralized merchandising here to a large extent. We certainly have standardized all of it. We still do some locally in terms of working with suppliers, but, for the most part, we're working with the suppliers here at corporate and then working closely with our operating companies.","So from that standpoint, we've realized a lot of benefits, but we have some more launches here to do later this year and into next year; not a significant part of the overall volume. And then, I think what you'll see us do is we'll get into renewals and we'll continue to perfect what we started here and get better at it, and probably have more time to focus on the innovation side of it, which is critical, obviously, to growing the business as well.","So, I look at it as something which we would continue to get better at, which would continue to help us mitigate the overall margin pressure that we face in the business itself, but something that we feel really good about at this point.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And let's take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Bill, I wanted to ask you about the sales trend during the quarter into April, and \u2013 it was pretty abrupt from quite strong to kind of weak. And I didn't see Sysco's numbers, but for the industry. It sounds like you guys outperformed that, but what do you think is going on with the industry? I mean, you kind of alluded to weather, because last year was easy and this March was tough. What do you think is going on in April? And I mean, do you have some insight into things maybe stabilizing or turning back up here in the later part of April or early May?","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Andy, if you notice, I really didn't talk a lot about the industry or the market because it's hard to make that call right now. While I did talk about weather, I didn't whine about weather this year. So I feel good about that. What we saw was this, and what I alluded to in my comments, we had \u2013 last year, if you go back and look at the weather, it was pretty harsh in December, January and the first three weeks in February and it was harsh in areas where typically you don't see it: Charlotte, Dallas, Atlanta and other places. And so we had some favorable comparisons in late December, January and February. Unfortunately, January and February are not exactly big months for us.","Then, if you recall last year, there was a little bit of a cabin fever impact up north and I think people got out in March just because they needed to get out and then March was reasonably mild and so was April. And so, the camps and the clubs started to open up earlier. So we had good volume in March and April relative to the rest of the year last year and I think we're seeing softer volume this year. What I'm trying to say to you is I think weather is impacting that. I just don't know to what degree and I think I can make a better call on that after we see May and June here because we'll be back to apples-to-apples.","In terms of what I read and what I hear, it's probably not a whole lot different than you. The good news here is the consumer sentiment is positive. It's up and down a little bit, but it's still positive. The sentiment of our restaurant operators is positive and it's remained positive. So I think people are generally seeing \u2013 at least maintaining \u2013 they're seeing good things and they're hopeful that it'll translate into better things. Probably the biggest positive out there right now, I would say, would be the lower fuel prices. They've come back up a little bit, but all-in-all, the consumer is getting a raise, if you will, at the pump. What's not clear there at all is to what degree. It appears that the consumer is paying down debt with some of that, saving some of that and spending some of that. It's not clear how much of that we are getting, perhaps some, but I don't think a lot at this point.","With that said, I think to the extent that the fuel prices stay down for an extended period of time, that will be good for our customers and I would expect that that would help us over time. So it's a long way of saying it; it's hard for me to really explain what's going on in the market right now because of kind of the unusual weather comparisons as well as the impact of fuel, but I think we'll have a better read on this as we get into the summer.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. No, I was looking for more color. But I just want to clarify with following up just on what you're saying. In your preamble, you said you expect things to get better. It sounds like it's more of a macro view of the business rather than something you've seen in the last week or two as a trend that has turned up.","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I expect the macro to clear up is what I try to say. I wish I could give you more. In terms of our performance, what I alluded to in my comments was March was softer and April softer. But again, I do think some of that is the comparisons. We'll see. So let's summarize here. You've got moderate inflation, you've got some FX, but let's put that to the side. And you've got softer volume in March and April. I would expect it to pick up. I'm still very pleased with what we are doing. We are growing our volume both on the local side and the corporate side. So relative to the market, I'm pleased where we are at there.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","I just wanted to ask Chris a question on the incentive compensation accrual you've called out. It's kind of housekeeping, but it seemed like quite a big number compared to trend and well above what the stock option alone would be. Did I do that math right? And if so, could you give us some explanation of why the accrual was so big?","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'm not so sure. I can't respond to the last part of \u2013 compared to what you're thinking, but the accrual itself is just what we anticipate paying out on those incentive accruals versus where we are on our objectives and on a year-over-year basis, we're just in a much better place. So last year at this time, we were not hitting our bonusable objectives and so we had very little accrued this year. We are accruing still at target because we are on pace to hit those objectives. So on a year-over-year basis, that's where you get the increase.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. So you're saying it's on trend with prior quarters, there was no catch-up Q3, just your on trend with the bonus accrual?","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Not this year. Yeah, this year, there's been no catch-up from quarter to quarter. No. Last year, it bounced around because every quarter you got to look at where you are versus those objectives and so we went through the first quarter fine. But then we had to start reducing the accruals Q2 and Q3 because we were no longer on track to hit the target.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Fine. So you were just calling out a tough comparison and we can do the adjustment if we like, and it is what it is. Okay.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. That's really all it is. Like say, I normally \u2013 I try to put things on an apples-to-apples basis as much as possible and when I look at our performance this year, especially on operating expenses, I don't like to say, well, we have to compare those incentives versus a year where there were no incentives whatsoever. Now, we still have to pay for those incentives and so those are real dollars and they are really going to go out the door, so we don't try to, again, excuse it, so much as just when you are looking at a percentage increase, I like to try to do apples-to-apples. That's why I gave you the number.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks taking my question. I was just curious in the quarter how you think about market share or what your market share may have been and I ask because it looks like some of the broader industry sales trends, at least for the restaurants, it seem very, very strong this quarter. So I was just curious what you would think how you performed relative to the industry during the quarter.","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'll take that one, Kelly. First of all, we don't track market share quarterly. We look at it annually through different industry sources, primarily technomics and we look at the overall market, U.S. and Canada, and then obviously we look at our numbers and generally if you go back and look over the long-term, Sysco has been able to grow its share about half a point a year and I think we are continuing to do that. I can't really speak to this quarter on market share because I don't have the market data. Certainly, there was some strength in our customer base but not throughout the quarter and certainly not with all customers. So again, I was pleased with how we grew the business, but we don't really track the market share quarterly.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. And then if I could just follow up with one more. Just in light of McDonald's announcement to shift towards using antibiotic-free chicken on their menus, I was just curious how Sysco is maybe positioned in terms of supply of antibiotic-free chicken. Do you see that as an opportunity? What kind of conversations are you having with suppliers and your customers around these products and what could any sales and margin implications for Sysco be if there is a broader shift from your customers to products like this?","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I think if I could broaden the question a little bit and not make it about chicken, but just in general, that's one of the key things that we think category management will help us focus on with a brighter light, which is be working with our suppliers and our customers is to better understand what the customers' needs are and how we can, as we optimize our SKUs and strategize together and do a better job of positioning a product in the way that our customers would want to see it whether it's organic or local or whatever it was important to them. So with us, it always starts the way you posed the question, which is what's important to the customer? What does the customer need? And we are doing a lot of work on the customer side through the marketing department, customer loyalty and issues to understand customer needs and then connecting that to the work that we are doing with our suppliers and category management and the data they provide us to better optimize our SKUs.","Now, it's early days and plenty of work to do there, but it's a big opportunity for us going forward. And I would also say to you, we have over the years made some good progress on the sustainability front and I think you'll see us continue to raise the profile of that work within the company and that group will work very closely with our customers, but also with our merchandising and our marketing team. So bottom line is we do everything we can to understand what the needs of our customers are. I think we are better positioned to do that going forward and I think we can speak more specifically about that as time goes on.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.","Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thank you. Could you just give a little more detail on what we could expect from the court action this week? How long will it take before we hear a decision? And if the court rules for you, is it a foregone conclusion that things will just be approved as stated? Or do you still need to negotiate with the FTC? And if there's a ruling against you, how long does it take to get through the administrative hearing with the FTC?","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Great questions, Mark. This was new ground for all of us. I would say, as far as the timing, obviously, that's in the hands of the judge in terms of how long the process takes. The hearing starts tomorrow and the judge has given us up to seven days so we'll go through \u2013 it's likely to go through the end of next week. Then there'll be some, as I understand it, some briefs or papers filed by each side with the judge to review. And then, he'll take the time that he needs to come back with a ruling. So we don't know exactly how long that is, but I would think it's closer to weeks than months. But, again, that's his call.","As far as what happens, as I said in my comments, if we were to prevail, then we think there's a short period of time where the FTC has an opportunity to decide whether they want to appeal or not. And we would wait on that, and then go from there. If they were to prevail, we'll sit down internally and then sit down with the sponsors, the owners of US Foods and charter a course from there as well. So, to be determined, but that's \u2013 those are the different ways it could play out.","Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And maybe you could talk about the state of US Foods while we're waiting, because we have seen some margin declines in their business through this year, we've been waiting for this deal to close.","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","I really can't comment much on US Foods. I think it goes without saying that this process is taking longer than we would've liked. And it's probably a little bit harder on them than it has been on us. So, early days, certainly they lost some sales people and I think their sales were hurt. I'm not close enough to it nor should I be in terms of what their margins are right now. And obviously, they pulled back here some on the integration planning over the last couple of months. So we'll \u2013 I think I'll just leave it at that. I probably shouldn't be commenting on US Foods.","Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And let's take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. At this point, just one, I think, easy question for you guys. SYGMA, in general, had a very strong year in fiscal 2014 and has been pretty slow year-over-year to this point in fiscal 2015. Can you shed some light in terms of what's happened there, whether some was by choice, maybe some wasn't by choice? How you feel about the overall growth of that segment over time?","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John. I'll start. I'll let Chris jump in too. I would say it's been a couple of years since SYGMA has had a strong year, and it's got a lot of attention. We have restructured there somewhat and put Greg Keller over SYGMA full-time. And Greg grew up in the SYGMA business. He's been running our national sales area up until the last several months, so he is very well-versed in the SYGMA business. He's very well connected with our customer base. He's got a lot of passion for that business. So, I believe we're in good hands there for leadership.","There's some things that we're working on there both in terms of how do we better position ourselves in terms of the needs of those customers and still run expenses very tight. So, it's a very transaction service oriented business. Not with a lot of touches like the Broadline, but there's very little margin for error in SYGMA. So, we've had to invest some money over the last year or so in terms of facilities and drivers and people like that and things like that to strengthen the business. And that's hurt us on the bottom line. We've also had to just take a look at how well we're running the business overall.","So, I'd say, we're in transition with SYGMA. We like the business strategically. It's a very \u2013 that customer base or potential customer base is a big part of the overall opportunity. And it's always nice when you're sitting down with customers or prospective customers for \u2013 to give them a choice in terms of which model they would prefer, the SYGMA model or the Broadline model. And the reality is sometimes they prefer both, depending on their locations and our positions; so, somewhat in transition there, work to do strategically, still very important to the company.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Have you...","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","John?","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Hi.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Just add a couple of other points. As Bill said, it's a business where expense control is incredibly important. It's a low margin business. There have been some regulatory changes on the transportation side, drivers and work rules and things like that, that, while we can handle those fairly well in the Broadline, they affect SYGMA disproportionately. And we're having to overcome some of those things. And as Bill said, we just \u2013 we've got to look at the model and continue to find ways to offset increases like that; so I would echo the statement. It's in transition. We've got some work to do.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Has there been any significant account loss that's maybe been covered up by some account gains? And as you kind of look forward over the next couple of years, do you have any big chain opportunities to add that could be coming up for bid?","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","I don't think there's any overly significant account losses. SYGMA is no different than the rest of our business. There's a lot of pricing pressure in that business, and so we've had to deal with that as well along the way as we've looked at expenses. But again, Greg is a very strong leader, very strong sales guy. So I'm quite optimistic that we'll continue to find the right mix of customers and do a good job for them. And \u2013 but again, the way we look at SYGMA today is we want to understand what the customer's looking for: what kind of model, what level of support, what economics are they willing to incur. And if that's the SYGMA model, then fine. If it's not, then we'll put them into Broadline. They go back and forth and, as I said, some customers utilize both models. So, I think we're in a good place there in terms of the direction, but from a customer standpoint we look at it across the entire spectrum, which is: what does the customer want in terms of the trade-off of service and price?","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Wanted to just go back to the product for a second. And it sounds like, obviously, early stages, but so far if you've been seeing any incremental demand increases from more of your customers wanting natural organic types of products, would you say that so far you've been able to have access to the supplies? Have you been able to meet demands? And that, now as you're continuing to go through category management, is that something that will continue to evolve? Is that fair to say at this point?","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Vinny. Yeah, that's what I was trying to say. So, yes, we've definitely seen that trend over the last few years. Now, it's a trend. And I have to tell you, in the scheme of what we do, it's not a huge amount of the business, which creates part of the challenge where you need enough volume and you need enough velocity to make it work for the supplier and on the cost side and for the customers. So, I would say it's like a lot of things in Sysco today.","There's certainly parts of the country and certain OpCos where we do a very good job on the local side and fresh side, and then there's others not so good. And that's where I see the work in merchandizing, and category management, in particular, with innovation getting us in position to be more consistent; and by doing that, create more volume, which will make it more economical. So, the trends have definitely been there. We're responding to them. We just \u2013 we need to continue to get better at it and \u2013 it's a catch-22. We need to continue to grow the volume to make it work for everybody.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. That makes sense. Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up. Inflation, that you could see, moderate over the quarter. Was anything kind of internally surprising to you versus your forecast from a particular category specific standpoint? And then, maybe just any additional color with your thoughts on inflation overall as we get through the rest of this year.","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah \u2013 surprising. I guess probably it fell off faster than I thought it would from that standpoint. It doesn't surprise me that dairy is down, for example. I mean, dairy is a very volatile category, but the fact that several categories are essentially flat, that's probably a little surprising. And I think as far as the rest of the year, I can't \u2013 if you're going to give me the fiscal year, I could probably look that far ahead. And I think we talked about this with John, earlier. Yeah, I would expect inflation to moderate somewhat more, but I still expect to see some low level of inflation here this quarter.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, Bill, thanks very much. Good luck.","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Lash - Morningstar Research","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I apologize if I missed this earlier, but one of the things that stood out to me in the operating expense line was that delivery costs were lower. And I wondered if you could speak to that, if there was an anomaly this quarter, or whether that's a trend that you expect to continue in light of the fact that we've been hearing that truck driver shortages continue to plague firms across a number of industries?","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it was mainly driven \u2013 at least in our case, it was mainly driven by lower fuel costs, which we called out. So, is the truck driver shortage abating? I would say that it's not getting any worse. We've kind of learned how to handle it, although it's not exactly easy; but this particular quarter we just started to see some benefit from fuel. And if you recall a quarter or so ago, we talked about we'd start seeing some benefit in the back half of the year, and this is it.","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Erin, I would only add \u2013 I think where we have driver shortages, and where it's not self-inflicted, it's generally in these areas where there has been a lot of drilling and a lot of energy. And so, as that's subsided somewhat, I think that has actually created a little more capacity. So, we're not all the way back there, but I think that pressure is a little less than what it was six months or nine months ago.","Erin Lash - Morningstar Research","Okay. Thanks. That's very, very helpful. And then, just my second question with regards to a lot of the press surrounding the avian bird flu and whether that will \u2013 or to what degree you think that that could impact your cost structure going forward.","William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Erin, it's really too early for me to make a call on that. I don't think to a large extent, but it's certainly \u2013 those types of things are things we monitor regularly, but at this point, I'd say \u2013 I wouldn't say that's a big issue from a cost.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it's affecting some of the supply as you're reading and that obviously has some impact out there. It's only if it starts affecting a very large part of the supply, not just here in the U.S. but offshore as well, but it begins to impact our ability to find product and distribute it to our customers. Thus far, that's not the case. But as Bill said, we watch this stuff. We stand up crisis teams when it's important and when it becomes relevant.","Erin Lash - Morningstar Research","Thank you.

Accordingly, we\u2019ll update you once the firm date for the event has been chosen.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.","William J. DeLaney","Thanks Shannon. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported third quarter sales of $11.3 billion in net earnings of $181 million. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding certain items was $0.38 for the quarter, compared to $0.40 in the prior year. Market conditions during the first two months of the quarter were dominated by the impact of unusually severe winter weather conditions throughout much of the United States. As a result, we experienced very modest sales growth in January and February and delivery expenses were under significant pressure as well.","Conditions improved markedly in March as the adverse weather subsided, which likely contributed to consumers going out more both to shop and eat. We benefited from this turn of events as evidenced by our nearly 6% sales growth in March, almost twice the top-line growth we experienced for the overall quarter. In assessing our operating performance for the quarter and factoring in the challenging market conditions, results were generally inline with our expectations.","Sales growth were modest at 3.2% was aided by improved, locally managed sales trends in March. Gross profit grew nearly at the rate of sales growth and at a higher rate than we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year. We also reduced our operating cost for case in our Broadline business. We are encouraged by improved gross profit trends during the quarter and attributed much of our progress in this area to more consistent margin management practices in our operating companies, strengthening local sales trends and the low level of inflation we experienced during much of the quarter.","Moving forward, we assume our cost is regarding gross margin trends in the short-term as we begun to see a meaningful increase in product cost inflation in the high cost meat and dairy categories since the end of the quarter. The consistently improved cost per case results, we\u2019re experiencing in the Broadline business have been driven by the benefits realized from several cost reduction initiatives we\u2019ve implemented over the past two years, especially in the SG&A area of the business. As some of these benefits begin to ramp on a year-over-year basis, we expect to realize increased benefits from more of our transformation initiatives on the operation side of the business.","Turning to our technology transformation initiatives, this fiscal year between November and March we implemented our new ERP platform at three operating companies and in April converted it to additional locations for a total of 10 companies running on the new ERP technology. The successful conversion of five OPCOs in six months reflects our consistent progress in strengthening and stabilizing our ERP platform.","In addition, we work to ensure smoother transitions for each successful convergence, for example improved procedures in attention to data management help to make the go-live at Denver and New Orleans last month a more successful year. Regarding our initiatives to lower product costs, we expect to meet our stated financial objectives for this fiscal year and next as our category management efforts continued to gain momentum.","By the end of this fiscal year, the pilot all the wave 1 and majority of wave 2 categories were launched into the market representing $5 billion to $7 billion in annual spend and roughly a third of the total addressable spend. We continue to enhance the program\u2019s effectiveness by showing best practices and improving communication both of the corporate merchandising and operating company level.","We also continue to progress on our initiatives to lower operating costs. During the quarter, we advanced our routing optimization project, which is resulting in reduced routes in miles driven while improving on-time deliveries. Our fleet optimization initiative is underway and we have removed hundreds of older pieces of equipment from the system with more to come.","In addition, we have now completed an initiative to negotiate standard terms and specifications for fleet purchases. These changes combined with similar actions for warehouse equipment completed earlier this year will help us reduce costs and optimize our capital spend as we move forward.","Regarding our proposed merge with US Foods, the integration planning team is making good progress toward bringing our two companies together as Chris will describe in a few minutes. This transaction represents a significant opportunity to enhance our ability to serve our customers, strengthen our supplier partnerships, further engage our employees and enhance profitability through meaningful synergies.","We are encouraged by our continuous improvement on multiple fronts throughout the company and believe that this transformational change will help our customers to be more successful through our added efficiency in our business and enhance our financial results. Personally engaging in transformation of this magnitude is both challenging and rewarding for me as well as for all of our 49,000 associates. I very much appreciate their efforts and dedication, as we move forward in this exciting and pivotal time in Sysco\u2019s history.","Now I\u2019ll turn the things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.","R. Chris Kreidler","Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $11.3 billion or an increase of 3.2%, compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased Case volume, including the impact of acquisitions. Case volume increased 3% for the quarter and Case volume excluding acquisitions increased 2.3%. Inflation remained quite modest during the quarter, increasing sales by 0.9% and changes in foreign exchange rate decreased sales by 0.9%.","As Bill mentioned, January and February sales were negatively impacted by the unusually severe weather throughout most of the country. However, March saw a March rebound with sales growth during the month of 5.5%, which was more in line with the rate of growth in the first half of the year.","Gross profit in the third quarter increased 2.7% nearly at the same rate of sales growth.","Gross margin declined 9 basis points to 17.69%, which is the smallest decline we\u2019ve seen in 15 quarters. After taking into account changes in customer mix, gross margin actually increased slightly compared to the prior year. Similar to what we saw with sales trends during the quarter, gross profit was substantially stronger in March, compared to January and February, increasing 4.8% during the month as weather and the locally managed sales trends improved.","However, as Bill mentioned, since the end of the quarter, we\u2019ve begun to see a meaningful increase in product costs inflation in the meat and dairy categories, which together totaled roughly 30% of our annual sales. We expect this pressure may contribute to added gross margin pressure in the near-term.","Operating expenses increased $57 million or 3.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, compared to the prior year period. A year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased Case volume and new cost from acquired companies, increased delivery and warehouse costs somewhat exacerbated by the unusually severe weather, increased corporate expenses, due mainly to timing, partially offset by lower sales organization costs and a decrease in retirement related expense, as a result of the restructuring work we completed last year.","Benefits generated from our transformation initiatives more than offset cost pressure in our delivery and warehouse areas, resulting in a $0.03 decline in operating costs per Case in our Broadline operations in the third quarter and a $0.07 decline for the first 39 weeks of the year with both periods excluding the impact of certain items. We remain confident in meeting or exceeding our objective of a $0.05 decline for the full fiscal year as we experienced continued year-over-year benefits from changes in our sales organization and the impact of lower retirement-related expenses.","The impact from the restructuring of our retirement plan is actually exceeding our expectations. We now expect that retirement-related expenses for fiscal 2014 will be lower by $65 million to $75 million excluding certain items. This is lower than our previous guidance of down $50 million to $60 million and expenses from our enhanced 401(k) benefits have been lower than anticipated.","As some of the benefits from our SG&A initiatives begin to wrap on a year-over-year basis, we expect to realize increased benefits from more of our transformation initiatives on the operation side of the business.","Operating expenses including certain items increased $51million or 3.3%, certain items totaled $56 million during the quarter, an increase of $6 million over the same quarter last year. Certain items this quarter consisted primarily of two times; first, merger and integration planning expenses totaled $32 million and mainly related to professional fees.","Second, we\u2019ve recorded a $20 million legal contingency accrual related to a previously disclosed investigation in California, a portion of which should not deductible for tax purposes. Certain items in the prior year period totaled $50 million including a $41 million charge withdraw from a multiemployer pension fund.","Business transformation expenses were lower in the third quarter compared to last year by $13 million and were lower by $45 million for the first 39 weeks of the year. About half of the variance year-to-date relates to a change we have made in how we allocate internal labor cost to the project. In the past, we allocated the cost of internal associates based upon the percentage of time they spend on the project.","We are now allocating either all or none of an associates cost to the project depending on whether they spend the majority of their time on the project. This has had the effect of shifting some expense from business transformation expense to general corporate expense. The remainder of the year-to-date variance in business transformation expense is the result of capitalizing more of the work effort than originally estimated.","As a result of the change in labor capitalization methodology and the increased amount of capitalization, we now expect total business transformation expenses for the year to be lower than our previous guidance in the range of $275 million to $300 million. And general corporate expenses to be somewhat higher.","Operating income for the quarter was down 1.4% year-over-year after adjusting for certain items operating income increased 0.3%. Net earnings for the third quarter were $181 million, a decrease of $20 million or 10.2% compared to the prior year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.31 and 8.8% decrease compared to the prior year.","Adjusting for certain items diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.38, which was down 5%, compared to the prior year. We estimate that the impact of the unusually severe weather in January and February reduced earnings per share by $0.01 to $1.05. Total capital expenditure is totaled to $117 million for the third quarter this year compared to $111 million last year. We continue to expect total capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million for fiscal 2014.","However, after including anticipated proceeds from asset sales net capital spending will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Free cash flow was $273 million for the third quarter increasing over the prior year period mainly due to improvements in working capital performance which offset weaker net earnings.","For the first 39 weeks of the year, free cash flow increased 22% to $484 million. As we began to wrap our particularly strong cash flow performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect the level of year-over-year increases in free cash flow to moderate.","Turning to the pending US Foods merger, we continue to make progress in our integration planning efforts and have engaged in an extensive process focused on three goals; day one readiness, value creation and long-term organizational design. The teams are working well together and has made a lot of progress in a relatively short period of time.","Regarding the regulatory process our dialog with the SEC continues to be productive as we work to fulfill their second request for information about our business and industry. We continue to believe that this merger will benefit customers and help us become more efficient in an evolving and competitive marketplace. And also believe the SEC will agree that our customers have many choices in the fiercely competitive marketplace in which we operate today. As a result we continue to expect the merger to close in the third calendar quarter of this year.","In closing, while severe weather in the third quarter present the challenges to the business and our financial results. We\u2019re relatively pleased with our business performance as we exited the quarter. In addition we\u2019re excited about our progress to transform our business and our integration planning efforts related to the US Foods merger.","While we continue to have much work ahead of us we strongly believe that we are taking the right steps and making the right strategic investments to position our company for success in the future.","With that operator we\u2019ll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll move first to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John E. Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, Bill. I\u2019m pretty encouraged by right your gross margin management. So, the question is, is there a different philosophy with regard to how you were spending those dollars? How you think about elasticity, and if so what is driving that change in philosophy and how you, practically what things you are doing differently.","William J. DeLaney","Good morning, John. I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t think there is a different philosophy, I think where you saw some improved execution. We\u2019ve been doing this a long time and we\u2019re always trying to strike the right balance between growth and taking profitable share for the medium to long-term with obviously managing our margins appropriately so.","From that standpoint what I was trying to convey in my remarks was, clearly we haven\u2019t been performing at the level we\u2019d like and we spend a lot of time \u2013 we\u2019ve done a lot of work with our operators so to speak. And I think what you saw here is a small but meaningful step forward in terms of progress and, I use the word consistency, that\u2019s probably our biggest opportunity in Sysco today and I think the benefits you\u2019re seeing in this quarter were more consistent focus and striking the right balance, I guess that between growth, pricing and what\u2019s good for the customer, anyhow just the basic day today stuff, there is nothing really overly proprietary here.","When you have commodity prices, continuous attention to how fast they are moving and what direction they are moving in and being responsive in the right ways. So I\u2019d say, it\u2019s more improved execution of that philosophy and hopefully it\u2019s a sign of things to come.","John E. Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Now is that in terms of giving lots on the improved execution. Is that more getting folks in the field to understand what you\u2019re trying to do and elasticity issues or is it more actually putting sort of guard rails on what they can do out in the field?","William J. DeLaney","I would say, our folks in the field understand, I think what it is, is that bringing more focus to the issue with all that they have to deal with on a day-to-day basis and in that process, yes, brining least parameters and overtime a little more governance to that process. So again early days here John, but we certainly are trying to get more consistency in terms of how we approach it. But our folks understand the issue, they are very good operators. It\u2019s more about bringing consistent focus to it.","John E. Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then lastly, with inflation picking up, how do you think about this pick up in perishables inflation versus those we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years. We\u2019ve had a couple of these cycles when you look at where the macro is, where you are with US Foods. Are you more or less inclined to pass that through quickly than you might have been in the past?","William J. DeLaney","I don\u2019t think the US Foods merger has anything to do with it. I would say what\u2019s interesting, what we are seeing right now John, and this is really just kind of manifest itself in the last four to six weeks. There is double-digit inflation in meat, seafood and dairy. And the rest of the categories are roughly flat, you\u2019re actually down a little bit in grocery, down a little bit in poultry, in terms of what we saw in April.","So what you\u2019re seeing here is that as you know in particular meat, those are high priced boxes. So it\u2019s challenging at times to pass that along as fast as you might like to with customers, sometimes that\u2019s not even a right thing to do, sometimes it\u2019s ups and down with the customer, kind of reworking their menu in terms of, if poultry is flat to down, working more poultry into the menu.","So we are just trying to be a little cautious here, I mean the good news here is well, as you know we don\u2019t want to see a lot of inflation over the meaningful long-term. It\u2019s not good for our customers. I mean that inflation is working its way into the top line as well.","So we\u2019re basically just common Al, I think gross margin as a percent of sales stand perspective. There is more pressure there right now than what we saw in the third quarter. But I think we\u2019ll manage it reasonably well and as far as going forward, a lot of this has to do with supplies in the beef area and I think some of this will be with us for awhile. It\u2019s really hard to predict what happens past three to six months, Al.","John E. Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","William J. DeLaney","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Good morning. On the March sales improvement, was some of that the inflation you\u2019re talking about or did the cases in the real business also get better?","William J. DeLaney","In March Andy is more \u2013 there was not very much inflation. I think we probably saw some in the later couple of weeks of March. But I think March was really more of demand, people got out more and you saw the retail numbers I think, they came out here recently and so it\u2019s just more \u2013 we saw more volume and as we alluded to, we also saw more on the locally managed side than what we see in the last two to three quarters which was encouraging as well.","Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Did you see that across the board, so the independence, I know in the past you said it\u2019s really hard to track their same-stores sales but just anecdotally or how would you can with the independent business also stronger?","William J. DeLaney","Yes, so independence will make up a significant piece of this locally managed, and yes I would tell you we saw across the board in March. There was very, was really tail two quarters. It was brutally hard out there, I think for everybody the first couple of months and then in March. We saw a turnaround in the top line in pretty much every segment. We saw every restaurant like that.","R. Chris Kreidler","Yes, and Andy, I want to be careful and echo what Bill said a minute ago about this inflation, the reason we are calling it out as frankly it come up upon us pretty quickly. We don\u2019t want it to be a surprise when we talk about it later on. But in the March quarter inflation was no different really than the rest of the quarter. And so, it really wasn\u2019t yet in the March numbers as Bill said, that we started to feel at a little bit in the later two weeks. But it was pretty much inline with the quarter.","It came on, it went from basically nothing to something in April and so that\u2019s why we are calling it out and it\u2019s pretty narrow in terms of the categories but they are big dollar categories for us.","William J. DeLaney","I don\u2019t want to get too much in the April because that's something we typically do. I would just say to you, we\u2019ve had two solid months in a row in the top line. They look a little different, April is a month, April is a transition month and so I would say to you a couple of thinks, my sense is spring came little earlier this year than last year. I saw some of the clubs and that type of thing open up and that helped us.","Easter was little later and people were still I think looking to get out, so April the weeks were not necessarily consistent but it\u2019s a month, we had another solid month on the top line and in the business. And I would just say the mix was little different between pricing and volume as well.","Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","To follow-up same vein on sales trends and this improvement. When you look at the geographies that probably add less weather impact like California and Florida, let\u2019s say, we have a lot of operations. Was there a better, do you see the same thing or was it stronger the entire quarter, could you just comment on the non-weather affected sales trends?","William J. DeLaney","I would say the weather, to go back to that was more East of the Mississippi, so that is virtually all of our markets other than California and West Coast. If I was particularly pronounced even though I would say, winner comes every year, it was particularly pronounced in the Northeast and the Mid-East, but we were shutdown at Atlanta for a couple of days. We didn\u2019t deliver that kind of thing. So I would say those first couple of months, the weather impacted the vast majority of our businesses.","As you work into March and April here now, I would say it\u2019s pretty much what we saw before, I think we are seeing very good strength in the Southwest, decent strength in the West, North-East and Mid-East still little sluggish. So these are matters of degree, but similar to what I call that I think in the last quarterly earnings release, we are seeing a little more strength certainly in the Southwestern part of the country than we are in the North and Northeastern part of the country.","Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you.","William J. DeLaney","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now move to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC","Yes, hi good morning guys.","William J. DeLaney","Good morning.","Edward J. Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC","I wanted to just follow-up on gross margin, gross profit, we tried to look at gross profit dollars per case and obviously, this quarter you did better there in terms of year-over-year growth versus where you\u2019ve been.","Now I know inflation going forward picks up. But do you think the business has reached the point where you\u2019ve done a better job in managing where our gross profit for case should at least be stable to better going forward. Or when you talk about the pressure inflation, are you trying to say that you could still be down a little bit there going forward?","William J. DeLaney","Ed, we look at this thing across a lot of different ways. So, I\u2019ll let Chris jumping in here in a minute as well. So, I want to be careful about the gross profit because that\u2019s going to play out in different categories. When I would tell you is the way I look at it, as I look at case growth, I look at the mix of case growth between locally managed, which is largely your street business versus your contract business.","And then, I look at gross profit dollar growth, and then I look at cost per case \u2013 operating cost per case. So, we can put that together, I don\u2019t want to shift in terms of your question on this call, but I would tell you obviously the first half of the year we had 1.2% gross profit dollar growth and that went to 2.7%. So, I\u2019m encouraged with that. I think we can continue to improve from there. We\u2019ll have to see how fast that develops.","So I feel good about that part. I think, we\u2019ll continue to manage the cost per case well. I think, just and put this in some historical contacts, Chris and I were talking before the call. I\u2019ve been around this business 25 years give or take, I would tell you, if you go back and look at Sysco\u2019s history we didn\u2019t always share all this, to mange our operating cost per case to be up a $0.05 a year was usually a pretty good year in normal times.","Our medium to longer-term model where we\u2019re trying to find enough initiatives every year to keep that at flat cost per case, in this particular year 2014, we targeted a $0.05 reduction as Chris pointed out. So, I\u2019m really pleased with how we are managing at the operating level, in terms of cost and encourage too much is not a trend make here, but I\u2019m encouraged what we are seeing on the gross profit dollar growth. I don\u2019t know, Chris is going to answer your specific question about what you put historic as well.","R. Chris Kreidler","Yes. I probably won\u2019t get into any specifics, but I want to echo what Bill said, it is one of the metrics we look at, but we look at a lot. And the challenge on that particular one depends upon a lot of different variables one of which, we\u2019ve been talking about here, which is inflation and inflation by certain categories.","So, if we get a lot of inflation and it happens to be in high dollar categories at sometimes are fee per pound or fee per case that can play havoc with that particular number. So, it is part of what we look at, but as Bill says, we\u2019re driving the business for gross profit dollar growth. And that\u2019s why we were generally pleased with the way we exited the quarter with the amount of growth that we saw in March.","Edward J. Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC","Yes. That makes sense. Okay. And then, just last question for you. Category manager, maybe could you provide just a bit more detail on sort of what you\u2019re seeing out there? What you\u2019re hearing from customers, where you\u2019re at? And I guess even more specifically like how our sales doing in a category then how our gross profit dollars doing in the categories?","William J. DeLaney","Sure. We\u2019re a year into this now, and as I mentioned, we\u2019re deep into wave 1 and wave 2. And we think, by the end of the year we will launched about 30% of what we called the influenceable spend, which is about two-thirds of our spend 60% to 70%. We\u2019re getting better executing that, so I would tell you there are certainly opportunity to improve, but we\u2019re assuming getting better in terms of working within our corporate merchandizing team and with our OPCOs in terms of how we communicate these category, and issues as they come out there is a lot of categories out there being launched right now.","We\u2019re getting better in terms of working with our OPCOs to work with our customers and their sales force and had the position of the opportunities for the customer as well again plenty of opportunity to improve over the next 12 to 18 months as well.","So, I think our execution is getting better, both on the communication side as well on the conversion side. We continue to see very good reductions in the cost of goods, certainly as much it ties better than what we originally plan. The sales line where we had some challenges earlier on there in terms of some of the conversions, I think we are getting better as a company in terms of positioning those conversions with customers and in the subsequent ways the sales trends are somewhat better than what we saw in the prior.","So, I would say \u2013 I would characterize it that is gradual continuous improvement on the execution \u2013 still relatively early days here and it would be a big part of our progress for next fiscal year as well.","Edward J. Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC","Great, thank you.","William J. DeLaney","Welcome.","Operator","We will now move to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.","Karen F. Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. It\u2019s just a couple of a questions on MAs. I guess, wondering, you made a comment in the press release Bill about improved weather and locally managed sales strengthened, I guess. So, I guess the first question is, what do you mean by exactly by locally managed sales strengthened?","And then the second part of that question is I guess there is definitely rumblings out there, their people might be going after your MAs knowing that there is going to be disruption. So wondering in this kind of environment as you\u2019re leading into the close, how do you \u2013 kind of how do you retain your best sales people and how do you please them that their won\u2019t be a much disruption as some people fear?","William J. DeLaney","Yes, so let me take the first one Karen. So locally managed was something I\u2019ve kind of coined here over the last 18 months. We use it more internally, but I don\u2019t really like to speak externally differently, I do internally. So it\u2019s an attempt which is getting traction now within Sysco. It\u2019s to have more clarity for operating in our market precedence. So the certain segment sales which we will call street sales, local contract being another, basically where the customer and that decision maker that relationship is driven with a local OPCO, we\u2019ve just kind of bundled that a little bit more than just talking about street from an accountability standpoint and from an influencing standpoint.","So it\u2019s an internal terminology. We still look at street within that number. So we look at both, I would tell you I think you would know this over the last four or six quarters what we\u2019ve seen is our corporate manager largely our national \u2013 large regional business has grown at a faster rate than our locally managed. And in fact, the locally managed growth is pretty modest, and it was modest again in January and February. So when I was referring to there, as it did strengthen in March along with the other book of business as well. And that is very encouraging and that is the key part of our growth and that is the key part of our profitability leveraging as well.","So it\u2019s a big part of our business and something we put a lot of emphasis on and in the fairness, while these initiatives we\u2019ve been driving out both in terms of the sales organization, cap man that kind of thing. That directly impacts that sales force, our local sales management teams and ultimately the customer, and so there has been a fair amount of distractions out there over the last year. And I think we are starting to see that we are \u2013 we are though a lot of that and beginning to manage it better.","As far as MA retention or MA numbers, we had situations in some of our companies last year where we as we had some of that distraction and disruption, we allowed our MA workforce to fall well below where our target members where. And we are coming back there, so we are not all the way back, but we had targeted growth numbers for this year and we are beginning to approach those to get to the level we want to get to.","We did eliminate several unprofitable territories about a year ago and we pretty much have worked our way through that process. As far as marketplace, please take this to \u2013 our people are always under high demand everybody comes after our sales people. We do generally a pretty job of retaining them. And I would say from the merger standpoint, our folks right now are excited, and whether there is some isolated situations there I wouldn\u2019t necessarily attribute them to the merger and there maybe a challenge I think as we pull all this together but right now I wouldn\u2019t tell you that's, it\u2019s not a big issue from the Sysco side, and it could be initiative as we put the company\u2019s together.","Karen F. Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay that\u2019s very helpful. And then just on Denver, New Orleans you commented that there was most successful conversions yet, maybe can you just talk a little bit more about why and what you did, and then what are your plans you are going to make, if you said that and I missed that out, but fair conversions for the rest of the year.","William J. DeLaney","Yes, well Denver, New Orleans, first of all they are both very large companies, very profitable companies. So that was a big step. I mentioned one example in my prepared remarks where, data management, is kind of issue for us and that\u2019s the basic thing that you look out in all conversions, but one of the things that happens when there is that much change going on sometimes, you don\u2019t have this consistent focus as you need. So we took out learning from the previous conversions and did much better and we\u2019ll continue to do better on that front.","I would also tell you on the customer side, we were more connected in particular with our larger regional and national customers in terms of how the conversion would impact them. And so as issues did arise, we were much more connective as an organization between the technology group and the sales group and that was a big part as well. So those are the two things I would call.","As far as going forward, we are having those discussions right. We\u2019re going to need overly, our view of the integration planning work. Currently that\u2019s going on with the merger and look at that, there is an opportunity to do probably a couple more companies we haven\u2019t made a final decision on that but I think there is a good chance that we probably do two more and then take a step back and look at where we are in the merger.","Karen F. Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right thanks a lot.","William J. DeLaney","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move to Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital, Inc.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me?","William J. DeLaney","Yes, can hear you?","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, good thanks. My first question is, you talked about MAs at your own company. Can you talk about at all that what\u2019s happening at US foods?","R. Chris Kreidler","Meredith, this is Chris. We really can\u2019t. We\u2019re competitors in the market and while we are going thorough a tremendous amount of integration planning, we really are trying to avoid talking about their performance, their sales, their on challenges initiatives out there, so that\u2019s something better directed directly to them.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, I also have a question, did you talk about the Easter shift at all impacting March, and probably would have been negative, and March was very strong, do you think it would have been stronger, it hadn\u2019t been for the Easter shift?","William J. DeLaney","What is the first part of your question, really what would have been negative?","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","In the Easter shift\u2026","William J. DeLaney","Yes","Meredith","By March to April?","William J. DeLaney","So your question is, if Easter been earlier, would it been better.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes.","William J. DeLaney","No there, I think a late Easter helped us. Interesting though, it didn\u2019t really help us that much. I cant\u2019 say this, our performance in Florida, which is where you would see most of the Easter benefit. What\u2019s if that different wasn\u2019t any better than the other regions until the week of Easter, and then we definitely saw the fact that, so we have a still more people in Florida, what you hear in Florida is regardless of the calendar, people tend to stay, a lot of people tend to stay until Easter.","So, it helped us, I think what really helped us a lot in March, Meredith was hurt us in January, February people. And good number parts of the country had been locked up in their homes, don\u2019t want to get out and dig it out more. So I would say, a late Easter helped us somewhat, but probably not as much as just the other side of the weather discussion.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","William J. DeLaney","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move to Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Ajay Kumar Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yes. Hi, I hope you can hear me. First on business transformation, I know, Chris that you mentioned that you\u2019re capitalizing more of the project in shifting some of the allocation on expenses, I\u2019m just wondering if the merger development have had a impact on how you\u2019re looking at business transformation, do you have to cleave things in anyway based on the business transformation process that\u2019s going on entire well over US Foods. So I was just wondering in terms of the capital allocation priorities, if anything is changed.","R. Chris Kreidler","Yes. It seems like there are several questions there. So, tell me if I don\u2019t get all of them. We\u2019re obviously taking into consideration the integration planning and what may occur post merger, but in terms of how we report our business transformation today and we\u2019re going about our business today really not that much impact.","So we\u2019re in planning phase for integration, but we\u2019re not allowing it to impact what we\u2019re doing from a business transformation perspective going after the benefits that the way look at the cost et cetera. What will impact it, and Bill alluded to it here a few minutes ago is, as we think about overlaying the merger into our company and especially from the business technology standpoint, we have to rethink about rollout schedules, we have to rethink how we\u2019re going to put the companies together technologically, that will have an impact and we\u2019re playing through various scenarios on that right now.","Ajay Kumar Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. That was helpful and just in terms of the timing of the merger looks like you\u2019re still targeting closing by the end of September and just wondering, does that seem like a realistic timeframe based on how things are going with the FTC process and is that really providing enough time to get the necessary shareholder approval?","R. Chris Kreidler","Yes. We don\u2019t need the shareholder approval on their side. They essentially have it whenever they need it, but we still believe it\u2019s realistic timeframe. I think the way we would characterize our interactions with the FTC and the regulatory process that\u2019s pretty much as expected. We don\u2019t have any reason to believe that we will be significantly faster or slower than what we expected from the very beginning. So, we still think Q3 is realistic.","Ajay Kumar Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. I just had one final question if I could. Can you just comment any further on inflation so far this quarter, I think Bill you talked about double-digit increases in certain categories, but just at an aggregate level of, how much is your cost of goods inflation right now compared to I guess it was around 1% from last quarter.","William J. DeLaney","Yes. We wouldn\u2019t necessarily give you anything forward-looking. I know we\u2019ve talked a little bit about April here and just because there is a trend in March we wanted to give you some color about what's going on with that trend? I think the way I characterize it, is we went from almost nothing which is at 1% to something. There are three very specific categories we called out that are kind of double-digit inflationary categories, but is built at the rest are really not an issue. They are either flat or even slightly down. So what average is out to certainly more than 1%, but that\u2019s not all will say and it\u2019s only April we\u2019ve got a couple more months before we build out the quarter.","Ajay Kumar Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move to Mark Wiltamuth with Jeffries.","Mark G. Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Mark Wiltamuth at Jeffries. Is there any update for us on the net positivity you expect from business transformation? Now that you\u2019ve changed the accounting a little bit on how the costs are going to be done?","R. Chris Kreidler","The way that we are allocating cost really doesn\u2019t impact the benefit at all. We\u2019ve been tracking it for those who\u2019d followed us, yourself included Mark, of course. And the benefit side and the cost side, on the benefit side we said $600 million of benefit we had achieved over three years. Bill said in his prepared remarks, I\u2019d reiterate it, we are still on track to achieve that, we hit our numbers for the first year. At mid-year we said we were still on track, but this year and we reiterated we still believe we are going to hit those numbers for the three years combined. On the benefit side no change.","What we are really talking about, what I refer to them the cost side. This is a long process and there is a lot going on and we are changing a lot. And as we go through this much change, we\u2019re having to take new looks at how we allocate cost, how we think about expenses et cetera. So we had some restatements, we\u2019ve talked about are not restatements, but adjusting the way we look at things and in this particular case we looked at the way we allocate our labor when we just said it is more precise to do with the new way.","So I\u2019ve got two choices, I either have to restate or give you a new look at the guidance,","using the new methodology which is what we opted to do or we\u2019ve to somehow go backward and tell you what it would have been in prior quarters, prior years and frankly that would have taken a lot more effort.","So we are giving you a new set of guidance, based upon the new methodology. Our variance this year from the old guidance that $300 million to $350 million a year is really about half and half capitalization of labor and methodology change on how we actually account for the labor. So that\u2019s the change frankly, if we did it under the old methodology we\u2019d still be in the old guidance. So we are just changing the guidance, so we can report it differently going forward. It does not impact the benefits.","Mark G. Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you. And on the point of attrition there\u2019s been all this chatter in the marketplace on potential loss of some customers in reaction to the US Foods merger. Any color on what the customers are saying what you\u2019ve been hearing from your side and is there any assurance that you\u2019re still retaining the customers on the US Foods side?","William J. DeLaney","Again, we are not going to comment on the US Foods side. But I would tell you from our perspective, we\u2019ve had an opportunity, very senior levels of management to speak with, virtually all of our top customers and at the local level our Presidents and VPs and salesmen out talking to many of their customers as well. And I think as time is going on people \u2013 we have been able to explain the reasons for the merger and the opportunities. And some of the challenges will come with that early days and transition and that kind of things.","So I would characterize the visits with the customers out from our perspective is very constructive, largely supported. And there were a lot of questions as you can imagine one of their key questions is to what extent will this disrupt service that type of thing as we go through the transition. And obviously that is a big priority for us to minimize that type of things.","So \u2013 so far I would say we had very good visits with our customers.","Mark G. Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay, and then on the US Foods side, are they on the same ERP system as you. And how do you feel like that will go on transition in your system?","R. Chris Kreidler","Yes, they are not on our old system which was a kind of customized proprietary system for Sysco. They had their own somewhat customized proprietary system. They are not on SAP either. So the way we looked at this, and I think we talked about this a little bit is, each company has its system. We are moving towards SAP as a unifying system. We do believe and we asked it publicly that we think it\u2019s the right system for the combined entities post merger and so we will have to build the bridge, so that both systems can communicate and talk to each other in the near and medium term and then a new road map to eventually get it all to the new ERP platform overtime.","Mark G. Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll now move to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, thanks it\u2019s (indiscernible) for John. I guess the first question, you touched on a little bit, but would that say, P and I think 10 facilities now, it would seem like it would have a pretty decent sample size to compared to the baseline OPCOs, so I was just hoping maybe you could provide some more texture around where some of the most meaningful differentiation is coming versus the OPCOs that don\u2019t have the systems?","Is it on a profitability side? Is it in case volume growth? Are you just generally getting better customer feedback around the execution, just some color around that would be great?","William J. DeLaney","Yes, I would say 10 companies, well we are pleased with that, the scheme of 70 is still early days, and our focus is, as I pointed out in my comments over the last six to 12 months has been more about stabilizing the system and improving the performances. And we see that in those companies, so on the sale side in terms of the speed of the system that type of thing, we made a lot of very good strides there.","Our service levels continue to improve and get toward the level of our legacy companies if you will. We saw a lot of opportunities to manage the inventory more efficiently and effectively and we are working on some things there. So we are pleased with the progress that we are making, but I wouldn\u2019t want to get into discussion relative to the legacy companies because it\u2019s still earlier days.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and then I just changing gears a little bit, we don\u2019t haven\u2019t talked about in a lot recently, but I guess where from your perspective obviously you have many things going on right now. But where is Sysco ventures might fit in terms of your priorities, from a longer-term perspective especially given the fact that with the scale that you have \u2013 you probably have a trove of information about what\u2019s working on restaurant customers\u2019 menus from both the sales and profitability standpoint. So it seems like it\u2019d be \u2013 something that could be a pretty major differentiation for you versus maybe other competitors in the space?","William J. DeLaney","We think, ventures is a key strategic opportunity for us. We are beginning to gain traction and we put together the platform with the company called Leapset about a year-ago. We\u2019ve rolled out certain solutions in certain markets we are seeing some progress there. We still have a big opportunity here to get it more integrated into the business. We\u2019ve made some progress there and working with several solutions, there are more solutions to come.","So I would agree with you that with this merger it give us an even stronger platform in terms of customers to leverage this capability and to build stronger more effective relationships with a greater number of customers. So it\u2019s a key part of our strategy, and I think, as we get deeper into the merger planning work, we\u2019ll be able to speak more specifically in terms of work structure and that type of things in terms of how we are going to drive it out.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay great and just lastly in terms of the CapEx, I guess Chris directionally going forward, obviously you\u2019ve got the merger going on but with some of the fleet optimization initiatives, and maybe with some of the business transformation initiatives being completed. Is CapEx directionally likely to step-down from that $500 million to $550 net of asset sales? Or is it something that kind of like a stable level of investment that\u2019s going to be on going?","R. Chris Kreidler","It is a good question. Our goal has not been on a specific dollar amount of more around the 1% to 1.2% of sales, which we rapidly approaching and so when we get to that level and preferably the lower end of that level we\u2019ll feel like we\u2019ve got the right amount of base capital that should be able to grow every year as we grow the business through volume growth.","Now overlay that the merger and yes, we\u2019ve got to take a new look at that we are. We\u2019ve got a lot of people working through what that\u2019s going to mean in terms of, what I\u2019ll call one-time capital to make the networks work well together. Toast with that we\u2019ll have to reevaluate. I got a personal believe that we should be able to get long-term run rate capital down to the low end of our range if not even slightly below that range is based upon scale. But that remains to be proven out in several years off.","Unidentified Analyst","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move to Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar Research","Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to touch on some of the \u2013 has been the two had been doing and your partnership with Robert Irvine over the past couple of years and how effective that has been or maybe hasn\u2019t been?","William J. DeLaney","Hi Erin, look we think it\u2019s been very effective in the year two, right now, with chef Irvine and as we\u2019ve talked about in the past one the reasons, we partnered with him and through Network is roughly 70% of our customers tune into that Network on a regular basis and in particular watch his shows. So he has been a great ambassador for Sysco both through the Network as well as personal appearances and working with our OPCOs and doing some nice work as well in the communities.","So we are very pleased with that partnership and we\u2019ve got some new ads that are going to be coming out this year. And I think, you\u2019ll continue to see is a significant positive for us from a marketing standpoint.","R. Chris Kreidler","I also say it\u2019s given our marketing associates a lot to be excited about we get that feedback constantly from our MAs so that positive is well for our system.","Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar Research","Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful. And then I just wanted to ask about, the Sysco brand overall, and I think you are going to make some investments behind this Sysco brand and how to better to help that I think in front of customers and I was wondering what kind of the mixes between the Sysco brand and private label and how those affect our progressing?","William J. DeLaney","You\u2019re talking about the product brand or the corporate brand, Erin?","Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar Research","The product within the product sales?","William J. DeLaney","Yes, I think what you are referring to us over the last year you\u2019re seeing the numbers pick-up a little bit in terms of the street are the local and that\u2019s been good. But I would also quickly say, as we go through and do the category management work and our customer insights work, we are trying to strike the right balance between what customers want and need, and how our brand line is up with that as opposed to just trying to push our brand out there for the second push in the brand.","So I\u2019m actually very pleased with the work that\u2019s been done in the merchandised area over the last couple of three years in terms of going through and looking at all the specs in our various categories, as we even we before the category management work started but in conjunction without now as well as combining that with our customer insight work so, we don\u2019t have a particular number in mind necessarily we are just trying to strike the right balance with our customers where we really do have a value-added product, we wanted to make sure that we\u2019re positioning it properly.","Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar Research","Thank you very much.","William J. DeLaney","Thank you Erin.","Operator","It does appear there are no further questions, and at this time, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their participation.

Joining me in Houston today are: Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ in a material manner.

DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance, an excellent progress in several key initiatives that have begun to provide a strong foundation for value creation. Our favorable operating performance was driven by providing our customers with exceptional service, growing our business with both locally and corporate-managed customers, and stabilizing our gross margins.","For the year, we achieved record sales of $49 billion, an increase of 5%. We grew our adjusted operating income and earnings per share by 3% and 5%, respectively. We generated $1 billion in free cash flow. We earned a return on invested capital of 13% on an adjusted basis. We increased our dividend for the 46th time in our history and distributed nearly $700 million in dividends to our shareholders.","In addition and subsequent to the end of our fiscal year, we announced a $3 billion, two-year share buyback program that will more effectively leverage our strong balance sheet and return additional capital to shareholders. It is important to note that these accomplishments were achieved with minimal disruption from the U.S. Foods merger planning and litigation processes that continued throughout the entire fiscal year. And I'm extremely appreciative and proud of all of our associates who performed so well on multiple fronts.","Moving to our performance in the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by the following; we generated case growth of 3.6% in our Broadline business. Gross profit grew 3% in an environment with no food cost inflation and gross margin expanded by 35 basis points compared to prior-year. Expense management trends improved from earlier in the year, and our cost per case in our North American Broadline operations was essentially flat compared to the prior-year on a constant currency basis.","Key drivers of our improved operating performance for both the year and the fourth quarter were following: increasing acceleration of local case growth; effective implementation of our category management process; improved Sysco brand penetration, especially with locally managed customers; significant progress in developing and growing our offerings for the Hispanic customer segment; collaborative and mutually beneficial joint business planning processes with a small, but growing number of corporate-managed accounts.","One other meaningful factor that impacted our financial results was the degree of volatility and food cost inflation. We experienced nearly 5% food cost inflation during the first three quarters of 2015 and we managed it very well. However, food cost inflation in the fourth quarter was essentially flat, which unfavorably impacted sales and gross profit growth.","Early trends in fiscal 2016 are similar, and we expect this to be a modest sales and gross profit headwind over the next quarter or two. We are committed to mitigate as much of this pressure as possible through ongoing gross margin stabilization efforts and improved expense management.","Moving to market and economic trends, as I speak to you today, the data is mixed. Consumer confidence and the outlook of food service operators are at historically high levels, but have slipped somewhat in the summer months. Fuel prices at the pump remain at historically attractive levels, which should support higher consumer spending moving forward. Restaurant spend is up, but traffic is generally flat.","Overall, the market environment appears to be modestly improved from a year or two ago, but it is unclear what the go-forward trajectory for the industry growth is over the next several quarters. Whether the overall industry grows over the next few years at 1% real growth, consistent with the past few years or closer to the 2% in Technomic's recently released five-year forecast.","We at, Sysco, will continue to differentiate our products and service offerings in a manner that will allow us to both profitably grow our market share and provide an improved return on invested capital for our shareholders.","I will offer some additional color in our future opportunities after Chris shares his perspective on our financial results for the year and the fourth quarter.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by providing some highlights of our financial performance in 2015. Then, I'll discuss our results for the fourth quarter, and I'll close with some guidance for fiscal 2016 around a few metrics.","For the year, sales gross profits and adjusted operating expenses all grew about 5%. Sales and gross profits benefited from high food cost inflation in the first half of the year, but were constrained in the back half as that inflation moderated and eventually disappeared.","Expenses were growing too fast early in the year, but were being supported by high gross profit growth. Expense growth moderated in the back half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted EPS also grew by about 5% this year. One thing to note is that our diluted shares for the year increased 1.1%, because we did not repurchase shares while the merger was pending as we typically would have done. If we had held our diluted shares flat, it would have added approximately $0.02 to our adjusted EPS and 1% to our EPS growth rate.","We achieved several of our objectives during the year. We exceeded our final three-year target for annualized business transformation benefits. Our successful implementation of category management helped to enhance gross profits and mitigate gross margin pressure.","For the year, gross margin was flat compared to 2014, after declining in each of the last four fiscal years. We continued our prudent management of capital expenditures with net CapEx of $518 million falling well within our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. We recorded another year of significant growth in free cash flow on an adjusted basis, which grew to $1.3 billion, up 22% over the last year.","With regards to cost per case, we achieved our revised goal of limiting the increase to $0.05 to $0.10 for the full year. Actual cost per case increased $0.09 per case for the full-year on a constant currency basis and decreased $0.01 in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. It's important to note that our original objective, when we started the year, was to hold cost per case flat for the year. Because we didn't achieve our original goal, we also did not achieve our goal of growing operating expenses slower than gross profit for the year.","As the operating expenses were up 4.8% versus a gross profit increase of 4.5%. However, we were able to improve our cost per case performance in the second half of the year and achieved our goal in the fourth quarter, where operating expenses grew by 2.2% compared to gross profit growth of 3%.","Let's turn our attention now to our fourth quarter results. Year-over-year sales growth decelerated to 9% as food cost inflation declined significantly from 5.4% in the first half of the year and 3.7% in the third quarter to flat in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we saw relatively modest inflation in the meat, poultry and frozen categories; but produce, seafood and dairy were deflationary.","Changes in foreign exchange rates continue to have a much larger impact than usual in the fourth quarter. The strengthening dollar depressed our foreign sales as we converted them to U.S. dollars, and as a result decreased sales by 1.4%.","Acquisitions increased sales by 0.4% in the quarter. Broadline and SYGMA case volume grew 2.2% during the quarter including acquisitions and 1.9% excluding acquisitions. This result includes a decline in SYGMA's case volume as we work to optimize that business. Broadline case growth, which excludes SYGMA, was 3.6% reflecting our solid performance with both locally and corporate-managed accounts. We are especially encouraged that local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business has grown sequentially in each of the last five quarters.","Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $2.2 billion, a 3% increase, while gross margin increased 35 basis points to 17.9%. Our U.S. Broadline business was responsible for the majority of this increase, driven by a stronger relative mix of sales for our locally managed business, benefits from category management and a very effective national promotion for our Sysco-branded products.","Case growth for our corporate-managed customers remained strong, but competitive pricing in this segment pressured overall gross margin. Expenses for certain items in the fourth quarter totaled roughly $430 million, almost entirely related to the termination of the U.S. Foods merger. This included non-cash accruals for the two breakup fees paid to U.S. Foods and PFG totaling $313 million; $67 million in litigation fees and other integration planning expenses, interest on merger debt of $41 million, and then $11 million write-off on merger integration capital. This was capital we spent on projects that would only be useful if the merger was completed. The vast majority of the merger-related capital we spent will benefit the company as we move forward. We've included a table in our slide presentation to show the expense impact of these items. I will provide more details about the impact to our 2016 financials in a few minutes.","Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter increased $36 million or 2%, mainly driven by the impact of higher case volumes, which increased our payroll and more specifically incentive compensation accruals.","As I mentioned earlier, we made progress in reducing our cost per case during the quarter. Cost per case was down $0.01 on a constant currency basis and down $0.07 when we include the impact from foreign exchange translation.","Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $509 million, up 5.8% from the prior year. And adjusted operating margin was 4.1%, up 19 basis points from last year.","Turning to other income, there was an $18 million increase from last year, mainly driven by accounting for our JV transactions, where we consolidate 100% of the JV's results above the operating income line and then back out the non-controlling interest in other income\/expense.","Our tax rate for the quarter was negative, primarily driven by the merger termination fees. Adjusting for these fees and other certain items, our tax rate for the quarter would have been closer to 38%.","Adjusted net earnings for the quarter increased 5.7% to $309 million, and adjusted EPS increased 6.1% to $0.52.","Cash flow performance for the year was again very strong. Cash flow from operations increased $63 million to $1.6 billion, while free cash flow increased $42 million to $1 billion. Both operating and free cash flow reflect the negative impact of two items. First, the cash impact of certain items was $231 million in fiscal 2015, mainly due to merger-related expenses. Second, as we disclosed earlier this year, we made a $50 million pension contribution this year compared to none in the prior-year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contributions each year. After adjusting for these items, free cash flow was $280 million higher, or $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2015.","Capital expenditures for the year net of proceeds from asset sales increased $21 million to $518 million, well within our guidance and internal budgets. During the year we significantly increased our investment in business technology as we were planning for the merger integration. While the vast majority of these additional investments will benefit the company, even without the merger, we wrote off $11 million, as I mentioned previously.","We were pleased that our adjusted ROIC grew 70 basis points to 13.1% in fiscal 2015, reflecting the continued prudent and disciplined investments in our business and solid operating performance during the year.","Finally, a housekeeping item to point out in our segment reporting; we have reclassified our specialty meat company results out of the Broadline segment and into the Other segment, as these operations are no longer reporting to our Broadline leadership. We've provided a schedule in the earnings release this morning to show the quarterly and full-year impact of this reclassification to both fiscal 2014 and 2015.","Looking ahead, I'd like to provide guidance for a few metrics to set expectations for the coming year. First, fiscal year 2016 will be a 53-week fiscal year for us, with the extra week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. Second, as Bill mentioned, we are starting the year off with little to no food cost inflation, which will create a modest sales and gross profit headwind over the next quarter or two.","Third, we will recognize additional merger-related expenses totaling $95 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. These will include: $50 million related to the payment of the 1% call premium on the merger debt, which was redeemed in July; a $29 million write-off of professional fees related to the issuance of the merger debt; an $18 million write-off of the bond discounts on the merger debt; a $10 million gain on the termination of the interest rate swaps we put in place upon issuing the merger debt; and $8 million in interest expense incurred leading up to the July 14, 2015 redemption of the merger-related debt. These amounts will all be classified as certain items in the first quarter.","The negative cash impact of certain items during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 will total approximately $350 million, including: $313 million reflecting the payment of the break fees accrued this quarter; $500 million for the bond redemption premium; partially offset by approximately $15 million in proceeds related to the gain on the termination of our interest rate swaps.","Fourth, we expect to issue $2 billion in new debt around the end of the first quarter to fund both the accelerated share repurchases announced previously as well as term out a portion of our commercial paper facility. Adjusted interest expense for 2016 will be significantly higher because of this.","Additionally, prior to issuing our merger debt in October of 2014, we entered into swaps that locked in a portion of the interest rates. These swaps were settled in fiscal 2015, and we expect to amortize about $10 million of that interest expense in fiscal 2016.","The share repurchase program we announced will positively impact EPS in fiscal 2016. Because of the timing of the buyback implementation, we don't expect to realize a full year's benefit from the reduction of shares in fiscal 2016. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal 2016, driven by a 4% to 5% reduction in average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense on the new debt issuance. In fiscal 2017, we would expect to capture the full-year impact of this buyback on an annualized basis.","Fifth, with regards to taxes, a normalized tax rate for Sysco would typically be in the range of 36% to 37%. And lastly, our forecast for capital expenditures, net of proceeds, for asset sales is $550 million to $600 million for fiscal 2016.","Now, I'll turn it back to Bill for closing remarks.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Chris.","While pleased with our progress and accomplishments in fiscal 2015, we recognize that there's still much work to do, if we are to fully realize our vision for Sysco to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.","The good news is that we have a sound strategy that is predicated on profoundly enriching the experience of doing business with Sysco, enhancing productivity and innovation in all aspects of our business, attracting and developing the best people available and exploring opportunities for growth within and beyond our core business.","The better news is that we have begun to realize the benefits of several years of transformative change to our business through a portfolio of strategic business initiatives. And the exciting news is that we are now beginning to embed these initiatives in how we do business each and every day by putting the customer first and working cohesively as one Sysco.","Following the termination of the U.S. Foods merger agreement and utilizing the knowledge that we have acquired through our ongoing customer insights work, we have begun to update our three-year strategic business plan. Specifically, we see opportunities to further accelerate our case growth, especially with locally managed customers through more impactful product and service differentiation together with enhanced sales and technology capabilities.","We also believe that we can build upon our recent success in stabilizing gross margin through enhanced product innovation, growing our Sysco brand sales and improving our pricing analytics and support. In addition, we see significant potential to improve our productivity and reduce overhead costs throughout our supply chain organization and in the administrative areas of our business.","We will continue to invest in our business to fully realize these benefits and improve our return on invested capital over the next three years as well. We'll discuss these plans in more detail including financial impacts at our September 15, Investor Day.","Lastly, as most of you know, this is Chris' last conference call with us. I'd like to thank Chris for his numerous contributions to Sysco over the past six years, and all of us at Sysco would like to wish Chris and his family the very best as they move forward. We also look forward to welcoming Joel into his new role in working with him as our CFO.","And with that, operator, Chris and I will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to our first question to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning, guys.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Ed.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Could we start with the cost control side? Your operating expense growth is better this quarter than it's been in a while, actually and congratulations on your flat number per case. Can you provide a little bit more color here on, basically, I guess, what you're doing within the business? And then Bill, not maybe to steal too much thunder from the Analyst Day, but when you talk about significant potential to improve productivity and reduce costs, could you maybe give us a little bit more insight into what you mean there?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We won't steal too much thunder from Investor Day, so don't worry about that, Ed. I think on the cost side, the way I look at our numbers is, those of you who follow us know, I look at them in terms of what are the key things we look at here? Volume growth, in particular, relative to the market, and within that volume growth it's very important that we see good local case growth, and we've seen that here over the last several quarters. We need the contract business as well, but we need that local business to grow as well to drive profitability.","And then I look at operating income growth, operating income is always going to be not just mathematically, but just from a business perspective, it's going to be a by-product of the environment that we're in. And at times, sometimes the gross profit will grow faster and sometimes the expenses will grow a little bit slower.","And so, I think, any given quarter there's always things that move around that could impact the numbers. So, I think as you look at the year, I think I would say to you that basically what we said in the prepared comments, we're pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter on the expense side, in particular, in the supply chain side of the business and really the business itself in the field, where we had flat cost per piece.","Now for the year, we didn't. We were up almost a dime, and I would say to you we need to bring that number for the year back down into that flat \u2013 up a nickel zone. I'm not saying that we will or we won't, I'm just saying that that's kind of where the numbers ultimately need to get to, to drive the earnings growth.","So, our plan to go to your earnings, to your Investor Day, Ed, our plan is to become more consistent in terms of how we do that and to take the quarter we saw here in the field and to begin to put that up quarter-after-quarter.","Now with that said, I also said that we're going to continue to invest in the business here in terms of things that will drive some of the commercial initiatives that are really panning out for us now, both on the growth side as well as the merchandising side. So, it's always going to be a mix, I think, of timing of investment relative to what you think the value of it is.","And bottom line, I would say, there's some things in the fourth quarter, for example, bad debt. We had an exceptional year of bad debt this year, knock on wood, please. So, that benefited our fourth quarter numbers as well as the year to some extent. So, I would say that somewhere between that 2% growth and the 4.8% is where we need to get to.","And I would say to you in terms of Investor Day, I think what you're going to hear us say there Ed, is we're running a business here. It's very important that we accelerate our case growth. We see opportunities to do that, especially on the local side, that needs to turn into leveraging our operating income, which we did here in the fourth quarter, and we were up for the year.","So, I look at the fourth quarter as hopefully a proxy for what we can do next year. Quarters are going to have their own unique volatility, and I would think that you'll hear a message from us that says that we have opportunity on all sides including the cost side.","But, the big opportunity here is always going to be for a company with our capabilities, with our footprint, with our people and with our technology today to grow faster than the market and to do that profitably and to provide a good return on capital.","So certainly, opportunities for cost reduction, they are significant, it'll take some time for that to play out, and we will talk about that more in Investor Day. But I don't want to leave this question without emphasizing how important it is for us to grow the business as we did this quarter. I mean, this is a quality quarter for us both in terms of growth, leverage, and the mix of that growth. And I think that's really what you're going to hear at Investor Day. It takes all facets of our business to be in sync for us to go where we want to go.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you. And I'll let some other guys go on.","Operator","We'll go next to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan J. Gilligan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning. It's actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. How would you guys characterize the competitive environment now that the deal is behind us and inflation is moderating?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think the competitive environment has changed that much at all. I mean, there's still plenty of competitors out there of all types as we've talked about in great detail here over the last year or two. So, I would tell you, I think competition is very, very acute.","In the short-term, the way I would look at inflation, we have for years said and truly believe that the optimal range of inflation for our customers, and for us, is probably in the 2% to maybe 3% range. That's a level that typically our customers can pass on and do pass on, and generally that's a level that the consumer will accept. So, when we're in those levels we're able to have the best of both worlds, if you will, in terms of a little bit of a tailwind on inflation at the same time. It doesn't hurt demand to any large extent. We very seldom find ourselves in that zone, and right now, we find ourselves in a zone where there's little to no inflation. As we said, there's some modest inflation and some modest deflation in the categories.","So, I think the way I would look at that is, it's a little bit of a better environment right now in terms of our customer being able to manage their business, and when our costs aren't going up that much, obviously we don't have to raise our prices as much. So from that standpoint, it probably does help in terms of case growth, but in terms of the competitive environment, I don't really think it changes that at all.","Ryan J. Gilligan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe, could you just talk about your labor cost outlook and if you think maybe there'll be a battle for talent going forward as U.S. Foods rebuilds its sales force?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We'll talk more about labor cost, I think on Investor Day. But generally, we've got 50,000 people out there and they generally get raises every year. And our whole goal as I was speaking to in Ed's question is, the closer we can get to improving our productivity every year in sync with the labor increase, the better chance we have of keeping that cost per case in that zone that I discussed earlier.","I don't know that I would \u2013 look, good people are always in demand in this industry, and we have a lot of good ones. And so, our people are always going to have opportunities. I would tell you our retention has improved here in recent months as we've kind of matured in a lot of our transformation work, and I don't expect that to be a big issue for us in terms of retention. But, we work hard every day to provide our people with good careers, and we work hard every day to make sure that we're retaining our best people.","Operator","We'll go now to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. Mr. Wolf, your line is open. Please check your mute function.","Hearing no response, we'll go to our next caller, Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question, and Chris, best of luck to you.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Wanted to ask, you mentioned about some of the technology investments that were made in preparing for when the merger was a possibility. Can you just give a little bit more color in terms of how that does play in with some of your former initiatives that you've been continuing to execute on and kind of what we can expect going forward?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, Vinny, the biggest that you can expect, and we will talk more about this at Investor Day as well, is while there's been tremendous emphasis, and appropriately so, on implementing SAP and where we are in that, we've kind of turned the corner there. So, on the one hand we've stabilized that system. We've improved the processes and we're moving more toward a modular rollout approach as opposed to an OpCo multi-modular rollout.","And we're starting to see some good success there. And the most recent example would be in our inventory replenishment system, which internally we refer to as DPR. So, in terms of the base core business, I think we're in a more steady state and mature place there. We're running the business. We're running it well. We'll continue to improve that.","But I think where you're going to see us go \u2013 and this is not so much a learning, but just a point of emphasis that came out from a lot of the planning work, is that we need to accelerate some of our work on the online mobile platform area. And we've got some things going on there that are very encouraging, and we will talk more about that. So anything we can do here to make it easier for our customers to order and order when they want to order and for our MAs to facilitate those orders would be a very high priority.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Bill, and just one other quick follow-up, if I may. In the prepared comments, you had mentioned about working specifically on the corporate managed front. Anything just to call out there?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think the one thing I did call out is this joint business planning approach that we've taken, and it really requires a different approach to doing business because it does require more transparency. It requires a commitment that needs to be a win-win for both organizations and we're at that point. Over the last several years, we've worked very hard with all of our customers. But on the contract side, the large contract side, we're certainly trying to utilize our supply chain network and our footprint to optimize getting product to their facilities and to their restaurants in the most cost-efficient way possible. But there are some limitations to that until you really sit down and open it up a little bit more in terms of what each organization is willing to do.","So what I'm getting at there is where it makes sense, and it's not always going to make sense. It depends on the nature of the relationship and the strategies of the respective companies. But we are starting to see some really nice progress with a couple key customers in particular, where by working together, we're able to reduce their costs and also reduce our costs at the same time, and \u2013 this is really the most important part \u2013 find ways to grow the business together. So more to come, but that is something that we've been working on quite a bit the last year or two years.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies.","Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask about the SYGMA decline in the quarter. It was down 8% on sales. If you could, maybe talk about how that impacted the gross margins because the mix there has changed and obviously SYGMA is one of your lower margin businesses. How much did it help the gross margin?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","How much did SYGMA help the gross margin?","Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","No, the fact that that's down, so the mix is lower there for SYGMA.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, I'd say for the quarter a very, very modest impact, but probably some. I think to your broader question, SYGMA is in somewhat of a turnaround situation right now. We've got new leadership there at the top, Greg Keller, who knows that business very, very well. And this is a year where we went through some changes with customers. There was some business that we lost that we didn't want to lose. There was some business that we transitioned because it was the right thing for us and the customer. And then there was some business where we had to adjust our pricing, which hurt our margins somewhat. So there's a little bit of everything going on there. We also had some expense challenges there that we're working through.","So this was not a great year for SYGMA, and I expect it to improve here as we go forward in the new year and in the following years. I would say overall, we're trying to optimize that customer base in a way that obviously needs to work for the customer as well as us. And I think you'll see some more of that next year, but I also think you'll start to see improvement next year \u2013 excuse me, in the current year.","Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Were there notable losses that we need to carry forward as we model out Sysco in future quarters?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not getting into specifics, but I would look more at the fourth quarter than the first three quarters probably.","Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for taking my question. Can you hear me?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","A quick question just first. You used to talk about street business, and now you're talking about locally managed. Do you think you could just tell us what the definition is? Is locally managed the same as street business?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Meredith, that's a great question. It's one of those questions we get from time to time. So no, it's not the same, but it's very close. What we did \u2013 this is about three years ago, Meredith. We changed our terminology internally to, frankly, bring a little bit more clarity and accountability to the ultimate responsibility for these customers.","So locally managed business is business where the customer generally \u2013 and there are exceptions to every rule in Sysco \u2013 but generally the customer, the decision-maker of that customer is proximate; i.e., within the selling radius of that local operating company. So there's a high percentage of street business, but there's also a fair amount of what we call local contract business. And these would be chains. And they could be of different sizes. They could be local chains. They could be somewhat regional. They could even be across regions, and that's why I say there are exceptions.","But, in our world, it's street business plus what we call local contract. And then corporate-managed business is your very large regional chains and your national and international customers, for that matter, where the relationships are largely managed from corporate here and generally with the customer. And then obviously, our operating companies are responsible for handling those relationships locally with the units and servicing those accounts. So that's as clear as I can make it, and there is some fuzziness there in the local contract. But the key is really how we look at the business and it's how we sign primary accountability for these customer relationships.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That makes sense. I just wonder when you talk about growth in the locally managed business, you could be talking about either small chains or business where it's contracted or business when you actually call on the customer. So the growth you talked about, is that coming from both kinds of locally managed business, or is there more growth in the independents?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd say it's coming from both kinds. This happened to be a year where we actually lost a couple of very large local contract customers that were spread across multiple OpCos, so that's in that fuzzy category, which we call them local contract because the history of those relationships is local, but they cross over multiple OpCos. But I would say generally and even currently that growth is coming from both.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, and then I just had one other quick question. I did notice that D&A was much lower this quarter than the recent run rate or lower than last year. Obviously, fourth quarter is a true-up period. Is there anything to comment on? And when you talk about cost per case, do you include D&A in cost per case, or is that just simply a corporate item?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","D&A, are you saying depreciation and amortization, Meredith?","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Go ahead, Chris.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So depreciation and amortization to the extent that it applies to business technology, we would capture that at the corporate level. To the extent it applies to something that's at the local level, it's captured within cost per case because it's applied at the local level.","Generally, I don't think there's anything especially to call out this quarter about the change in that number. As you pointed out, there are some true-ups that occur at the end of every year. We've had probably more than last year than we had this year, so that's going to help your growth rate a little bit. But in general operating costs were much better managed this fourth quarter than last fourth quarter. The number we cited up $36 million happens to be the amount of the increase and incentives for the quarter as well. So, to the extent it went up, it went up for the right reasons. We were selling a lot more cases and rewarding people accordingly.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And so the lower growth in case cost in this quarter wasn't particularly due to D&A?","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It was a part of that mix, but there was no significant amount attributable to that, no.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","To Chris's point, there wouldn't be a lot of amortization in that cost, but there's certainly a lot of depreciation in that number.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There is, to the extent that at the field level, that's exactly right.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, good morning. Thanks for answering my question. Just wanted to talk a little bit more about gross margin. You called out some of your initiatives, a little better growth with some of the local accounts. But, if you just step back, how helpful was the flat food cost inflation, and where do you think gross margin has really stabilized at?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not sure I can answer the second one, but let me start with the first one, Kelly. So, look, I think it depends on whether you're talking about gross profit or gross margin. I don't want to be too anal on this thing, but that's the reality of it. We pay our bills with dollars, so gross profit dollar growth is very important here, and we had 3% gross profit dollar growth, which was less than what you saw earlier in the year, but at a time when there's no inflation, that was pretty good and we were able to manage our expenses pretty well. That's why I was saying earlier, those numbers are going to move around from time to time. Obviously, what we need to get back to more consistently is where that gross profit is growing faster than the expenses.","I think on gross margin, when you're in an environment where your costs are not going up, there's not as much pressure to obviously raise your prices. And that allows you to manage your margin percent a little bit better. So, there's no doubt that that helped on the percentage part of it; but, again, we need to manage both. And after three years of talking about how important gross profit dollar growth is, I'm not going to sit here today and take a victory lap on gross margin. I think it's good that it went up, but I think it's more impressive that we were able to grow the gross profit at 3% with very little if any inflation and keep our expenses below that. That will be somewhat challenging here, as we said, in the first couple quarters, but we'll continue to work at that. And we'd like to get the gross profit growth back up in that four to five zone over time like we saw, but that will be somewhat driven by inflation.","I think the corollary here, Kelly, is, when we have inflation, let's say higher than normal inflation like we saw, particularly in the first half of the year, that's where it's very difficult to \u2013 and at times not even appropriate \u2013 to raise your prices as fast as your costs are going up. And so, when you have an inflation environment of 5% or 6%, it's highly unlikely that your gross margin is going to keep pace on a year-over-year basis there. So, it's math, but it's more than math. It's the environment that our sales people work in, and it's basically what's the right way to treat the customer.","So, bottom line, I think it helped on the margin, but it hurt on the gross profit this quarter. As far as stabilizing, let's take it a year at a time, okay? So, we have a year here where we had essentially flat margins.","And I think what I should say or reiterate here, because we've talked about that inflation or lack thereof, I mean we did a lot of good things this quarter and this year. So, category management really matured this year and helped improve our margins. We'll see some more benefit there in the new year. Not as much, but a trajectory the slope will flatten out a little bit.","Growing local cases is very, very important in this business. I don't think I can say that enough. So, what we said here is, we now had several quarters in a row where we grew our local business. That's where we provide the most value, that's where we make the most money. And we don't have to grow them at the same rate as the corporate-managed necessarily, but we do need to grow them. And I think that contributed significantly to the margin as well as the gross profit growth.","And then this quarter and really the year to some extent, we saw the brand rebound a little bit, and some of that was through some promotion work. Some of it's just the natural by-product of connecting it with our category management work. And anytime we can utilize our private brand to create value, that's also positive.","So, I think there's a lot of things that led to it, there's a lot of things we need to keep doing well and we have some good things going. But, look, it is competitive out there, and I think if we can stabilize margins at this level we'll be very happy with that.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John E. Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Bill, one of the things we've heard is that post the U.S. Foods thing not happening, the promotional environment's got a little bit more intense. Is that fair? Is that what you're seeing? And then how might that tie-in with this disinflation? And does this \u2013 so, we've gone from plus four to zero in a very quick period of time. Does that breed more aggressive competition, right? Because everybody's COGS is going down and they can be aggressive without giving up a lot of margin?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, it's been a long time since I practiced accounting. I'm not sure that COGS are going down in the promotion. I think their sales are going down and maybe their marketing expenses are going up depending on how they account for it. So, I don't think that's a COGS issue. Obviously, cat management helped us there.","As far as the question on promotion, I see there's been some chatter out there. Yeah, I mean, look, you've got a transition that's going on here. I think in certain markets we are seeing some of that type of activity. I've even read pieces where people are saying that we've stepped up our activity.","And the reality is we haven't. I think we're always out there selectively doing what we need to do to retain good quality customers and business and selectively going after potential new business. So, it's not that we don't promote; but I would tell you, I don't think our promotion activities picked up in any meaningful way from a year or two ago. So, it's out there, I think we're going through this transition period, so it may be somewhat accelerated, but I think that's a little overblown right now.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then, if you look at case progression, so take Broadline, up 3.6% this quarter, what had it been running? Is that an improvement? And then if you look at locally managed on top of that and you said that has improved, so where has that improved from? Where was it a couple of quarters ago? Where is it today?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't know that we give \u2013 I'm not going to let you do the work on some of that, John. I don't know that we give guidance at that level. But I can directionally tell you it has improved, okay? So, that 3.6%, that's total Broadline, it's got about a half a point of acquisition and everything. So, you're looking at 3% organic growth, and I would tell you that that's \u2013 there's a little bit more there on the corporate side than the local, but the local has moved up nicely over the last, I think it's five quarters to six quarters, and it's continuing to grow. So, I think the important part there is that piece of it is growing and continuing to grow.","John E. Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Thanks. Can you hear me this time?","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We can.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We can.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","All right. I don't know what happened there. In the interim, most of my questions were asked, but maybe I could tie it together. I thought the gross profit growth with this inflation was pretty good. So, and you're saying even from U.S. Foods you haven't seen an uptick, if I can be so impolite, your old dance partner there. Have you seen an uptick from them specifically? Or I guess maybe you're saying if so, it's not enough to really change the nature of the market.","So, when you sound a little cautious on the first half of the fiscal year, is it more on the expense side? Because if the market environment's not changing, you have some internal initiatives to get the gross profit dollars at least going above sales, is it more of an expense issue? It's just you can't \u2013 it's just hard to keep the expenses flattish or to get the leverage that you got this quarter?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If I came across as cautious, I guess it's just my nature, Andy. But I'm trying to be balanced here and...","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Yeah. No, I appreciate just being straight, so I'm just talking to you.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But I think this is an important exchange here right now. So, I think, I'm really pleased with this quarter. I mean, the quality of this quarter was very good. And we've got some good things going on here on the local case growth side, so we need to sustain that.","And I think we still can grow some of the other cases as well. So, I think that's a positive I feel good about that. There's not much we can do about whether there's going to be any inflation or if there's going to be a little deflation, so that's where I'm a little cautious. That does impact our top line and our gross profit dollar line.","And then on the expense side, I would say encouraged by the fourth quarter, and I just would look for gradual improvement there. I don't think we can sustain 2% expense growth with 3% case growth. Okay, I don't think that's a sustainable ratio.","With that said, I expect our expense growth to \u2013 on a relative basis to be better next year than what we saw this year relative to case growth, relative to sales and GP growth. So, I actually feel pretty good about the part that we're managing right now, and then my caution is that if you look at the quarter, I see that as something.","We had three good quarters this year. We need to have four next year, and they need to look somewhere around what we saw here in the fourth quarter. But, the lines are going to move around depending what's going on in the marketplace. But, overall, I feel good, but yeah, I'm a little cautious on that top line and GP line for the first quarter, too. Chris.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Hey, Andy, I'm just going to tie it back to some stuff we talked to earlier in the year. We continue to say we'd like to see gross profit dollar growth of 4% or better. That sets us up very, very well. Because of the level of food cost inflation, it's difficult right now. All Bill was really saying is, we're going to have some headwinds on the sales line. We're going to have some headwinds on the gross profit dollar line. Obtaining that 4% is going to be difficult without some sort of reinflation in food cost. The reason the 4% is 4% is because we acknowledge that we're going to drive cases, and that's going to drive costs.","So as Bill just said I think very, very well, if we're going to have headwinds on the top line numbers, it means we have to control the cost even more at a time when frankly we're driving cases. So that makes the math a little bit tough. So I'm with Bill. I'm very pleased with the quarter. Neither of us are pessimistic about next year or even the first half of next year. We're just, as Bill said, trying to be able to balance with the current inflationary environment and how hard that's going to be to drive our equation.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Good. No, no, I saw the quarter that way too. And just lastly, back to U.S. Foods, they are the number two player, potentially at least in some markets if they were to really get aggressive, could squeeze some margins. Are you seeing them being pretty normal, or are you seeing them ramp it up quite a lot?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Again, Andy, I think in certain markets our people are seeing some of that. They've got new CEO there now who we know and respect a great deal. I think they've got a lot to get through here in the next couple, three months. I expect that they'll do it and do it well, and I expect them to be a rational competitor. But in any given market, any of us could at times be a little bit viewed as being overly aggressive or whatever. So I'm sure there's some of that going out. I'm not that close to it. But if it was overly significant, I think I would know about it. And I don't have a sense that that's a big thing right now.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, thank you. Congratulations on the quarter, I thought it was pretty good.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Andy.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","We'll go next to Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Bill, in your prepared comments, I think you cited improved expense management and also higher payroll costs, higher incentive compensation. And so with respect to your expense outlook for this year, overall would you say comparisons are starting to ease? And then can you give any additional breakdown on where you're expecting comparisons to improve and where you see continued pressure on earnings? Excluding the merger expenses and interest expense, I'm just still trying or struggling to get a big picture perspective on whether comparisons should improve this year or at least be a little bit more normalized in fiscal 2016.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ajay, look, our plan is to grow our gross profit faster than our expenses. And as I said a couple times now, that may look differently in some quarters than others and there will be a little more pressure in the first quarter or two.","Our expenses this year were high, as Chris took you through, were higher than we planned. And we can't have 8%, 9%, 10% case growth on a currency-adjusted basis. So we had a good number here in the fourth quarter. I expect this to continue to improve on the expense side in the field. There are going to be some ups and downs there, but I'm confident that we're on the right track there. So I don't know that you can sustain flat every quarter, but certainly low single-digit case increases \u2013 cost case increases would be what we're shooting for here.","On the corporate side, it depends on the quarter. We talked about some true-ups. I mentioned bad debt. So in any given quarter, there could be some things on the corporate side. I would just say to you that as we continue, we have stood up a lot of capabilities here, from cap-man to a lot of things on sales capabilities. There's more to do there, and so we'll continue to invest in our people and our technology to position this company to grow its business and grow it profitably and compete very well and do great things for our customers.","So long story short, we'll talk more about this in Investor Day. But as I said, we expect to grow the cases. I don't think 2% is sustainable with 3% case growth if we're able to continue to do that. At the same time, 4.8% is too high. So I think you can assume from that that somewhere in the middle is what we're shooting for.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ajay, this is Chris. Remember back early in the year when we were reporting very high gross profit dollar growth numbers, we were calling out the fact that we were not pleased with our expense performance even back then. It was being supported by the gross profit, but we weren't happy with our expense management.","Since that time, we've actually done better in the fourth quarter. It's certainly the best quarter we had during the year, so I'm going to be repetitive here with Bill that we were not at all pleased with the overall year performance, but we were much more pleased with Q4; again, calling out the fact that it might be a little bit swung to the other side of being hard to repeat.","So overall cost per case was higher than it should have been, higher than we wanted it to be. We got it back under control in Q4. And certainly that's the goal as we look into next year, but it's something we have to continue to focus on. But again, we saw real improvement in Q4. We just have to continue to maintain that and make sure that we don't allow the increases that got ahead of us in the first part of this year.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think if I could maybe just add one other thing to put this in context. I've talked about quarters move around. Years move around. And I think if you look at our cost and our expense management over the last two years, a lot of our initiatives matured last year, and we actually saw a reduction in cost per case last year. And I think it was a low single-digit reduction, but it was up in the fourth quarter I believe last year. So we've cycled some of that now. And I think if you look at the two years together, that's a pretty good proxy of what we're able to do, and we're working really hard and I expect us to improve from this year.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's actually a good point, Bill. We were down $0.06 per case last year on a reported basis, and I think we're up $0.04 a case this year on a reported basis. So you look at the two years together, and we're almost back to breakeven. And it's not a bad story, but frankly we were expecting better out of ourselves. So, that's where we have to continue to work.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, great. Thank you. First just a housekeeping question. The Analyst Day is going to be on September 15, I had something else written down, so I just want to make sure I have that right.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We changed it to, I think the original day was September 24. We changed it to September 15, that's correct, in the afternoon.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you. And then secondly, the comments in the press release, we will also continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure. That's obviously a very interesting comment, and one's imagination can run wild just seeing a sentence like that, within a press release especially. So as you've talked and had more time to think about this with the board and perhaps even solicited investor feedback, what do you think that optimal capital structure is in terms of rating? And whatever that is, I guess at this point, what are you waiting for to implement that optimized capital structure?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually, John, that's pretty much the same thing we said when we announced the share repurchase. So our view on that is pretty straightforward I think at this point. We kept our powder dry here for quite some time because we've been looking at a lot of different opportunities on the acquisition front, some larger than others, and we ended up pulling the trigger on the U.S. Foods deal, and that required a lot of capital, and as we all know, that ultimately didn't play out.","So where we're at today is we just felt it was appropriate to return some capital in the form of share repurchase back to our shareholders here over the next year or two. But we still think we need to keep some powder dry here. We continue to look for acquisitions, as I said in my comments, both within the core and potentially beyond the core, whether it be adjacency or continue to build our international platform here.","So I would just say to you, we're going to do what we're saying here, which is from time to time we'll continue to look at our capital structure relative to what our other options are. And for the most part, it starts with investing in the business. I think we've got a pretty good cadence there. We've got pretty good \u2013 Chris has done a nice job coming in here and helping us get a little more structure and discipline around our CapEx spending. We've improved modestly, but we've begun to improve in our working capital management, so there are some good things going on there. But I would always like to have the opportunity to do some strategic acquisitions if and when they present themselves. It's just at this point we don't need to keep quite as much capital available to do that.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood, thank you.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session and also brings us to the end of today's conference.

We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions.","I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.","Neil A. Russell - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Lindsey. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. Joining me in Houston today are Bill DeLaney, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Ben\u00e9, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that states the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations, or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner.

As such, we will reference throughout our presentation today Sysco's financial results both including and excluding this acquisition.","To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our start in fiscal 2017 and this morning we reported strong first quarter financial results. These results reflect our relentless focus on improving our customers' experience with Sysco that benefits a several key business initiatives that we've implemented over the past few years and the contributions from our new colleagues at Brakes who joined Sysco in early July.","For the quarter, and excluding the impact of Brakes, sales grew 1%, gross profit grew 5%, while operating expense grew less than 2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 15%. After reflecting the business results of Brakes, adjusted operating income grew 24% to $627 million and adjusted earnings per share grew to $0.67.","While we benefited from some favorable year-over-year expense comparisons, which Joel will touch on in a few minutes, these results were achieved in an uneven economic environment that is impacting our customers' business. Some metrics reflect positive implications for longer term consumer demand such as steadying unemployment levels, modest GDP growth, increased consumer confidence, and healthy momentum in the housing market.","However, the restaurant industry, which represents approximately 60% of the foodservice market, is not currently experiencing the level of growth we've seen in recent quarters. Restaurant traffic continues to show year-over-year declines and restaurant spend has decelerated as well.","More specifically, recent data from both NPD and NavTrak show weakening overall sales trends. That said, we continue to execute our business plan and key initiatives very well. I'm pleased with our progress to date toward the achievement of our three-year financial goals, and I remain confident in our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives over the long-term.","Our improved and increasingly consistent performance for the past two years is attributed to multi-year foundational work we have carried out in customer insights, category management, revenue management, supply chain efficiencies and administrative expense management. The benefits of these work streams have positioned us to continue to effectively support the needs of our customers and profitably leverage our volume growth.","Moving forward, we will build on this momentum by maintaining our customer-centric approach while focusing on targeted, disciplined and profitable growth. Both Tom and Joel will provide more detail about the specific initiatives we are currently implementing and their related benefits.","Turning to the Brakes transaction, we continue to work closely with our experienced and talented leadership team to support their growth, drive out there transformative initiatives and identify additional acquisition opportunities. I'm very excited about the long-term benefits that this business will provide Sysco.","In summary, we are off to a good start to fiscal 2017, and I am encouraged with the progress we are making as we approach the midpoint of our three-year plan. I'm especially appreciative of the efforts and contributions from all 65,000 of our associates, as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco, to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom Ben\u00e9, Sysco's President and Chief Operating Officer.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflects solid operating performance and continued progress against several of our key multi-year initiatives. Our favorable operating performance continues to be driven by our ongoing focus on the key levers of our three-year plan, including delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses both in our supply chain and administrative functions.","This morning I'll be providing an update on our business results based on our new segment reporting structure which highlights U.S. Foodservice Operations, International Foodservice Operations, SYGMA and all other.","During the quarter, U.S. Foodservice Operations, which is primarily comprised of U.S. Broadline, specialty meat, FreshPoint and our European imports business grew sales 0.8% driven by overall case growth in the U.S. Broadline of 1.8% with local cases driving our growth at 1.9%.","Gross profit in U.S. Foodservice Operations grew 4.3% for the quarter and gross margin increased 68 basis points driven by a combination of factors including our ongoing category management efforts which is how we now go to market with an improved product assortment and centralized approach for majority of our product procurement, which in turn helps us drive out cost for ourselves and our suppliers.","Second, improved Sysco brand performance with our local customers, the deployment of a suite of revenue management tools and processes that bring more discipline to our sales and merchandising teams, and ultimately more consistent pricing to our customers and the impact of deflation.","During the quarter, we continue to focus our sales teams on initiatives and activities that will help our customers succeed and grow their business. We have been implementing a variety of sales training and support tools that build overall capability within our selling organization and we have restructured some of the work within that organization to both free up our marketing associates' time and provide access to more targeted resources to better support our customers.","These efforts in conjunction with ongoing enhancements to our e-commerce tools, which allow our customers to choose how they place the orders with Sysco are enabling us to better leverage our marketing associates to spend more time supporting our customers with unique programs, innovative products and other business building solutions.","From a cost perspective, our expense management for the quarter was solid and remains a key area of focus for us moving forward. For U.S. Foodservice Operations, during the first quarter, we limited total adjusted operating expense growth to 1.8%. Our supply chain performance is progressing well, and we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and continuing process improvements that are driving efficiencies.","For U.S. Broadline, cost per case improved by $0.04 for the quarter, and on a fuel price-neutral basis, cost per case was flat. The continuous improvement efforts in our facilities and a continued investment in training for our warehouse associates and drivers has allowed us to build further capability throughout our supply chain.","One such example is the implementation of a labor forecasting tool that enables us to proactively manage hours at our facilities based on the anticipated workload for each shift. We also remain on track to deliver our previously-communicated administrative cost reductions both in corporate and within the operations.","Moving to International Foodservice Operations, which is made up of Canada, Europe, Bahamas, International Food Group and our joint ventures in Mexico and Costa Rica, sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased $50 million, both driven by our recent acquisition on the Brakes Group. We appreciate the Brakes Group early performance and continue to look forward to working with the management team on achieving our collective plans in the future.","During the quarter, Brakes performed reasonably well in the UK amidst the challenging environment, and performance in both France and Sweden was relatively strong. Our business in Canada is off to a good start for the fiscal year as we are effectively managing costs within a deflationary and somewhat soft market environment. And lastly, our joint ventures in both Costa Rica and Mexico had solid performance in the first quarter fiscal year of 2017.","SYGMA continues to make progress against their key business initiatives and had 4% sales growth for the first quarter. We continue to feel confident in their ability to deliver their full-year growth goals and objectives.","In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as part of our three-year plan. We have continued to make significant progress in all areas for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and I remain optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success.","Now I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business including solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management, as well as a solid contribution from Brakes. The results that I'll cover for you this morning include Brakes, which significantly impacted our results.","In summary, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, sales grew 11.2%, gross profit dollars grew 20.3%, operating expense growth was 19.2%, all of which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 23.8% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 28.8%.","Sales during the quarter were positively impacted by the inclusion of Brakes in our results, though partially offset by deflation of 2.2% in our legacy Sysco business. Continuing with gross profit and gross margins beyond the addition of Brakes, the key drivers of improvement included category management, revenue management, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business and deflation. Categories impacted most by deflation continue to be the center-of-the-plate protein and dairy. We expect the trend to continue into calendar 2017. That said, we continue to manage this environment effectively as evidenced by our strong gross profit dollar growth.","The increase in expenses during the quarter beyond the addition of Brakes were mainly driven by the previously-mentioned higher case volumes and a timing shift of expenses related to our option grants from the second quarter into the first and was partially offset by various decreases in indirect spend, fuel costs, favorable comparisons to the prior year, which included planned investments in technology spend related to our three-year plan, and foreign exchange translation.","As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 32.9% compared to 36.3% in the prior-year period. The decrease in tax rate is driven by tax credits, lower tax rates in the UK due to new tax laws that were recently passed, and the mix of business as we grow in the lower-rate jurisdictions. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 20.7%.","Cash flow from operations was $249 million, which was $510 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $111 million, which was $492 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvements in both are due mainly to improved working capital performance and payments made in the prior year related to the proposed merger with US Foods.","Net CapEx for the quarter was $138 million. I am pleased with our net working capital performance for the quarter. We had a net two-day improvement versus the prior year and a 2.8-day improvement versus fiscal 2015 and are making good progress towards our three-year goal of a 4-day improvement. These improvements are driven primarily by improvements in all three phases of working capital; payables, receivables, and inventory.","Our first quarter results included some certain items that were mostly related to the Brakes acquisition including amortization associated with the transaction. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had significant amount of certain items primarily related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods.","Now, I'd like to transition to three business updates. First, regarding Brakes, as a reminder, we initially guided that the acquisition would be modestly accretive to fiscal 2017 earnings per share by low-to-mid single digits. We are now updating that guidance due to finalizing the treatment of amortization as a certain item and believe this acquisition will be accretive to adjusted earnings per share by high-single-digits in fiscal 2017 with acceleration in subsequent years assuming constant currency. For the first quarter, Brakes was approximately $0.04 accretive to our business on an adjusted basis. It is important to note that Brakes business does have some seasonality as the performance is more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. Accordingly, we do not expect the same accretion each quarter and, in particular, in quarter number three.","Second is regarding fuel expense, we expect the favorability we've had over the past two quarters to begin to lap in November. Separately, we are enhancing our fuel strategy. In the past, we used a third-party to forward-buy fixed price contracts approximately 12 months out. Going forward, we are transitioning the management of our fuel expense by using derivatives to hedge our exposure. By separating the management of our fuel purchases from our risk management, we will allow for more effective management of the risk. We'll continue to cover approximately two-thirds of our needs with hedges in place to minimize volatility in price.","Finally, we are announcing today the upsizing of our credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion and we'll upsize our commercial paper lines accordingly to provide greater liquidity to support our growing business.","In summary, we had a quality quarter reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business including solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our three-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution on all areas of our business that improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I am confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan.","Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up to allow other participants time for questions. Your first question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. It's actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. Thanks for taking the question, and thanks for all the additional disclosure. It's really helpful. I guess first off, can you just give us the bridge in the year-over-year change in gross margins in the International segment? It seems like Brakes is driving a lot of that improvement, and we're just wondering if this is a new level of gross margin that we should expect or if there's any one-time impact from there?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Hey, Ryan. I'm going to start here. I think, look, we have given you a lot of information, and the Q will be issued this week. There will be a little more detail in there, but we're not going to get into bridging individual entities within those segments. But obviously, Brakes did contribute a significant amount. And generally, I would tell you that in Europe, gross margins are higher and expenses are higher.","Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And is there an opportunity to lower your expense \u2013 or lower the expense margin to one that's closer to the U.S. over time?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Well, they have a lot of good work going on over there in their own transformation, as we've spoken to a little bit before. So there is opportunity on the supply chain. They're doing some things with their warehouses where they're moving from multiple warehouses to service a market to one, which is more similar to what we see, and there's always opportunities on the administrative side of the business. So I think there will be opportunities. That's a big part of their plan. And I don't know that they'll get to our number necessarily because it is a different market, but there's certainly upside there.","Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And I guess just last question, can you comment on how cases trended throughout the quarter and the outlook for them going forward, I guess, just given the comparisons start to get tougher the next two quarters?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","So this is Tom. So as I said, the local cases were up 1.9% in U.S. Broadline, and yes, that's been a little bit of a fall off from what we'd experienced in the last couple quarters of fiscal year 2016. I think based on what we're seeing in the restaurant segment, I think we believe it will be continued to be a slight decline from what it's been at the end of last year, but we still feel fairly confident that we'll see continued case growth in the local segment of our business. We're very focused on, as Bill said in his comments, profitable growth, and we want to make sure that we're focused on those right customer segments, but we still believe we can grow our local cases.","Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Hey Ed.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Can I just start with a follow-up to that last question? Could you just help us understand what you're seeing from an organic case growth standpoint? I don't know how it'd be if you could sort of frame that for us at all relative to the 1.8% and the 1.9%? I'm just curious as to the role that acquisitions are playing into this.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Well, let me start, Ed. I'm going to let Joel and Tom maybe add some color here, but I would say that is largely the organic growth that we're experiencing. What Tom said was if you go back a year, I think we're in the mid-2%s to high-2%s in different quarters, not every quarter was the same.","So if you go back to my comments, I mean basically we're seeing some slowness out there \u2013 softening, I guess, is a better word \u2013 in terms of overall growth in the restaurant segment, and ours is off a little bit as well. So it just reinforces the importance of solidifying those customer relationships and getting penetration where there is that opportunity where customers are growing as well as continuing to stay really locked in on retaining our customers and identifying new opportunities as we go along, but I mean the 1.8% to 1.9% is largely the organic growth.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And just one second question here that I wanted to ask you about and I kind of asked about it last quarter too, but you maintain your three-year target. Your results so far had been really impressive. I mean this is a great quarter. Can you just talk to us about how you're thinking about that goal at this point, whether you think we'll get an update at some point relatively soon? And as we just sort of sit back and try to consider how things play out from here, Bill, what are the moving parts that we should really be thinking about from here sort of like good or bad going forward?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Well, I think the moving parts, we've touched on here just now. I think we're seeing some softness out there. I think other people are seeing the same thing on a relative basis, and so we're very focused on trying to get our case growth back up over 2%. I think that's very important.","We're real pleased with how we're managing the margins and still growing the business and taking care of our customers in the right way, and a lot of the steps we took back in the spring to initiate deeper expense reductions are benefiting us right now. So I think the things that we can influence and control we're doing a really good job with. We're probably a little cautious in terms of the overall macro out there for our customers. We still got two points of deflation out there, largely driven by those center-of-the-plate categories, so those will be two areas where we're probably a little bit cautious.","Obviously, we're in our third year now of earnings growth and I think this is the fourth quarter of double-digit earnings growth on an adjusted basis. So obviously, the bar gets higher and we're ready for that. So we feel very good overall about what we're doing, a little cautious on the environment. I think to your first question, the way I'm looking at that, Ed, is we're one quarter into this year and we're just not quite to the halfway point of the three-year plan. So I want to get a little further into this year and get halfway through the three-year plan, and then I think we'll be able to reassess where we are on the goals.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. So on the M&A impact in the quarter, first of all, was there any M&A impact to U.S. Broadlines beyond Brakes? And then secondly for Brakes, total sales came in a bit higher than I thought. Maybe you could talk about just volume trends there and what the impact of the FX was. And just with the high-single-digit accretion for the year, what are you anticipating for total sales growth for the year for Brakes?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Again, we're not going to get into bridges or trends on individual businesses within segments, but I think as Tom pointed out, I'm going to let Tom speak to this, obviously there're some challenges in the UK right now. We thought the Brakes Group performed well given the environment and very nicely in France and Sweden. I think that's as much as I probably can add right now. Tom, you got anything?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, well, maybe the answer to your first question too, Zach, the very little impact on the U.S. cases from the acquisitions as we mentioned a minute ago. So those numbers were basically kind of organic growth numbers. And the only thing I'd add on Brakes is that we think the team's off to a really good start. Bill mentioned the transformational initiatives they've been operating against are all moving along nicely, and I think we feel very comfortable with overall how that business is performing. And the UK certainly has got some bumpiness in their economy driven by a lot of things going on over there right now. I think we feel very comfortable with where they're at and how they're performing (26:09).","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. And I would just add, I mean you asked about the FX part of that. I mean, obviously, the weakening sterling certainly plays into this, so there is some FX impact on an aggregate basis for the organization. We had fairly minor impact from FX for this quarter.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just, I guess, let's all take it on a high level here on the operating environment. Could you comment on the \u2013 just a little bit about underlying restaurant trends with them being a little choppy, are you seeing any change to the competitive environment here particularly with the impact of deflation versus food away from home \u2013 or food at home widening a little bit? Are you seeing anything as far as just continued challenges for your customers and then competition from your peers?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Well, I think the challenges are what I'd referenced. You've got several quarters in a row now where traffic is actually down, and while the spend is up, it's not rising at the same rate it was rising. So there is clearly a softening out there. I mean whether it's because of the election or relative pricing between grocery store and restaurants, I'll let others kind of critique that. Look, I think there's ebbs and flows in any cycles of economies, and I think we're going through that right now. But I think it just puts a premium on quality operators both in terms of our customer bases as well as ourselves. I mean we feel good about what we're doing and we're doing everything we can to support our customers.","As far as the competitive environment, I wouldn't say there's any change. It's acutely competitive, as we've talked about before, all different types of competitors out there. We feel we're very well positioned. It does play out differently in some markets, but overall I'd say it's about the same.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much. Really appreciate your time.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So maybe starting a question for Tom. When you think about moving case growth back up, is there a lot of clear things you can do to help your customers stimulate demand or is it really more taking share from other distributors in the environment we're in today?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Hey, John. Well, I'd say I'm not sure there's a lot work we can do to help stimulate demand. What we can do is make sure that each of our customers is operating as effectively as they can and that they've got obviously the right products and the right pricing so that they can be successful, but as far as stimulating demand into their \u2013 our traffic into their locations, that's a little bit harder, I think, from where we sit. But I think there's a lot we are doing to help them be successful, and I think that's what we continue to focus and we believe very strongly that's as much our responsibility as theirs to help ensure that they're healthy and effective in what they're doing, and obviously with the tools that we bring them every day, we think, makes a big difference there. What was the second part of your question?","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Well, it was really that \u2013 if you're going to get case growth back up, it's more market share driven, which I guess, do you think from what you can see, is your share \u2013 the rate at which you're taking share from others in this space, maybe the smaller guys, it looks like it's accelerating. Is that fair?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Well, I think it's hard for us to obviously know that directly because, as you know, lots of competitors in this environment. We certainly believe we're continuing to grow at least at the industry if not outpacing that. As we talked for the last couple of years, we've tried to focus our efforts in a couple of areas, one where there's natural growth taking place. We've talked in the past about some of the segments where you're seeing growth, whether it be the Hispanic\/Latino segment out there where we've really focused some of our energy and efforts to provide support to those operators or certainly looking at geographies where we've got opportunities. So I think we continue to execute our strategy and we feel like it's working and that we're hopefully gaining share from lots of different places based on how well we're taking care of our customers.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. And then just lastly, if you think about supermarket foodservice, maybe just remind us kind of relative size of that business for you, it's still pretty small, I think, and where you think as you look out three years, five years or longer, how much bigger can that get?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Well, it is still relatively small for us. I don't have the exact numbers from Technomic, but I think that they would say that that retail segment, I think, is about 7% of the market. If my guess is \u2013 my memory serves me right. And I think that for us we certainly have opportunity to grow there. I think it really is a matter of what's the best way for us to grow there. We talked a couple of years ago about our relationship with Kroger. We feel like we continue to have opportunity as they grow in that space. But I think it really comes down to how consumers decide to purchase their food away from home, and that retail segment certainly, I know, is a big focus for a lot of the retailers see if they can pick up maybe some more share from that consumer.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Curious if you could just talk a little bit about the local case growth. I know it's hard to really know exactly how much the market is growing there, but do you feel like you took some share there? I realize it slowed, but still pretty solid, so just any color around that 1.9%.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","As we just were talking, I feel like it really is hard. We don't have a good view of the entire market. I'd say what we continue to see is we're getting growth from new customers. We are seeing a little bit of softness in some of the penetration of existing customers. We think that might be driven by some of the more external information that's out there around restaurant traffic, but broadly speaking we feel like we're just serving the broader independent restaurant segment well, and as we do that, we probably are gaining some share, but it's really hard to tell exactly where that might be coming from.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. And then I guess just another question on the three-year target, so I realize you may not be updating those or feel the need to update those, but I guess given that Brakes is now just a significant part of the story over the next couple of years, do you have any color just on how we should think about that three-year target with Brakes included?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Kelly, I'm going to start and I'm going let Joel give you a little more on this. So one of the reasons we are providing more detail at this time on this segment information is to make sure that we are clear on the International versus the U.S., and then what we will do \u2013 so we have a three-year target and we have a three-year goal, and we will continue to track that in calls like this and investor presentations periodically and give you some sense on where we are in that original goal for the businesses that existed at that time, and then how we're doing on the rest of it. So we're going to simultaneously track that three-year goal and also begin to build a new three-year plan here over the next few months, and then we'll put that out to you at some point in calendar 2017.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I think, Kelly, the thing I would add to that is it's just as a reminder. Part of this target was to be very clear with all of you in the way that we are holding ourselves accountable, the way you can ultimately hold us accountable is this very clear and specific target to the legacy business. And so as we go through this, again what you can expect from us is to continue to have a very clear delineation, again, of both how we look at the organization as a whole, but a continued very clear tracking on the things that we talked about on our original Investor Day, and again tracking our targets against that. So, that would be hopefully very clear and separate out for all of you.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Great. Thanks very much for taking my question, guys, and congrats on the nice quarter here. Just wanted to kind of reconcile, obviously we know that there were some puts and takes with Brakes and tax and all that type of stuff this quarter, but you did, several times of course, again say today about the softening from the macro, which you had alluded to last quarter as well. So I guess maybe anymore color you can give on that restaurant softness in terms of any particular types of customers or geographies, and kind of going forward, do you expect things to get kind of sequentially worse or more just kind of roughly stay around these levels which are off the kind of previous highs? Thanks.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Hey, Vinny. I'll start. Look, the one thing I would point us to is on an adjusted basis, if you exclude the impact of Brakes, we grew our operating income 15%. And that's the fourth quarter in a row where we got double-digit increases on adjusted operating income. So I think what we feel good about and hopefully what that tells others is whether we've got 2.5% or 3% case growth or 1.5% to 2% case growth, we're doing everything we can on the top line as well as how we manage it from there to deliver on our commitment. And so at this point, we feel very good about how we're managing the environment.","In terms of where it goes from here, I can just tell you, internally Tom and his team are very, very focused on penetration, on improved retention and where appropriate bringing on new quality customers. So we're doing everything we can in a disciplined way to grow that top line, but clearly it puts a premium on managing our expenses here and continue to find ways to price in a way that works for us as well as for our customers. So, that's the part we can control and influence. As far as where the market goes, it's really hard to call right now given everything that's going on in the country, but we're preparing for where we are at. I think to continue a while longer hopefully, it gets somewhat better, but we're not really \u2013 we're really not in the business of making those projections.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, okay. Thanks, Bill. That's helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up on Brakes specifically. In the past, I think we're all kind of \u2013 given the impression that at this point at least it was more or less going to kind of stay on its own largely kind of be run separately over there. Can you guys, I know it's still early, but just kind of give us maybe more of a qualitative sense of kind of the last few months, how that overall integration is going and if you think there are opportunities to kind of bring it more under kind of one roof over time?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Again, the way we're looking at this strategically is, there's a lot of exciting things about Brakes. We talked about quality of their team, the part of Europe that they know bring us into and our ability to use that business as a platform for future acquisition growth and a lot of other things.","So strategically the way we look at it is, it's a \u2013 along with Canada, it's a two foundational parts of our international business, and we expected to continue to grow and to allow us to continue to find ways to do acquisitions, and that's basically it from my perspective. Joel, you want to add something?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I think what I would just say for maybe a little bit of color, I mean, we certainly have regular ongoing conversation in the business reviews with their team, but again, as Bill mentioned, just to remind you, when we talked about this deal initially, it's again, they have a very strong management team, we feel really good about their people and the work that they're doing that continue to transform their business.","We certainly see that, again, as an opportunity to run that business stand-alone. Again, there's minimal overlap in the business we have. We certainly continue to look for opportunities though to bring upside in the deal. But, I would just tell you, again, a lot of good ongoing dialogue, but certainly we got a strong management team running that business as a stand-alone entity.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much, guys. Good luck.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about gross margin excluding Brakes. It's still up very significantly in the quarter, and so I wanted to get your sense on what were the key drivers? You mentioned four. How would you rank them during the quarter specifically and also how did deflation impact the gross margin this quarter? Thank you.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Good morning. So, this is Tom. Let me \u2013 I did talk about four different drivers, and I think we continue to believe each of those is contributing to the work we're doing. It's hard to pull out the deflation component. We know it certainly impacts the gross margin percent, but it's also I think probably most important to think about those other three areas that we're focused on, because that's how we manage the dollar side of it.","Category management continues to be very positive for us. As you know, we've been basically in that operating model now for the last three years, and it's \u2013 well we've gone through I'd say the major cycle with that, we continue to work with our suppliers and we look at long-term partnerships that continue to provide value for us, and ultimately for our customers. So category management continues to be a very important part of what we do and how we operate.","Revenue management has been something that now is fully deployed within our organization and I think we've got a really good set of processes and tools and ultimately routines for our sales and merchandising teams to leverage in the marketplace, and it allows us to be I think a little quicker on our feet, and be able to do the things that we need to do to make sure that our customers pricing is right on a regular basis, and it's driving really more consistency for our customers as well.","And then lastly, partly with the work we do in category management, but a continued focus on Sysco brand, which brings value also to our customers and obviously delivers additional profitability for Sysco has been a key driver for us, and we continue to see improvement within our local customers, with our local business, and we again saw an improvement in Sysco brand this last quarter. So it really is a combination of all of those, and it's hard for us to kind of tease apart each of them individually, but I can tell you that each of them is definitely playing a role.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","The only thing I would add there Marisa is, the thing I feel the best about here is going back to Tom's prepared comments, we grew the gross profit dollars over 4% in U.S. Foodservice business, and so deflation hurts you when you talk about gross profit dollars. So, all those things Tom just outlined I think are all key reasons why we were able to do that in an environment where you're looking at a meaningful deflation.","Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And if I could just follow-up on the revenue management, now that it's fully deployed, when do you anticipate seeing more of the benefit flow-through?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Well, I think it's \u2013 when I say it's fully deployed, I mean, it's been out there now for a couple of quarters, and so I think we're seeing the benefits right now. If the question is, does that have an endpoint? I think it's too early to even know that. It's an ongoing process that we follow now, and I think it's really more about being disciplined and how we approach pricing in the marketplace.","Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, good morning. And, Bill, just kind of sticking with the gross profit dollar growth subject here, when I think about your $500 million EBIT growth goal for over the next three years or through 2018, if you will, can you remind me what the inflation or deflation assumption was originally?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, the original model, and I will take it, this is Joel, that was about a 2%. If you recall, we had a differential between our volume and sales growth that we rolled out. We initially talked about at a 2% rate.","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then I guess suppose following up to that, now that we're in our fifth quarter of consecutive deflation, but also considering how well you guys have been driving your gross profit dollar growth despite this backdrop, how do we think about kind of you guys reaching that ultimate goal? I believe the original mix was somewhere 55% to 65% of that $500 million EBIT growth goal came from a gross profit dollar growth?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yes, I think I will take \u2013 I will start with that, I think, you guys can add in. I think we're still looking of that in a relatively consistent way as we had initially outlined. I think the real important part of this though is to \u2013 one of the things we've talked about a bit externally is this gap or this delta between our growth in gross profit dollars and our growth in expense dollars. And so one of the things \u2013 again, we've certainly done a good job of managing through this deflationary times and still continued to grow our growth in gross profit dollars.","We've also done a good job, I think of focusing and driving expenses downward as both Bill and Tom have talked about. And I think, when we looked at that plan and sort of the puts and takes of what was going to drive it, we certainly knew there are \u2013 we could've had more inflation, could've had less inflation, some of those factors are what they are, but the reality of it is our continued focus on that gap and that delta between those two numbers I think is really important.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I think where we're at right now and I think where we've been to your point over the last few quarters is, we're not on track to hit the sales number, okay? I think in that original goal, we were looking at 4% sales growth with two points of inflation and directionally about the same amount of GP growth. So we've got to get the GP a different way, and that's what we've been able to do here so far. We're really encouraged by that as well as managing the expenses, so I think it's more of a play on the top line than anything else.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, just the one final thing I'd add to that is the \u2013 if you recall when we increased our targets from $400 million to $500 million, that was again primarily driven by some change in some of the way we viewed our expenses. And so, again, if you want to look at that shift again a little bit it was, again, as I mentioned earlier, a pretty good system over the top, it was again a little bit more of a shift towards some of the expense side as we roll out when we increased our targets.","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","Right. That's helpful. And then just a quick housekeeping one for you, Joel. What's the reasonable tax rate to be assuming on a go-forward?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, so I think at the end of last year we guided somewhere in the 35% to 36% range. So with some of the \u2013 one of the things we've talked about of this was actually a tax law change in the UK that moved the statutory rate essentially from 18% to 17%. I would say that would take our view of that probably on the low-end of the guidance that we put out before.","A couple of things in this quarter that again we called out that we are seeing some one-time deals, and so I would say the rates you see in this quarter is a bit lower than you should anticipate going forward. But I think the low end of our guidance is probably a fair way to look at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is now open.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Yeah, hi. I had a question on the currency impact. I think, Joel, you mentioned that the impact overall wasn't that significant in the quarter, and my understanding is that any hedges that were in place were terminated at the end of last year. And I'm also sure that you're very well aware that there was a pretty dramatic swing in the exchange rate for the pound year-over-year during the quarter. So can you give any more color on why there wasn't any significant drag from currency in the quarter? I would've assumed that earnings would have been better without the currency impact, but I'm just surprised that you're saying there really wasn't that much of an impact at all?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I think, Ajay, I mean, the point I was really making is \u2013 without a doubt, I mean, you're correct in your statement regarding the hedges. I think if you think about the magnitude of the Brakes business as a percentage of our entire business, it's really where my comment was targeted at.","What we've talked about over the past few quarters was a difference that was primarily driven by the Canadian exchange rate, but that has pretty much mitigated frankly, and again if you think about that business as a percentage of our total, certainly the Brakes earnings would've been higher and if you factor the weakness of the sterling in, but I guess my comment was really on the whole organization, the overall impact wasn't that significant.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","I mean, to Joel's point, you're talking about 65% of 10% of the business.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Right.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Got it. And I also just wanted to follow-up on the earlier questions on the three-year plan, and maybe I'll just frame my question a little differently. So I know you're going to be giving an update later in the year, but since you are tracking your progress pretty closely, can you just at least confirm where the things are right now on a run rate basis relative to that $500 million growth target? So if you were to give a current snapshot, can you confirm whether you're comfortably ahead of plan or if there's still supposed to be kind of like more back-ended loaded assumptions on those three-year objectives? Thanks.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","As I said, I feel good about where we're at. We're five quarters into it. We've been trending 10% to 15% earnings growth every quarter, that's consistent with the plan. We've got some benefit next year with the depreciation as it relates to the business technology. So from where I sit, I would say we're comfortably on track right now and looking to reassess here at the end of second quarter.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I think the way, and I'll just add to that, I mean, I think at the end of last year we've talked about some initial percentage targets. I think at the end of last year we were slightly ahead of those targets. I think what we've talked about, though, and again, we had a strong quarter this quarter, but on an ongoing basis we've \u2013 I've said it, Bill said it before, I mean we'd certainly like to get a couple of quarters under our belt before we think about doing anything differently there. And so that's really the way I would think about our progress. We're feeling good, we're in a good place, but let's see how this plays out.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. And finally, how would you describe if you could comment on the case volume trends at Brakes year-over-year in the UK market in particular? I mean, can you confirm if they were positive or negative?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Again, we've got an international segment. We're going to give you some color on the components of that. I would tell you that their business softened through the calendar year even before Brexit, and I think it's more about just the uncertainty in that economy, whether it was leading up to Brexit or post-Brexit. And if you read all the different accounts, so far it hasn't been as bad perhaps as people thought it might have been and I think we're seeing that as well.","On the other hand, there's still a lot of uncertainty here over the next two years or three years. So, I think as Tom said in his prepared remarks, I think they performed reasonably well given the environment.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. One quick one and then one question, if I may. Firstly, there seems to be some confusion about what non-GAAP D&A should be for the business in 2017 and maybe even 2018. Bill, I think in the last question you mentioned some technology write-off that you had done recently that may benefit that D&A line, but I hate to ask such a specific question, because a lot of people are \u2013 do have some really different estimates. Can you give us a little more specific help on that specific line?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Well, so let me start with that, and then so I'll take a couple of things on that. So one of the things you'll see are certain item, reconciliation this quarter is that, you can see this in our Q, our D&A is up a bit for this quarter for a couple of different reasons. Number one, as we talked about last year, we actually expected some due to the write-off of the SAP system, there was an acceleration of the amortization related to that, and so there is again say roughly $30 million I'd say of a certain item related to that issue that's part of our D&A. There's also as a result of the Brakes deal, there is both additional depreciation and amortization as a part of that. And so I think if you look at our overall D&A expense for this particular quarter relative to where we've been, those are really the two primary contributors on that line as it relates to this.","What Bill was referring to as in his comment earlier, if you recall at the time when we increased our targets from $400 million to $500 million at a while back, we had made a couple of comments as it relates to that. Number one was the fact that a component of that difference was related to the fact that we \u2013 it was a changeover in our technology strategy, that there'd be some benefits once again the asset was fully written off. Again, there is accelerated amortization we will be experiencing at the end of last year and through this year, but there'd be benefit of that starting in 2018.","So I think that's really what Bill was relating to on that, and so hopefully that gives you some clarity on some of the comments and a little bit of a break down on that. But you should expect that accelerated amortization from that plus the Brakes to be present throughout the rest of this year.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","I can confirm that's what I was relating to.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Okay. Thank you, and I think I did understand that. But I think if you look at Street estimates you'll see that people have some pretty different estimates for D&A, like unusually different estimates for D&A in 2017 and 2018, and that's why I was wondering if you're willing to just give a little bit more specific guidance on that one specific line?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I mean, look, I think you guys need to adjust this quarter, go through a certain item schedule, work with Neil, and I would expect it will get more consistency there.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. We will do our best as always. And then the next question, obviously the restaurant industry just speaking from an operator perspective, slower traffic, higher labor cost, I mean, it's one of the obvious things that a restaurant company does is come to their food supplier and try to get as low as prices as possible. Are you seeing your restaurant customers may be asking even more from you than they have in the past, even if they see your gross margin results may ask you to get some of the gross margin back to them as they try to protect their own profitability?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Well, this is Tom. So I would say, John, a couple of things, as we said earlier, it continues to be very competitive out there, whether it's a chain restaurant customer or a street customer for us. And I think the way we try to look at value we bring to those customers is certainly beyond just price. We offer a wide range of obviously products and services to these folks. We believe we bring them value each and every day.","We talked a little bit about Sysco brand earlier, Sysco brand is a great example of where we're able to bring basically lower cost of goods to our customers, and put them in a position where they can earn as much as they can from their offering.","But it's well beyond just products and pricing, and so I would say it's the whole portfolio of things we bring to them that's allowed us to be successful, and certainly what we believe is the right strategy for us going forward. But it doesn't take away from the fact that it's competitive out there each and every day, and we just have to make sure that we're doing those right things in the market. We absolutely believe we need to be price competitive and that's one of the components of what we focus on.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","And I think, John, just to reinforce that, this is happening in an environment of two points of deflation right now, so the customers, they're benefiting from a food cost deflation. What we're doing and what Tom addressed earlier with the revenue management is using a lot of tools to be more consistent, more targeted in our pricing. But we still need to compete, as he points out, every day for that business.","And interestingly to me, on the data that we see, to your point, whether benefiting from deflation, they've got some labor pressures, they've been out there for a while now, but the restaurants as a group continue to pass long about a two-point increase to their customers, and that has been incredibly consistent through every cycle that we've seen here.","So, I think right now they're managing it pretty well and the deflation is helping them. At some point, I guess it could become more acute if we were to see the deflation reverse, but as I think as Joel pointed out, we don't see that happening here, at least not in this calendar year.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue.

Joining me in Houston today are Tom Ben\u00e9, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and actual results could differ in a material manner.","Additional information about factors that could cause the results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings.

Thank you all for joining us. This morning we announced financial results, which reflect improved year-over-year performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019. For the full year, we made solid progress against our multi-year transformational initiatives, which we believe position us well to exceed our customers' expectations and deliver long-term growth. During the year, we had solid 8% adjusted operating income growth and adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%.","Starting with Sysco's full year fiscal 2019 results, sales grew 2.4% to $60.1 billion, driven by steady growth of local customers and the acquisition of several smaller distributors in both the U.S. and Europe, which were partially offset by the transitioning of some national customers in both our Broadline and SYGMA businesses.","Gross profit for the year grew 2.9% to $11.4 billion, driven by a continued shift in our customer mix, as we grew local cases at a faster pace than total case growth; favorable product mix, as we continue to drive growth in our Sysco Brand portfolio, not only through the addition of innovative products, but also by bringing Sysco Brand to additional geographies beyond the U.S.; the continuation of our successful category management effort, as we are now starting to bring this successful process to our European business; and the ongoing management of inbound freight that's now stabilized, although, not back to the pre-fiscal 2018 levels.","Finally across the entire business, we saw a modest level of inflation for the year of about 1% to 2%. From an expense perspective, we saw solid overall expense management for the year, with adjusted operating expenses increasing only 1.4%, driven by benefits from our transformative initiatives and solid corporate expense management, all of which helped to offset the ongoing rising labor costs in both the transportation and warehouse areas. The gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth was 150 basis points for the full year, despite a challenging year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter.","For total Sysco, we delivered solid adjusted operating income growth of 8% to $2.7 billion, which helped to drive our adjusted earnings per share up 13% to $3.55. As we look at the results by business segment, let's start with the United States and the overall macroeconomic trends, which continue to be relatively positive. The underlying economic picture remains encouraging with GDP at 2.1% for the second quarter of 2019 and continued low unemployment, which were just 3.7% in July.","Consumer confidence has decreased slightly, but still remains solid. These factors were important macroeconomic indicators, which describe the environment our customers are currently operating in and speaks to the relative health of our food-away-from-home market.","As for restaurant industry trends Knapp-Track and Black Box show same-store sales relatively flat in June and consistent with what we previously discussed, while traffic continues to be negative. Within U.S. Foodservice Operations for the year, sales for fiscal 2019 were $41.3 billion, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. Inflation in U.S. Broadline was 1.5% and local case growth grew 3.1%, of which 2.2% was organic, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline grew 2.7%, of which 2% was organic.","Gross profit dollars increased 4.4% and gross margin increased 5 basis points to 20%. Gross profit was positively impacted by strong Sysco Brand sales, year-over-year favorability of inbound freight and continued category management benefits.","Regarding Sysco Brand, using customer insights we launched two new brands, including Sysco Earth Plus, a planet-friendly non-food solution for operators looking for a wide range of reliable and economically environmentally responsible products; and Sysco Simply, a platform designed to enable our customers to accommodate the growing consumer demand for varied dietary and lifestyle choices.","Our adjusted operating expenses for the year increased 4.4%, due mainly to increased costs in both the transportation and warehouse areas, partly as a result of the tight labor market. This combined with seasonal hiring of driver and warehouse staff have driven increased operational costs on a per unit basis, as volume has softened. Finally, adjusted operating income was $3.2 billion, an increase of 4.4% compared to the prior year.","Now turning to our International Foodservice Operations results for the year. The macro environment for the -- macroeconomic environment for the geographies in which we serve remains relatively positive, while the foodservice industry data suggest modestly improved sales with flat to slightly higher volume growth. The Sysco results in the segment overall were mixed during fiscal 2019 with improved performance during the second half of the year.","Overall, for fiscal 2019, sales decreased 0.2%, gross profit decreased 1.8%, adjusted operating expenses decreased 3.7%; and adjusted operating income was $354.8 million, an increase of 10.7%. Topline growth for the year across our international businesses was also mixed. Canada and most of Europe performed well especially Ireland and Sweden and we dealt with some operational challenges in France as our efforts to integrate our two businesses Brake France and Davigel has impacted our ability to drive growth.","From a cost perspective, we continue to make investments across much of Europe to position us for future business growth. We have also begun to leverage broader Sysco capabilities and processes to deliver improved synergies across the European business. Additionally, our regionalization efforts in Canada continue to deliver results and also helped to drive improved cost performance in this segment.","In Latin America, our businesses are operating well with continued growth in sales, gross profit and operating income in Costa Rica and Panama from both the Broadline and Cash & Carry segments. The Bahamas in our international food group export business also continue to experience growth but were partially offset by our business in Mexico, which in the fourth quarter began to show some progress and weaker performance earlier this year.","Turning to SYGMA, we continue to focus on improving overall profitability. As a result, we saw planned softness in the topline, while gross margin increased 30 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating expenses were down for the year, driven by a focus on removing unproductive miles and rightsizing underperforming locations, which helped to drive an adjusted operating income increase of 25% versus prior year. We feel very good about the continued progress we are making within SYGMA and are confident in our ability to drive improved performance going forward.","Now, let me turn the call over to Joel Grade, who will talk with you about our fourth quarter performance, along with additional financial details for both the quarter and the year. I'll then come back to offer perspective regarding our overall business performance for the year, some important updates as we look ahead and some things we are excited about for the future.","Joel Grade","Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone. I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter results, followed by some additional perspective on our full fiscal year results, closing with some commentary regarding fiscal year 2020.","Sales for the fourth quarter increased 1%, compared to the same period last year. Foreign exchange rates negatively affected total Sysco sales by approximately 0.8%. Local case volumes within U.S. Broadline operations grew 1.4% for the fourth quarter of which 1.3% was organic, while total case volume within the U.S. Broadline operations grew -- of which 0.3% was organic.","Even though, case growth was softer than anticipated, it is worth noting the tough comparison in the prior year local case growth of 5% and total case growth of 5.3%. Gross profit increased 2.1% versus the prior year and gross margin increased 21 basis points. We saw solid expense management for the quarter, despite operational cost challenges in our U.S. segment.","Our transformational initiatives continue to provide benefit, as adjusted operating expenses grew only 0.6% for the year. And as a result, we achieved a gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth of 150 basis points and adjusted operating income grew 6.6% compared to the same period last year.","It's important to note, that this performance as well was achieved despite having difficult year-over-year comparison, where the gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth was 300 basis points. As it relates to taxes, our GAAP tax rate in the fourth quarter was 21.5% and when adjusted for certain items was close to 20%.","For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recognized the benefit as a reduction of income tax expense, attributable to stock option exercises that occurred in the quarter. In addition, we recognized a onetime benefit in France, related to a favorable ruling on tax carryovers and employment tax credits.","Now turning to our results for the fiscal year 2019. Sales increased 2.4% to $60.1 billion. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total Sysco sales during the year by 0.8%. Our local case growth for the year in U.S. Broadline was 3.1%, one of the highest full year percentage increases in several years. Gross profit increased 2.9% to $11.4 billion and gross margin increased 10 basis points.","For the year, our overall expense management was solid, driven by benefits from our transformation initiatives with adjusted operating expenses increasing 1.4%, resulting in an adjusted operating income increase of 7.9% to $2.7 billion. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total Sysco operating income during fiscal 2019 by 0.5%.","For the year, we achieved a gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth of 150 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.41 to $3.55, primarily impacted by growth in adjusted operating income and our fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate which is 21%. For fiscal 2019 our non-GAAP tax rate reflects tax benefits attributable to equity compensation elections and credits.","Cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion for fiscal year 2019 which was $256 million higher compared to last year. Net CapEx for fiscal year 2019 was $671 million or about 1.1% of sales which was $5.9 million higher compared to last year. We continue to generate meaningful free cash flow as we achieved $1.7 billion for fiscal year 2019 which was $250 million higher compared to last year due in part to reduced pension contributions partially offset by higher cash taxes.","We are pleased that our adjusted return on invested capital grew 170 basis points to 16.4% in fiscal 2019 reflecting continued disciplined investments in our business and solid operating performance during the year.","Now before closing, I would like to provide you some commentary on the outlook for fiscal year 2020. Capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 are expected to be approximately 1.3% of sales consistent with our previous three-year guidance. From a tax perspective, we expect our overall effective tax rate to be approximately 24% in fiscal 2020 and we intend to continue to improve working capital days to achieve our three-year plan goal of two days improvement by the end of fiscal 2020.","At the end of fiscal 2019, we have improved working capital by approximately 1 day versus start of the three-year plan. In addition, we continue to maintain a strong and consistent capital allocation priority of investing in our business and returning value to shareholders with the increased cash flows from the business. These priorities include; first, investing in our business for long-term growth and increasing our industry leading position; second a commitment to consistently growing our dividend, something we have done each year for the last 50 years.","Third, participating in successful tuck-in and specialty acquisitions as well as being opportunistic when it comes to larger more strategic deals. In fact I am proud to announce today that we are signing a definitive agreement to acquire J. Kings Food Service Professionals, a New York-based distributor with $155 million in annual sales a majority of which are local customers.","Fourth, a balanced approach between debt paydown and opportunistic share repurchase. As a result of our confidence in our long-term growth opportunities and our strong market leadership position, we intend to increase the amount of our share repurchases to more than $1 billion of shares during fiscal 2020.","Before we go to Q&A, let me turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Thanks, Joel. Before closing, I'd like to first review a couple of things we've shared with you this morning. As mentioned we delivered a strong fiscal 2019 with 8% adjusted operating income growth and 13% adjusted earnings per share growth. However, we didn't finish the year as strong as we would have liked especially in the U.S. Foodservice segment and therefore didn't meet our own expectations for the fourth quarter.","When you combine the overall softness in our topline, driven primarily by national and regional customer losses along with some increased operational expenses and with our previously communicated reduction in go-forward operating income from the sale of Iowa Premium, our beef processing facility, we are now lowering our fiscal 2018 to 2020, 3 year plan adjusted operating income growth target to approximately $600 million from the previously communicated low end of the $650 million to $700 million range.","Having said that, I'd like to reinforce why we feel very confident in our ability to improve the current trajectory and continue to achieve success over the long-term despite some of these near-term challenges.","We know from our ongoing customer feedback that we are strategically on the right track as we work to improve the experience our customers have in doing business with Sysco. That includes our ongoing investment in customer facing technology as we look to improve the way our customers do business with us.","Additionally, we will continue to drive growth in our Sysco brand not only through the addition of new and innovative products, but also by expanding the reach of these type of products in additional geographies beyond the U.S. and Canada.","We continue to have the strongest balance sheet in the industry and expect to leverage that to drive growth both in the core business and in returning value to shareholders. That includes planned M&A in both segments and geographies, in which we currently serve as well as relative adjacencies over time, which will only further strengthen our position as we see the level of competition in the industry increasing.","In summary, in fiscal 2019, we saw improved year-over-year financial performance, which included strong adjusted operating income growth, double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, and strong cash flow performance all achieved while investing in the business and returning value to shareholders with our 50th dividend increase and over $1 billion in share repurchases.","Looking ahead, our focus remains squarely on the customer and achieving the newly outlined three-year plan financial targets. I remain very confident we have the right strategies and most importantly, the right team to vigorously compete on service, the highest quality products and price.","Finally, I would like to thank each of our 69,000 associates across the globe for their continued dedication and hard work to ensuring Sysco remains our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.","Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Kelly Bania","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and for all the color. I guess, just wanted to start with maybe a diagnosis of the top-line and the case growth and if there's any execution factors that you see either with sales reps or service levels or you really think it's just a function of the industry. And I think you've just made a comment about a level of competition increasing. So maybe you can just expand on what you're seeing there and how you feel about execution?","And then I guess second part of the question is the outlook for $600 million, I guess does imply a little bit of a stronger year in fiscal 2020 than the last two years and just maybe helping -- seeing if you can help us walk through the puts and takes on how you're thinking about modeling that?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes. Thanks Kelly. Let's start with the top line and it's a great question. So as I shared, we certainly have seen and continued to focus on this disciplined profitable growth as it relates to our national customers. And so we've seen certainly some impacts there and some fairly significant change in the trajectory of that business as we've kind of -- we're in the fourth quarter even as we're into the New Year.","So that's a big part of what we're talking about here. We've seen that also at some of the regional customer levels. So we talked over the last year or so about our focus on these micro chains and we cycled some business that we've picked up in the past and we've also seen competition ramp up in that space. And so that's the biggest single impact I think you will see both in the fourth quarter, driving our top line performance. Joel also talked about just the overlap we had year-over-year. Our Q4 last year was one of our biggest quarters in record both local and total cases.","As far as operational or executional things, most of what we're talking about is on the expense side. Although as we talk about some of the transformative initiatives that we've been executing, but we see from time to time as we're learning that there are some customer service challenges that get created. We're not broadly concerned about that and don't feel like that is a long-term issue but we've certainly seen a little bit of impact both from our finance transformation and also in some of the work we've done with our new ordering platform. But again in both cases we think that they are short-term and we're working through them. And obviously our customer service is kind of paramount for us in everything we do.","As it relates to fiscal year 2020, I think that your point is correct, which is even at the $600 million number that does suggest a step-up from where we are today. And I think it's a combination of good performance in the U.S., and obviously continuing to see that business perform well, improving business across our international segments, and as I mentioned continued improving performance within SYGMA as well. So it's a little bit across the board, but we feel going into 2020 fairly confident that we can deliver that $600 million number and that increased step-up for fiscal year 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Edward Kelly","Yeah. Hi guys, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up first question -- another question on Kelly's question here. Industry data for July hasn't really been great. Just kind of curious as to what you're seeing so far in Q1?","And then how should we think about the progress of case growth throughout the year just given what you put up in Q4, some of the commentary about being more disciplined on accounts? Just kind of curious here as to how -- what the expectation should be in terms of case growth as we progress through to 2020 given what we just saw?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Great, Ed. So let's start with the Q1 question. I'd say, as we started Q1 and July has had some of that same softness that we just talked about for Q4. And I think it's mostly in the same areas for us these national and regional customers where we transitioned some business there or had some losses. So we see that similar trajectory as we started the quarter. As we think about case growth broadly, as we've talked for a long time now, our focus continues to be on those places where we can add the most value so those local customers. Some of those still are those regional concepts.","I don't want to lead you to believe that those aren't important part of our growth story as well. But that independent customers where we have the most value, we continue to see that part of the business performing well, if not maybe at some of the high you saw a year ago, but we still see that business performing well. We feel like we're continuing to progress nicely with those customers.","We do believe that we will start to see some improved volume growth throughout the fiscal year 2020, as we continue to cycle some losses that we had earlier in the year in the national customer sector. But generally speaking, I think we feel like the overall case numbers as we talked about I think last quarter are going to be a little softer than we originally projected for the three-year plan.","Edward Kelly","Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you about bad debt and just really kind of what's going on. We haven't -- looking at the cash flow statement, but -- and I'm assuming this is your accrual, but it hasn't been this high really since 2009. I'm just kind of curious, is there one specific situation that drove that this year? Is it something more broad-based? Does 2020 normalize?","Joel Grade","Yes. Ed, it's Joel. I think the way I think about that is, I do think we have seen some worsening of the environment for bad debt. I think the -- it's -- I wouldn't certainly call it at a crisis situation, but it has certainly gotten worse. Our overall days are a little softer. We've had -- we had about one fairly significant hit per quarter to some extent that has impacted us. And so on one hand the bad debt expense -- and when you look at it year-over-year there is an element of some pickups we had in last year's numbers that account for about half of the difference. But nonetheless, I would say the environment has gotten a little bit worse. It's certainly something we're keeping a close eye on. And I'd say, if you look at our performance relatively over the last few years, we've had a pretty strong run. And so again I think it's a fair comment to say that has gotten -- it has gotten somewhat worse, but certainly something we're monitoring carefully.","Edward Kelly","All right. Thanks guys.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Mandeville of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Chris Mandeville","Hey, good morning. Tom, you characterized some of the losses or just reduction in customer count both in national and in regional from a perspective of loss and then planned. Can you just go into the losses a little bit more in greater detail? Just -- is there a common thread with respect to why they're choosing to go elsewhere, or is competition doing something a little bit more aggressively? Anything you can add there in terms of concept?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Sure, Chris. I think you're right to suggest there's both. There's customers that as we go into the negotiation would end up not being a renewal for Sysco. When we've taken a loss, it's generally driven by competitive pricing. And what I mean by that is more aggressive distribution fees than what we are comfortable with. And part of what we've tried to work through is how do we continue to improve the cost of -- to serve our customers so that we are obviously competitive on a day-to-day basis for almost any customer. But when we've typically lost, it's been because the fees have been beyond what we've been comfortable. And so that's been a big driver of what has happened to some of these regional customers.","Joel Grade","Yes. And I would say too, I just wanted to add to that. I mean there's a little bit -- there's been, I'd say a little bit more of the upfront monies that have been moved around in the industry at this point. That's things in the areas that again discipline-wise at times we're just not comfortable making some of those decisions. So it's probably the other part that plays into that same point.","Chris Mandeville","Okay. And then, just looking to fiscal 2020 here and really just the updated EBIT guidance for $600 million or so. Is that still again very much predicated on OpEx and the larger buckets which you've outlined in the past? And are we able to essentially hit that $600 million, if in the event we don't see any material acceleration in total cases?","Tom Ben\u00e9","It's a great question. I think this conversation we've had for a couple of years now around the balance between gross profit and operating expenses is going to be key. And so if we do see -- we don't see a dramatic uptick in volume, therefore gross profit, we've got to make sure that that spread remains at that 150 basis points. So it is -- I wouldn't say, it's not really predicated only on that, but that balance of those two is very important as we continue to move forward the business.","Chris Mandeville","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim. Your line is open.","John Heinbockel","So, Tom let me start local case growth is not bad, but it could be better right, particularly stacked up against some peers. Where do you think -- maybe you can put some investment muscle behind the business, right, if you think you can to drive some incremental growth?","And where do you -- how happy are you with the growth in the MA population and their performance? Is there a case to be made for stepping that up a little bit selectively like you did two years ago?","Operator","Our next question comes from Judah Frommer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Judah Frommer","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first just to follow-up on kind of the competitive landscape within Broadline. Can you help us with what types of competitors may be winning those customers away from you? Are they more local in nature? And then why is your scale not helping you with kind of lower costs to serving those locales?","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. We're experiencing technical difficulties. Thank you for your patience and please stand by. Jeffrey Bernstein, your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you. Can you hear me? Hello?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hi there, Jeff?","Jeffrey Bernstein","Yes. Hi, there. Thank you.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hi.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Good morning.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Go ahead with your questions.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Thank you. A couple of follow-ups as we think about the three-year profitability target obviously you've baked into the sales side of things. I'm just wondering from a cost perspective. First, I guess on commodities, I know the best inflation this past quarter was 2.5%, seems like it's been creeping up the past few quarters. Just wondering, what you're assuming in terms of fiscal 2020 whether you're anticipating a further acceleration in inflation. Maybe any thoughts specific to proteins that might be more vulnerable or any color you can provide on the food cost side of things?","Joel Grade","Yes. Sure, Jeff. It's Joel. I would say at this point, I mean, we're anticipating what we continue to refer to as modest levels of inflation over the next couple of quarters, which I would interpret to say as something fairly consistent, where we are today. And we're certainly \u2013 the inflationary categories really have been in meat, in poultry and produce and then to some extent Jeff frozen potatoes as well has been an area that's continued to have some inflation. So I don't know that we are look for the next couple of quarters anything really dramatic or above that, but I certainly \u2013 we do anticipate continued inflation, and I'd say approximately in the range, we're at today.","Jeffrey Bernstein","And on the labor front? Is there any color you can provide in terms of whether there's a basket inflation number or how you look at it from turnover or just competition for drivers and associates?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yeah. I think what we've tried to manage through here Jeff is the \u2013 and it's probably worth spending a minute here for everyone's benefit. As we went into the fourth quarter and we did have some volume softening traditionally, what we would be is much \u2013 probably more aggressive on trying to reduce the number of drivers the number of selectors we have.","And given the labor market and the environment we're operating in we choose \u2013 we've chosen really to take more of a long-term view on this. And so part of what we're wrestling with right now is these increased operating expenses not so much driven by increased labor rates, because our labor \u2013 we pay \u2013 we're a pretty good payer in the market, but trying to make sure we're not letting people go during maybe a little bit of softer volume times. So we're still paying for those resources probably at a level that we haven't historically to maintain the service and support levels for our customers.","As we look forward the volume \u2013 if the volume numbers will be softer over a longer period of time, we'll manage that more appropriately. But I think we're just trying to make sure, we're not in a situation where we were a couple of years ago, where we had lots of retention challenges and we were struggling to even get drivers in to fill routes. So today, we're feeling much better about our retention. And as we look to the labor rate next year, we don't see anything that's beyond the kind of 2% to 3% that we've dealt with over the past. And we look to offset some of that with productivity benefits in the operations. We still feel I think pretty good about the labor rate increases, just continuing to manage the retention and making sure we're not doing anything in the short-term to impact our ability to service our customers.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it. And just lastly, just \u2013 you mentioned national customer softening. I'm just wondering, if you're able to dig into that whether it's more quick service versus casual dining, whether there's a differential there, whether it's a regional differential, or is it kind of a broad brush comment across all brands and across all geographies?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yeah. I think it's more of a broader comment. Part of it was losses meaning, we didn't renew or weren't successful in renewing a customer. There are some softness in certain customers, but I would say, it's not specific to anyone geography or even customer type. It's probably more of certain brands that are performing better than others and you guys probably have a sense of who those are and so some of those are in our portfolio both on the positive side and on the challenge side.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it. Thank you very much.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim. Your line is open.","John Heinbockel","Hey, Tom, can you hear me?","Tom Ben\u00e9","I can hear you John. We're glad you're back or we're back here.","Joel Grade","We thought we lost you.","John Heinbockel","So when you look at local case growth and you think about trend right because obviously a two-year stack it probably a little bit better in the fourth quarter, where do you think you are, or have you seen any deterioration in local case growth say the last three to six months? And then, is there opportunity, right? A couple of years ago, you selectively added or stepped up MA hiring. Is there an opportunity to do that again, or you don't think that would result in incremental share gains?","Tom Ben\u00e9","So let's start with the local cases. It was probably a little softer when you think about the last two quarters. But to your point about the two-year stack as we look at how we've grown over the last couple of years, we still feel pretty good about it. And even as we move into this year on that true independent customer, I think we feel good about where we're at. There are some of these as we've talked regional chains where we've seen some impacts and we've got to stay close to that. And part of that is making sure, we're staying competitive in those situations and so that's something that we're going to be very focused on.","As we think about is there a way to accelerate that growth even further the MAs continue to play an important role in our portfolio. As you guys know, we've talked about often the fact that our customers really value that resource and we obviously see the benefits of having them out there. We will selectively add resources, where it makes sense meaning maybe our share position is such that there's lots of upside and \u2013 but I don't think it makes sense for us to go and add a significant amount of resources in that area. What we're trying to make sure we do is we have the right support around them, especially as we have more and more customers go online to make sure that they've got whether it's the specialist support around proteins or it's around certain product categories that we feel are important to those customers or some of the other tools and technology that we've built to support them.","So, it's less about I think adding more resources because, we feel like, we're pretty balanced in the size of territories that they have and the amount that they can handle going forward. We are thinking about ways to increase our new business. Our new business has been strong, but there's always an opportunity to increase the new business side of things especially as we've had some of these transitions happen.","John Heinbockel","And then, when you think about 2020, right, so two things, impact of financial road map in 2020 maybe versus '19. And then maybe for Joel, so D&A in 2020 is that likely to be in the sort of $775 million to $800 million range? I know, it's been stepping down a bit. Is that a fair range to look at?","Joel Grade","So, why don't I start with the D&A comment? I mean, we typically have our D&A that -- I don't know, if there's anything I'd say that's any material or significant change as it relates to that. I mean, I think -- and these sometimes find -- again as we make investments, some stuff falls off and some things add and our D&A may go up a tick. But I just broadly speaking would not say there's anything of significance that you should expect from a D&A perspective moving forward.","Tom Ben\u00e9","And John, when you spoke financial road map, is there something in particular?","John Heinbockel","No. I'm just curious, when you look at your operating initiatives, right, and you think about which one can make a bigger difference of that group of four, right. It would seem like financial road map could be one of big ones that would have a bigger impact in 2020 than this past year. Is that not right?","Joel Grade","Yes. I would say it this way. I think, we actually had a significant impact in fiscal year 2019 at our finance transformation road map and actually certainly expecting even a slightly more significant impact in fiscal year 2020. I think a couple of those key initiatives. Again, the Canada regionalization as well and when you think about that that was really something that had a benefit in both this year and as it carries into next year kind of started in the middle of the year. And so, the way I would look at these initiatives, John, is that many of them if you remember started benefiting in the second half of the fiscal year which then carries into the -- some of the first and then obviously some further benefit builds on that. So, I would call -- I would say a couple of those certainly again strong impacts last year and expect another solid year as we head into next year as well.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ajay Jain of Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.","Ajay Jain","Yeah, hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I think as others have pointed out, I think you still need to deliver over $200 million of incremental growth to hit the three-year target. And so, I'm just trying to figure out where that's coming from in 2020. I mean do you think that growth will be broad-based across your segments, or should we expect continued pressure in U.S. Foodservice? I think in U.S. Foodservice, earnings were flat in Q4 and that was a pretty sharp sequential decrease in the growth rate. So, do you have any color on what you're assuming across the three main segments in terms of growth for 2020?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Ajay, as mentioned earlier, I think, it's going to be a balance across all international U.S. and SYGMA. And we see -- in the U.S it's about maintaining that balance between gross profit and operating expense and we feel pretty good about our ability to do that. We have initiatives in place to drive that.","As it relates to the European business and the rest of international, I think, we feel like we dealt with a few challenges this year that we had not expected. Specifically, we talked about Mexico and also France and so we think we feel much better going into next year about that. And then, SYGMA, I think, we're just on a good trajectory at this point.","We've got ourselves in a place where we need to be able to continue to see improving, both not so much top line, because we've got that business, I think, in a place now where it makes sense, but more around balancing the gross profit and the cost side, so we can deliver operating performance.","Ajay Jain","Okay. Thank you. And I had one follow-up. I think, Tom, in your prepared comments you sort of presented a mixed picture with strong economic backdrop, but softer industry trends in terms of restaurant spending in the U.S. with flat restaurant comps and negative traffic trends.","So I'm just trying to reconcile the weaker industry backdrop with your operating performance and that of your competitors, I think, apart from the weaker -- I guess, I'm just wondering apart from the weaker traffic trends, do you feel like you're losing any piece of the independent business to competition? I'm asking, specifically, in relation to some of your competitors who've reported an acceleration with the independent case volume.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes. Well, as you guys all know, there's tremendous amount -- a number of competitors in the space we operate in. There are the public guys and then there are tremendous amount of regional and local folks. I think there are geographies where we've had more impacts from a competitive environment than others.","I would say, broadly speaking, we feel comfortable with where we're at. But it is getting aggressive out there and more competitive and we just need to make sure we're maintaining our position and doing everything we can to continue to earn our customers' business every day, not just on price, but obviously on things like our service platform and our product portfolio.","Joel Grade","Yes. And, Ajay, I think, just as a reminder though as well. I think some of the commentary earlier was also related to the fact that, again, within what we talked about as local, there's a couple of different types of those customers. And I think when you think about kind of the true independents versus talk about some of the regional and local chains.","Again, I think, some of the pressure a little bit, as Tom talked about earlier, is more in that area where there seasonally seems to have been a bit of a ramp-up in, again, pricing and some upfront that I think we just -- again, we're keeping a very close eye on that, but also again trying to remain -- maintaining our discipline in some of those areas. So I just think I would just distinguish a little bit between, as it relates to true independent and some of the other areas that we're actually feeling more of the pressure.","Ajay Jain","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe","Hi. Thank you. I just had a direct follow-up on the previous question, actually. That level of competition that you have cited in your prepared remarks, I think, even a few times, do you think that's service level-driven, or are you seeing competitors that are materially using gross margin to drive case growth?","And like using your previous history in this industry, I mean, do you think we're at the cusp of, which we've obviously been in several times before, companies that might be using gross margin just in and of itself to drive case growth? And is that something, at this point, that you're at least contemplating on a customer-by-customer basis?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Look, I'll start with, it's always been competitive out there and our comments are, we are certainly seeing some increased competition in certain geographies and segments. And we tried to articulate that. As it relates to how we need to think about that going forward and whether others are investing, we need to make sure we're competitive every single day in every customer and we intended to do that.","I think the way we think about that has more to do with making sure that our overall offering is top-notch for our customers and that includes service, product and cost and pricing.","I don't think we are having any adverse impact based on our service. We continue to provide very high levels of service. And I would argue that we -- as we've talked about with some of the investments we're making on the operating expense side, we'll continue to put service as a top priority.","We know in this business that's critically important to our customers. If you don't have the product, it doesn't really matter what the price is. And so we -- it's really a broad-based approach John and therefore the answer is, there's not one specific thing. But we certainly don't want to be and won't be in a position to be uncompetitive, however that looks by customer type or geography.","John Ivankoe","Understood, thank you. And it's certainly often across many different industries being -- including foodservice distribution where corporate efficiencies can improve cost and margins for the corporate, but it can change or maybe some lower service levels for customers.","So in terms of how you measure service levels, can you go into some of those measurements in terms of how you've been able to maintain or even improve service levels across your customer base in the past couple of years? And that's the first point. ","And secondly, are there any changes? You've mentioned about investments in OpEx but are there any changes that you think you might need to make to get back and do things like day-of-the-week delivery whatever that case may be that a specific customer wants to regain some of their case volume?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes. So, a couple things. We -- you're referring to the corporate expense adjustments we made earlier in the calendar year our -- end of our -- start of our third quarter.","John Ivankoe","I am yes but also some of the broader business transformation efforts that even occurred before that.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes. So those things are really designed -- we've talked about those as non kind of operational or service-related investments or focus for us. And what we really try to do there is remove non-value-added expenses in our business. And so that -- when we talk about corporate expenses those are kind of tightening our belt here making sure we're doing all the things we need to do so that we can be competitive in the marketplace.","So nothing that we've done there would be necessarily affecting our serviceability or our ability to take care of our customers either from a pricing or a cost standpoint. Only we do is further improve our ability to do that. As it relates to how we service the service has been a hallmark for Sysco for a long time. And we look at everything. We have lots of metrics there.","But some examples of things we're doing to improve even our service level is to make sure that we have a way of communicating to our customers on a daily basis throughout the day where their delivery is as an example so that -- we have -- they have both an application and we use technology so they can look and see where their delivery is at.","But we also have ways of making sure we're staying more in touch with our drivers throughout the day, so we can remove any obstacles they might have to delivering that customer when they expect to be delivered. So when I talk about investments some of it's technology investments, some of it is resourcing investments as we've talked about. But we intend to make sure kind of for us table stakes is a great service offering and certainly delivery is a big part of that.","Joel Grade","Yes. And just -- John just as a summary of that. I would just think it's just really important to be clear that the work we've done had been again some streamlining of spend layers efficiencies in terms of administrative, but in no way shape or form are we somehow reducing investments in our ability to grow or to provide great service. I think that's just the really key takeaway here, I just wanted to reinforce.","John Ivankoe","Absolutely. And certainly for fiscal 2019, I think that was clearly the case that it was corporate driven. But some of the business transformation efforts before that were put into place would be with routing and purchasing and what have you and you could have had an impact on consumers that were actually delayed. And so that was the question that I was asking. If you were to go back versus several years ago and looked at your service levels after the variety of business transformation efforts that you've put forth whether you've been able to maintain or even increase service levels despite those changes, which have obviously been a big part of the efficiencies and profit growth that Sysco has seen.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Okay. Thanks for the clarity. If you're referring back to some of the ERP implementation work, yeah, we certainly had some fairly significant service challenges in those companies that had transitioned. We're well beyond that and our systems are operating well. And certainly that is a big driver of our ability to make sure that we've got the assets on the road to deliver our customers' expectations. So, yeah, we're a much different place than we would have been years ago and we feel very good about our ability to continue to improve in that area.","John Ivankoe","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judah Frommer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Judah Frommer","Hi good morning, guys. I was hoping, first you could help unpack the commentary on competition within the U.S. business between national, regional and then truly independent cases. You guys do probably have more chain business within your local case number than some competitors. And I don't want to put words in your mouth but it sounds like you're seeing that elevated competition on the chain side of things as opposed to independence. And can you help us with why that may be happening?","Tom Ben\u00e9","When we talk about regional accounts you might I guess -- I don't think oftentimes folks talk about them as changed, certainly I don't think talks about them as always changed. But some of the larger regional concepts is what we have talked about and we are referring to here. And so I'd say just -- we're just seeing increased competition.","Folks do I think look at that as a growth opportunity and certainly we have and just become more aggressive in going after those customers. Those are the type of accounts that Joel referred to earlier that are susceptible to some aggressive pricing as they look to change their offering, and we tend to be more balanced on our focus on those customers around -- certainly product pricing is important but so is our ability to service them and make sure that they have what they need to keep growing.","Judah Frommer","Okay. Could that potentially create a dynamic over the course of the year where you're seeing maybe cases slow down but, kind of, average profitability across your local customers improve if you are calling some relatively lower margin business within the local customer base?","Tom Ben\u00e9","You see a little of that today based on that mix, but that's certainly not our objective, meaning we're not trying to in those customers per se change the mix or certainly not looking to drive more pricing in our independent segment. We feel like we're positioned well there. So it's not about driving additional margin with local customers I guess is the key point I'm trying\u2026","Joel Grade","But I do think you're seeing a little bit of that now Judah when you see the -- our margin this past quarter continued to increase despite some -- a little bit higher inflation. And I think some of that is related to the fact that there's a bit of a shift in -- in terms of where the growth, which again a little more towards the -- a little move away from if you will some of the contracts.","Judah Frommer","Okay. And if I could just squeeze one more in. As you kind of lower the three-year operating income plan to $600 million there are things that within the three-year period have kind of worked out after you guys expressing concern namely the inbound freight and inflation seems to be in a supportive area.","Would you say that you're setting the current guide assuming that everything kind of continues as is Q4 and early into Q1, or would you say that there are kind of executional improvements you can make that could drive upside to the updated guide?","Tom Ben\u00e9","I think the way we talk about that is that -- someone referenced earlier is the big step-up from the prior two years and we know that we've got to be able to deliver that. So, we feel like it's a reasonable number based on all the things we need to execute, the topline that we've talked about continued improvement in our costs so that we are being competitive out there every day and ultimately making sure that the industry and the market continues at least at the pace that it's at now.","So, I think what we would say is we feel good about the number but I wouldn't go as far as assuming there's a bunch of upside in there based on where we sit today.","Judah Frommer","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Edward Kelly","Hey, thanks guys. Thanks for letting me back in. I just wanted to ask just one question here Tom and this relates to kind of beyond 2020. And just any thoughts on sort of the next three years when we'll think we'll get some color? Are you planning an Analyst Day at all later this year?","And kind of we take a step back and you hit your $600 million, you're still going to average 8% EBIT growth rate over this period in what was one of the toughest operating environments in the industry in quite a while. That's really hard to find a consumer. Just thoughts on how you're thinking about the longer-term outlook kind of beyond 2020 even if it's qualitatively at this point.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Well, appreciate you raising a couple of those points. So, we feel really good about the three-year number and to your point that's delivering really solid results. I think as we look ahead we have not set a date yet to do an Analyst Day or Investor Day but we are we're certainly talking about that and trying to think through when is the best time to do that given the current three-year plan ends.","I think the way we think about it is how do we continue to invest for the long term and drive what we would argue is top quartile results in the industry. And so it's a combination of the two.","We still have a lot of investments that we're making in the international sector. Even here in the U.S. we still believe there are things we need to continue to invest in around technology to put ourselves in the right place going forward. And obviously, M&A continues to be an opportunity as we think about how do we grow in the future.","So, probably not giving you what you want other than to say that we feel good about the performance we've had over the last couple of years. We feel like that's the kind of performance that we should be able to deliver going forward and we'll pick a day here in the not-too-distant future to be able to get together with you all and talk about that.","Edward Kelly","Great. Thank you.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Rebecca Scheuneman of Morningstar. Your line is open.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Good morning. So I want to switch gears a little bit and just ask about the international division. The profitability came in a bit better than we were expecting and at 4% operating margins in the quarter. I was just wondering is this a reflection of the Canadian reorganization and something that could be more sustained and possibly a new kind of base hitting forward, or was there something unique about the Q4 that will not -- that temporarily kind of boosted profitability that we should not expect to carry forward?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hi, Rebecca. Thanks for joining us. I wouldn't say, it was any unique things that happened in the quarter. I think it's a combination of things. The regionalization is a good example of where we need to be bringing more consistency across how we run the international businesses. And in the case of Canada, leveraging a model that given the geography there could help us drive more benefit on the cost side, because our costs were a bit out of whack.","As it relates to Europe, some of those same opportunities exist. And you heard me say in the prepared comments that we're starting to bring some of the same kind of capabilities that we have as a company and processes to some of these businesses that maybe historically haven't operated that way. So I think what we would say is that we feel good about where we ended the year. As we had said, though we -- it was a little bit rougher in the first half and we still have some work to do, I think balancing the investments we're making and the improvements you should see in our operating expenses over time in the international sector should be kind of a way to think about us going forward.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"19854":["Sysco (NYSE:SYY) Q1 2013 Earnings Call November  5, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Neil A. Russell - Vice President of Investor Relations","William J.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Neil A. Russell","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. On today's call, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner.

The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation and can also be found in the Investors section of our website. All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to case volume growth include total Broadline and SYGMA combined.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.","William J. DeLaney","Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported record sales of $11.1 billion for the first quarter and net earnings of $287 million. Earnings per share was $0.49 and adjusted earnings per share, representing our underlying business performance, was $0.58 or a 3.6% increase year-over-year. Sales grew 4.7% for the quarter, driven mainly by case volume growth of 2.9%, which contributed to the highest quarterly sales level in our history. While we believe restaurant spending trends may have softened somewhat as the quarter progressed, we are pleased with our overall volume growth during the quarter.","Acquisitions contributed 0.5% to sales growth during the first quarter, and we have completed or announced, thus far this fiscal year, the acquisition of companies with annual revenues totaling approximately $560 million, several of which expand our presence in geographic markets that we currently serve outside the United States. The acquisition environment is currently favorable, and we have a number of potential opportunities in the pipeline.","Product cost inflation moderated to 2.2% for the quarter, which is beneficial for both Sysco and our customers. While our growth in adjusted operating income was modest, we are encouraged by our expense management performance in most areas of the business. Specifically, we experienced lower cost per case in our selling and administrative areas as a result of enhanced business practices and effective leveraging of this quarter's volume growth. Conversely, higher fuel prices, labor shortages in some markets that we operate in and execution issues on our part led to higher year-over-year delivery cost per case. We are fully committed to both servicing our customers at a high level and improving productivity in all parts of our business as we move forward.","Turning to our business transformation efforts. We continue to make progress on deploying our new and enhanced technology platform. Just prior to last quarter's call, we converted our East Texas operating company to our new ERP system, our third location to go live. That conversion went very well, and we moved forward with our planned conversions at our operating companies in North Texas and West Texas last week. The early results in both locations are generally favorable, and we will continue to assess the performance of these 2 companies closely over the next several weeks. These 2 deployments represent a critical step in our technology implementation timeline for 2 reasons: One, it is the first incidence of multiple operating companies converting simultaneously; and two, the North Texas location is one of our largest operating companies and services a significant number of our corporate multi-unit customers.","We are pursuing a market-based approach for our rollout schedule. As a result, we expect to move forward with our next planned conversions in Texas and Louisiana in the coming quarters. As we prepare for these conversions, we are also evaluating the possibility of potentially accelerating our pace of deployment in fiscal 2014 and beyond.","I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many associates that are engaged in this project, including those at the operating companies that have or are preparing to convert to the new technology platform, as well as those at SBS, IT and across the company. The very real progress we are making in transforming our business would not be possible without their hard work and dedication to the success of this project.","I also want to acknowledge a new member of the team. We welcomed Wayne Shurts in October as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. Wayne brings extensive experience in both the food business, as well as the deployment of large technology projects. His capabilities complement our team as we work to increasingly leverage the opportunities technology can bring to our business.","Beyond the technology deployment portion of our business transformation journey, we are rapidly rolling out several other key initiatives. For example, we are building the foundation for enhanced customer insights through direct feedback from our customers, prospects and associates. We have also recently rolled out our first-ever customer relationship management or CRM platform, which will permit our sales managers and marketing associates to service their customers more effectively, operate more efficiently and accelerate our sales growth over time. In addition, we're exploring multiple ways to reduce our operating cost structure and have recently identified significant potential savings in our IT support function.","Regarding Hurricane Sandy. While it is difficult for us to accurately estimate the full impact to our customers, I do want to provide you with some relevant updates: First, our employees are safe; second, we know that many of our customers were impacted more severely than us, and we're doing everything we can to help them; third, there was no substantial damage to any of our facilities. While we did have some intermittent power outages, our backup generators operated effectively, and as such, our inventory is secure; fourth, due to on-site fueling capabilities, we have adequate fuel supplies to make deliveries; and finally, obviously, there were initially some road closures and power outages that limited some deliveries. However, our operations have recovered relatively well, and we are ready to serve our customers as they are able to get back to business as usual.","In closing, it seems appropriate and timely to remind all of us that Sysco is in the midst of a great deal of change. Not only is this change necessary at this point in our 40-plus year history as a public company, but it will result in a much stronger Sysco for years to come. We will build upon our industry leadership position by becoming a much leaner, more agile and easier company for our customers and suppliers to do business with. We are most fortunate to have 47,000 highly committed and capable associates to lead us through this exciting period in Sysco's history.","Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the first quarter.","Robert C. Kreidler","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $11.1 billion or an increase of 4.7% compared to the prior year, driven by case volume growth of 2.9% and food cost inflation of 2.2%. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.5%, and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.3%.","Gross profit in the first quarter increased 2.9%. While gross margin in the first quarter declined 33 basis points to 18.1%, it's important to note that this performance significantly improved as the quarter progressed. Operating expenses increased $87 million or 6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the prior-year period, driven mainly by a $41 million increase in business transformation expenses and a $30 million increase in salaries and related costs. As a result, operating income decreased $31 million or 6%. Net earnings for the first quarter were $287 million, a decrease of $16 million or 5.3% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.49, a 3.9% decrease compared to the prior year.","As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it's important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes $6 million in certain items such as severance but also excludes business transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 3.2%, adjusted operating income increased 2%, adjusted net earnings grew 3.2%; and adjusted EPS grew 3.6% to $0.58 per share.","As Bill mentioned, the acquisition environment is currently quite favorable, and we have been very active in this area. To date in fiscal 2013, we have completed or announced 6 acquisitions of annual revenues totaling approximately $560 million, including 2 transactions which occurred subsequent to the end of the first quarter. As a result, we expect to exceed our goal of adding 0.5% to 1% in sales from acquisitions this fiscal year, and we still have a number of additional potential transactions in the pipeline that we are working to complete over the next few quarters.","Building on our successful 2009 acquisition of Pallas Foods, we've recently added 2 new distributors to our family of companies in Ireland. We acquired Crossgar Foodservice, a Broadline distributor, during the quarter, and in early October completed the acquisition of the foodservice distribution division of Keelings, a specialty produce company. Both of these companies have great people, and we are excited to add them to our Sysco family. We believe that building a market leadership presence in Ireland similar to our efforts in the U.S. and Canada provides us strategic advantages and offers our existing and potential customers a broader choice of products and services.","In addition to Ireland, we continue to expand in Canada. Over the last year, we have been strategically building our presence in the province of Qu\u00e9bec. This is a well-populated area of Canada, home to roughly 8 million people, and we believe we have significant opportunities to increase our market share here. As a result, we have completed several acquisitions in Montr\u00e9al, including a company specializing in Italian imports; a meat processor and distributor; and a seafood company.","In addition, in late October, we announced our agreement to acquire Distagro, the foodservice division of a Montreal-based grocery retailer. This is our largest acquisition so far this year and is designed to complement our growing presence in this highly competitive market. The Distagro transaction is subject to Canadian regulatory approval, and we expect to complete that acquisition by the end of the calendar year.","Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the first quarter, project expenses totaled $78 million, and we capitalized $3 million related to the project. In the prior-year quarter, project expenses totaled $37 million, and we capitalized $45 million related to the project. As Bill mentioned, considering the successful implementation of our third operating company, and dependent upon how the next few weeks go for North Texas and West Texas, we have begun to explore what is necessary to potentially accelerate the deployment schedule beginning next year.","We continue to make progress on our other key business transformation initiatives as well. In the first quarter, we announced our decision to outsource a portion of our IT resources to a third party. The changes in the organization will result in significant financial benefit over time and is included in the total business transformation benefits that we expect to achieve. Due to our progress on this and other initiatives, we believe we are on track with the business transformation financial objectives we provided at Investor Day last year.","Turning to our cash flow performance. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $213 million, a decline of $42 million, driven mainly by increased tax payments and lower earnings, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization. The IRS settlement payments we paid last year will begin to impact the year-over-year operating cash flow comparison beginning in the second quarter. As a reminder, during fiscal 2012, we paid a total of $212 million in settlement payments, none of which was paid in the first quarter, $106 million that was paid in the second quarter and $53 million that was paid in each of the last 2 quarters.","Capital expenditures totaled $156 million for the first quarter this year compared to $227 million last year. The $71 million decline in capital spending is driven in part by a reduction in business transformation capital spend and in part by a reduction in the number of major facilities -- facility projects this year compared to last.","As a result of the reduction in capital spending, free cash flow doubled year-over-year to $58 million. We expect the effect of lower capital spending this year, combined with the completion of the IRS payment last year, will result in an improvement in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.","Before we close, I wanted to update you on our fuel guidance for the year. Our process each quarter is to project the impact of fuel prices using, among other inputs, forward fuel prices. While we are hearing continued discussion in the market about a potential decline in fuel prices, there has been little impact yet in the forward prices. As a result, our current and projected rates for fuel had increased since our last forecast, which result in an estimated increase in fuel expense for the year of $10 million to $20 million.","In closing, while fiscal year 2013 is a critical year for us as we begin -- as we work towards significant milestones in our ERP deployments and begin to realize benefits from several areas of our business transformation plan, we are beginning to see a consistent uptick in momentum underlying our efforts. This is evident in the increased confidence throughout the organization, in particular as it relates to the deployment of our new technology platform. I believe this favorably positions us to take advantage of opportunities to grow our market share and expand upon our leadership position in the industry.","With that, operator, we'll take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Karen Short, BMO Capital Markets.","Ryan Gilligan","This is actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. We wanted to ask you about the inventory opportunity in terms of reducing SKU counts in your categories and the progress you've made so far, specifically in the categories that you've approached already. What has been the response from customers and what has been the impact on cost of goods?","William J. DeLaney","This is Bill. I'd say on the SKU opportunities, we have kind of a 2-pronged approach right now. We, from an operational standpoint, have a lot of activity going on in our operating companies where, basically, it's what I would characterize as good old-fashioned inventory management where we see opportunities to reduce SKUs that are not critical to customers and which are slow-moving, then we do have -- brought a lot of focus to that particular an issue. So we've actually made good progress on that side of things. And generally, that's being handled well with customers. And any time you have a situation where you're reducing a SKU that -- or taking away a SKU that sells, often there will be some type of discussion with the salesperson or the customer. But we're working through those and I feel pretty good about that. As part of our lower costing products initiative, we've talked about exploring category management. And that will bring a much more integrated and smoother approach to how do we optimize our assortments throughout the enterprise and manage SKUs more effectively at the same time. So that work has not yet begun in terms of being live, but we're doing a lot of development work on that front as well.","Ryan Gilligan","Great. And can you talk about the cadence of sales trends throughout the quarter and into the second?","William J. DeLaney","I would characterize sales trends pretty much what I said in my prepared comments. We certainly read a lot from you folks in terms of softening in the restaurant industry, and we think we've seen some of that as the quarter's gone along, and that's continued here somewhat in the early part of the second quarter. So the good news for us, and this is just something we always try to remind everybody, restaurants are obviously a big part of that $225 billion market, but we have a lot of other business beyond the restaurant business with colleges, universities, health care, hotels, basically any establishment where food is prepared and eaten away from home. So we\u2019ve made some good strides with some of those customers, and that's serving us well right now.","Ryan Gilligan","Great. And, sorry, last question, just to go back to the opportunity with reducing cost of goods. The estimate that you outlined at the Analyst Day, could that possibly be conservative, or how are you guys thinking about that right now?","William J. DeLaney","It's not conservative until we beat it, so I think at this point, that's our best guidance for you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So Bill, a couple of things. One of the reasons gross margin had declined over the last 1, 1.5 years, had been some proactive price investments you guys had made. Where do you stand on that? And assuming that, that's moderating, is there a possibility here that gross margin turns positive some time in '13?","William J. DeLaney","I certainly hope so, John. We're pleased that the trends have improved, but obviously, they're still below last year. And I think in this type of market where the inflation has moderated, as we called out, we would expect to continue to see improvement in those trends. So we're highly focused on that is about all I can tell you. We've done a lot of work internally, John, outside of the big initiatives in terms of providing what we call more market-relevant costing to our operating companies through our purchasing organization here. And I think as we continue to provide better and more market-oriented, market-relevant transfer costing, and that gives the OpCos a better cost base to price off of. So there's a lot of different things going on there. So I'm going to answer it similar to your earlier question. We need to improve, continue to improve in that area. And as we get closer to year-over-year being flat, then I'll be more optimistic about improving year-over-year.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","You also talked about the acquisition environment being very favorable. Now is that -- I guess it's a combination of these 2 things, but in terms of quality of companies available versus the price that you're having to pay, is 1 of those 2 much more favorable than the other?","William J. DeLaney","That's an interesting question. I'll start and let our acquisition guy here probably clean it up here a little bit. I would say there's a couple of things going on right now. I think the environment is good. There's a little bit, I think, of a year-end phenomenon going on, with concerns about tax code and that kind of thing, so I think that has helped at least in this country. But I would also tell you that this interest rate phenomena, I think, works both ways. So for us, it helps the deals look more attractive, obviously, since our borrowing costs will be a lot less. But the sellers know that as well. So I think for good value in terms of quality companies, you're going to pay an appropriate multiple today, and we're willing to do that because we can see the benefits financially and otherwise. So hopefully, that's a response. So I think that's a better environment, but we're not stealing any companies right now. We're talking about good companies and pay reasonable value.","Robert C. Kreidler","I don't really have anything to add, Bill. Bill kind of couched it. The only thing I'll amplify is we have seen substantial increase in inbound phone calls because of the potential for tax rate increases in the beginning of next year. So you\u2019ve got a little bit of that rush to get it done phenomena. But we're fortunate; we're seeing a lot of good companies that haven't been interested in talking before coming forward and wanting to have discussions, and some of those will result in transactions soon and some may result in transactions later. But we're happy to talk to everybody.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Then last on ERP. So Chris, you said none of the financial objectives have changed. I assume the costs and benefits you'd outlined for '13, none of those have changed?","Robert C. Kreidler","That is correct.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then accelerating it in '14. How many of OpCos do you think you have done by the end of fiscal '13? And then what's the capacity, if you look at it per week, per month, however you want to look at it, the capacity the organization has to do those? And if you do accelerate it, what do you do to enable you to accelerate it?","Robert C. Kreidler","Well, John, first, I mean, our guidance for the year was 5 to 15 companies, and we're certainly comfortable with that guidance. If I were going to shade it, I mean on the pace that we're at, as long as things continue to go well, I think we'll be towards the higher end of that guidance. But we're very comfortable with that. As Bill said, and I repeated, we are looking at now what it would take to accelerate that based upon us starting to feel better about our deployment capabilities. I think it's premature to give you more guidance as to how fast we could go or how many we could do at a time until we finish that work.","Operator","And up next is Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could we maybe go back to ERP? And I was hoping you could maybe give us a little bit more color around the decision that you're potentially making, I guess, to accelerate the rollout. So what are you seeing today in the most recent rollouts versus what you've seen over the first couple that gives you a little bit more confidence? And then the second part of this question is if you did accelerate it, and I know, obviously, there's a lot of variability around the details, but what would that mean to the 2015 guidance that you gave at the Analyst Day?","William J. DeLaney","I'll tell you what, I'm going to try to do a better job than Chris, and then I'll let him go back and do this all over again. We -- I think the biggest thing we're seeing is confidence, I mean, to be somewhat qualitative. We -- I mean I think our people are -- we've done a few of these now, right? So we've done 5 now. And each time we do it, both the teams on the deployment side, as well as the local operating teams, the SBS teams, everyone, it's familiar, and it's things we\u2019ve -- we get better each time and so I think confidence coming from improved performance in terms of the deployment aspect of it. In terms of what we need to see, we need to ramp up some resources to be prepared to move at a more accelerated rate. And we need to see really good transition into the operationalizing of the ERP platform as well. So those are all things, as I said and that Chris has alluded to, that we're assessing for over the next several weeks following these last 2 deployments.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, I want to go back. I mean, at Investor Day, we actually talked about the potential to accelerate once we proved a few things and built up our own confidence. We just said we'd be looking for that opportunity. And I think all we\u2019re really pointing out right now is we are now starting to look more seriously at the opportunity to accelerate based upon some early confidence. The impact of that, I obviously can't quote you numbers, but conceptually, the impact of that is we will accelerate expense, obviously, inside of the range that we had previously disclosed, and that would also ultimately accelerate some of the benefits that were post-2015. So if you recall when we talked about the benefits from business transformation, we said there would be additional benefits beyond the 3-year guidance that we were putting up on the slide and on the screen during Investor Day. So this would allow some of that to come into that 3-year period, but we'd also accelerate the expense to get it done.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then you did mention the $10 million to $20 million increase in the fuel charges. Is that a gross or net basis because you do have surcharges, I think down on a lot...","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, that's the fuel expense, not the surcharge. I don't really anticipate the surcharge increasing very dramatically, so that's the fuel expense. But ultimately, if the surcharge isn't going to grow, that's going to end up being a net expense as well.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And another question is on inventory. Inventory was up about 11% this quarter. Inflation's lower; you're doing some SKU actualization although I don't know how much of that's in the numbers. But could you maybe just help us understand why inventories is up that much?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, first -- I mean, we are moving more cases or still a significant amount of new cases. We were up 2.9%. Secondly, those acquisitions that we bring online also bring on additional inventory as well. You still have a little bit of inflation in there; it's not nearly as much as before. But every quarter, we \u2013 well, actually every month, we will analyze how much of our increase in inventory was due to sales versus DSOs. And I will tell you, we're still not hitting on all cylinders on the DSOs. We have opportunities for improvement there. But most of our inventory increase was driven by sales growth.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then my last question for you is a little bit more bigger picture related to CapEx. Your CapEx guidance for this year is certainly down relative to last year because there's less spending, I guess, on business transformation. But if you look back over time, you've had years where you were $400 million to $500 million in CapEx. You're still, I think, in the range, if I remember, $600 million, $650 million. Could you maybe just help us understand what the difference is even where you are now versus what that used to be? And is there an opportunity to get CapEx lower in the not-too-distant future?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, it's a topic we've spent quite a bit of time talking about around here. I think the answer is yes, we can bring CapEx down lower. We've taken the first step of that, which is to look historically at some metrics for capital versus sales, for example. We talked about that at Investor Day and what's the right percentage, and I think we outlined 1% to 1.2% of sales. It's not perfect, but it's a good guideline. Step one is to get us back comfortably into that range, and then we'll see where we can go from there. But the answer to the first part of your question is we're a bigger company than we were 4 or 5 years ago. We've got more facilities. We had to -- during the crisis, we didn't spend a lot of capital, so we did some make-up spending afterwards because, frankly, we had built up some pent-up demand, and we needed additional space. So there was some catch-up there. Now we've got those facilities to maintain, we've got additional fleet from all of the case growth that we've realized over the last 4 or 5 years. So we're going to spend more capital to maintain that fixed asset base. But all of us believe that we've got more opportunities for efficiency.","William J. DeLaney","Yes, the only thing I would add is Chris has done a really good job over the last few months of helping us make cash flow and asset optimization, asset management optimization in one of our key areas of strategic focus. We had 3 big facilities that came on board this past year. We have one big facility that's going to come on board in the current year in Southern California. Fleet replacement, those trucks and power units cost more today; significantly more than they did 2 or 3 and even certainly 5 years ago. So there's a fair amount of inflation on the construction side and on the fleet side if you go back and compare what we're doing today versus just a few years ago.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just one quick follow-up, and I'm done here. The cost savings that you guided to for the year, I think, was in this like $150 million range. How much of that did you get in this quarter?","Robert C. Kreidler","So your guidance is approximately correct. We said total run rate benefit at the end of 3 years $550 million to $650 million, and we'd realize about 25% of that in the first year so your math certainly holds up. We believe we're on track for that. We're not really going to give quarterly guidance as to what we received. We certainly have internal forecast by category of initiative, and we're tracking those very carefully. We're ahead in some areas; we're behind in some areas; we're on track in other areas. But all in, we're feeling pretty good about the number for this year, and that's why we've not changed our forecast for that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Greg Badishkanian of Citi.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Alvin Concepcion in for Greg. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the slowdown in the restaurant industry trends throughout the quarter and early part of the second quarter. Is there a major difference you're seeing out there between casual dining chain customers and independents? And also, is there any color that you're hearing from your customers on the sales environment? Are they increasingly more concerned and are they making some adjustments to pricing as a result?","William J. DeLaney","Let me take the first one and if I forget get the second one, let's come back to that. I'll tell you what; can you just give me the first one again? I want to make sure I answer it right.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sure. Are you seeing any major differences out there between casual dining chain customers and the independents?","William J. DeLaney","Well, first of all, I guess the way we look at it, there's a lot of independents that are casual dining restaurants. Relative to chains, I'd say actually the data we're seeing right now is that there's been some growth with independents, modest. It's comparable to the chain growth right now after a couple of years of where independents have been flat to down and chains have been flat to up. So from that standpoint, that might be a promising sign. We're seeing the same data you all see. Sometimes, we're reading your data. I think overall, there is still very, very modest growth there, but the trends have softened, and it's not what it was a few months ago. Most of the growth seems to be on the quick-serve side and the casuals are holding their own. Upscale is up a little bit, but I still think that might be off of a relatively easy comparison. The only other color is I think traffic has softened some, but the price of the check, so to speak, is -- continues to grow modestly. So we still think there's some very modest growth there; it's not just at the rate of what we saw here just a few months ago. And again, we're splitting hairs here. It's not like it was robust growth a few months ago. So I just want to reiterate our point. We feel like we're doing a good job being responsive and proactive in those areas. We cover all segments of the restaurant industry. But again, we also have a strong presence in the nonrestaurant side of the foodservice industry, and we're doing a really nice job there as well.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's great color. And I apologize if I missed this, but in regards to the sequential improvement in the gross margin, I'm assuming moderating inflation was a contributor to that. Did you also see improvements in the competitive pressures in the quarter relative to last quarter?","William J. DeLaney","I think, clearly, the moderating of inflation was a big part of that. And we saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter. I think inflation came down into the 3s, and then this quarter in the 2s. So there's -- as I've explained before, I don't want to sound too esoteric or too passive here. There's certain amount of math in the relationship between inflation and gross margin. So yes, we've benefited from that. But our margins were still down 0.3 of a point, and so a little bit of that, I think, was customer mix, where our contract customers have grown a little faster than our street customers right now. We did see our brand grow, which is encouraging; that's a good thing on margins. So, yes, the competitive pricing environment remains very acute. But at this point, this is really on us to find ways to continue to strike the right balance between growing our business with our customers and still driving out the right type of gross profit dollar growth.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And did you see any changes in the environment into October?","William J. DeLaney","Yes, I would say it softened further in October.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","With competitive pressures, I'm talking about.","William J. DeLaney","That's almost impossible to gauge on a monthly basis.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Bill, if you can give us what your buyers are saying about inflation right now and how are you feeling about the center-of-the plate proteins in particular given the drought we had this year?","William J. DeLaney","I think it's mixed. I believe we saw a fair amount of inflation in poultry this quarter, and meat's a big category for us, Mark, so I think that was 5% or 6%. So it's hard to get a great handle on where that goes from here, but I would expect that to stay up. Seafood, not as much. Dairy, on the other hand, we saw a meaningful deflation there in dairy and dairy, and a little bit in produce as well deflation. So actually, dairy and produce are probably 2 of your most volatile categories, and so they'll go back and forth. So right now, I would say it hasn't changed a lot from what we're showing here for the quarter. And I wouldn't expect it to change dramatically in the next few weeks or month or 2. But also, we're watching it really close because, obviously, there's other fundamentals out there in terms of the drought that we experienced throughout summer and what that may mean second half of the year in terms of both products and livestock and all that type of thing. So bottom line is it's in a good place for us and our customers right now. I do think there are some pressures building that over the second part of the year we could see a pickup again.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just to follow up a little bit on your last comments there on the gross margins getting a little better here as the quarter progressed. Is that because your efforts to manage inflation were a little better, or that you backed off of some of your planned discounting? Where do you think the improvement came from?","William J. DeLaney","Well, I think we managed it somewhat better, but we're still not managing as well as we need to. I'm just being straight with you there. But I also think, like I said, just the math of inflation, when your costs are only going up 2%, it's not as difficult to manage the pricing off of that than when they're going up 7% or 8% in some categories.","Operator","And up next is John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones, I think. You mentioned, Bill, in your prepared remarks something that Sysco was doing that was driving up the cost of delivery in the quarter, maybe -- I don't know if it was a mistake that you made, or maybe there were some initiatives. I mean -- I guess what were those? And are those now solved for the current quarter?","William J. DeLaney","Well, let me balance this a little bit, John. What I said is I felt we did a really good job on the SG&A side. And unfortunately -- and we lowered our cost per case there, which is a key metric for us. And to just have flat cost per case in this business is pretty hard to do, so we were pleased with what we did there. We gave a lot of it back on the delivery side. Some of that was fuel; some of it was some labor shortages in markets that are particularly robust right now, and where some of the oil is being drilled and energy and that type of thing. So I'm sure we saw the benefit of that on the sales and gross profit line. And there's just some things we didn't execute as well as could have in several markets, and I\u2019ll leave that in-house, if you're okay with that. And look, we're running a business here, and I wish on a given day or a given quarter, we could execute with perfection, and we did a lot of things well here, I would say, to characterize this quarter. I would've liked to see us perform a little better on the gross profit line and manage our delivery expenses a little more consistently across the company, and we're working on both of those.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then secondly, I mean, obviously, you're outperforming the broad foodservice distribution industry as would be evidenced by restaurant sales that -- and especially in casual dining is actually seeing shrinking traffic. So -- I mean, what is your sense that -- where is your share coming from at this point? I mean, is it coming from some of the larger competitors, or is it the very fragmented industry that you see out there that may finally see some forced consolidation as traffic remains weak and fuel costs goes up for operators that already have extremely low margins?","William J. DeLaney","Great question; hard to answer since we don't see the other guys' numbers. But my best judgment is that more of it is coming from the smaller, more fragmented part of the competitive landscape and that the larger players are probably holding their own or maybe picking up a little share.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I mean, obviously, we've been talking a lot about acquisitions, but I mean are you beginning to see at the local level some consolidation of the smaller operators? Is there kind of some supply that's quietly coming out that we wouldn\u2019t necessarily see here?","William J. DeLaney","Yes, I think we are, and that's what we alluded to in comments on the acquisition environment being somewhat better. The challenge for you guys it's there's thousands of them, so it's hard for you to see it in terms of how our numbers roll up or the industry numbers. But the acquisition pipeline we're talking about is more in that middle to lower end of the competitive food chain, so to speak.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ajay Jain of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","My main questions were already asked earlier, but I wanted to just get some clarification on whether the severance costs this latest quarter are related to the cost reduction activities that were already contemplated for the year so even to the extent that your anticipated cost savings are at least somewhat headcount-driven, I'm just wondering if the severance represents some upfront investment in terms of the cost reduction goals or if it's totally outside the scope of the planned cost reduction activities that you talked about at your Analyst Day?","Robert C. Kreidler","Ajay, this is Chris, and you nailed it. It is related to the initiatives, primarily related to the IT initiative that I talked about so there was a fairly large chunk of it this quarter. We'll probably have some more of it in Q2. But it's an upfront investment to get to the run rate savings.","Operator","Up next is Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Looking at the segment numbers sales, could you talk about just SYGMA, why it slowed? Was that what's going on with those customers or did you anniversary some business?","William J. DeLaney","We anniversaried some business, I've never used that term before, but I like that one, Andy. So we've had pretty good growth in the segment the last couple of years, and the key there generally is picking up a new customer and, obviously, not losing any big ones. So we haven't picked up a large new customer here over the last year. And we've lost a little business; some of that we wanted lose and some of it, not so much. Bottom line is SYGMA is going to be a little more volatile compared to the Broadline in terms of ups and downs.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And with -- we don't see the inflation number by segment. But when I look at SYGMA going down and much more than sequentially in terms of sales growth in Broadline. Does -- what can we -- can you tell us if Broadline case movement was actually -- I'm sure it was better than the combined number, but was it a lot better; was it flattish sequentially or versus down the way it was for the combined 2 segments?","William J. DeLaney","I want to be careful here, Andy, because you know a lot of our people listen to these calls, and we're working hard at kind of this One Sysco mentality here. But when you look at our numbers, as the Broadline goes is how the company goes. So there's never going to be much of a difference between the Broadline numbers and the overall numbers, and there wasn't in this case either.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Fair enough. Okay. And my last question is on business transformation. Kind of simply put, what are the things you're seeing that are -- have the executive -- your folks contemplating accelerating it; what's working?","William J. DeLaney","Well, we had a similar question earlier. I'll give you my best shot at that and let Chris jump in here.","Robert C. Kreidler","Maybe I can help.","William J. DeLaney","Yes, Chris can help me this time. Seriously, look, we've obviously had some bumps along the way here, but we've done 5 of these now. We've continued to bring in folks to strengthen our team at all levels, and we're getting better at all parts of it, the prep work, the programming, the change management work, the training. And as a result, each rollout on these conversion weekends has been a little bit better. East Texas went very well. We've had good results business-wise since then. And so as you see that, people gain confidence, we gain confidence, and so that's the first step, is to make sure that you can handle the conversion right, get the deployment right and begin to hand it off to the business in a way that they run with it. And -- but you can't wait until you're year end to it to kind of have these thoughts. So where we're at right now is evaluating the opportunity to accelerate as we get more comfortable that we're executing at a level that's appropriate, and that we can mobilize the resources that it\u2019s going to take to do that. Chris?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, I think about this in 2 different components. There's the confidence level on being able to roll it out, so the actual implementation and then there's how does it work after the fact. And while those are tied together in our minds, they are kind of distinct parts of the equation. We're definitely focused in this particular answer to this question on the first part of this, which is, are we gaining more confidence in being able to roll it out? So I spent the weekend in North Texas during their rollout last weekend. And when you're actually sitting there watching the large number of people roll this thing out and implement it and it goes incredibly smooth, and yes, there are issues that come up right and left, but the team have gotten so adept at handling the issues. And frankly, they're smaller issues than we were seeing in the other ones, that just gives you more confidence that we know how to roll this thing out. And at the same time, we were doing it in another operating company at the same time. First time we've tried that. That gives you more confidence that we're going to be able to roll this thing out a little bit faster. Now we still have to get through a couple other hurdles to make sure that we're going to be ready to do that, and that's the work that we're beginning now. But I'd say that's more color on the whole confidence notion, and that's what's causing us to, at least, look at what it would take to go faster.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And on the second -- that's sort of where I was -- that answer was very clarifying. So the second way you look at it, the benefits, is there any -- is there enough data for you internally to also feel that more confidence about that, or is it really just more about the first part, the execution of the rollout?","Robert C. Kreidler","Well, if you remember some of our previous conversations around the benefits, we were only looking at the hard dollar benefits, which primarily are driven by reduction in staff and headcount out in the field as we roll these things out. So as we go back and we look at what was our pre-rollout headcount, what did we anticipate getting to after the rollout by a certain amount of time? We're getting close to our targets there. And the first 3 being pilots and the second 2 -- or the first 2 being pilots; and then East Texas and the second 2 just having gone, it's a little early to get a complete read on that, but we are getting the headcount reduction benefits that we had anticipated getting in almost all areas. And the exceptions, frankly, are areas where as we went through the process, we decided that we might have been a little aggressive and -- in our initial estimations and we've pushed back a little bit since that time. So it's too early to read everything. We're not going to quote a bunch of numbers, but we're feeling pretty good about at least the hard dollar savings that we talked about publicly.","William J. DeLaney","Yes, Andy, I'd just take a moment here to remind everyone that a lot of what we talked about in May and what we've shared since then is because we have had some delays here, we are finding other ways to accelerate these benefits. We're not waiting to deploy this thing in 70 U.S. companies and then Canada to get the benefits as we originally designed them in the business case. So when we talk about improvement in SG&A and when you look at that roadmap to 2015 that we put out there in SG&A and operations, some of those benefits were part of the original case, and we're going to drive those out now, and muscle through them where we need to. And then to Chris' point, there'll certainly be some additional benefits as we deploy and we're able to become more efficient post-deployment. But there's 2 paths right now: One is the deployment path, and the other is muscling through these cost savings even without the system.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we turn next to Meredith Adler of Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit, go back to the subject of inflation. And maybe just talk a little bit about what you're working on. I think you talked about some systems that would help pass along and were priced better, and I'm sure that relates to inflation. So maybe talk about where you feel you haven't done as good a job and how you see that improving and how quickly can it improve.","William J. DeLaney","Okay, I'm not sure what we've talked about in terms of pricing and in inflation, but what I try to share with you, Meredith, is as we've said very consistently for as long as I can remember, if we could keep inflation in this 2% to 3% zone that we've had the last couple of quarters, and if it was relatively comparable across all categories, that's just a much better environment for our customers and, therefore, it's a much better environment for us. People can handle modest increases. Maybe not as easily as I could 3 or 5 years ago before some of the challenges in the economy and the marketplace, but certainly better than they can a 5%, 6% to 7% increase. We have pretty good systems today. I want to be really clear. We have good systems today on how to manage inflation. And from that standpoint, I think we do a decent job with it. I think the art to this thing right now is to, again, strike the right balance as we manage the business at that district level, at the OpCo level and then even here on how we interact with large customers and suppliers. How do we strike the right balance between profitable growth and pricing? And so along the way, we have certainly explored some different systems and scientific pricing modules, and we continue to assess those. And I think we will get better in that arena over time. And we certainly can see analytically that there's probably an opportunity to have less variability in our pricing. And we'll continue to work on those opportunities. But I would say to you, for now, it's kind of good old-fashioned management on our part and attention to detail and striking that proper balance between growth and profitability.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I guess when you have said, you did say it on this call about could've done a better job in terms -- you're talking about finding a good balance between profitable growth and pricing when you say could've done a better job?","William J. DeLaney","Yes, I'm just saying we, as a management team throughout Sysco, I think could've done a better job. We did better than we did last quarter, and we certainly did better than we did a year ago from a trend standpoint. But what I'm really trying to say is we see opportunity out there where we could perform even better, and that's what we're working on internally.","Operator","And we have time for one final question today, and we'll go to Erin Lash of Morningstar.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You commented that the acquisition environment was very favorable. I wonder -- I was wondering if you could touch on whether there were any differences that you're seeing between the acquisition environment in the U.S. versus internationally?","Robert C. Kreidler","Well, to the extent that in the U.S. we mentioned the kind of tax rush, if you will, to get some of these transactions done by the end of the year, that does not necessarily apply to foreign acquisitions unless that their ownership may be U.S.-based. So we're not seeing, I'll say, quite as many. The markets are -- just talking about Ireland, there aren't as many players in Ireland. We tend to know who they are, and I think these were very targeted, strategic transactions for us to broaden our appeal to the customer base there and also broaden our network. So we've kind of picked what we wanted there, I guess, if we could say, and done it strategically. Canada, we spoke a lot about or at least I talked about our strategic desires in and around Qu\u00e9bec, Montr\u00e9al. And so again, I think the team was very thoughtful up there about which acquisitions we wanted to go after. But in terms of the pipeline, we've got stuff coming to us, I'd say, in all 3 markets, and we look at it, we evaluate it, we first decide whether it makes strategic sense and we start looking at whether the valuations are going to make sense to both us and the sellers and see if we can get a deal done.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just finally, I was wondering if you could provide just a little bit more detail. You alluded to the execution issues that you're facing. I was wondering if those were in markets where you've already rolled out business transformation, or in markets that haven't been touched by those efforts yet.","William J. DeLaney","Erin, it\u2019s Bill. No, they were just -- I'm just trying to give you all some color. When you look over our business and you're talking about roughly 70 operating companies in the U.S. and another 10 or 12 large companies in Canada plus Ireland, the beauty of this business is there's always things that we're doing well and we can do even better. And then there's always going to be situations where we're not doing and performing quite as well as we would like. So the point is, is I can tell you without, from where I sit and where our management team sits, that there are several markets where we probably could have managed the operations side of the business a little bit better, and we will. And we're very focused on that. And so I share that with you basically to be candid, but also to illustrate the nature of the business, that it's one of continuous improvement. With that said, we did a nice job on the SG&A side. And so from the standpoint of looking at it overall, that's why you saw in my prepared comments from an overall expense management standpoint, the expenses in the core business grew about 3%. That's pretty good. We think we can do as well as that or better going forward.","Operator","And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to the management team for any final comments.","Neil A. Russell","Thank you, everyone, for joining us. Have a good day.","Operator","And this concludes today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions]","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Ben\u00e9.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Good morning, everyone and thank you as always for joining us. This morning I'll provide an overview of Sysco's first quarter results. Discuss the macro environment that we are currently operating in and walk through our operating performance including key drivers impacting our performance across each of our business segment. I'll then turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer who will discuss our financial results in more detail.","Sysco's overall financial results announced this morning reflect improve year-over-year operating performance, driven by a variety of initiatives across each of our four strategic priorities. Due to some temporary headwinds, including decreased inflation across some categories and the impact of Hurricane Florence to hit the southeast late in the quarter, as well as some additional and more persistent operating expense pressures, we had mixed business results across the business. From a top-line perspective, we generated sales of $15.2 billion, a 3.9% increase compared to the same period last year, driven by a very strong US Broadline case growth of 5.7%. But offset by slower growth and our international businesses.","Additionally, we saw our gross profit increase by 3.9%. Adjusted operating expense growth of 3.6%; adjusted operating income increased 5.1% and adjusted EPS increased $0.17 to $0.91. Overall, our fundamentals for the quarter were solid and as an organization we remain focused and working closely with our suppliers and customers to deliver discipline, profitable growth to enable the achievement of our long-term objectives.","Looking at broader economic and industry trends in the US, overall consumer confidence remains high which is driven healthy consumer spending. During the quarter, according to black box intelligence, the restaurant industry saw improved performance particularly in same store sales growth despite lower same-store traffic. In addition, other data points reflect positive implications for longer-term consumer demand such as faster than anticipated growth in US GDP of 3.5% and the strength in the labor markets, all factors that historically have been positive signs for the foodservice industry.","Economic outlet in our international geographies remains somewhat mixed. Canada's economy is performing well and foodservice sales are projected to continue growing. In the UK, GDP and household consumption are both forecasted to grow over the next year, but consumer sentiment remains negative in the market with further closures of restaurants and concerns about the food supply chain being driven by continued Brexit negotiations. The remainder of the European market continues to experience healthy foodservice growth and positive economic conditions due to improving consumer confidence.","As it relates to the current operating environment at Sysco and some of the impacts affecting our business, we are seeing cost challenges specifically driven by the tightening labor market in the US and a slowdown in growth in some of our international businesses, which I will address in the various segment results. Given some of these ongoing challenges, we are accelerating our focus on managing our overall costs and having placed multiple initiatives across the business that will drive cost improvement and enhance customer service over the next several quarters.","A few of these initiatives include the finance transformation roadmap which we originally discussed at our Investor Day in December. This initiative increased centralization and standardization of our end-to-end global finance processes and workflow, and utilizes digital automation on a more modern finance platform to improve efficiency. This also allows for increased globalization of certain roles, helping to lower our administrative costs. Job changes have recently begun and we expect to see financial benefit from this initiative to ramp up as planned over the next few quarters.","Smart spending which is focused on reducing our overall G&A spend by taking a detailed and accelerated look at indirect spend categories to drive productivity and savings. This effort is providing unprecedented visibility, ownership and performance management in all areas of our business. And third, the Canadian regionalization which is focused on streamlining our back-office administrative support for our Canadian operations, while maintaining an acute focuses on our customer. This effort has already commenced and will contribute to increased cost savings as we move forward.","I would like to transition now to our first quarter results by business segment beginning with US Foodservice Operations. We are pleased with our top-line result and local case growth but as mentioned we continue to see significant cost challenges. The results are as follows. Sales for the first quarter were $10.4 billion, an increase of 5.6%; gross profit grew 5.2%; operating expenses grew 5.8% and operating income increased 4.3%. As previously mentioned, local case volume was strong within US Broadline Operations growing 5.2% % and is now grown for 18 consecutive quarters.","Total case volume within US Broadline Operations grew 5.7% reflecting a mix of both local and national customer growth. As it relates to volume, going forward we expect to see some softening in the year-over-year growth numbers through the annualization of both the HFM and Doerle acquisitions, the annualization of two large national customers added in the prior year and the impact of hurricane Michael. Gross profit grew by 5.2% despite moderating inflation as we continue to see growth in Sysco brand which is up to 47.2 % of local cases.","We also continue to see accelerating growth with local emerging concepts also known as micro chains as these unique locations continue to resonate with today's consumers. In fact, the larger portion of our local growth is currently coming from this type of customer. From an expense perspective, operating expense for the quarter grew 5.8% driven by supply chain costs in both the warehouse and transportation including significant overtime expense and cost associated with hiring due to the tight labor market. Additionally, rising fuel prices also contributed to our higher operating expenses for the quarter.","We are addressing these challenges by working on the initiatives I mentioned earlier and by continuing to drive productivity putting tighter control in place and how we manage costs, and working with our teams to improve our hiring and training practices to better retain talent in our supply chain operations.","Moving on to International Foodservice Operations, we had mixed results for the quarter. Sales increased 0.6%; gross profit grew 0.1% adjusted; adjusted operating expenses were flat and adjusted operating income increased 0.2%. Top line results were softer than expected in Canada after a good second half of fiscal 2018, first quarter sales in Canada lost momentum as year-over-year growth began to moderate. In Europe, performance with a quarter met our expectations and we have a combination of activities impacting our overall performance that includes the rationalization of some customers in the UK as we restructure our operations, along with saturation of restaurants in the market partially driven by the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.","In France, we have made significant progress towards the combining of Brake France and Davigel which will enable us to ultimately leverage the size and scale these businesses to deliver accelerated performance as we create Sysco France. And in Latin American businesses, we saw solid performance particularly in our Costa Rica operations which were partially offset by a challenging operating environment in Mexico. From a cost perspective, Canada is experiencing similar cost challenges for our US business in both warehouse and transportation. Additionally, our strategic transformation efforts in Europe continue with the integration of Sysco France progressing well along with the final phase of cost synergies occurring in Ireland as we combine Brakes and Pallas Foods there.","Finally, our ongoing investment in multi temperature distribution in the UK is moving forward and will eventually enable us to improve our overall cost structure and customer experience as we reconfigure the supply chain network across the country. Moving on to SYGMA. +The underlying macro cost challenges with both the transportation and warehouse area in the supply chain are also impacting this segment of our business. We continue to take a disciplined approach to growth with our customers and as we have transitioned some business sales modestly decreased during the first quarter.","We continue to look for opportunities to improve our value proposition in this important chain restaurant segment, while also looking for synergistic opportunities for growth. Lastly, in other business segment, guests apply also experienced cost challenges due to a combination of tariffs which began to put pressure on certain product categories in the business along with increased cost of shipping products to our customers. Overall, we continue to see top-line growth in the hospitality segment and are working on a variety of activities and initiatives to mitigate some of the increased operating expense associated with this business.","In summary, despite some of the challenges we are experiencing related to our operating environment, we delivered improve year-over-year results in our largest segment of the business. Our overall fundamentals are solid and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our three year plan financial objectives. Furthermore, we remain focused on delivering against our strategic priorities, which we believe will serve as our roadmap for additional growth and long- term value creation.","Now I'll turn the call over in Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Joel Grade","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I would like to provide you with additional financial details surrounding our performance for the quarter. As Tom noted for the first quarter for total Sysco sales were $15.2 billion, an increase of 3.9% compared to the same period last year. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 24%. Gross profit in the first quarter increased 3.9% and gross margin increased two basis points in part due to a year-over-year decline in inflation primarily driven by deflation in the meat, poultry and produce categories.","Adjusted operating expenses for total Sysco grew 3.6% for the quarter. The increase in expense as previously discussed was largely driven by supply chain costs in both warehouse and transportation and increased fuel costs, as well as increased bad debt expense in our US operations related to larger recoveries in the prior year and a couple large local customers going out of business. Additionally, we continue to make investments in transformation and integration in our international business.","Regarding the gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth, we were disappointed in that performance for the first quarter. The compression in the gap during the quarter can be attributed to continued increase costs in our US and Canadian supply chain operations, customer mix and Hurricane Florence. But as Tom indicated, we are taking an aggressive approach to accelerate our costs initiatives to improve this performance going forward.","Total adjusted operating income was $692 million in the quarter, an increase of 5.1% compared to the same period last year. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased operating income by 36 basis points. In terms of earnings per share, our result this quarter were primarily impacted by a lower tax rate, which I'll discuss more in a moment, driving an adjusted earnings per share growth of more than 22% to $0.91 per share. However, this was partially offset by increased interest expense which was higher than the same period last year due to variable rate changes and slightly less stock option exercises than in the prior year.","Returning to taxes. Our effective tax rates for the first quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 20.3% and 32.6% respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to lower tax rates resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the favorable impact of excess tax benefits of equity based compensation, partially offset by higher rates in local, states and other jurisdictions.","With regard to share repurchases, we repurchase shares based on a dollar based amount program. With the increase in share price this means fewer shares are being repurchased than during the same period last year. Cash flow from operations was $271 million for the quarter, which is $188 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $171 million, which is $222 million higher compared to the same period last year. It's important to note that the first quarter is often a weaker quarter for cash flow seasonally than the remainder of the year.","The improvement in cash flow is mostly due to improved working capital, and I'm pleased with our net working capital performance for the quarter. We had good improvement versus the same period last year driven primarily by changes in our receivables and payables. In September, Sysco issued senior notes in Canada where we previously had no fixed income exposure. This was a good opportunity to take advantage of investor demand in Canada and further balance our assets and liabilities in different geographies. As we looked to term out internal debt that was created to repatriate earnings from Canada as a result of US Tax Reform.","We're very pleased with the transaction and the interest on the notes will be paid semi-annually in April and October beginning in April of 2019.","Before closing, I would like to reinforce some of the messages we have shared with you as we look ahead to the next couple of quarters. As Tom mentioned, in our US business we expect to have a continued volume growth as a result of both healthy macro environment and our initiatives differentiate our capabilities from the competition. However, we will begin to annualize a couple of large acquisitions. One, we are beginning to annualize now and the other will begin to annualize in the second half of the fiscal year. And the annualization of two large national customers which will impact our overall volume growth.","Due to this annualization, along with a customer mix shift towards more growth of emerging concepts or micro chains, we expect our gross profit dollar growth to moderate. As for expenses, as Tom mentioned, we have a plan to aggressively manage and accelerate our cost initiatives and expect the benefit of these initiatives to ramp up over the next few quarters. As a result, we expect to have modest operating income growth during our second fiscal quarter. However, we expect improved performance in the second half of fiscal 2019 and are still committed to and confident in our ability to ultimately achieve the financial objectives associated with our three-year plan.","In summary, our results for the quarter reflect continued momentum from our underlying business, including solid local case growth and strong gross profit dollar growth. That said, we have more work to do in order to mitigate the macro-environment headwinds, manage our overall costs and achieve the full financial objectives of our three-year plan. We are committed to servicing our customers and executing on a high level in all areas of our business. To continue to improve our financial performance in both the near and long-term.","Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Christopher Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Christopher Mandeville","Yes, good morning. You guys saw some nice sequential improvement in your organic cases of close to 70 to 80 basis points. I don't think you had provided prior year first-half number. So I was just hoping maybe you had those off hand on organic cases for Q1, Q2 first off.","Joel Grade","Yes. Chris, just this is Joe. I think just to clarify your question I mean I think the first half of last year there is-- there's very little M&A. And so we hadn't, I think that's probably part of what you're looking at here is just a difference in having M&A and this year M&A and not last year. And I note that if that is your question.","Christopher Mandeville","Okay. Yes. My question I suppose would be thinking about trends on a two-year basis, you reference that you're looking for or expecting some moderation in Q2 on the top line of cases for that matter. How do you feel about maybe keeping things somewhat stable on a two-year stack basis?","Joel Grade","Yes. Well, I think, look, I think - one of the things I would certainly reference you back to is the three-year plan that we talked about with an overall volume growth. Again that made some assumptions of some M&A about of some M&A about 1%, 0.5% or 1% in there. We talked about overall volume grow over 3% local about 3.5%. Again every quarter is going to look a little different and there's going to be some impact of some things that we've talked about here, but I think we broadly still feel good about the volume numbers we talked about as part of our three year plan.","Those things are just going to move around some, but I think our --what we're really trying to get at here is just to give some line of sight to the fact that as we head into this next quarter and over the next a little bit of near future here that some of the things that we have been benefiting from including the HFM acquisition, the Doerle acquisition, some large as we referenced national accounts coming on that we're simply suggesting that we're seeing some of that moderation happening as we move forward.","Christopher Mandeville","Okay and my follow up would be so you referenced that you weren't happy with your gross profit dollar growth in the quarter, and you'll be accelerating your cost savings programs going forward to help trying offset that to see some improved trends on overall even in the back half of the year. You also mentioned that you were still confident in your 2020 outlook, but if I recall over half of the growth was going to be predicated on gross profit dollar growth so has the algorithm changed to some degree or should we be just thinking that there's some near-term softness and gross profit dollars and we'll improve from here on out.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes, Hey, Chris, this is Tom. So I think - I don't think we said we are disappointed in our gross profit dollar growth. What we said was that the gap between gross profit dollar and expenses was not where we had hoped they would be. And so we still expect to see I think good gross profit dollar growth. What we've got to get is better focus and management of the cost because the current cost increases are not, we're not comfortable with where they are at. And so I think the headline here is that we still expect to see decent gross profit growth as similar to what we've talked about externally, but we just got to figure out how to mitigate some of these rising costs that were --that are challenging us right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Summers from Buckingham. Your line is open.","Bob Summers","Hey, good morning. Just to leverage off that a little I mean I think about the gap between case volume growth and gross profit dollar growth wind out in a not favorable way like any more texture to that. And if I think about deflation impacting that number what's the right way to view it?","Joel Grade","Yes. So, Bob, it's Joe. So I think the couple things on that. I'll start with the deflation point is obviously there was an anticipated level of inflation and some of the projections we had as part of this three-year plan and where we're at today is less than that. So I think part of what we're calling out is the fact that again in a deflationary environment which you are a less inflationary environment you typically have some mathematical improvement in the margin percentage that you actually have less gross profit dollars. And so when the impact of lower inflation does tend to be having lower gross profit. And so I think that's part of what we're seeing there.","I think some of the other thing we talked about a little bit here was a bit of the mix and we called out some of this mix between some of the --even within our local cases of some of the micro chains, some of the things that are actually growing at an accelerated rate versus some will even I would call some of the pure independence that's part we're also referencing is something we're seeing as a somewhat of leveling off of our gross profits that's I think part what we're calling out here. So those are couple of -","Bob Summers","And then you referenced the Hurricanes but you didn't size it up in any way on the cost side on the case volume side. How should I try and normalize?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes. I think typically, Bob, the way we try to look at those hurricanes and the reason we've talked about both of them is one of them impacted quarter one, the other one Michael will actually more impact quarter two. But typically what we find is we lose the top-line right. We don't get the cases because outlets are shut down, the markets basically shut down, but we still have some of the costs. We still pay our people. We still and sometimes we try to recover. We are paying overtime because we are having to struggle to get as many people where we need them when we need them there.","And so we tend to get is less top-line and more cost in those situations. And that's what we experienced in both of those situations. Obviously in the first quarter we had a little bit of that a year ago with a couple of hurricanes. So the real impact probably here is somewhat smaller in the first quarter and will be a little maybe larger in the second quarter.","Joel Grade","Yes. And you're right, Bob, we didn't size it out. I mean some where the impact of the, let's say Florence itself it is pretty somewhere a little less than a penny I would call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Edward Kelly","Yes, hi, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to dig a little bit further into the cost pressures that you're talking about in here and just I guess how they're impacting the P&L right because there's a part of the cogs that there's impact and there's part of OpEx as we think about and Bob started asked sort of along this lines, as we think about gross profit dollar growth this quarter relative to case growth, there clearly was a short fall within that relative to I think what has been going on historically. What is going on with inbound freight? Has that gotten worse to some extent or is this truly just a more of a mix issue and lack of inflation issue?","Tom Ben\u00e9","I'll start and then Joe can jump in. I think it's probably more of you suggest. I think it's more of a mixed issue and somewhat of, look, it's a slowing down of the inflation that we had planned, but it is also seeing deflation in a couple of key categories which is impacting us. I think in addition, look, I think the inbound freight is gotten better. It's still not great but it's more I think more consistent and maybe we were experiencing last year. So I think that consistency enables us to manage through that a little bit better. It's still up obviously it still continues to be a challenge as all of the-- we'd say everything around drivers because it's a challenge.","Whether it's our ability to hire and retain and make sure we're doing everything we can to get our products out the door, or the impact of products coming in. I think what we're just seeing with within inbound is we're a little more stable than we were a year ago. We're cautiously optimistic but that will continue throughout the year but as we get to this holiday season, we do worry that that we see more pressure there as they're just more freight on the road.","Joel Grade","Yes and I think this - just one thing I'd add to that, yes, it is just I think Tom's comment earlier about these the categories themselves that are actually in deflationary are important. We've always and we always talked about this pretty consistently. It matters what inflation or deflation is but it also in some ways matters what the categories that are inflating or deflating are. And in this case some of them, we've had in our FreshPoint business for example, we had a fairly significant deflation in the produce area and again on the center of the plate in the meats area. Those are large dollar cases you start experiencing some of the deflation and that has some more impact on per case number that you're referring to.","Edward Kelly","All right. And just a follow up on the cost side and the potential offsets. How are you thinking about pricing at this point in the industry given the rising cost pressures? I mean your top-line is obviously very strong and it doesn't take a lot of pricing to offset issues like driver pay and what's going on with the warehouses. Are you actively looking to try to offset some of this with price? And, if not, then why?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes. So, of course, we are and we always try to look at what is reasonable to pass along from a pricing perspective. I think the only challenge I'd say we've seen is the as we talk between the inbound freight which is adding to our cogs and some of the inflation in some categories that we've seen, we are trying to pass along as much of it as we can. Having said that, we did see a little bit of a gap between the cogs rising and our pricing in this quarter, and that is obviously creating some of this pressure we're talking about. So we continue to leverage our revenue management tools and all the work we've done over the last couple of years. We're just-- we're doing everything we can to move it along without creating issues obviously for our customers or for our overall top-line growth.","Edward Kelly","And just last question when you think about the back half of the year, obviously you're expecting an improvement there. When you say that do you mean back to that 1% gap in GP versus SG&A growth?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes, that's very much the focus is how do we get keep, our top-line growing very strong and then make sure we are managing the cost side of the business tighter.","Joel Grade","Yes and again just as part of that three-year plan if you remember that that gap was targeted at for that three-year time period. So certainly there's a plan that has some acceleration.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","John Heinbockel","So Tom and Joe, let me start with corporate overhead right or your corporate EBIT. Did that grow a little faster in the period than you would have liked or have planned? How do you attack that--I know that a lot of these shared services are part of that but maybe talk about the way you're attacking that here specifically on the next couple of quarters? And then is it fair to for us to think that line item can grow? You can hold the growth to 1% or 2% on a go-forward basis or is that too low?","Joel Grade","Well, let me start and then Tom can chime if he wants. I mean-- I --first of all, no, the answer your original question is we did not actually that was not part of the cost acceleration that happened this quarter. So but having said that one of the things that Tom had referenced in his comments were around some of the areas in terms of the finance technology roadmap, some of the smart spending that, so that is not to suggest we don't still have areas of opportunity that we're continuing to address. And again in a world where we have some of the challenges we talked about in some of the macro in particular in the operations side.","These are areas that we need to continue accelerate even at a faster rate than we have today. And so I think as we always think about those type of cost them in there are pay increases and there's things and so each --there are going to be a couple points of the increase in any given year, but what we're talking about now is actually doing some things that are going to further accelerate decreases in that area. And again it starts with these things that Tom referenced in terms of finance technology roadmap and smart spending categories.","John Heinbockel","Yes, are you pulling forward the timetable on some of that in light of the warehouse cost pressures or it's on the same timetable?","Joel Grade","In some cases, yes, but obviously there's some puts and takes and all that, but we're certainly making sure we're either stay on track or where we can't accelerate we're doing so.","John Heinbockel","All right. And then maybe just for Tom when you think about this question of pricing the flipside being obviously you've got a lot of data and you think about the position you're in versus a lot of your peers right which is far better competitive position. If you don't take pricing and they do, is there an idea when you look at elasticity that can lead to step up in share or not and I know what's account by account item by item but that's really not the path you want to go down?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes. As you know, John, that we've talked a lot about this in our past. We are not looking to buy share, if you will. We need to be obviously competitive in the marketplace, but you should not expect and we would not be out there and kind of leading with pricing downward to drive market share. We need to earn that based on all the things we've talked about. We're very focused on all those I would call differentiators in the business to create a better experience for our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks. So my question is I guess in early September you kind of indicated that you probably you loosely achieved a third of your three year goals and operating income in 2018 and you'd indicated that the remaining two-thirds would be pretty evenly distributed between fiscal 2019 and 2020. And obviously with what you have given us today that doesn't appear to be the case achieving your remainder of the $400 million or $450 million to $500 million in operating profit is pretty heavily weighted to fiscal 2020. So I guess the first question is that I mean that is an accurate statement right? And I guess the second question would be I guess I am still trying to understand really what changed from early September to today?","Tom Ben\u00e9","So, Karen, A couple is, I would say not just a year 2020. I think we're telling you is back half of 2019 and 2020 but we are still confident we can achieve those numbers that we've shared with you all. So I think from that standpoint I wouldn't assume by any means that this is a - we're pushing everything off to the last year and you're going to have some big balloon when you need to stall for. So as far as what's changed, I mean I think what we are --one big thing that we are feeling maybe more right now than we had anticipated or had been prior to that is this cost pressure on the a supply chain side.","And look, we knew it was out there. We were managing it pretty well, but I think we've gotten to a point now where we are like probably everyone starting to feel the impacts of that kind of day in and day out. And if we think about what that really looks like it literally is if you don't have enough drivers in the building then we need to pay what we have over time to get those products out. We need to invest more in recruiting people faster because we're not getting the folks in the door, and so whether it's incentives we have to pay to get people in, it's all of these things that we all know are out there, but I think maybe we were feeling less of that than others in the last couple quarters. And now it's hit us kind of squarely like everyone else.","So I think that's the single biggest thing that's changed here. Obviously, we talked about going forward more of these just lapping issues that we have where we had some acquisitions a year ago that we'll start to lap and we had some new some bigger customer acquisitions, but it's really about this supply chain cost and all we're saying is we're going to accelerate some things in some other areas knowing we've got to offset that.","Karen Short","Okay so then just to clarify also you were kind of asked this earlier but in terms of the components of achieving that 650 to 700 I think you were asked gross profit was 55% to 65% of that, so is that still the case or should we expect the leveraging cycle not leveraging supply chain but reducing admin costs to be a more of a contributing factor? And then if you could give us just some color in terms of the dollar buckets in the three areas that you called out the finance transformation, smart spending and Canadian regionalization that would be helpful?","Joel Grade","Karen, so I'll start I mean I think the bucket is broadly speaking, I wouldn't call it materially different. There's probably some shifting around a little bit there that that skews towards some more of the cost side. Again out of necessity, again - every - we --again express confidence in our goals and if it looks a little different than we'd originally anticipated, but I wouldn't necessarily come to conclusion right now that all those things are going to just dramatically shift in terms of the buckets. I think that's, again, we're all we're really saying is that where we have some experiences of some of these issues particularly in our supply chain area, we're just going to continue to focus on accelerating those areas that we can continue to take costs out of our system.","So I think that's really the main message here. And I think - [Multiple Speakers] yes and on those specifics, Karen, again we haven't-- we're not going out and actually I guess assigning specific cost to those items just suffice it to say, and we talked about this in Investor Day. Those were certainly a sizeable portion when we talked about of their G&A savings, and yes we can accelerate some of that we're looking to do so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Sinisi","Hey, great, good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Also of course just wanted to follow up with what the cost focus. So I guess Tom you said it's certainly supply chain seems to kind of be the biggest difference versus last quarter, but then in your prepared commentary it felt at least like you talked quite a bit around kind of opportunities for cost cuts across really all your geographies, and not maybe just with breaks and whatnot. So I guess first is that a fair statement? And then just more holistically are some of these costs initiatives strictly to combat the headwinds that you ran through or by different geographies may there --may be just be more efficiencies that you should be realizing overall?","Tom Ben\u00e9","So, Vincent, there are a couple of things. So the cost challenges are, if you think about the various segments, the business we talked about. Our biggest cost challenges are in North America. So the US business in Canada from a supply chain perspective. That's where we're feeling the majority of the impact. Our European business while there's a few things that are not a big driver of our cost issue. So it's the supply chain North America, big focus, so that's number one. Second what I would say is while I referred to other opportunities those are the ones we've been talking about finance roadmap, smart spending, some regional, I talked about Canadian regionalization.","Some of those are kind of normal course of business opportunities, and we'll continue to look for those as well whether they're in the US or whether they're an international. We'll continue to look for and we will drive out cost opportunities that exist beyond big strategic focus areas. And so the last thing I think you asked is are they in the plan or not some? Some are and some aren't. And so finance roadmap we talked about that Investor Day, we plan for some of that. We're accelerating some of the work there, but we had planned for some of these things. So I think some of them are in the numbers; some of them are going to be accelerating, but I think the key message for you guys is, look, we understand that we were seeing some cost headwinds today that we had not anticipated. And you should expect and we are focused on mitigating those by taking out other, by taking out cost in other areas.","That's why we're not really saying we're shifting; we should be shifting the model a lot. There might be slight adjustments as Joel suggested but this is basically saying look, we got some more cost headwinds than we anticipated. And we are aggressively going after those so we feel comfortable we can deliver the numbers we've committed.","Joel Grade","Yes and I think just again that benefit again, we certainly anticipated seeing some of that starting in the second half of this year as opposed again somehow jamming all that into the final year, the three year plan.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay, all right, that's helpful, guys. Thank you and maybe just as a quick follow-up. Joel, I guess this is more for you just in terms of the rest of this year. How are you thinking about inflation which was just very slight and then also how should we think of tax rate going forward?","Joel Grade","Yes, so from an inflation perspective, I mean I think you were certainly coming around this flattish area and I would just say that our anticipation within a couple quarters is, I'd say somewhat modest inflation splash kind of deep-- this is kind of right around this flattish area over the next couple quarters. I think is probably the best view you can have right now. Tax rate, certainly at this point continued we talked about twenty bucks I think a 25% tax rate that we called out in our earnings call for our fourth-quarter and some guidance there. And while obviously, we certainly continue to drive traditional opportunities there. At this point that certainly though we're still looking at that 25% factor at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judah Frommer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.","Judah Frommer","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to break out the expense pressure from the top-line strength. I mean it does sound like the expense pressure is expected to continue, but that's tied to wage growth and you're talking about a pretty supportive macro in the US. That said, it sounds like there is some channel shifting going on that's kind of pressuring margins. You talked about the micro change versus independence. So how much confidence do you have in continued top-line strength potentially offsetting elevated costs in the near term?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hi, Judah. I'd say, look, I think we feel like the top line should continue to see solid growth, were, all of the, as you said the macro environment there is pretty positive and a lot of the things we're seeing across the food service segment continue to give us confidence there. I think the other thing you're raising and we've talked about this a little bit already this morning in the call is. There is some potential pressure on margin based on the mix of the customers and where some of that growth is coming. So I think the growth will continue but this kind of emerging segments, micro chains growing at a faster rate maybe than we had seen earlier are creating some pressure there.","We're going to have to figure out how to manage through that as well. And I think your point on expenses was these aren't short-term, these are-- we see these continuing at this point. And, so yes, that's why we have to get aggressive in some of these areas because we don't see those costs increases mitigating anytime in the short-term.","Judah Frommer","Okay and then kind of beyond the broader expense pressures in the industry. I mean there are clearly different things going on at each of the public players. Is there anything you'd call out in the first quarter or going into second where you've seen material share shifts amongst the top players in the industry? Or is this kind of you guys executing on your plan and that's where the top-line is coming from?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes, I would say in our case, I can't really speak for the other guys but we're --this is more just continued execution of our plan. We continue to be very focused. We talk about this disciplined profitable growth and while we have some of these challenges we're talking about, we're still very focused on each customer and making sure there's value. We can create for the relationship but also being thoughtful about not every customer is a good fit for what we're trying to accomplish, and we'll continue to focus on managing your business that way.","Joel Grade","Yes, and just to remember the size, the sheer size of the industry in terms of competitors. Again we often, the conversation is often around the three of us but really three of us maybe have 30% share at the top and so I think there's just a lot of competition in there, where share moves around.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Marisa Sullivan","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on the top-line focus. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on the drivers of the healthy case growth you saw in the US? Was it more new business that you were bringing? Was it increased penetration? Are you seeing accelerated share gains and then any commentary on the quarter to date whether that's continued? Thank you.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hey, Marisa. So from a top-line standpoint, I think it's really all of the above. We continue to see obviously some new business gains. Obviously that's important for all of us in this segment of the industry. I think in addition, we are seeing improved penetration in certain geographies and with certain customers which is a good sign again kind of some of the robustness in the industry in certain segments of the industry I should probably say. And last I guess I'd say is we have like everybody we have markets that are performing better than others.","And I say market, from our geographic market say in the US, and so we are constantly kind of managing through that whether it's competitive situations or weather related situations or whatever, we've got to manage through those on regular basis. So I'd say the top line is nothing changed dramatically from what we've seen historically. Again, some of that growth that we talked about was still acquisitions and some non-organic but we feel really good about organic growth. And we are kind of right where we thought we would be from that top line perspective. Is it relates to - what was the second part of your question?","Marisa Sullivan","Just quarter-to-date if you have seen that momentum continues?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes. I think in general as we go into second quarter we talked about some of these things, some of the lapping issues. So I'd say in general, yes, understanding that we have some of these lapping things that we shared occurring as we speak.","Marisa Sullivan","Got it .And if could just quickly follow up on the cost side. Given that a lot of this is coming from wage pressures both in the warehouse and transpiration. Can you give us a little bit more detail on some of the productivity initiatives you have underway in both the warehouse and supply chain other opportunities for automation that you see that could help offset some of these pressures over the midterm? Just any more color there. Thank you.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Sure. And just on the pressure so it's wage to some extent. I think the important thing for everybody remember, I know we've talked about this is, we aren't --folks who are out there maybe increasing the minimum wage or coming out with higher wages for their associates. We generally aren't as impacted by that because we're already at or above those rates, but what we're finding is with the reduced availability of work force with the current levels of employment, we are just having a harder time attractive and retaining a certain associates. And I think that's we get into this little bit of churn situation where again we don't enough or paying overtime and that's driving our cost or we are having to spend money at higher rate to get people in the door.","And it's not necessarily the pay rate or the wage rate; it's more of that churn that we are experiencing there and everything around that. And that's when we talk about out trying to retain folks longer, we know just like customers or we can retain our associates, it helps our overall cost. As far as other things we are doing, we've talked about things like small delivery vehicle. So let's talk about that for a second. That's a great example of where you may instead of having to find CDL driver where we know there is huge pressure right now for that commercial driver's license person. We can use folks who don't necessarily need a CDL.","Ability to accelerate initiatives like that can be - can do a couple of things. Help us dramatically in our service for our customers but also impact that overall cost to wage rate and expense of that driver issue we've been dealing with. That's an example. Automation, we have a fair amount of automation in our facilities not like you might think of its hi-tech automation but automation around some of the slower moving items we are able to put more items into our facilities. We have piloted and tested some various types of warehouse automation and we will continue to look at that. We've not seen necessarily that being a big driver for us in the short term. But that doesn't mean we don't continue to look for ways to do that.","I'd say the other areas where we might use think about automation is around analytics as you think about the AI, you hear a lot about. How do we take the information we have, enable us to make quicker decisions, enable us to do something in a way that maybe in the past that took us a little more manual approach to. And then maybe the last thing around our delivery is the way we route our trucks and the way we - the more we can be efficient in our routing and also enables us to kind of manage through this driver challenge but also improve our cost, meaning we can get more cases on the truck and we can obviously --we can have bigger drops with our customers, all those things really do help and improve that pressure on the supply chain cost.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Kelly Bania","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I guess just another way to ask the cost question. Do you think that your planned initiatives on the cost side just need to be bigger than maybe previously expected over the three-year period in order to offset some of these supply chain costs which sounds like it's more drivers and warehouse labor versus maybe freight but I guess the question what are you assuming for those kind of supply chain costs over the next year and a half?","Tom Ben\u00e9","So, Kelly, I think it's a combination of things. I think as we were just talking with Marisa's question. We need to improve the current run rate of our supply chain cost. They are higher than we are comfortable with and I think we've got some initiative underway to continue to manage that, but to make sure we cover this increase that we're seeing. We are going to I'd say probably not necessary bigger but accelerate some of the cost initiatives that we've had out there. We have a pretty good line of sight to the areas of opportunity and I think it's really about accelerating those faster versus making them bigger if you.","Kelly Bania","Okay and I guess Joel just on the comment on gross margin and the impact of deflation and the mathematical impact that has. I guess can you quantify what that did have on the gross margin rate? I guess it would have thought gross margin would have been up a little bit more last time we went through this deflationary cycle it was also up a little bit more, so can you help us understand maybe kind of some of the puts and take underlying gross margin?","Joel Grade","Yes and so again just to be kind of clear on that, again we haven't quantified that but I mean the point here really is we're not in deflation yet. What I was really referring to is that we were actually having, you want to call it less inflation and in certain categories we are actually experiencing some level deflation, but we're not in an overall deflationary place. Now the point I was also making was that if you look at last year in the same quarter, we actually had more inflation and so I guess that was really the point of the kind of the earlier comparison that there's some mathematical if you want to call it contribution to the gross margin percentages that happens when you look at that year-over-year. But that's really the point I was trying to make but we're not in a deflationary environment right now in total. So again which when we were talking about this couple years ago we're a couple points of deflation.","And that obviously has certainly a much more significant margin percentage impact than what we are talking today.","Kelly Bania","Okay and can you help us understand how you're defining these micro chains? How big are they? Ad how close is the margin profile to more of a local independent restaurant versus a chain? And how we should think about that?","Tom Ben\u00e9","I think typically we've talked about them kind of less than 100 units, but generally covering multiple from our view-- multiple operating company. So instead of being like within a local geography with a few locations these are emerging concepts that are starting to grow beyond their traditional borders. And think about it as there are concepts that usually have done well for a while as a local or independent customer and now we're at the stage where they feel like they're ready to expand. And so we're just seeing that segment of the market starting to grow a little bit faster as they do that they require things that are probably more similar to a national account, both from how we manage their business but also the kind of programs they're getting from suppliers et cetera.","And so that's why we say that that segment is a little more margin pressure than an independent restaurant operator, and but that they vary in size and scope. There not --they're not --they're certainly not changed like you typically think of a chain but they are starting to emerge and shift beyond kind of their traditional market.","Operator","And our next question is Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.","Ajay Jain","Yes, hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could maybe expand a little bit on the general operating environment for independence. Obviously, your competitors have had some recent challenges with independent case growth and they've also been adding marketing associates to address that challenge. And on the last earnings call I think you mentioned at the time that you were also hiring some marketing associates. And even though your top line for independent case growth has been really strong, I'm wondering if there's a more competitive backdrop to get that incremental case growth. This competition by itself driving some of that increased cost pressure. So just wondering if you are seeing any combination of increased industry pricing and headcount expenses for drivers and for more salespeople?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes, Ajay, maybe the way I'd answer that is if you recall we actually probably led these nine months to or so ago by adding some marketing associates. We believed that we had now had the kind of the data analytics and tools to allow us to focus where we were going to add resources. So we started that kind of Q --our Q2 of last year and that carried on kind of through now. So we have seen some additional expense associated with our adding some marketing associates, but we also believe that that's helping us drive our local customer and case growth.","And so I'd separate that as far as what we see is the strategy we put in place is working. Is the competitive environment changing as others? Now look to add marketing associates out there, sure, I'm certain markets we're seeing some of that and as it gets more competitive obviously we need to be there to compete, but I would separate those from the operating expense other than to say that obviously higher case growth drives higher operating expense in general. If you're growing 5% plus in the cases and you should expect your operating expenses are going to grow.","Our problem is our operating expenses, we're not getting leverage on them or they're growing faster than what obviously we're just getting on the case grow. So that's our issue and we've got to get that back in check which is what we've really been talking about here this morning.","Ajay Jain","Okay and Tom in your prepared comments you, I think you cited improved economic data points and improved environment in the US for restaurant spending, but then based on the recent performance it breaks and SYGMA you mentioned a more moderate rate of earnings growth in Q2 but can you mention or can you confirm whether that operating income growth in Q2 is that supposed to be similar to this quarter or could it be potentially worse than Q1?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes. I think we're suggesting that where we sit today we feel like we just want to make you all aware of a couple of the lapping issues we've talked about. So we're not sitting here calling down for anything. I think just to be clear when you talk about breaks or Europe that's very different situation. And as I said in the remarks, I think in the UK there's certainly some uncertainty in that market continues because of this Brexit question that's out there. And quite honestly what we see in here as it gets closer to the date where they need to make some decisions that's probably creating more dynamics in the market right now, but the rest of our international markets we feel pretty good about, France and Sweden, Ireland all doing well.","And so we just sort --we are managing through what is a little bit of a bumpy environment in some of our international markets.","Joel Grade","Yes, Ajay, I just, this is Joel. I think just to clarify I think what I think we're saying is that the Q2 we are anticipating looking somewhat more similar to what we have this quarter as opposed to something a lot worse than that. So I think what we're calling our is just some moderation a bit due to some of the lapping and some of the volume and then again we talked about some of these expense acceleration kicking in, but we're anticipating some of that more in the second half of the year. So I think just to clarify is more similar is the answer to your questions is we really we're calling out there in a second quarter.","Ajay Jain","Okay, thanks Joel. And just lastly for you. Do you expect higher interest expenses? Is that going to remain a headwind for the rest of the year or does that moderate at all?","Joel Grade","No, that's - I anticipate that remaining a bit of a headwind.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Karen Holthouse","Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just another way to ask the question on the cost side of things. It sounds like you're pulling forward some cost savings but if there a level of inflation or we at the point or how much worse would wage inflation have to get before that sort of 150 basis point gap between gross profit and operating expenses in the three year plan would be addressed?","Joel Grade","Well, you are right, couple things. Again I just like to just make one slight comment like that Tom made. I would not characterize this as wage inflation per se. It is demand for labor particularly on the transportation side and again with a pretty low unemployment obviously that impacts our ability to try to retain on the warehouse side as well. So it's really that as opposed to just wage inflation itself that's causing that impact. And I guess what I'd say to that, Karen, your other question, how much of that's going to happen before it just blows out the course of the three-year plan.","I mean the reality of it is, again, we've been an environment for a while now where we've had these --some of these driver challenges. We've navigated through that for a while now. It's starting to pinch us a bit more which is what we've talked about here. I'm certainly not ready to make the call though that, it's again unemployment is pretty low, driver shortage has been there. And so I don't, I certainly don't know whether we're contemplating a scenario where that somehow gets just exponentially worse and it just blows this plan out yet. We're certainly-- we've talked about a couple times today. We've --it's a headland, we've got to deal with it both from how we become more productive on our supply chain as well as some of the other costs that we need to accelerate to deal with that.","We will do so and we're certainly again at this point we should we certainly have continued to express our confidence in achieving our three year plan numbers.","Tom Ben\u00e9","I think that's the important thing, Karen, is where we sit today we still feel like we will deliver the three-year plan we committed. Will we have to make some continued adjustments? No doubt. And that's what we've been talking about mostly this morning.","Operator","Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe","Hi, thank you. The question is on pricing but pricing not to your local accounts but to your contract accounts and I was just wondering whether some of the cost pressures that you're seeing internally in particularly this quarter we're allowed to be passed on in general to your current contract accounts. In other words are you selling them, products at one delivered price it's different than what your own backdoor price is? And it might just be a function of some of these contracts kind of rolling over or for you to set up a new whether cost-plus percent or cost plus your dollar per case basis whatever it is for you to capture the true cost to deliver to these customers?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hey, John. It's a good question. There are certainly some contracts that have longer periods of time for adjustments of cost increases for us to pass them along, but I wouldn't say that's a big driver here but there's some of that for sure but I wouldn't characterize that as something that's a major impact or you should see some big switch swing because of it.","John Ivankoe","And at least from what I remember historically it was at 50% contract and 50% locally managed. I mean is that still the breakout within your Broadline or has that not?","Joel Grade","That's right, John.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes, that's right.","Operator","And our last question comes from Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wolf","Hi, good morning. I just want to drill down on some of this maybe into some of the line items on the cost pressure. So it sounds like you're saying it's still the change was still more on the driver side than in the warehouse side. I just want to confirm that and change in terms of where more pressure came. And then I want to --one of you guys referenced started over talking your answer but maybe can do two at once. One of you guys referenced increasing over time and that sounds more like a warehouse issue or is it also a driver issue?","Tom Ben\u00e9","So let's start there. Andrew. So I think it's both and so we obviously have hours of service types of things we have to manage on the driver side, but it's both. And I would say that costs are both as well if you think about those are relative expense. The driver and the transportation cost associated in our business are significantly higher than the warehouse. So both are being impacted but if you have heavy impact on transportation and the drivers that plays a disproportionate role in the overall expense load. And that's the really the point.","Andrew Wolf","And in terms of the labor shortage and I think the turnover that's very central to that. If you could perfectly match up the supply of labor with demand, would you --these cost pressures mitigate? In other words it's just-- is there just a lot of turnover and it's sort of unpredictable and that's when you're caught short or is it generally just more of a general process and you're just short labor most of the time?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes. We historically have not been short labor most of the time. So this is clearly a new phenomenon and I think it's driven by all of the factors we've talked about. Certainly just the unemployment levels are a lot lower; there is a shortage of what we would call skilled drivers. These drivers that have the CDL licenses and there's just a high demand for them in lots of industries right now. And as long as they remain short, we're going to have to do everything we can to retain the ones we have and attract the ones we need. And so that's where a lot of this is happening.","Joel Grade","Yes and you can imagine, Andrew, I mean it's --the more your --the issues you are having with retention, there's more training cost, there's more churn; there's more --people take some time to ramp up productivity and accuracy and all those things. I mean all that stuff just exacerbates when you're having some of the issues of the retention. So that's just really - and that's both on the warehouse and the transportation side.","Andrew Wolf","Okay and if I could just ask kind of housekeeping. I think you called out fuel for the first time in a while. I don't know if you'd be willing to give us a swing in fuel and just sort of comment on whether this future surcharges, what degree that mitigates things?","Joel Grade","Sure, well. So, yes, so fuel has continued to increase, obviously we continue to use some forward derivatives to hedge some of that but nonetheless those are on a rolling 12 that as fuel costs continue to go up those also go up. And so we certainly had say about $0.03 a case in terms of our fuel impact this quarter. So it's pretty significant, and you can certainly anticipate that coming continuing fuel surcharges I think the way ours-- the way those work I mean again that's not a dollar-for-dollar offset to be clear. We have had some increase in our surcharges those and on the contract side most of those are negotiated in. We have contract customers and those do move up and down based on some type of grid.","On the street side, yes, that's something we're certainly continuing to evaluate and again as the markets move those do tend to move some as well but aren't nearly as big an impact.","Andrew Wolf","Okay. And Joel just on the reclassification and the other income. It was pretty big swing this quarter especially without any other income this quarter and a year ago going up. Is that a pattern or we're going to or you guys going to go back to having sort of a decent other income line going forward? Otherwise it's like-- if we annualized this quarter so adverse swing it's like a $0.05 a share.","Joel Grade","Well, so again that was related to an accounting change related to the way the pension accounting works that used to be up above the line. And so that is a reclassification from up above to down below. That is something you're going to see because again that's just to play a classification issue. That's really the main impact on the other income this quarter. And that you'll see for this yearend beyond.","Operator","Thank you everyone for joining us today.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Earlier in this morning, Sysco reported strong financial results for our third fiscal quarter. Specifically, sales increased 13% year-over-year to $13.5 billion, driven both by a 3.5% local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business and new sales from our Brakes business which we acquired last July at the beginning of our fiscal year. Adjusted operating income grew 14% to $500 million, and adjusted earnings per share grew 11% to $0.51.","Our results for the quarter reflect excellent performance across a majority of our businesses and build upon our increasingly strong and consistent performance over the past few years. These results were driven by our 65,000 dedicated associates successfully and cohesively executing Sysco's customer-centric strategy at a high level. Further, these results were achieved in markets that for the most part are experiencing modest economic growth and stable employment levels.","While the energy-related downturn has resulted in regional economic headwinds in certain areas of the United States and Canada and political developments continue to contribute to economic uncertainty in some of the countries we operate in, overall consumer confidence generally remains favorable. Our business strategy is predicated on disciplined, profitable, and sustainable growth with particular emphasis on the following pillars: utilizing customer insights to enrich our customers' experience with Sysco; continuously improving productivity in all areas of our business; enhancing our product, service, and business solution offerings; and leveraging our talented associates while further developing our rich culture.","In recent years, we have made tremendous strides in more effectively and consistently executing the specific initiatives developed pursuant to this strategy. By putting our customers first and embracing the right kind of properly-paced impactful change, we've built a foundation that has both supported our improved business performance and positions us well for continuous improvement as we move forward.","The other key pillar of our business strategy is to continually assess new market opportunities for profitable, long-term growth. To that end, we see many exciting opportunities ahead for our international business in Canada, Latin America, and Europe.","In closing, I am encouraged by the strong, positive momentum we currently have in our business and am pleased to report that we remain on track to achieve our recently upwardly revised adjusted operating income growth target through fiscal 2018. In addition, we are also in the process of developing Sysco's new three-year plan through fiscal 2020, and look forward to sharing that publicly later in the calendar year.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional discussion about our recent business results.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, our associates are executing at a high level as we continue to deliver on the key strategic levers of our three-year plan: delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, growing gross profit dollars, and managing overall expenses.","This morning, I'd like to discuss our segment results with a focus on U.S. Foodservice Operations and International Foodservice Operations. I will also highlight some of the key strategic initiatives of our U.S. business that are helping us to differentiate Sysco in the marketplace.","Starting with our quarterly results for U.S. Foodservice Operations, sales grew 2.2% and gross profit had growth of 4%, while adjusted operating expenses grew 2.3%, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 7%. Overall, our U.S. Foodservice segment had a strong quarter. We experienced strong growth in our local business as we accelerated case growth to 3.5%, which was partially offset by declines in case volume for our multi-unit business, resulting in 1.8% total case growth.","Importantly, as we strive to deliver disciplined, profitable growth as a part of our three-year plan, our continued focus on providing value to our local customers through innovative product offerings and value-added services, along with improved e-commerce capabilities, has enabled our growth with these customers for the 12th quarter in a row.","Looking at gross profit growth for U.S. Foodservice Operations, we delivered growth of 4% and gross margin expansion of 35 basis points as we continue to manage the deflationary environment well. As you all know, the industry has been in a deflationary environment for an unprecedented six consecutive quarters, and that trend is finally beginning to shift toward inflation. Meat prices are abating, and dairy and produce prices have begun to rise. Based on those changes, we are anticipating overall modest inflation in the fourth quarter.","Our strategy around accelerating growth with local customers is working. Over the last several quarters, we've improved the capabilities of our sales force through investments made in training, technology, and targeted resources. And as a result, our marketing associates are spending more time selling and focusing on delivering benefits to our customers versus spending time on non-value-added activities.","In addition, our insights-based approach to understanding and meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts. As an example, one of the insights we've received from customers was around providing healthier product options. In response, we created a good-to-grow promotion during the third quarter that highlighted the large variety of fresh and healthy produce options available to our customers. Furthermore, we brought innovative products to market through our Cutting Edge Solutions program. This program introduces new product ideas to customers, which can help them reduce labor costs and\/or improve the quality of their menu offering. These are just a few of the programs that have translated into improving loyalty scores for Sysco this past year. We are committed to delivering value to our customers while also providing a more consistent experience of doing business with us.","From a cost perspective within U.S. Foodservice Operations, our expense management was solid as we limited growth to 2.3% on an adjusted basis for the quarter. Looking at U.S. Broadline, cost per case improved by approximately $0.02 compared to the prior year. And on a fuel price-neutral basis, cost per case improved by $0.01, ahead of our three-year plan objective.","In our supply chain area, we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements which are driving efficiencies. One example is our slotting initiative that's helping our warehouses to build pallets faster and more accurately.","In the area of delivery, we are seeing progress in improved routing and delivery metrics through the leverage of enhanced technology. While there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends, and we are focused on continuing this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year.","Additionally, we are continuing to thoughtfully manage our administrative expenses through a more consistent approach that is improving our overall efficiency while maintaining service level to our customers. Looking at the overall performance for U.S. Foodservice Operations, I'm very pleased with our level of execution, which enables us to deliver solid operating income growth and improved operating margins by 34 basis points.","Moving to International Foodservice Operations, sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased $6.6 million, both driven largely by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group. During the quarter, Brakes performed well amidst a challenging environment in the U.K. and is continuing to make progress in their supply chain transformational efforts. Growth in France remains steady, and Sweden continues to produce favorable results. Additionally, we continue to see opportunities for growth across our European business. Lastly, although we are in the early days of integrating our Ireland businesses, things are progressing well, and we expect to achieve modest benefits from that integration.","Looking to Canada, we are pleased with our performance despite the continued softness in Alberta which has been driven primarily by the energy market decline. Our Canadian business overall is leveraging the many learnings and successes of our U.S.-focused initiatives and is now implementing many of them. For example, we've introduced the category management and revenue management processes, and we are offering multi-channel ordering via online and telephony, as we provide our customers the ability to choose how they order from Sysco. These initiatives are a few examples of how we are enhancing our customers' experience, as we support the growth of our local business.","In addition, we are effectively managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses to improve productivity. As a result, we expect the Canadian business to continue to deliver improving positive performance.","Turning to Latin America, we are excited about new facilities in both Costa Rica and Panama. Specifically in Costa Rica, we have opened 180,000-square foot, state-of-the-art facility with a test kitchen and training facilities. This new space will enable new products and full product lines to be available to our customers, and we're excited about the accelerated growth potential those offerings will deliver.","In summary, our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution, and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our three-year plan.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade for further details.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the third quarter. Our ongoing quality of earnings growth reflects continued momentum from our business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth, and good cost management.","This morning, I like to cover our third quarter results for the company both excluding and including Brakes. For the purpose of comparing to our three-year plan, I'll start with our quarterly results excluding Brakes where we delivered sales growth of 2.3%, gross profit growth of 4.3%, which included margin expansion of 34 basis points, and adjusted operating expense growth of 1.9%, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 13.6%.","We continued to maintain the gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth above 2%, which translated into strong adjusted operating income leverage and continued progress toward achieving our three-year plan objectives. As Tom mentioned earlier, we now expect modest inflation for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 in our U.S. Broadline business. While it is important to note that this change from deflation to inflation can pressure gross margin as a percentage of sales, we do not anticipate inflation to negatively impact our ability to grow gross profit dollars.","Shifting gears, I like to transition to our results for the quarter including Brakes. Sales grew 12.7%, and gross profit dollars grew 18.3%, while adjusted operating expenses grew 19.3%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 14.3%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 10.9%. On an adjusted basis, our Brakes Group operations contributed approximately $0.01 per share to our consolidated earnings per share this quarter. As Tom noted earlier, Brakes performed well during the quarter and continues to make progress in their transformational efforts.","The reason the performance was accretive rather than dilutive, which was our original expectation for the third quarter, was largely related to changes in deferred taxes for our European business. Additionally, there are negative tax impacts to our domestic business, also driven by changes in deferred taxes. As a result, our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35%, compared to 34.3% in the prior-year period. These changes, along with increased interest expense, ultimately impacted our adjusted earnings per share growth of 10.9%.","Cash flow from operations was $1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2017, which was $36 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2017 was $630 million which was $11 million lower compared to the same period last year. These changes are largely due to improved business performance, improved working capital, and favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the US Foods termination payment last year, offset by higher cash taxes from deductions related to the US Foods settlement and a deferral from flood relief.","Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks was $395 million. We now expect the total CapEx for FY 2017 to be in the range of approximately 1% to 1.1% of total sales, slightly above our previous guidance. Investments have been related to capital improvements in the business, including supply chain opportunities at Brakes.","Net working capital performance has continued to improve. We have improved net DSO by 2.7 days compared to fiscal year 2015, driven by improvements in all three areas: payables, receivables and inventory. As a reminder, we are measuring these results ex-Brakes, consistent with our three-year planned targets.","Our third quarter results include certain items that were related to the Brakes acquisition, including amortization associated with the transaction and accelerated depreciation related to our revised business technology strategy. As a reminder, the accelerated depreciation will continue through the end of fiscal 2017.","One last item before closing. This month, Sysco voluntarily withdrew from a multi-employer pension plan previously disclosed in our 10-K, and has recorded a $35.6 million withdrawal liability subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We consider this fourth quarter charge to operating expense as a certain item.","In summary, we had another high-quality quarter reflecting continued momentum from our business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business, which will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term.","Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO capital. Your line is open.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the independence, I guess, a little bit. Always hard to gauge, but with 3.5% growth there, very strong. I was just curious if you feel like you gained some share there with that customer this quarter, and anything to call out that you think is driving that that you're doing or regional trends or types of restaurants that are really kind of outperforming among that group.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Hey, good morning, Kelly. It's Tom. Thanks for the question. So, let's start with \u2013 I think we feel really good about the work we've continued to do in this segment. And if you think about where we said we'd be on our three-year plan, we're right where we've said we would be, which is around 2.5% local case growth. So, obviously, good quarter this quarter. And what I would say is I think over the three-year time, our goal was to continue to gain share in this space, and I feel like we continue to make progress there. But I think what I'd attribute it to is continued just execution of our strategy. If you think about these customers, we've been very focused on them. I think our value proposition is resonating with them. And I think based on that, we're seeing more and more customers support Sysco and partner with us.","If you think about new business growth, we're also seeing some new business growth in this space. But overall, I would say it's really just more consistent continuation of the work we've been doing, and I think we're seeing the recognition of that effort with these customers.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. And then, I guess just to follow up on that with the core gross margin expansion of 34 basis points, I guess a little bit slower than the past couple quarters. So, can you comment a little bit more on the drivers there and also elaborate on that comment about potentially the return of inflation maybe weighing on gross profit margin percentage but not impacting gross dollar profit growth? I think there's still a lot of confusion on that front, if you could talk about that a little bit.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Okay, I'll start and then I'll toss it to Joel for some of the further discussion around the deflation and inflation. So, I think gross margin percentage, yes, it probably slowed a little bit versus where we've been, but I think still very strong. And I think you are starting to see a little bit of impact of that starting to move from deflation to inflation that could be impacting that. But just as a reminder, the areas we continue to talk about regarding gross margin improvement are the category management effort we've had for a few years now, continued improvement in Sysco Brands. So, you saw again additional growth in Sysco Brand with our local customers. Obviously, that shift of mix to higher local case growth versus corporate multi-unit is going to impact that as well.","And then, obviously, now revenue management is kind of part of the way we operate day in and day out. So, I think those are all key drivers, what continues even as we start to see a little bit of slowing of the deflationary environment start to happen.","Why don't I toss it to Joel? He can talk a little bit about some of the categories that are starting to shift a bit. You heard me talk a little bit about it and then maybe just idea of gross margin dollars versus just gross margin percent.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, so, Kelly, the question you asked in terms of the impacts, yeah, just as a reminder, the deflation tends to impact the margin percentage, and so we've seen some benefits over the last few quarters that we've called out the impact of deflation on our margin percentage. But we typically would see that as a headwind in terms of the gross profit dollars. As we shift to more modestly inflationary environment, one of the things I think you \u2013 again, and certainly I called this out in my script as well, we do anticipate some impact on the margin percentage, which we began to see in this quarter, but we certainly also do not consider that an impediment to growth in our gross profit dollars.","And so, again, we've talked oftentimes in this industry that a couple percent of inflation is what we would view as the \u2013 some of the optimal state. In other words, so an opportunity where costs that come through to us, we can pass to our customers, our customers can pass to theirs. And so, I wouldn't look at this more the return of inflation in a negative way. Again, gross profit dollars, we certainly feel good about our ability to generate. Again, we may see erosion in our margins.","To Tom's point, in terms of product categories, just remember again, we talk about one number, but it's certainly made up of a lot of different product categories. And some of the things that you're seeing here is some lesser level of deflation in our meat area, though that area still is deflating. But other areas such as produce, and we've seen some in bacon and other product categories that are continuing to actually accelerate in their inflationary characteristics. And so, all told, again, looking at some more modest levels of inflation as we head into the fourth quarter.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Kelly, this is Bill. I just would add that in addition to everything these guys just took you through, we're now talking about gross margin improvement over gross margin improvement. So, there's a little bit of math in this thing right now in terms of year-over-year comparisons. So, we're actually quite pleased with the performance. And to Joel's point, I think the 4% gross profit dollar growth we feel very good about, and that's been a target of ours. And so, I think whether it's modest deflation or modest inflation, we certainly want to stay locked in on growing the gross profit dollars. So, I would just say that as we get back into some modest inflation, if we can hold the margins flat, little up, little down, that type of thing, I think we'll be pleased with that. And you should see a very good gross profit dollar growth.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is open.","Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Just wondering, given the growth that you're seeing, and I mean it looks like the momentum is here to stay for a little bit. Can you just give us an update on where you're at from a capacity perspective? How much more whittling down, I guess, you have to do with some of your less profitable customers? And then, I had a follow-up.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Good morning, Karen. This is Tom. So, I assume when you say capacity, you're just talking about overall warehouse capacity?","Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","And so, I would say we are fine in that regard. You heard me talk kind of over the quarters about different efforts we're talking where we may have some capacity constraints to get more capacity out of our facilities and more throughput, and a lot of those initiatives in our supply chain area have been working very well. So, we're going to continue to focus on those where we have challenges. But we think we feel very comfortable at this point about our ability to not only handle our existing customers but continue to grow this business within our current footprint.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","I think one of the things you did hear \u2013 Karen, it's Joel \u2013 from us also is this approach to a disciplined approach to growth. And certainly, part of that is around the idea of a very thoughtful and carefully thinking about opportunities where they may exist to either add or retain, and how that fits in with the overall network of facilities that we have. So, again, certainly, something we do consider. But again, as Tom said, I think we're in a decent place there.","Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, I just wanted to switch gears to SYGMA for a second. Because SYGMA was up, I mean, decently on tougher comparisons. So, wondering what kind of drove that shift suddenly in the quarter.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Well, you heard me talk over the first couple quarters about some of the challenges we've had in the SYGMA business. And some of that had to do with some of the operational aspects of the business specific to certain customers, and also the deflationary environment we've seen. So, I think as you start to see some of that deflation slowing as we talk, there's some benefit we're seeing there. And we continue to focus on improving our operational effectiveness. I'd say that those are probably the two biggest drivers of the kind of shift in our performance, although I would say while we feel better about the quarter, we still feel like we have a lot of opportunity in the SYGMA side of the business.","Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start with some operational expenses, including Brakes. They came in a little bit higher than expected. How much of that was Brakes, and is there anything else to note during the quarter that might have drove higher OpEx?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","No. I mean, I think part of what you may be seeing in the Brakes, again, if you remember there is some seasonality in that business. And so, some of the things you see there is just on a smaller base of business as a higher relative expense. But I \u2013 I would not say there's anything of any significance there at all in terms of that comparison. It's really more related to what I talked about there in the smaller business. I think we're very pleased overall with our expense performance.","Again, we maintained a gap in our overall business in the nearly 2.5% to 2.5 points between our gross profit dollar growth or operating expense growth. Again, as Tom pointed out, on a cost per case basis with our U.S. Broadline, we came in actually, on a fuel adjusted basis, $0.01 better, which is actually a little better than the goal we talked about of a flat cost per case. So, in general, I would just tell you what you're seeing there again is a little bit more reflective of the smaller businesses seasonality as it is anything else. But overall, we're very pleased with the expense results.","Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And if I could just follow up on the topic of deflation. As you've started to see it come back in some categories like dairy or produce, have you been able to pass along the higher product cost to your customers? And are you generally seeing rationality in the \u2013 amongst your competition when it comes to passing through the return of inflation?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","This is Tom. Yeah, I'd say, Marisa, that we're \u2013 again, we're talking about mild numbers at this point, and as Joel said earlier, this industry historically, I think, operates pretty well at these kind of lower inflation levels. So, we're not seeing anything that would concern us right now about our ability to pass along those prices. I mean, in the category like produce, when you get some of the weather issues they had in California earlier this year, you'll get some spikes in certain areas that have to be kind of managed closely. But generally speaking, we feel fine about how it's affecting the business right now.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I would actually distinguish dairy and produce from other items in our mix. Those are very volatile items, dairy maybe even more than produce at times. So, I think in the course of 12 months, Marisa, you could see those go up and down within that period. As I think we alluded to, the meat, center-of-plate items, obviously, high dollar boxes there. They drive a lot of this thing over the medium to long term. Still some modest deflation going on in the meat side, but we would expect that to continue to turn in that direction as well. So, I would look more in terms of long-term thoughts on deflation more in terms of wait and see on the center-of-plate items. And I think dairy and produce will, for other reasons, be up and down from time to time.","Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. So, I guess, I'm just looking to tackle capital allocation here. I think you've essentially exhausted your $3 billion ASR at this point. Can you just remind us of what you have remaining for just general buyback programs and then potentially update us on your order of importance when it comes to capital allocation?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Sure, be happy to. So, we think about capital allocation really in number of few key priorities, starting with investing in our business. And so, certainly technologies, facilities, fleets, et cetera, those are the kinds of things that, as we talked about today, actually are getting our CapEx numbers even up slightly, and that certainly reflects our continued emphasis on reinvesting in our business as a key priority. Certainly, dividend was a key part of our strategy that obviously is very important to a large part of our investor base, and remain committed to growth in our dividend as we have over a long time in this company.","Pursuing strategic M&A, and both in our core space and adjacencies and additional geographies certainly remains a key focus of this company. And then, to the points you're bringing up, again what I call a balanced view between paying down debt and buying back shares is really the other key component of our capital allocation. I think the question specifically you asked, so just as a key point, we're a good majority of the way through the two-year $3 billion ASR that we announced a couple years ago, following the termination of the US Foods merger. I would call our share repurchase strategy opportunistic. That would certainly fall into that category. And in addition to that type of repurchase, we also, as a reminder, do continually repurchase shares to offset option dilution. So, hopefully, that...","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Yeah. And then, I guess, just my second question as it relates to case growth itself. If I recall in the last earnings call, you guys were actually sounding a bit cautious heading into this quarter itself. But obviously with the results, they were really quite impressive and must have seen some nice acceleration in the month of March. I'm just curious if you can provide any real color on the case growth cadence and if you've seen some continued trends quarter-to-date.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I'll start here, Chris. And kick it to Tom, since I'm usually the one who's most cautious. So, part of the reason for the caution, we had had a couple quarters where we were between 1.5% to 2% case growth. And we were heading into a quarter, being the March quarter, that's a hard quarter to predict early in the quarter, March, because of the seasonality within the quarter, March is a big, big percentage of the overall sales and earnings. And we'd had a pretty mild winter the year before. So, we were a little bit cautious. At the same time, the point I made and I will continue to make, Tom mentioned it as well in his prepared comments, is we feel very good where we are in the three-year plan, and frankly, where we are in our plan for this year. We're running about 2.5% local case growth over the seven quarters now and over the three quarters for this year.","And we would love for people to kind of look at us the way we look at the business, which is we've got a three-year plan and it'll be a rolling three-year plan over time. And there's going to be some ebbs and flows in any individual quarter or even couple quarters in a row. But overall, we're running this business certainly for the long term, but also understanding that we've got some three-year financial objectives out there. So, we're very pleased with what we're seeing here. We've got some good momentum, as we said in our earlier comments. And I'll let Tom give you a little more color on that.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Chris, I think the only thing I'd really add was more \u2013 and some of that caution might have also been around the corporate multi-unit because at the time, we had been slowing in that area. We obviously rely heavily on how each of those concepts themselves perform. And so, I think that's always something that we are thoughtful about as we go into any quarter. So, I don't think there's much else to add to what Bill said. I think we feel really good about where we're at, and I feel like we've got good momentum which is important going forward.","Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC","All right. Best of luck, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, maybe for Tom. When you look at the local case growth, roughly how much of that is coming from existing customers? Could it be two-thirds or 70% or something in that ballpark? And then, maybe talk a little bit about growing share with those existing customers going forward, both from other broadliners and then specialty distributors. Does one have more potential than the other?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Hey, John, good morning. So, look, I think \u2013 let me say a couple things. One, I'd say, we definitely feel like we are improving our level of penetration with our customers, which is selling more to our existing customers. To give you a number on what percentage, I think that's probably a bit of a stretch and...","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","But I think we feel like we are continuing to further penetrate and gain our share of wallet with those customers. And we obviously are growing new customers and adding customers to the portfolio as well. So, I think we have a good balance of both of those working, and I think we feel really comfortable with where that's at. As far as where that's coming from, it comes from a lot of different places. It's hard to, again, peg, is it just in the specialty area? I think we continue to perform well in the specialty areas. But I also would say that the broadline business is really doing very well. And a lot of what you see is the sheer size of our broadline business especially in the U.S. That's where a lot of the growth is going to come from, is from more within our existing customers and certainly picking up some new business from other broadline competitors.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","John, the other thing I would add there, which kind of gets buried in these numbers as well is we're having the best year we've ever had on retention of local customers, off of a very good year last year. So, it's all of the above. You certainly always want to have new business coming in. But in addition to penetration, we're managing the current portfolio very well.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then, maybe just shifting gears a little bit. On to Brakes, I guess we knew it was seasonal, maybe we didn't appreciate how seasonal. But you think about the amount of deleverage there, is it solely that deleverage or is there a mix issue as well? And does it have to be that seasonal? You sort of wonder, is there an opportunity for you to do things somewhat differently, and so it's not so skewed, 3Q versus the first half?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I mean, John, I think \u2013 I mean, first of all, this is Joel. I mean, this \u2013 as you know, it's our first full year of this acquisition.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","So, we're certainly seeing some of those things for ourselves for the first time as well. But I would just say, again, if \u2013 keep in mind, just in terms of the order of magnitude of the size of their business, there's certain fixed costs that size leverages in different ways. And so, I think there's always going to be an element of some of that. And I think that's \u2013 but certainly to your point, I mean, there are things that as we go along, we'll continue to find ways to try to take a little of that seasonality out. Now, we did anticipate it. Again, last quarter, we called it out that certainly the second half of what is our fiscal year is a weaker time for them, particularly in our third quarter. So, again, we certainly anticipated some of that. But again, over time we'll certainly get smarter there, and look to find ways to continue to drive a little less seasonality in the business. But it certainly is inherently there.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, John, I think on that one, to Joel's point, we need to get through 12 months with this business and kind of really understand their cycles. I think the top line probably will remain pretty seasonal. There's some CapEx we need to invest in over there. We need to better understand how they work with their big customers and their suppliers. So, I think over time there may be an opportunity for us to better understand, not just the seasonality, but the efficiency of some of these things and \u2013 so hopefully, as we get into the fourth quarter and we talk to you in August, we'll have a better handle on that. But I think, over the next year or so, it will still take some time to work through some of that, and we'll give you the best guidance that we can.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on the international front. Quite a bit of commentary upfront just around kind of the opportunities and the different geographies. Any further color you could provide at this point in terms of kind of either timing effort or capital that may be allocated to those, that would be great.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","I think I was the one who was so effusive upfront there, Vinny. So, I'll start. I think Tom hit on up some of it. I mean, we certainly feel good with some of the earnings momentum that we have up in Canada right now. We've had to go in there and obviously look at our cost structure pretty aggressively, and we continue to do that. As Tom also mentioned, some of the initiatives that we've rolled out now for a couple, three years, and four years really in cat man's case, we're looking at how to deploy those in Canada in a way that makes sense for that country and that market.","And there's some things that we're already doing up there with the telephone sales and that type of thing. So, we're learning from Canada and vice versa. And so we feel good about that. The Latin American business, a couple joint ventures, Bahamas, smaller in scale but exciting in terms of what we see over the medium to long term down there in terms of growth potential, new facilities in Costa Rica and Panama, that kind of thing coming up. So, that's really what I was talking about.","And then, we just talked about Brakes, and lot of opportunity in Brakes. There's going to be opportunities to certainly improve how we execute over there. I think there's going to be some investment opportunities. And at the same time, we still think from an acquisition platform standpoint, it's just a tremendous vehicle for us to do more in Europe over time.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, maybe just following up on that, Bill, and thank you for the commentary. Just on kind of on the international margin, I know you said, obviously seasonality, still early, still learning, Brakes specifically. But that it was a bit lower, of course, in 3Q. Anything else to call out outside of just kind of continuing to work through Brakes, and how we should just kind of generally think about that profitability in that line of business kind of on a go-forward basis?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","I don't think so right now. I'll let Joel weigh in. We're just now beginning our planning process for next year with them. So, I think as we finish up this year, like I said a minute ago and as we get into their planning process, to the extent that there're some nuances here or some things that we think we can maybe work with them to do better or differently, we'll certainly give you some guidance there. Joel?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, Bill, I actually don't really have anything else to add to that. I just think it's, in general, again \u2013 just always remember, again, order of magnitude, a little bit smaller businesses, so more impacted by some of the cost structure and smaller volume quarters. But other than that, there's \u2013 again, we'll keep getting smarter about this, as Bill said, and I talked about earlier. At least, again, we've had these people as part of our company now for not even a year yet, and so we'll continue to be able to refine our talking points around that and hopefully give you guys continued clarity as we go forward.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, fellas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, hi, guys, good morning.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Hi, Ed.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Bill, last quarter, obviously, the market hated the fact that your total case growth was roughly flat. And then, this quarter, it really kind of came back pretty good. You had talked about, post Q2, about the multi-unit side. And I think if I remember correctly, some business that didn't renew because you didn't like the pricing. Did something else happen this quarter? Was there a new business here to fill the void? Just thoughts around that. And then, as we think about total case growth going forward, I think what a lot of us were doing we're kind of assuming that you'd be flattish to up modestly for three quarters now. And it doesn't seem like that's going to be the case. So, I guess, how should we be thinking about this going forward? Was Q2 just an anomaly?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","I don't believe in anomalies. So, I won't say that. I can't say that with all of our people listening right now, Ed. But now, look, let me start, and I'll have Tom give you a little more color on the large account, what we call the CMU part of the math here in a little bit. But I think the way we should be thinking about it is the way we're trying to run it here, which is we've got these three-year targets, and we have an annual plan. And we bifurcate it today, because when we talk about disciplined, profitable, sustainable growth, we really run this thing, even though we run them out of our operating companies, we run them differently. And a lot of the large accounts, they're much more complex relationships and they're longer term generally. And there's going to be normal ebbs and flows in those negotiations as well. And while we've done a great job over the years growing that business, and frankly, retaining the business, when you do lose an account or two accounts, even if you are maybe the catalyst in that transition, i.e., Sysco, that's going to make an impact over, not just one quarter, but a couple quarters. And obviously, perpetually, you're always bringing on new business. Hopefully it's not four quarters, so you have a chance to mitigate it.","So, I think you're seeing a little bit of that with the new business offsetting. I'll let Tom go there. I think the bigger point is more on the local side, which is we're looking to grow that, in the current three-year plan, 2.5% or more. And if you go back and look at Q1 and Q2, we were between 1.5% and 2%. So, we certainly weren't where we needed to be, and I think now you're seeing a strong quarter here in the third quarter. And so far, this quarter we're seeing similar types of results.","So, when we talk about momentum, that's really what we're talking about there and our ability to leverage it. So, feel good about the local case growth, feel good about our ability to leverage it. Feel very good about where we are, relative to our three-year plan.","And I just think the CMU side of it, the way I'd like you to think about it is we're managing this in a very disciplined way. We're not trying to get rid of customers. We're trying to work with customers in a way where we can grow, support their growth in a way that's profitable for both of us. But to the extent that there is turnover in that account base, it will impact the numbers a little more significantly.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I don't think I have really that much to add. I think Bill answered that pretty well. The only thing I'd go back to, we've said earlier around the local, is we feel like we're very focused on improving our share wallet with our existing customers, and we're seeing good momentum there. And then, sure, we're always looking at new business opportunities in that space. But I would say it's not anything unique or different this quarter than what we've been doing. I think we just feel like we've got good momentum, and we're continuing to execute our plan accordingly.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then, just one quick follow-up. And we're kind of beating a dead horse a little bit here, but it's probably worth it. As you think about inflation and deflation and your goal to drive gross profit dollar growth, a couple hundred basis points faster than SG&A, you would rather have an inflationary backdrop than a deflationary backdrop in order to achieve that, number one. And then, number two, sounds like you'd encourage us to really think more about, as we analyze you as a company, more about how you're achieving that gap and how you're growing gross profit dollars over really what your gross margin is doing in any given quarter. Is all that fair?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","I would say yes and yes. And on the first one, what we would prefer is modest inflation, let's call it low-single digit, Ed.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. I'm curious if you have any thoughts on the disconnect between the improving consumer confidence trends, yet underlying restaurant traffic, particularly chains, looks to be pretty choppy. I'm curious if you think there's been any change out there with regard to the reallocation of consumer wallet. And if you see this variability as more temporary or if you think restaurant spending can reaccelerate from here going forward.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I'll take a stab at that, Zack. It's hard. I mean, it's hard to really get a handle on it. These trends aren't exactly new, so I think the traffic phenomenon, it's probably \u2013 it's been a few quarters now where we've seen somewhat less traffic. It's not dramatic, but a little bit less. But the nice thing is the check amount is covering that, and we're still seeing some real growth at the restaurant level. It obviously changes from subsegment to subsegment from quarter to quarter. And obviously, within the individual operators.","I think the good news here is while there's consumer confidence or some of the other feedback we get from surveys we do with restaurant operators that we participate in, it is positive. So, I think you always want to be in an environment where people are looking forward or feeling better about things. And I think that's a good thing. So, if the economy can continue to at least move along even modestly and if that translates into our business, that will keep our customers positive and obviously that keeps the business in a good way. So, I think right now, we'll take it. It would be good to see a little more traffic. But the fact that people are positive is very good.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","The only thing, Zack \u2013 this is Joel \u2013 that I could add, just to remind you and others, yeah, and we certainly talk about restaurants, as we should, frequently. But always keep in mind, about a third of the business is actually outside of the restaurant space, as well. So, things like healthcare, thing \u2013 sports stadiums, universities. Those types of government institutions. And I only just say that as a reminder that some of the opportunity we have is part of Sysco's kind of what we've begun portfolio diversification, if you want to call it that, and the ability to have some level of buffering, if you want to call it that, and some of those trends. So, just as a reminder. No other comment there.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Joel. And I had a couple housekeeping items. Sorry, if I missed this. But what was the specific impact of deflation in the U.S. this quarter? And then, also, with respect to the volume uptick, was the U.S. Broadline all organic growth for the most part, or was there any small M&A or anything like that in there as well?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","So, I can take that. (50:16) I'll call it slightly deflationary for the quarter. And the other one I would consider \u2013 there's some M&A growth, not a large amount. So, it's considered mostly organic.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, Joel. Appreciate the time, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Obviously, your cost per case continues to come down. Expense management has been pretty strong. Are you guys seeing any signs of the labor cost inflation in the U.S.? Any indications that you're seeing upward pressure on wages in any of your markets?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Well, certainly, our customers have been experiencing that for a year or two now. So, that's been one of the benefits of the deflation, is that we've been able to work with our customers well on that while they were incurring a fair amount of labor increase. As far as our labor costs go, to your point, Shane, we're managing it very aggressively. And I would say we're doing a decent job managing both the head count as well as the costs. So, we're keeping those in line. We're a heavily incentive-based company. So, when the company performs, our people do well, our sales people are on commission. So, it's a heavily incentivized cost structure here on the payroll side.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","I think the only thing I'd add \u2013 this is Tom \u2013 is that the minimum wage changes you might see around that Bill referenced that certainly impacted some of our customers, don't really impact us much because we're generally well above the minimum wage with all of our employees.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then, just a quick follow-up on your M&A outlook. I know that's \u2013 still you mentioned it was a strategic priority. What are you guys seeing today in terms of the M&A environment? Just any color you could give. Do you guys see a lot of willing sellers out there? And do you anticipate more opportunities over the next year?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","I think the first thing we see is a pretty wide open space for us, both domestically and international. So, it comes down to prioritization and just the right kind of acquisitions whether they're what we call fold-ins into our broadline, additional businesses that can complement the specialty companies that we have or international. So, there's plenty of opportunity.","Obviously, over the last couple of years, three years, really we've been more locked in on some larger deals. So, we're remobilizing our team here to staff up for going out and being \u2013 if not more aggressive, certainly broader in our thinking up and down the line in terms of opportunities there, as I said. So, we think there's good opportunity. How that translates into (52:59) acquisitions, that's always a little bit more difficult to predict. You need willing sellers. You need an environment where they can take their proceeds and reinvest them in a way that works for them. But we think it's actually a very good environment right now for acquisitions.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Kirk with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you for taking the question. It sounds like you're pretty confident in your ability to pass food inflation to your customers. But how do you feel about their ability to then pass it on to the final consumer in the face of some of their existing traffic deceleration?","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I think what we've seen over the years, and this really just comes from data that we see \u2013 industry data, that kind of thing, is that most restauranteurs and the restaurant industry in general, and then to Joel's point, that's only about 60% of our customer base or revenue stream. It's a very interesting phenomenon. Year in and year out, they pass on about 2%. And so, when you hear me talk about \u2013 and we've been saying this quite consistently for years. When you hear us talk about low-single digit or modest inflation being a good environment, that's good for our customers, and therefore, it's good for us. And so, I think if it stays at those levels, they should be able to pass it along reasonably well. If it were to go back up to the 4 or 5s, that becomes more difficult. And obviously, in our situation, you don't necessarily pass it all along every day. It depends on the category and that kind of thing. But within a reasonable period of time in a modest inflation environment, I would agree that we should be able to cover it.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","I think the only thing I'd add is just keep in mind, I mean, we are still in a deflationary point with meat. And again, a couple of the other categories. Again, we talk about dairy, produce, some of those, to Joel's point earlier, tend to be more volatile in general. So, again, I still think we're certainly in a decent place there. And again, certainly a modest inflation level is something we feel good about in this industry.","William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's all for me. Thank you.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Yeah, hi, good morning. Obviously, with Brakes, you did better than expected in Q3. I was just wondering if you can give an update on your outlook for Brakes in the fourth quarter. To what degree you expect Brakes to be a net tailwind or a drag on earnings?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah. So, thanks for the question. Yeah, it's \u2013 so, again, as we guided previously, we certainly anticipated that the second half of their year \u2013 again, certainly second half of our fiscal year, if you want to call it that, would be less favorable in terms of accretion than the first half, where we also \u2013 we talked about that as \u2013 in particular, the third quarter, we expected some modest dilution. And then, that in the fourth quarter, we expected some modest level of accretion. So, we certainly maintain that belief as we head into the fourth quarter.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. And as a follow-up, it looks like adjusted operating expenses outpaced gross profit dollar growth for the first time, I think, in about six quarters by about 100 basis points. And I know you've already gotten some questions about this and you called out seasonality with Brakes in response to one of the earlier questions. But the fact is, Brakes was accretive, so can you give any clarification on what's driving the higher","relative expense growth to gross profit, and if this is some kind of inflection point?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, I'd just \u2013 again, as I mentioned earlier, there's nothing there that I would call out as something that I would consider any type of inflection point or change point there. Again, I would just tell you that, in general, in a quarter, our smallest, their smallest, it tends to be a little less leverage on cost than there are in some of the other quarters. Again, our core business actually had very strong leverage between gross profit dollar growth and expenses. I don't anticipate \u2013 again, there's really nothing to call out there, honestly, in terms of that (57:43) business outside of this.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, just keep in mind, I think everyone knows this because you're probably ahead of me on your modeling, but Brakes is a higher gross profit, higher expense business. So, when you get into a quarter where you have this seasonality, which is even more pronounced than our seasonality, that's going to accentuate that even more. But that's really why we break it out the way we do. We're actually quite pleased with how we manage the expenses from the core business, if you will, to Brakes to the corporate office. So, I would say right now, we're feeling good about the expenses. We need to keep growing the gross profit, keep that spread, to Joel's point. But that is totally consistent with what we talk about. We talk about discipline. We talk about that and the customer mix, and we talk about profitable. In this business, what we mean with profitable is to keep that spread there. So, overall, we feel fine on the expenses.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Hey, if I could ask one final question. I just wanted to clarify a comment from your prepared remarks. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought you mentioned that accelerated depreciation for SAP would continue through Q4. So, does that mean the add-back for depreciation ends in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, or do you continue to benefit from technology restructuring next year, and by that, I mean incrementally benefit next year?","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Well, so, again, I think the comment there was around the fact that we actually have, as we talked about during the announcement of our revised technology strategy, that because of that and because we're moving away from the SAP platform, that there would be actually accelerated depreciation that we would reflect up until the end of our fiscal 2017. And then, at that point is when we are actually completed with that transition which we are certainly on track to do. And so, the accelerated depreciation that you're seeing in our numbers will end, if you will, at the end of fiscal 2017. And then, there would be some level of benefit we would see from that although, again, I think, as we've talked about that as well, there're some opportunity to reinvest in additional technologies, particularly around customer facing. But to answer your question directly, the accelerated depreciation that you're seeing ends at the end of this year, and you will not be seeing that starting fiscal 2018.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","And it's all embedded in the three-year plan targets.","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Correct.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just another question on gross profit per case. And looking at the gap between inflation, assuming moderate deflation by 1% or something like that, it looks like the gap between gross profit per case and the rate per case growth came in pretty sharply this quarter, still positive but smaller than it's been, which you wouldn't necessarily expect given the sort of favorable mix shifts in the business. I don't know if there is anything you can do to help us decompose how much of that would be related to just the multi-unit piece of the business, or just help us understand why that sort of trend changed. Thanks.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","This is Tom. You might have to help a little bit with \u2013 so, you talk about gross profit per case which we don't really talk about. Are you talking about gross margin and the slowing of the gross margin percent improvement?","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, you can look at gross profit growth and gross profit growth versus case growth, and get an idea of what gross profit per case growth looks like. And the gap between that has been running 500 basis points or so ahead of \u2013 in the U.S. Broadline business. 500 basis points or so ahead of inflation or deflation the last couple of quarters. And then, this quarter (01:01:23) like 200 basis points. So, a pretty sharp compression. If you can help us understand what could be driving that.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","I don't really see anything unique or different from what we've been talking about. I think it's obviously the mix of our business continues to drive some of the change. That's certainly, as we talked about, on the gross margin percentage also lapping. We're year-over-year now lapping growth rate upon growth rate from a gross margin percentage perspective. But I guess the last thing I'd say is we feel very good about our 4% gross profit growth in the U.S., and I think relative to the overall case growth that we're seeing, which was slightly below 2% for that same gross profit growth. So, I think we feel very good about where we're at. Joel, if you have anything to add (01:02:13).","Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, Karen, I think \u2013 this is Joel. I mean, the main thing I would continue to focus on here is around the \u2013 again, as we talked about, the growth in gross profit dollars and that growth relative to our operating expense dollars. And so, the reason we keep talking about that is at the end of the day, whether it's inflation, deflation, et cetera, that gap certainly drives the efficiency in operating margin. And that's certainly, again, something we're very pleased with. And so, I would just continue to remain focused on those things that really ultimately drive the operating profitability.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. The question was on the market share that you're taking relative to the broad foodservice distribution industry. Is it happening in some of the smaller independents finally where they're just having a difficult time keeping up with merchandising and technology, and maybe, for lack of a better word, poor sellers of their business to you? And then, secondly, and I think related, and about an hour ago, Tom, you talked about improved e-commerce capabilities for your independent restaurants. And just hoping to get an update on that, and whether you're seeing gradual improvement or maybe something more of step function in terms of how things are changing on that front. Thanks.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","Sure. So, I'd say, just back on the market share. So, we obviously are very focused on continuing to grow our share across the business. I think, as you know, there are lots of competitors out there. So, to isolate in one area or another is really hard to do, given we compete with so many different types of folks, literally market by market. So, I would just say that we continue to be focused on delivering the right value proposition for those customers, which includes all the things that I've been talking about. So, I won't reiterate all of those.","One, in particular, that you did ask about was where we're at on the technology rollout, and we continue to feel really positive about that. We're now seeing across our local customers around 25% of those customers ordering via our online applications. So, we feel really good about the progress we're making, and we continue to feel like that's going to be an area that we'll continue to see growth. But we also \u2013 I want to remind everyone that our approach and our strategy around this is to do this in a way that supports whatever our customers are looking for, meaning giving them choice. Whether that's through online or that's through the marketing associate or through some other way of ordering with us. But we feel great about the progress we continue to make and think it's a combination of all those things that are helping us continue to gain momentum.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Steve Gojak with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steven Ivan Gojak - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Just two quick questions. Just on the corporate management case growth, what was that this quarter, and any impact from customer exits or wins there versus, I believe, the minus 2% last quarter? And then, secondly, just your thoughts on the competitive environment in the third quarter versus the last several quarters. Any change there in it being more or less aggressive. And then, within that, following up to a prior question, as you move from an inflationary environment to a deflationary environment, those competitive pressures, and then the cost and demand pressures on the restaurant operators themselves impact the ability to pass through any sort of price increase or inflation, again, even though you're seeing modest inflation right now? Thank you.","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","I guess, let me start with \u2013 we don't communicate the actual numbers on our corporately managed growth. But you know roughly from our prior conversations, we're around 50\/50 on our local versus CMU business. And so, we talked about our local and U.S. Broadline being up 3.5%, and our total of 1.8%. So, you can surmise from there. I missed kind of the second part of that, I think it had to do with the inflation-deflation...","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Kind of environment, how would that be accentuated by inflation?","Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.","So, I don't think \u2013 I mean, we've talked about, it remains highly competitive out there. I don't think that the inflation or deflationary environment necessarily affects or changes that competitive nature and who we're competing with. We all deal with some of those impacts as an industry. And obviously, all of us have our way of dealing with those.","William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.","Yeah, look, Steve, I think that's probably the best answer we have here. Our focus always starts with the customer. So, as their challenges become greater, certainly they probably put more pressure on their suppliers. But we also think that's an opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves relative to many of our competitors, if not all, in terms of what our offerings are across products and services and just basic relationship management that we've done for years.","Steven Ivan Gojak - Cleveland Research Co.

I'd like to start off this morning with an overview of our third quarter performance and a discussion around our business segment and the key highlights for the quarter. Following that, Joel will cover the financial results in further detail.","Overall, we are pleased with our overall operating and financial performance for the third quarter. We delivered improved year-over-year growth in line with our expectations and managed costs well including the ongoing cost savings associated with our business transformation initiatives.","The improved pace of performance for the second half of fiscal 2019 we've previously spoke of is in fact taking shape. And while we still have work to do, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted operating income growth target and now expect that to be at the low end of the $650 million to $700 million range. Joel and I will both elaborate on this further.","From a total Sysco perspective, our third quarter results include increased sales of 2.2% to $14.7 billion; gross profit growth of 2.9%; and adjusted operating expense decrease of 0.4%, which translated into an adjusted operating income increase of 16.6% to $620 million; and an adjusted earnings per share increase of 17.4% to $0.79.","Turning to U.S. restaurant industry data. The overall sales trends remained mixed. According to Black Box and Knapp Track, we saw some choppiness throughout the quarter as March data was generally positive compared to February in part due to weather, which negatively impacted February sales. Additionally same-store sales were positive for the quarter, although traffic once again declined. However, even with this recent choppy industry performance, the overall macro trends remained generally favorable for our customers as illustrated by continued low unemployment which was at 3.8% for March and strong GDP growth for the first quarter at 3.2%.","Economic growth in the international markets in which we operate was mostly positive. This includes modest growth in the foodservice sector, although we continue to see the impacts of Brexit on our U.K. business due to uncertainty and low consumer confidence.","In Canada, the consumer confidence index continues to rise with March seeing the third consecutive monthly increase with Technomic forecasting the Canadian foodservice industry to grow 0.6% in real terms or 4.1% on a nominal basis for calendar year 2019.","Additionally, we continue to see reasonable overall trends in the other international markets where we do business. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipated seeing an increased benefit from our transformation initiatives beginning in the second half of this year and we began to see those benefits show up this quarter. Overall our results included a bit softer top line than expected offset by good overall expense management which delivered solid operating profit performance that was in line with our expectations.","Examples of initiatives that are driving benefits from an expense management perspective include our field finance transformation and the corporate office administrative restructuring which we implemented last quarter. As it relates to acquisitions, in April we acquired J&M Wholesale Meats and Imperio Foods; two smaller central California distributors.","J&M Meats is a foodservice distributor that specializes in key Center of the Plate products and Imperio Foods carries dry canned good products which both are complementary to our existing Broadline businesses in central California area. They also provide Sysco with the opportunity to further extend our reach to the important Hispanic customer segment. We will begin to see the impact to our business in the fourth quarter from both of these acquisitions.","Additionally in the quarter, we made the decision to sell our Iowa Premium, cattle processing business. While our 3-year plan forecast included positive operating income for this business, we believe the divestiture of this business is in alignment with our strategic priority and allows us to focus on our core strength as a distributor. The transaction will result in a reduction of planned operating income of approximately $25 million and is the reason for us now projecting to achieve the low end of our adjusted operating income growth range.","Now I'd like to transition to our third quarter results by business segment beginning with U.S. Foodservice Operations. Sales for the third quarter were $10.1 billion, an increase of 4.1%. Gross profit grew 5.1% including an improvement in gross margin of 18 basis points. Adjusted operating expenses grew 2.3% and adjusted operating income increased 10%.","Total case volume within U.S. Broadline grew modestly at 2.1% for the quarter, of which 1.3% was organic. However we delivered relatively solid growth in our local business, as local case growth was up 3.1% of which 2.2% was organic.","We are pleased with the gross profit growth we delivered for the quarter which was impacted by a number of factors including continued positive momentum from category management, as we continue to deepen our relationships with our strategic supplier partners; year-over-year favorability from the impact of inbound freight; and continued growth in our Sysco branded products, which increased by 28 basis points with our local customers this quarter. In addition, the inflation rate for the quarter was 2.3% in U.S. Broadline, up nearly 1 point from the second quarter of this fiscal year.","Technology continues to be one of our fundamental enablers of growth, as we transform our business to serve our customers in ways that best meet their needs. We are continuing to provide new capabilities and tools to enable an improved experience of doing business with Sysco, including new ordering tools, which has driven our e-commerce ordering utilization to more than 53% with our local customers.","From a cost perspective, within U.S. Foodservice Operations, our expense management was solid, as adjusted operating expenses were 2.3% for the quarter. While we continue to see Supply Chain cost challenges in the warehouse and transportation areas, we are seeing positive momentum from our recruiting, onboarding and retention initiatives.","These challenges were partially offset by continued improvements seen as a result of our routing optimization initiatives and ongoing process improvements. Furthermore, our finance transformation and smart spending initiative have also provided benefits in the quarter.","Moving on to International Food Service Operations for the quarter. Sales decreased 1.5%. Gross profit decreased 3.1%. Adjusted operating expenses decreased by 5.8% and adjusted operating income grew 30%. We saw solid overall performance in Canada with strong top line growth and solid gross profit dollar growth of more than 5%, driven in part by an inflation rate of 2.6% along with strong expense management, partially benefiting from our ongoing regionalization efforts, which are progressing well.","In Europe, we continue to have mixed results. The U.K. continues to feel the effects of Brexit uncertainty, causing depressed consumer confidence. However, our Brakes U.K. business continues to stabilize operationally as a result of our multi-year initiatives to transform the business. In France, social unrest continues to impact tourism and consequently food-away-from-home consumption.","Our sales performance during the third quarter was adversely impacted by this unrest and by some operational challenges associated with integrating Brake France and Davigel into Sysco France. That said, the overall integration and supply chain transformation continues to be on track to deliver the long-term benefits that are part of our multi-year plan.","As for our business in Latin America, we continue to see growth opportunities in this region, both with our chain restaurant customers and with our expansion of Cash & Carry locations to complement our Broadline footprint in both Costa Rica and Panama.","Moving on to SYGMA. We continue to make disciplined choices in an effort to deliver improved profitability. In Q3, we saw expected softness in the top line due to transition customers, while seeing gross margin increased by 28 basis points year-over-year.","Solid expense management drove adjusted operating expenses down 7.1% versus prior year, resulting in significantly improved operating performance. In an effort to improve overall profitability in this important segment of the business, we will continue to take a very disciplined approach to growth as we move forward.","Lastly, in our other business segment. We recently announced the restructuring of Guest Supply. As the industry landscape evolves, we are focusing on optimizing our business model in creating a more focused and agile organization to better meet the changing needs of our customers.","New operating structure has created three distinct business units under the parent company Guest Worldwide. The business units include Gilchrist & Soames our amenity manufacturing unit; Manchester Mills one of the world's leading textile producers; and Guest Supply which serves the world's top hotel chains and independent properties in over 100 countries as a full spectrum distribution solution provider.","In summary we continue to feel good about the fundamentals of our business. Our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around reaching our customers' experience of doing business with Sysco. And we remain focused on engaging our 67,000 dedicated associates around the world to deliver against our financial objectives associated with our 3-year plan.","Let me now turn the call over to Joel Grade our Chief Financial Officer. ","Joel Grade","Thank you Tom and good morning everyone. I'd like to provide you with additional financial details surrounding our performance for the quarter. As Tom mentioned earlier, we saw improved year-over-year results for the third quarter. Although we saw some softness in the top line, our earnings reflect solid expense management and strong adjusted operating income growth which are in line with what we've previously stated and our results of our enterprise-wide transformational initiatives. These initiatives showed our streamlined efficiencies and allow us to reinvest in the business to facilitate continued growth include, our finance transformation roadmap, smart spending and the Canadian regionalization initiatives.","For the third quarter of fiscal 2019, total Sysco sales grew 2.2%. Foreign exchange rates negatively affected total Sysco sales by approximately 1.1%. In our U.S. Broadline business we experienced 2.3% inflation driven by a few categories including the frozen potato, poultry and meat categories and we are managing this modest increase in inflation well.","Gross profit in third quarter increased 2.9% and gross margin increased 14 basis points while adjusted operating expenses decreased by 0.4% resulting in strong adjusted operating income growth of 16.6% to $620 million. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased adjusted operating income by 34 basis points. Although it will vary from quarter-to-quarter we are focused on maintaining the 150 basis point gap between gross profit dollars and operating expense dollars that we committed to as part of our 3-year plan in order to achieve our adjusted operating income growth targets.","Turning to earnings per share, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased $0.12 to $0.79 per share. Our EPS results this quarter were impacted by our strong operating income, adjusted tax rate, foreign exchange impact and stock option exercises.","I would now like to discuss our tax rate for the quarter. The GAAP effective tax rate of negative 2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily attributable to the termination made during the quarter to recognize the favorable impact of $95 million of foreign tax credit generated as a result of distribution to Sysco from our foreign operations at the end of fiscal 2018. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 21%. Looking to our fourth quarter, we would expect our effective tax rate to be in the 23% to 25% range.","Now turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019, which is $244 million higher compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019 was $1 billion, which was $233 million higher compared to the prior year. The improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to last year's pension contribution, partially offset by cash taxes and the impact to working capital from an increase in day\u2019s sales outstanding.","Net capital expenditures totaled $367 million for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019, which was $10.8 million higher compared to the prior year period. For the full year fiscal 2019, we now expect the capital expenditure forecast to be approximately 1.1% of sales, down slightly from our previously stated 1.2%.","That said, there are no changes to the prioritized order of capital allocation, which is as follows; investing in the business, consistently growing our dividend, participating in M&A, and a balanced approach to share buybacks and paying down debt.","As Tom mentioned earlier with the anticipated sale of Iowa Premium, we expect to achieve our target at the low end from $650 million to $700 million range as a result of our planned operating income being decreased by $25 million.","In summary, we saw improved year-over-year results for the third quarter, led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, solid local case growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the financial objectives of our three-year plan, although we remain confident in our ability to achieve these objectives. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering at a high level of execution all years of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long-term.","Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Christopher Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Christopher Mandeville","Hey, good morning. Can you speak to the gross margin improvement in the quarter and maybe help us understand [those reference] [ph] impacts by order of magnitude? And then Tom or Joel as it relates to private label penetration, it was again expansion but it was one of the lower rates we've seen in recent quarters. So maybe you could help us understand as to whether or not it was an anomaly and we can return back to that 50 to 60 bps of expansion going forward or any color would be appreciated.","Joel Grade","Yeah. Sure, Chris, good morning. It's Joel. I'll start. The way to think about that again it's really up balanced across some of the levers I would say, but I mean certainly our continued opportunities in our Sysco Brand, certainly are a strong driver as well as continued category management efforts where we continue to again obviously it's not what it was five years ago when we had this giant year-over-year jump, but the reality of it is we continue to enhance our relationships with our suppliers and continue to drive category management as well across.","Again there are business and so I think those are a couple of areas that certainly are driving again [indiscernible] like a margin percentage, but again I'm really talking about what we think about most and that is our gross profit dollars.","We obviously also have some favorable benefits of some inflation. Inflation in our world clearly is something that ultimately certainly in the moderate range it's at today is a good driver of opportunities again to move as we continue to push cost of goods through our customers and so that's certainly beneficial in terms of the dollars and gross profit.","And I would say it's not necessarily at the levels of that detrimental really against the comments that I think we're managing these cost of goods inflation well. And I think that's really, really due to the fact that this is -- yes, there's ton of inflation really in our wheelhouse in terms of where those functions best.","So, I don't really say those are some of the main drivers of what we're looking at here and just in general some of the tools that you heard about in the past in terms of again managements continue to help us drive the margins in a positive way.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hey Chris this is Tom. Just maybe just two other things I reinforce as well. We did get some positive year-over-year benefit on the inbound freight side which as we've talked in the past does impact gross margin.","And then your question around Sysco Brand, we look at 20 basis point improvement as a very positive number still as long as that continues to move in the right direction. That's a reflection for us of a couple of things. One, our customers are still reacting positively to all Sysco brands. And two, we continue to bring innovative ideas and solutions to the market. So, we actually view that to be a solid number, while it might be a little bit less than the growth that you've seen in a couple of quarters, it's still a really good number.","Christopher Mandeville","Okay. And then just my final question would be -- and you brought it up Joel inflation. What should we be expecting in the coming quarter? And if there's a willingness with you guys be able to disclose organic case growth quarter-to-date?","Joel Grade","Yes. And so I mean I think just on your question on inflation I mean I think certainly our forecast is to continue to see I'd say moderate level of inflation as we move forward, certainly over the next couple of quarters. There's nothing that jumps up necessarily that would be really significant in terms of the overall inflation numbers. So, I would think we expect certainly an additional moderate level of inflation over the next couple of quarters. Organic case growth I think it was part of the U.S. Foodservice ops, 2.2% was the overall number that was organic.","Tom Ben\u00e9","But you're asking year-to-date right? Chris? And that's--","Christopher Mandeville","Quarter-to-date?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Quarter-to-date numbers. Okay. ","Christopher Mandeville","Yes, strip out some of the noise from weather and what have you and may be expect the calendar shift for Easter as well.","Joel Grade","Yes. So, I think -- so when we talk about there's local -- our local case volume for the quarter was the question I was answering, it was 2.2% was organic. Total case volume organic was 1.3% [indiscernible].","Christopher Mandeville","But is there any real comment for April?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Not really. I mean we continue to -- I think we feel good about continued momentum of the business. And I don't think there's anything necessarily -- Easter, there was a little bit of an Easter shift, but not a big shift given the timing of when it fell last year in the quarter versus this year.","Christopher Mandeville","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Edward Kelly","Yes. Hi, guys. Good morning.","Joel Grade"," Good morning.","Edward Kelly","Can I -- I want to start with OpEx and I was hoping that you could give us a little bit of help here. I mean, obviously, you had a big quarter from a cost perspective. Maybe just digging a little bit more related to the drivers and I'm asking this question, because I think a lot of the accelerated efforts that you guys have been talking about weren't supposed to be at a full run rate this quarter. So I'm just trying to figure out, how we think about OpEx going forward? And then, as part of this, Q4's comparison looks pretty hard. I think you had a worker's comp benefit last year that you had to lap. Can you get to that 1.5% spread in Q4?","Joel Grade"," Well, I'll start and I mean, I think, a couple of things I would say to that. Number one, I'll maybe take the last point first. 1.5 point spread obviously and I think I even said it in my prepared comments is, it's something we look at over the course of a three-year plan. It doesn't mean that necessarily a report has been all the same, some actually higher, some actually possibly be lower as, obviously, we've seen both here.","I think the way I would look at it though, I mean, again, as we did signal, we did anticipate some improved performance in the second half of the year. Obviously, some of these benefits start to kick in from our finance technology roadmap, smart spending work, the Canadian Regionalization, some of the other administrative cost work that we did around some of our corporate office transitions.","I think the -- again, we feel that about -- those things kicking in as we said in the second half of this year, as we headed to next year as well. I would also call out just -- again, overall, our operating performance continues to be pretty strong and the expense line -- that\u2019s a good pace so that actually we had some a little bit of fuel headwind, this particular quarter. And it was about $0.03 a case.","So, I mean, we had -- I think the question is, do we expect this to continue in these areas? I do. To your point, there are some headwinds that we're anticipating that we will be up against in the fourth quarter. But, certainly, as we've talked about here for a while, we certainly anticipated that our leverage from the second half of the year will be better than the first half and I think we're certainly starting to see that.","Edward Kelly","Okay. And then, just a follow-up on CapEx. So the CapEx guidance is down a bit. Can you just talk a bit about what's driving that? I don't know if Iowa Premium has anything to do with it. And how sustainable a rate of sort of 1.1% would be going forward?","Joel Grade","Well, I -- again, I -- the way I would look at that, I mean, number one, it's not that optimum of a forecast, but I mean the reality of it is, we spend our CapEx and make our investments based truly on the needs of the business. There's been absolutely no change in terms of our perspective on our capital allocation priorities that always start with investing in our business.","We're obviously very committed to doing that. We've got a lot of changed programs and things transitioning our organization that will continue to require investments. I would just tell you, from a timing perspective, some of those things happened. And, again, things do move around in the businesses has been some ways, so some of that's probably the timing as much as anything, but I would definitely not takeaway that there's some changes in terms of the way we're looking at forecasting our CapEx. We just -- again, we just adjust spending in investment in terms of the needs of the businesses.","Edward Kelly","Great. Thanks guys.","Joel Grade"," Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.","Karen Short","Hi. Thanks. First thing I just want to ask was in terms of the composition of the -- now I guess the $650 million. Is there any change to the breakout between gross profit and then the supply chain versus the admin?","Joel Grade","No, Karen. So there's not. I would just \u2013 the only shift at all was related to the anticipated sale of the business, but no there is no bucketing difference if you will.","Karen Short","Okay. And then the same question I just want to ask. I know you, obviously, mentioned and you have been mentioning positive same-store sales, but traffic weakness. So, I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about trends of traffic and I guess same-store sales on a true like mom-and-pops local basis in terms of being independent versus the micro change? Any patterns or differences you could point to there?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yeah, good morning, Karen. This is Tom. I mean I think we have seen certainly some choppiness this quarter particular. I think there are probably a bunch of different things driving that, but it depends really on what source you look at.","I mean NPD would call out that while overall spend is up traffic is up in some areas as well and down in others, and Firefox, Naptrack they are probably a little more consistent than they have called traffic down really across most of the segment. So I think it's driven by everything from the weather choppiness in Q3, our Q3 and mostly in February and then I think again consumer efforts during that time.","The small chains seemed to be doing a little bit better, so that's going to be your micro change. And then the pure independents at least in this quarter according to NPD tend to be a little bit softer, but I would say from our perspective we have seen necessarily any major difference in trend line that we've experienced over the last couple of quarters, so we continue to feel like this independent growth that we've had and that sector is doing well and we continue to feel pretty confident in our ability to continue to grow and take share in that space.","Karen Short","Okay. And so then just last housekeeping. Corporate came in on a dollar basis was higher than I would have expected given the layoffs that you'd announced. I don't know if that's just an allocation issue or what because I would have thought on the dollar basis that would have been quite a bit down sequentially and year-over-year.","Joel Grade","Are you talking about the last kind of the specifically corporate layoffs? We're talking in stream stocks\u2026","Karen Short","Yes, yes.","Joel Grade","Obviously there are a lot of things that are part of our financing technology roadmap that are very much fueled focus. And so in fact one of the things we talked about in the first half of the year is that there were again why do we feel comfortable about this because there's been -- field personnel. And so I would tell you, I think the majority of what you're seeing is pretty \u2013 is probably even more fuel focus in corporate, but it's balanced between the two.","Karen Short","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wolf","Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the cadence of sales question that people asked about. You guys said, January was strong on a good weather comparison for February, but it's not good. Should we take away from that sort of March and April have somewhat normalized and if people are trying to get obviously trying to get a sense of whether the industry has slowed or not on a normalized basis?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yeah. I think we would say that that's -- we feel like that certainly instances of weather impacts in the early part of the quarter, things have stabilized. ","Andrew Wolf","And I noticed you gave us -- I may have missed this but I heard the Technomics forecast for Canada. Do you have one for the U.S that you might be able to share with us? ","Joel Grade","As you know Technomic kind of gets out ahead of and they do it by quarter kind of by -- sorry by subsegment. I may have that information which if I have it I can get it to you. We may get back to you on that, but we generally do have that information. ","Andrew Wolf","Okay. And I just got one other question unrelated to sales. So in the -- you took a $35 million charge and I know it was related to the change in the business technology strategy. So could you expand a little upon that what the change is in your business spend -- business technology for us?","Joel Grade","So \u2013 just can you clarify -- that question one more time maybe? ","Andrew Wolf","Of the $72 million charges you excluded out of operating expense $35 million was allocated for what you call the change in business technology strategy. Is that basically going to the cloud and could you expand on -- so we could understand a little bit better\u2026","Joel Grade","Yes some of that. It's also a variety of things being actually accelerated depreciation we took in Europe. That was really all due to technology change. So I think, there's been a few things that I get that number is also accelerated our G&A a little bit. But I would say there's one thing that fell into a number of things that are just part of our technology strategy that are included in that number and it's not necessarily one big thing there. And there's not one thing -- the takeaway would not be that we've somehow have a significant change in technology because we do not. It's just a variety of things going on.","Andrew Wolf","And that was what I was trying to get to. So appreciate that.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes. Think of it as more specifically around Finance Transformation which is a technology component of it and then the European work we've been doing where we have an ERP in France that we've been updating and so those are the two main drivers of it.","Andrew Wolf","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Marisa Sullivan","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to touch on fuel quickly. You called it that there was a slight headwind in the third quarter. Well, how should we think about fuel in the fourth quarter as it impacts your assumption?","Joel Grade","Marisa I\u2019d anticipate some of the continued headwinds as we head into the fourth quarter and probably a little bit as we head into next year as well. ","Marisa Sullivan","Got you. And then I haven't heard you guys talk about category management in a while on these calls. I'm wondering was there anything you guys are doing differently in the third quarter that kind of made it a greater impact, anything that you're planning for the fourth quarter as we should think about gross margin in CatMan?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Marisa, it's Tom. No, I wouldn\u2019t say anything unique. I think we're just trying to highlight as we continue to -- it's an ongoing process. It has been now for years and we're starting to do some deeper work with some of our more strategic supplier partners and think about them more as some potentially long-term benefits as we the end partner more deeply with some suppliers.","Marisa Sullivan","Got you. And are you seeing any impacts or any customer feedback on category management? Are they like and what you're doing? Or is it -- are they having to adjust to assortment changes? ","Tom Ben\u00e9","No. I think we're in a point now its \u2013 early, early days so call it a few years ago now. I think because we were changing some suppliers in some areas or products that was creating some choppiness and we've actually continue to have a very good feedback from our customers around the work we're doing with CatMan, obviously, that drives cost benefit for them and they're very excited about that. And as I mentioned, we are getting more focused on strategic partnerships so that we can have more consistent supply for the long-term. So, it's generally very positive. ","Marisa Sullivan","Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judah Frommer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Judah Frommer","Hi thanks for taking the question. Maybe first just on the changes to guidance related to Iowa premium. I think you said it's the entire kind of reduction in guidance is due to Iowa premium. But if we're stripping $25 million out, obviously, that's not necessarily the low end. So, when you say the low end, are you saying $650 million to $675 million effectively? ","Joel Grade","Yes. No, I think here's the way I would think about that Judah. I think we talked about really -- really comes around the midpoint of the range. And so if you do $650 million or $700 million that will be $675 million. Really we're talking about here is a $25 million related Iowa premium and yes that was the only adjustment to our guidance at this point, which takes us from that midpoint down to the lower end of the range.","Judah Frommer","Okay, that's helpful. And switching gears. I thought you said that freight was a tailwind on the inbound side in Q3. Is that right? Are you telling us that you're actually getting a benefit there? Or that it was less of a headwind year-over-year? And any commentary around kind of the freight situation in driver shortages and ability to retain drivers lately will be helpful.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Sure. Just remember we had to separate a couple of things here. So, inbound is our gross margin and I did mention that we had charm year-over-year positive impact to that. Again -- because a year ago, we were still dealing with quite a few challenges related to inbound freight. So, I would think about it as it has gotten better. We're not feeling the kind of impact and there was a piece of that gross margin improvement that was driven by that this year.","As it relates to outbound, we continue to have certainly we're managing that I think better than we were a year ago as well, but we still have challenges from transportation perspective although albeit I think the work that we're doing around recruiting and retention is much improved and we are seeing positive impacts across our operations versus a year ago in that regard.","Joel Grade","Yes. Judah just one thing I would just add to that. I would characterize the inbound freight as less of a headwind and not necessarily a benefit. In other words, there is some level of resetting in the overall structure that happened. But relative to Tom's point to where we were at last year, we were really up against some real major challenges that we have left ahead. We have to think about that.","Judah Frommer","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","John Heinbockel","So, Tom maybe 18 months ago you guys selectively added MAs in a few markets. So, how are they performing? And then if you think about the opportunity on the share side, is there an opportunity today to go out and redirect some of the cost savings into more MA hiring to try to drive more share? Or is that not productive? ","Tom Ben\u00e9","hey good morning John. I'll answer the question. So, I would say first of all we felt really good about the work we did around MAs a little over a year ago. And if you recall when we talked about it back then, what we were really focused on was a few tools that enabled us to do a better of understanding where the biggest opportunities were and then applying those resources to those specific geographies or areas. And so, we continue to believe that targeted approach is the right approach. And as I think about it overtime, it's -- so it's not as much just about adding MAs for the sake of adding MAs. It's about adding them where we now know we have the biggest opportunity to succeed.","And so, we'll continue to selectively do that. And we're kindling all the time evaluating our territories in each of our opportunity areas and that may encourage us to shift in certain areas versus others, but I would say just outright adding a bunch of more MAs for the sake of that is not really our strategy.","We continue to see our territory size get a little bit larger as we are able to provide the marketing associates with more tools and support. We're talking a lot about the tools and support that we offer our customers on that side of the business and we continue to do, I think, a really nice job of building up those capabilities, whether that be things like menu planning and analysis for our business review process, where we have our chefs engaged.","So I think we're continuing to focus those total resources on the local side of the business, not just the marketing associate, but leveraging the MAs to bring these other tools and capabilities that we built behind them to the market. ","John Heinbockel","And then, if you guys started to give thought to when you provide the next plan, right, what's the time frame for that? And is the idea another three-year plan? Or, sort of, shift to year-by-year outlook?","Tom Ben\u00e9"," I don't think we -- we've never made that call on that yet, John. And so we're -- I think, we're still working through ourselves, what the best approach and so I'd say, kind of, more to come. We'll certainly talk with you all when we're in a place where we want to do that.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.","Ajay Jain","Yeah. Hi. I know you guys don't typically comment on case growth internationally. And Tom, you did mention in the prepared comments that top line in Canada is really strong and then you also talked about some of the challenges in France and the U.K, but is there any way you can give some directional commentary about organic case growth internationally, specifically, for Canada, the U.K. and the rest of Europe sequentially and year-over-year?","Tom Ben\u00e9"," Honestly, Ajay, I think part of the challenge for us sincerely is the way we are still, I would say, managing through that transition. The cases that we talked about in the U.S. and the consistency that we can provide you guys, does not exist in that business yet. And so, potentially over time, we might be in a place to do that, but today the way we still account for the sales and the way we think about the cases or the pounds of the units that we sell in different parts of the world are not on account on a consistent basis.","But what I did say and I will reinforce here, we did have strong top line growth in Canada. And what we said in Europe is, look, we had a couple of things going on in Europe that are impacting us. Certainly, the U.K. and everything with Brexit, has created some choppiness over there.","Our sales are positive. It's just that they are not -- they're not growing at the rate we would like them to or would want them to at this point. And then in France, look, I think, we all thought the unrest that was going, the total social unrest in France would have, by now, certainly cleared and it just has not. And while that\u2019s -- it's not a huge impact because it's a big country, there's certainly still some things going on there that are creating issues for our customers and therefore us getting products to them. So, long way of saying, I think we still feel generally good about those businesses. We would have like to see a little bit more top line growth in Europe in this last quarter, and that's kind of built into my prepared comments driving that overall numbers and we feel good about the U.S. numbers and certainly about Canada. We just don't have the information in a way that we feel like it's easily providable to you guys.","Ajay Jain","Okay, thank you. Would it be possible to confirm how much you've allocated for severance in Q3 and year-to-date? I think there were some kind of breakdown provided last quarter for Canada and Europe, but I'm just wondering if there's any update on severance that includes U.S. Foodservice and also wondering if you can give your outlook for severance for Q4.","Joel Grade","Ajay, there's volumes to that -- I mean, they're not GAAP rest. I mean, we do have a fair amount of detail that is probably the best I'd be able to give you here in terms of spilling that out. Again obviously if you think about the areas, certainly really across our business we've had a little bit finance technology roadmaps certainly we talked about our corporate here in the U.S. side versus the Canada regionalization, some of the work being done freight in terms of programs, I mean obviously again some of that I think you'll see fallout in our non-GAAP product, but I think that's part of the back up.","And the only thing I would say is, obviously, there's some pretty sizable numbers in there, particularly last quarter as it relates to Europe, obviously, that was -- well not all inclusive. That was some of the biggest majority what's going to come there and at least in that part of the world.","Ajay Jain","Okay. And in terms of the impact from the recent headcount restructuring, will that be more reflected in Q4, or will the majority of that allocated in Q3?","Joel Grade","Yeah, I mean I think the majority -- again the majority of that is actually going to be in -- within Q2 but then also here in Q3, so I wouldn't expect that -- a lot of that is reflected in Q4. The benefits we were starting to realize here as we talk about the second half of the year as we head into next year. ","Ajay Jain","Okay. I had one final question if I can. I think you've made some adjustments in the financials for accelerated depreciation year-to-date. I'm not sure if there was any impact in Q3 itself, but I thought at this point you should cycle the technology restructuring plan from a few years ago. And maybe I can get some clarification offline, but I thought conceptually at this point there shouldn\u2019t be any residual impact from the SAT accelerated depreciation less your year-to-date adjustments are for Europe or unrelated to the previous?","Joel Grade","Yeah, I wouldn't think about it that way. It's actually was in D&A, in particularly the site volume increased this quarter. That was related to I would call accelerated depreciation in Europe for the most part, actually accelerated some depreciation there. And so the majority of the depreciation increase you're seeing is related to some technology transitions in Europe, but it's not related to what you're talking about before in terms of the mess right here in the U.S.","Ajay Jain","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Sinisi","Hey, great. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much guys for taking my questions. Wanted to just go back to the choppiness and the top line in the domestic business, obviously as you said a few times, it seems like you know more kind of February and weather specifically. Just wondering was there are a lot of variability that you could see by region? Another way of asking was it basically, the weather and largely February the way to think of it? Or were there any other factors that just might be worth us knowing?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes. I would say nothing that was inconsistent with what you just said. I mean I think we just -- when I talked about weather we saw certain parts of the country where there were more impacts than others, so I wouldn't say nothing else beyond that we saw. ","Vincent Sinisi","Okay. And then just I appreciate the color on the Iowa Premium versus the 3-year plan. But as you had this quarter very nice expense control, just kind of curious more from like a high level perspective like with the buckets that you are getting more the kind of cost of efforts pulled to date, how much kind of lead time or planning is there with some of the levers that you had to pull? Kind of said another way like, kind of how much quarter-by-quarter planning or impact are not -- is there any kind of way to think about that?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Maybe I'll start and then let Joel chime in. If you think about the way our business operates, we have regular operating expense which is generally built into the businesses that is going to have a primarily consistent cadence depending on volume and our topline being a big driver, right? Just a lot of it is driven by cost per unit.","In addition we've talked about vague strategic initiatives like Finance Transformation, like Canada Regionalization, like Smart Spending that we have planned out and we believe we have a good use to win those impacts will be happening. And then we have things like our last quarter when we announced the corporate restructuring. There's more of a onetime event where we would see that coming into the business.","So a long way of saying it I think generally speaking our operating expense moves with our business performance meeting our volume. And then -- and certainly the headwinds or tailwinds we see in the business, few are being a great example of headwind we're feeling right now, certainly things like driver and warehouse turnover in the past and just a low employment rates driving higher cost of some of those roles in the company. But everything else is generally planned out and we have visibility to that, except for these one timers. Does that get what you're asking? ","Vincent Sinisi","Yes. That was very helpful. Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe","Hi, thank you. I want to follow-up on your some comments that were made about maybe independent restaurants being a little bit softer in the March quarter. I mean whether we adjust for weather or not. And the context of the question really what I'm getting at is, have you seen a significant rate of openings for independent restaurants? In other words, your addressable customer base maybe over the last 12 months?","And considering the amount of labor pressure that independent restaurants are facing and just margins which were in general lower than chains are you actually seeing a pickup in closures on the independent side that's noteworthy even on like a very market-specific basis?","Tom Ben\u00e9","John good morning. I wouldn't say anything that's unique that's happened there. I mean as you \u2013 we all know, in this industry you've got a lot of new business coming online all the time and you also have folks that are closing. I don't -- wouldn't say we have seen any dramatic shift in that area. As I mentioned the different data sources have some mixed information, but all of them generally talk about positive spend dollars being up in that kind of 2.5% to 3.5% range and then you have traffic generally down with the exception of NPD which is showing slight increase in traffic. So, I don't think there's anything unique or anything in this quarter that we've seen as highly different than what we've seen in the past quarters.","John Ivankoe","And is there anything to note by category or by regional that you're beginning to see? And obviously I think there's a lot of questions that are being asked you of whether you think there's a slowdown and I think the answer, at least, as it stands today is no. But when you look at different categories or different regions, is there anything interesting that you're seeing in the marketplace a little bit more detail either positive or negative that you can basically talk about now that gives us I guess somewhat of a forecast of the future from Sysco's perspective as opposed to some of the third-party sources that you use for your data?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Not really. I mean there's nothing else that I would tell you that we're seeing is any different.","John Ivankoe","Understood. Thank you.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Kelly Bania","Hui, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to expenses, again, it seems like there was a good amount of upside at least in our model on the international. Can we think about the performance this quarter? I think it was down about $30 million year-over-year. Is that kind of the right run rate to think about for the next few quarters international? And then maybe you can tie in just the impact of the corporate restructuring on the expense performance this quarter? ","Joel Grade","Yes, Kelly, I'll start. And I think the answer to that I mean obviously we're continuing to do a lot of work there as to streamlining our operations more efficient. I guess I'd say there is some run rate consistency there, but I would tell you is that, reason a lot of room in -- right now in some of our international business.","What I would not necessarily tie it to one of the things we talked about in the past is the sizable transformation we're doing in France. I think the majority of that benefit really we start to see next year, so I would not tie a lot of that necessarily to the restructuring that we're doing in our French business.","But I would say generally speaking, I think it's fair to continue to see that as a relative run rate realizing again we just got a lot of moving parts over there that in terms of transformation were doing. So, I guess my answer is generally is yes but again, just realize things are not going to move around quarter-to-quarter based on the amount of stuffs we got moving around that business.","Kelly Bania","Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just in terms of the U.S. Broadline business. Can you talk a little bit about some of the specialty meat and produce, some of the categories that aren't necessarily part of the normal case growth? And what kind of trends you're seeing in those other areas of the U.S. business?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Sure. This is Tom, Kelly. Good morning. I think we continue to feel really good about our specialty company strategy. As we've talked for a few years we know that our customers truly value Broadline, but they also have these -- oftentimes they can be better met by some specialty companies. And in our case, meat, seafood, poultry, and that side and then the produce with FreshPoint. And so I think we continue to feel really good about overall -- what we bring to the market and the value proposition we have there. We've been working on ways of even helping our customers, to make that easier for them to procure products both from Sysco and from the Sysco specialty companies and we're seeing benefits of that as well.","And so, creating the environment where it's easier for them to kind of do business with both of those entities as they need to and as they feel like they want to and so -- versus the feeling, maybe like two or three different companies that they're doing business with, the idea that they can do business with one Sysco and get the value out of that. So we continue to believe that's an important part of the market and we continue to feel really good about the work we're doing there.","Kelly Bania","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of the Bob Summers at Buckingham. Your line is open.","Bob Summers","Hey, good morning, guys. So I just wanted to dig a little deeper into the transportation. Your dry van spot rates have been contracting all year. So can you maybe talk about how that flows through in your business, either by talking about the percent of business that you do at the spot rate? Maybe talk about how that spot rate influences contract rates as you may be threatened to move more to the spot market? And then, lastly, how that impacts what you have to pay your drivers.","Tom Ben\u00e9"," Hey, Bob. Again, getting back to this conversation about transportation and cost, the piece you're referring to is the inbound freight part for us, which does hit our gross margin and we called out in the prepared comment and we've talked a bit here this morning about that we are seeing some year-over-year improvement that have been there. It's not huge and it's not something that is a major driver for us but the market has come down certainly from where it was a year ago and obviously everybody benefits from that.","We, obviously, try to minimize the spot market, because when that -- that's the one that gets the most out of whack the fastest and that's what happened a year ago, so we continue to manage that side of our business mostly with contracts. But, yes, it's certainly is that whole market comes down that affects both sides, the spot and contract side.","And then as it relates to our drivers, as we said, I think, we've done a lot of work around both recruiting and retention and the way we're operating our business to improve as much as we can our driver retention. And so, we feel better about where we're at than we were year ago. But it continues to be a challenging part of the business and I think will be as long as of the markets the way it is, meaning unemployment's low and there's a lot of freight on the road. So we feel much better where we are now than we were a year ago, but that doesn't mean that we don't still have ongoing challenges associated with hiring and retention of drivers.","Bob Summers","Okay.

I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications and Treasurer. ","Please go ahead.","Neil Russell","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. Joining me in Houston today are Tom Ben\u00e9, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the Company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and actual results could differ in a material manner.","Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2017; subsequent SEC filings; and in the news release issued earlier this morning.

I\u2019d like to start the company\u2019s key themes that drove our results for the quarter along with some comments on the current macroenvironment that we are operating in, followed by a discussion of our U.S. Food Service Operations business and concluding with the discussion of our International and other business segments. ","Joel will then discuss the financial results in more detail. This quarter, we were able to deliver solid results that include adjusted operating income growth of 7.1% compared to the prior year and adjusted earnings per share of $0.67. ","There were number of key business drivers that impacted the results for the quarter including strong gross profit dollar growth, despite adverse weather in multiple geographies and continued investments that we are making across our business.","Turning to the macro environments, the overall trends continue to be generally favorable in the United States. This led to improved spend for the Retail and Food Services sectors and somewhat favorable conditions for Food Service operators as sales at restaurants continue to rise offsetting somewhat lower traffic counts.","We also see continued growth with local customers as they increased their reach through innovative concepts and additional delivery methods. Economic growth in the International markets in which we operate was mostly positive including modest growth in the Food Service sector. ","Looking at our results, sales grew 6.1% to $14.3 billion driven by strong performance from our local customers, the addition of new customers accelerating our national customer growth, product cost inflation and an acquisition. ","As we shared during our Investor Day, we are focused on M&A activity as a part of our strategy and have recently closed three acquisitions, HFM in Hawaii, Kent Frozen Food in the UK, and Doerle Food Service in Louisiana. ","We are excited about all three companies and the talented associates that we are bringing into the Sysco family. However, only the results of HFM are included in our third quarter results. ","Gross profit grew 5.6% driven by positive case growth and effective ongoing management of product cost inflation. While we continue to face some challenges from inbound freight cost, the trend has been somewhat improving and was less of an impact in the third quarter. ","Additionally, the growth of Sysco brand, which now comprises nearly 46% of local cases resulted in incremental gross profit dollars. Sysco brand continues to be driven by customers\u2019 interest and our growing breadth of products offered across multiple categories and tiers along with continued progress from our brand revitalization efforts and new innovative products from our cutting-edge solutions process.","From an expense perspective, adjusted operating expense for the quarter grew 5.2% driven by ongoing strategic investments in the business and a few operational challenges that impacted the quarter. Some of those investments include supply chain transformation work occurring in Europe, the investment in marketing associates in the U.S., and the continued investments in technology that will ultimately translate into a more enriching experience for our customers. ","One example is the investment we are making in Sysco Labs. Our Sysco Labs teams, in conjunction with our business technology team, continue to enhance our technology offerings to customers including further enhancements to support the ordering process and how customers receive products from us, all intended to make it easier for customers to do business with us. ","Overall, we delivered adjusted operating income growth of 7.1% to $536 million and with the addition of tax benefits, EPS growth was meaningfully higher than the prior year as adjusted EPS grew 31% to $0.67. The operational improvement in our business is a direct result of our business strategy that is predicated in our disciplined profitable and stable growth with an emphasis on local customers. ","We have continued to make strides in the execution of our strategic priorities and focusing on satisfying the needs of our customers. ","Transitioning to our quarterly results by business segments, beginning with U.S. Food Service operations. Sales grew 5.1% for the quarter, gross profit grew 4.1%, adjusted operating expenses grew 5.9% and adjusted operating income grew 1.2%. For the quarter, top-line results were strong as local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business was 2.6% including the acquisition of HFM and has now grown for 16 consecutive quarters.","We continue to see strong growth from our local customers who are able to introduce new and fresh concepts to consumers are positively responding to. National customer case growth was 2.2% driving overall case growth of 2.4%. The solid case growth performance translated into healthy gross profit dollar growth of 4.1% as customer mix continue to improve as we grew local cases faster than national cases. ","Additionally, the previously mentioned growth in Sysco brands also contributed positively to the gross profit dollar growth. ","Turning our attention to cost, our adjusted operating expense growth for the quarter was 5.9% driven by increased supply chain cost in both warehouse and transportation due to a combination of weather impacts and the continuation of ramp up cost for new business, our ongoing investment in our selling organizations, specifically marketing associates in an effort to accelerate our local sales and increased bad debt expense as a result of year-over-year comparisons to a very strong prior year. ","Moving on to International Food Service operations, we had strong results for the quarter with sales growing 10.7%, gross profit growing 12.9%, adjusted operating expenses growing 13% and adjusted operating income growing 11.6%. Top-line growth was strong for the quarter despite winter storms that had a negative sales and cost impact across parts of our European and Canadian businesses due to reduced shipping days. ","Additionally, we continued to experience acute product inflation in the mid to high-single-digits across the European business also impacting our gross profit growth for the quarter. From a cost perspective, we continue to make investments in our supply chain transformation across Europe including a recently announced integration of Brakes France and Davigel to become Sysco friends. ","The merger of these two businesses will position us well for continued success in the French marketplace enabling new capabilities and allowing us to offer unique multi-temperature service to better adapt to our customers\u2019 growing needs as well as to provide access to new customer segments. ","In addition, we are investing in new capabilities such as technology solutions and modernization of existing facilities which are being implemented across the business to enrich the customer experience of doing business with Sysco, which will ultimately lead to improved loyalty and accelerated case growth with our local customers. ","Despite the positive top-line performance and the various investments mentioned, the sequential improvement in operating income results for international were largely related to the Sysco calendar timing shifts for our European business. ","We continue to focus on executing against our long-term plans by investing in necessary capabilities across the international business and leveraging our position as a platform for future growth. ","Finally, SYGMA continued top-line growth during the quarter with sales up 4.6% and piece growth of nearly 2%. However, the business continues to struggle with expenses including inbound trade issues and increased transportation expenses due to driver challenges and third-party spend to meet the high service level expectations of our customers. ","In summary, we are encouraged by the solid fundamentals of our business, specifically the top-line growth trajectory we are on while continuing to invest in our future growth. As we approach the conclusion of our initial three year plan, I remain confident that we are on track to achieve the high-end to $600 million to $650 million range of adjusted operating income improvement target. ","Additionally, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our new three year plan including the financial targets we laid out during Investor Day as a part of this plan. We continue to make the necessary investments in our people, technology and training that will lay the foundation for future growth. ","And I\u2019d like to thank our dedicated Sysco associates for all that they are doing to execute on our customer and operational strategies, which will ultimately improve our customers\u2019 experience of doing business with us and also for making Sysco the distributor of choice for our customers. ","Now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer. ","Joel Grade ","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the top-line fundamental results for the third quarter. Sales and gross profit growth were strong as we saw positive impacts from case growth, inflation and continued Sysco brand growth. ","Adjusted operating income reflect continued investments while with some ongoing challenges this quarter. However, we are able to generate operating leverage leading to adjusted operating income growth of 7.1% and with the additional tax benefits, adjusted earnings per share of $0.67. ","In addition, we continue to generate meaningful free cash flow as we posted $768 million in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018. As for our quarterly results, for the third quarter, sales grew 6.1%, gross profit grew 5.6%, while adjusted operating expense grew 5.2%, which resulted in an adjusted operating income growth of 7.1% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 31.4% to $0.67 per share.","For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we saw foreign exchange benefit to sales of approximately 1.6%. Sysco experienced inflation across all of our segments in the third quarter. In our U.S. Broadline business, we experienced 2.6% inflation driven by a few categories including meat, dairy and produce. With our International business, inflation was a combination of both product cost increasing and currency translation in the UK.","During the quarter, we had gross profit growth of 5.6% driven by overall volume growth and improved Sysco brand penetration. ","As Tom mentioned earlier, trade expense trends have somewhat improved and were not as significant of a headwind as in previous quarters. Adjusted operating expenses grew 5.2% for the quarter. The increase in expense was largely driven by supply chain costs both warehouse and transportation, which were partly related to adverse weather and increased fuel costs, the previously announced investment in our selling organization and increased bad debt expense in our U.S. operations. ","Additionally, we continue to make investments in transformation and integration in our International businesses. During the quarter, we achieved operating pre-tax leverage as gross profit dollar growth outpaced adjusted operating expense growth. We saw a gap of 40 basis points this quarter and we expect to continue to improve this trend in the fourth quarter. ","As it relates to taxes, our results for the third quarter were impacted by a benefit from a constitution of $330 million to derisk and fund our defined benefit retirement plan, which was deductible using fiscal 2017 tax rates, tax benefits from stock option exercises and additional tax credits.","Cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018. Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018 was $356 million or about 0.8% of sales, which was roughly $39 million lower compared to last year. ","Free cash flow for the quarter declined $232 million driven by a deferred tax payment from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 due to relief from Hurricane Harvey and the contribution of our defined benefit retirement plan. ","However, free cash flow for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018 was $768 million, which was $81 million higher compared to the same period last year. ","Now I would like to transition to three business updates. First, regarding our new effective tax rate following tax reform. As a reminder, due to the way our fiscal year fell from July to June, our U.S. statutory rates for fiscal 2018 is 28% and our U.S. statutory rate for fiscal 2019 and beyond will be 21%. Over time, we expect that our effective tax rate will be in the range of 25% to 26%. ","However, we anticipate that for fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate will be slightly lower as we continue to work through various initiatives and opportunities. Second, regarding the annual savings from lower taxes. ","We\u2019ve invested a portion of those savings in our associates by increasing our ongoing contributions to the Sysco 41-K plant. We continued to evaluate our options with regard to how best to utilize the balance of the savings and we will do so consistent with our capital allocations priorities. ","We believe this is an opportunity to reinvest in our business and further strengthen our competitive advantage. ","Finally, regarding CapEx, we have previously forecasted investment of 1.4% and 1.5% of sales for fiscal year 2018 as we plan to move spend from fiscal year 2019 into fiscal year 2018. Based on current spend levels, we anticipate finishing the fiscal year somewhat lower than previously forecasted. ","In summary, I remain confident that we are on track to achieve our three year planned financial objectives including the high-end of the $600 million to $650 million range of improved adjusted operating income compared in fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015 excluding Brakes. Fundamentals of our business remains strong as we expect to deliver solid local case growth, good gross profit dollar growth and improved cost management, while continuing to help our customers to be successful. ","Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Judah Frommer ","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First maybe just on the tax reform reinvestment. There is a little bit of confusion out there with the second three-year plan and whether anything has been restated for tax reform? I think, based on the CAGNY disclosure, it\u2019s only EPS, but if you could help us out with what is and what isn\u2019t good in that three year plan that that would be helpful?","Joel Grade","Yes, it\u2019s Joel, Judah, thanks for your question. Just to really make sure I am understanding your question properly. You are asking a benefit ultimately on the new three year plan of the tax reform. And so that\u2019s what I am answering. At CAGNY, we talked about this benefit of $0.20 to $0.25 on the EPS line, which continues to be our view of how we see that little before. So that\u2019s our \u2013 that\u2019s current guidance we\u2019ve given and that\u2019s our continued current view of it. ","Judah Frommer ","Okay. So, like the operating income guidance, that would include any potential reinvestment of tax reform dollars?","Joel Grade","Yes, I would say it this way. I mean, the three-year plan we\u2019ve laid out \u2013 if you recall it doesn\u2019t create a slightly increased level of capital investment, which wasn\u2019t directly related to tax reform. But the answer to your question is that the net income impacts in the operating income over the next three years factor considers those areas where we have invested in the benefits thereof. ","Judah Frommer ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just quickly, just in terms of the independent landscape and kind of all three public players, before talking the same way about the attractiveness of the opportunity there, is there any bumping up against larger competitors when you are competing for independent business more than there was, let\u2019s say three, six, months ago?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hey, Judah, this is Tom. I\u2019d say, look, this business as we talk for a long time continues to be very competitive. I don\u2019t think there is anything newer that we are seeing from either the bigger publicly traded guys or even the regional players that are out there. ","I think everyone knows that this is an attractive space and so, they always have and they\u2019ll continue to participate in this space and it\u2019s coming upon us to containing to do things that differentiates Sysco from everybody else to continue to earn that business. But I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything new or different that\u2019s come about lately. ","Judah Frommer ","Okay. Thanks a lot and good luck. ","Tom Ben\u00e9","Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Sinisi ","Hey, great. Thanks very much. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about freight. It was the current thing to hear that you said it improved somewhat this quarter. Just wonder if you can give us some color on, I mean, to our understanding certainly the capacity is still constrained. So was it more what you are doing when you are negotiating on the rates are \u2013 just give us a little more color on there and then kind of, are you holding things status quo from a freight perspective as we go forward the next couple quarters?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hey, Vini, it\u2019s Tom. So, look, the freight environment obviously continues to be somewhat challenging out there and I know everyone is seeing that, hearing that. I think our point here is there have been a few things that we\u2019ve been able to do and we talked about this over the last couple quarters that we needed to be able to work with the suppliers and work with the carriers both to improve the situation we ran into especially in our second quarter or the fourth quarter of last calendar year. ","The more freight on the road obviously creates pressure for everybody. There is driver challenges and there is obviously just capacity challenges. I think the combination in Q3 will be probably saw as a little bit of softening of some of that pressure that was there and at the end of last calendar year or in our second quarter. ","But also I think our teams doing a nice job working with our various carrier partners ensuring that we were getting the loads we needed and the coverage that we expected as part of our agreements. And candidly working with suppliers too to help soften some of the impact that\u2019s out there. As it relates to going forward, I think it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. ","I mean, we continue to manage this thing. It\u2019s knock up I think on a lot of us at the end of last calendar year and we are doing everything we can to manage it. It\u2019s still impacting us, but hopefully, we will see more of what we saw in Q3 \u2013 or Q3 going forward, but it\u2019s a little too hard for us to call that from where we sit. ","Vincent Sinisi ","Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up on Brakes, specifically, more on the fundamental kind of the integration temperatures zones and all that, can you just kind of a little update where we are in terms of progress there? ","Tom Ben\u00e9","Sure. ","Vincent Sinisi ","Thanks a lot. ","Tom Ben\u00e9","So, If you think about the Brakes acquisition, we\u2019re now about 18 months into the acquisition and over the last, call it, year or so, we spent a fair amount of time reinforcing of the Sysco approach and model to the business I\u2019d say in that first nine months, we are just getting our bearings straight on what we acquired and what we had there. ","And what was going on in the market as you also know, at least in the UK a lot of things were happening in the UK market with Brexit. So with this last year what we\u2019ve done is, spent more time focused on what are kind of things that we need in place to sustainably grow this business, similar to what we do here in the U.S. with a focus on local customers. ","And so what we\u2019ve learned over that time is that there are investments we need to make in the supply chain area, specifically, and we\u2019ve always talked about this transformation in the UK, but multi-temperature which is common ground here in the U.S. and not the way we operate is not necessarily that way in all of Europe and certainly in the business that we had acquired. ","So we are investing in multi-temperature, which means, think about that is, one facility being able to provide all three temperature frozen, chilled and dry on one truck and we didn\u2019t have that in all markets. And that\u2019s an ongoing investment we are going to make. We\u2019ve also have a better sense of what capability we had from a technology perspective in each of the countries and we are making some investments there. ","And I\u2019d say, lastly, there is some structural things that we needed to get in place to make sure we could operate the business the way needed to across this international segment and that\u2019s with some resources we are putting in place in Europe, specifically to oversee a lot of the efforts we have going on over there. So it\u2019s been a \u2013 it\u2019s you hear and you see obviously the number of investments we are making there. ","We believe it really is important for us to continue to position ourselves well for the future and ultimately to start to get the value that we believe exists in those markets and in those businesses we acquired. ","Vincent Sinisi ","All right. That\u2019s helpful color. Best of luck guys. ","Tom Ben\u00e9","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Chris Mandeville ","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Joel, if I could get some clarity and I apologize if I didn\u2019t understand it correctly here, but, on the new three-year outlook, are you still evaluating how you might use tax reform on a go-forward basis and leaving things open to possibly adjusting your three-year goals on the EBIT line or is it\u2019s effectively final you remain confident in growing EBIT $650 million to $700 million over 2017 numbers?","Joel Grade","Yes, just to be clear, there is only lack of clarification on this, you should ask it again. No, we are not adjusting our targets for our next three-year plan. Our targets for our next three-year plan is $650 million to $700 million as we talked at out Investor Day. We are simply \u2013 what we had said is we are continuing to evaluate the options for investing that, but certainly again, our targets are what they are.","Chris Mandeville ","Okay. So the timing could shift a bit, but nonetheless the end target is same, okay. And then, just any insights on how cases may have trended in U.S. during the quarter? And how Easter and\/or weather may have affected yourselves? And then, any willingness to discuss quarter-to-day trends?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Chris, just on \u2013 I am missing pieces what you are saying. Are you just talking about how weather affected the U.S. or just share trends in general?","Chris Mandeville ","Yes, so, it\u2019s just in terms of the case cadence throughout this quarter, how Easter and weather impacted the overall quarter and then, if you see willingness to discuss quarter-to-day trends?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Okay. So, actually, we talk through, we certainly had weather impacts, both in the U.S. and in some of our International businesses as everyone is pretty aware of what happened in the U.S., specifically, let\u2019s say, in the Northeast, but also some around the whole eastern corridor. So we certainly saw some impacts for that weather on our volume. ","The other thing that we did not talk about last quarter, that we went back and did a little bit of work on, look, as we think about the shift that happened at the end of last quarter around the New Year\u2019s holiday, we also probably had a small impact in our business in Q3, because of that shift that took place in Q2, meaning, we got a \u2013 what we think about a 50 basis point impact, volume that went into Q2 that hit the prior year would have gone into Q3. ","So I\u2019d say, those kind of things slightly impacted our volume for this quarter. But we continue to feel pretty good about the overall industry trends. There has been some choppiness because of that weather, you saw that in the March sales numbers for a lot of our restaurant operators. ","But, generally speaking, we feel good about the fundamentals in the business and believe that these segments continue to be an opportunity and as we\u2019ve talked numerous times, given our market share position, we believe there is plenty of opportunity for us to grow whether it\u2019s in restaurants or other segments across the Food Service landscape.","Chris Mandeville ","And is there any real ability to quantify the weather impact and\/or the Easter benefit as many restaurants call that out?","Tom Ben\u00e9","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily easy to quantify it, because you get so many year-over-year impacts. We believe \u2013 we certainly know when we lose shipping days that we \u2013 you don\u2019t easily get those back in this business, as we all know, it\u2019s not like, hey, I didn\u2019t go out last week because of the weather, I am going to out twice this week. That\u2019s not usually how it happens. So, I think the reality is, you lose those days, but we deal with this year in and year out. It just have to be a little more affected in fiscal year \u2013 in our fiscal year 2018. ","Joel Grade","Chris, we haven\u2019t quantified that and like I said, so I think, to Tom\u2019s point here, I mean, it\u2019s not something we try to overly big deal, we are simply acknowledging the fact that both from a volume perspective and probably from an expensive, we had some areas that were impacted. But we are not trying to oversell it. ","Chris Mandeville ","Okay, thanks guys. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","John Heinbockel","So, on the investment in MAs, how much do you think that, that contributed to the 6% SG&A growth in the quarter? Could that be 50 BPS or something like that? And then secondly, given the timing of onboarding those folks, when do you think they start to make an impact on local case growth?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Good morning. Thanks for the question. So, I\u2019d say, when you think about the expense impacts, specifically the U.S. business that you are asking about, there really were three big areas of impact. Certainly, marketing associates and the investments we are making in the sales organization was one of them. I am not going to give you an exact number or as a percentage of that. ","But it\u2019s a pretty important investment that we are making and we believe that that in addition to some of the technology that we are putting in place to support that organization is important and what I would say is, think about these as somewhat planned investments and we went into both this three-year plan knowing what we needed to get done and why we\u2019ve committed to the numbers we\u2019ve committed to and this was a key part of that investment strategy. ","So, think about it is planned and something that we think. From a timing, how long it will continue and how long it takes these MAs if you will to get up fully up to speed. I think, three to four quarters is still probably appropriate. What we\u2019ve gotten better are getting folks ramped up and trained. We\u2019ve got much better process and programs in place than we had in the past. ","It still takes a while to get these guys really impacting the business in the marketplace. So I\u2019d say, I wouldn\u2019t suggest we\u2019re done with it after this quarter. We\u2019d probably have another quarter or so of investment around the selling organization. ","The other two areas in expenses were around the \u2013 and Joel talk about this, when we do have some times with weather impacts is, we\u2019ve got our fixed cost obviously are there. Often times, we are paying our warehouse depot and our drivers even if we are not shipping cases. So we do have incremental expenses associated with some of our operating expense. ","Fuel obviously is also up and we know that and we are dealing with the impacts of fuel and the operating expense. And then the last thing we called out was bad debt and part of that was just year-over-year. We had a really good year last year in bad debt and we had a less favorable year this year. And I\u2019d say, more consistent this year was what we had maybe in our history, it\u2019s not like we had a huge issue, but versus prior is why that stood out. ","John Heinbockel","And then just as a follow-up on the MAs. So, correct me if I am wrong. I think you kind of went from flat to maybe up 2% something like that in growth in MAs. Is that about right? And would that kind of pickup, can that add a couple 100 basis points once these guys are fully mature to local case growth? Or is that too much?","Tom Ben\u00e9","I am not going to try to quantify that. I don\u2019t \u2013 we certainly believe that, as we\u2019ve talked in the past, John, the ability to better analyze the opportunity is what enables us to focus these resources. So we are in the past, we might have just added resources and hope we put them in the right place and focus on the right things. We now are much more surgical in that approach. ","And so, we certainly believe that by adding them in the areas of where we have opportunity, we will accelerate our growth in those areas. But it\u2019s not everywhere and it\u2019s not certainly \u2013 it\u2019s not something that \u2013 it is something that we think about. ","We\u2019ve built it into our new three year plan. So it\u2019s certainly embedded in the numbers we\u2019ve shared with you all. But I can\u2019t necessarily quantify if we hadn\u2019t couple percentage in MAs, that\u2019s going to drive a couple incremental percentage points of sales growth. ","Joel Grade","Hey, John, it\u2019s Joel. Maybe if I can just add one little perspective on this \u2013 from that \u2013 I\u2019ll just give you maybe two little data points here. Number one, you may recall, lot of conversations we had, as we are heading into this, even in the second year of this three-year plan, we are at an \u2013 what I would call, somewhat of an accelerated trajectory and people were actually \u2013 we are getting a lot of questions around, hey are you going to outperform what you\u2019ve talked about this and that. ","We remain very firm on this, because part of that is a $600 million to $650 million target, it\u2019s included some of the investment what we are talking about here and so, given we remain very constant and consistent in terms of how we stuck to that number. ","And then the other thing is, from a corporate expense perspective and one of the things I think we\u2019ve done a good job of, and we will continue to is, it\u2019s been saving some dollars on the corporate expense side and then reinvesting some of those dollars into our operations that ultimately will drive long-term benefits. ","So, I think there is a book- some of the effect of what you are seeing in both those cases here. But, again I think very consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about and just to get a little bit of other perspective, I wanted to give you and the rest of other people on the call as it relates to some of the costs. ","John Heinbockel","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Edward J. Kelly ","Hi, guys. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. ","Tom Ben\u00e9","Good morning, Ed. ","Edward Kelly ","Hey, Tom, can I ask you about the independent business or the local business and just an update from you on what you are seeing from that customer segment from a demand perspective? There has been, I think just, some concern about whether things may be slowing down there or not, it\u2019s obviously a very hard channel to track. So just talk about what you are seeing on the demand side there and what your expectation is going forward?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Sure. So, look, we haven\u2019t really seen a big change from what we said. I think we continue to believe this is a very important and growing segment of the restaurant space for all the reasons we\u2019ve talked about, They are much more capable of flexing their business and their model to the changing consumer dynamics that are happening out there. ","They also \u2013 if you think about, whether it\u2019s the technology that\u2019s out there or this delivery that wasn\u2019t off and available to these folks, those kind of things are out there. So there are lot of things that are happening in that space. We continue to feel good about and we see at least from our numbers and our dealing with these folks that we think there is still runway there. ","Clearly, there are some cost pressures that they are facing, obviously product cost inflation is impacting them some. Some markets, the labor challenges that are out there are certainly impacting them and labor \u2013 I think it\u2019s always going to be a challenge for the restaurant industry as we go forward here. ","But generally we feel good and as I\u2019ve said earlier, given our share position, we feel like there is plenty of room for us to grow and as we\u2019ve talked in this local area, we\u2019ve now grown our business for 16 straight quarters and we continue to believe that we can deliver the kind of growth we\u2019ve talked with you all about. There is some growth happening in what we would call \u2013 kind of the micro change. So think about that as these emerging concepts we\u2019ve talked about. ","There are some of these folks that are starting to get more traction. These are the \u2013 they can be start out as three or five units and then they continue to add as they get traction. So we are seeing some pretty good growth within that segment of the independent market. ","Edward Kelly ","Okay. I just got a follow-up quickly on the cost side. Can you talk about when we should expect the cost in U.S. Food Service to begin to normalize a bit and see the true underlying EBIT growth within that business shine through?","Tom Ben\u00e9","I think, as we get into fiscal year 2019, you should start to see us get back to a little more balanced top-line versus cost. You know, as Joel just said, I think we purposely plan some investments in these businesses and base we are executing that plan that we had built. ","But as we get into fiscal year 2019, you should \u2013 as we talked about for our next three-year plan, we are very committed to the gap that we have between our top-line, our gross profit, and our expense growth and I think you should expect that as we get into fiscal year 2019. And that\u2019s through across our business, we are very focused on those numbers. ","We\u2019ve delivered them. We\u2019ve exceeded what we had said in our first three year plan and I think you should expect that we\u2019ll deliver what we communicated in our new three-year plan. ","Joel Grade","And quite honestly, without that happening, we wouldn\u2019t be able to deliver that present NAV gap and we certainly feel \u2013 again we certainly feel good about our ability to do that. So I think that\u2019s certainly the way to think about this. ","Edward Kelly ","Great, thanks guys. ","Tom Ben\u00e9","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Karen Short ","Hey, thanks. Just a quick question on your operating profit goals. You stated you are still planning to be at the high-end for this three years, and then 2018. Can you just give us an update where you are now?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Sure. Yes, we are at $561 million through, essentially through 11 quarters. ","Karen Short ","Okay. ","Tom Ben\u00e9","So we think we are in a good place. ","Karen Short ","Well, so I guess, just as I look at the way you have delivered each quarter this year, it seems like the fourth quarter, there is definitely a lot larger percent will be \u2013 need to be achieved in the fourth quarter this year. Is there anything specific about the fourth quarter that we should think about? I mean, if you were to get 100-ish million in the fourth quarter, that would be a lot bigger than you had in the past?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes, I mean, I agree. I think, but, number one, again just, certainly we continue to feel good about it. Two, it\u2019s certainly a big quarter for us typically as there is some seasonality, it\u2019s typically a strong quarter and so, obviously, Q3 being a smaller quarter and Q4 typically being a larger one. ","We do anticipate some positives on some \u2013 couple expense comparison areas as well. But I\u2019d just say in general, nothing shattering there, but we certainly continue \u2013 we certainly expect \u2013 continue to expect to get those numbers we talked about. ","Karen Short ","Okay, thanks. And then, in terms of freight, I guess, in general. I guess, obviously, you said, you had a plan in place to help mitigate some of the headwinds, but did it also get easier this quarter to pass on freight or is that kind of unchanged?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hey, Karen. Yes, I think \u2013 look, as time moves on, it have to become a little easier, but that\u2019s primarily in the contract customers, okay? I mean, if you think about the way this works, it comes to us for the independent customers isn\u2019t just another part of inflation if you really think about it. ","The cost of the products, the landing cost of the products go up and so it takes what\u2019s already normal inflation of 2.5% or so and takes it up even further. So, in the independents, it\u2019s a little harder, but as you have some more time, you can pass that along. And from a contract customer, given the cycle on the way that freight impacts actually hit us and ultimately we pass those along to the contract customers, we are able to pass more of that along. So, the longwinded answer is, yes to some extent. And that\u2019s certainly helping as well. ","Karen Short ","But I guess in that context then fourth quarter for you should be better than third sequentially, shouldn\u2019t it?","Tom Ben\u00e9","I think, what you maybe should expect is, we are hoping a continuation of what we had in the third quarter. I would necessarily say better. Having said that, we are still a little nervous about is the summer season kicks out, there is all kinds of new freight that\u2019s on the road. Things like produce, I mean, there is a lot of movement of freight in this country and summer season seems to be a big season. So, we are a little nervous about that relative to what we saw in Q4 of last year. But, time will tell. ","Joel Grade","But just the one thing I\u2019d add to that, I mean, to be clear, we are not banking our ability to hit the $600 million to $650 million based on an assumption in improved freight market. That have to \u2013 right. ","Karen Short ","Right. I wasn\u2019t requiring that. Okay, and just last question, within the local organic case growth, I know that you\u2019ve been asked this before and it\u2019s hard to do, but do you have any more insight into how much it\u2019s really coming from same-store sales or I guess, same-door sales versus new doors?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Well, we do manage in our business, what we would call penetration, so think about that is what you are asking is how much is coming from current customers buying more as well as business that\u2019s new or business we\u2019ve lost. Our penetration numbers are positive, which would suggest that we are getting more sales. ","But Karen, as you know, that\u2019s highly variable, every customer and every concept and every market can be a little bit different depending on what\u2019s going on in that market. So, it\u2019s hard to take that across the business, but as I said earlier, we continue to feel pretty good about a lot of these customers in the space. Not everybody has got a winning concept, not everybody is succeeding. But, we feel good about the customers that we do business with and many of them are doing well. ","Karen Short ","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Wolf with Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Andrew Wolf ","Thanks. Just wanted to ask you about the gross margin., it\u2019 s getting a lot better sequentially on a consolidated basis. So would ascribe that mainly to less inflation making the markets a little more efficient for distributors for \u2013 or is it max or pricing, give us a sense of what you think drove the improvement there?","Joel Grade","Yes, I\u2019ll start Andy and I\u2019ll let Tom to chime in here. I mean, first of all on the inflation comment, I mean, I would say broadly speaking, inflation \u2013 there wasn\u2019t much of it really a significant change there from that perspective. I think what we continue to see that ultimately drives, again, solid improvement in margins. ","We continue to talk about a continued good mix of local case growth, our brand growth and continued to be strong and so that\u2019s certainly always, again, a positive contributor into our overall margin. I think the point Tom made, we just talked about in this last conversation regarding freight. Again, that doesn\u2019t suggest that we\u2019ve had some dramatic shift there. ","But the ability that overtime \u2013 that variability to pass some of those cost along particularly to the contract customers as that ultimately translates some of the margin improvement as well. So, again, I wouldn\u2019t see, really there has been any sort of macro swing that\u2019s kind of mathematically caused it. ","But just in general, when you couple those things with continued enhancements with the technology and utilization of the technologies to improve our pricing through our revenue management, I think it\u2019s just overall continue to allow us to do well in that area. ","Andrew Wolf ","Okay. I just wanted to follow-up real quickly if I could, on the International side of the business where for the first three quarters it\u2019s still substantially down, but this quarter you are up a bit. First I just want to make sure I heard your explanation, what\u2019s this quarter\u2019s increase in operating profit internationally, just mainly driven by the harmonization of the calendar \u2013 the fiscal calendar at Brakes? Just wanted to make sure I heard that right. And I am \u2013 what I am really trying to get you is what the implication for Q4, should it be a better improvement?","Joel Grade","Well, so, Andy, so I think what I would say to that is, again, number one, keep in mind, Q3 for our International business is a small quarter in terms of dollars. But, I mean, so percentages get bigger based on smaller dollar movements. But I mean, there is certainly some element of calendarization that was one of the main drivers of the improvement in this quarter and we\u2019ve talked about that over the last few quarters. ","We anticipated some of the negative impacts, certainly in the first half of the year and we\u2019ve talked about the second half being better and you started to see some of that in this quarter. So, I think, again that\u2019s \u2013 and you\u2019ll see some more of that as we have anticipated in the fourth quarter as well. So I think, obviously there is lot of work being done to continue to announce the underlying operations of that. ","But certainly again, gives us certainly as we anticipated, first half of the year and some calendar impacts that some which we picked up here and we\u2019ll pick up a little more in Q4. But, that\u2019s not to suggest recovering all that, but that\u2019s what you are seeing there.","Andrew Wolf ","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. So, we can now think of modeling the International operations in terms of seasonal leverage and such similar to U.S. part assembly?","Joel Grade","Yes, I would say, it\u2019s certainly much more similar. Obviously, the stuff that we\u2019ve called out heading into this year, we certainly anticipate smoothing out, again keep in mind, we saw it one quarter to go where you are going to see some of that. But starting in our next fiscal year, yes, I think that\u2019s a fair comment, Andy. ","Andrew Wolf ","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bill Kirk with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Bill Kirk","Thank you. I have another question on International. I think it will be in the Q tomorrow, but what impact did the currency have on top-line and on profitability for that segment in the period?","Joel Grade","Yes, you know what, you are going to have to \u2013 you\u2019ll have to wait for the Q now and I don\u2019t have that right in front of me and certainly the last segment itself. As an overall enterprise, our foreign exchange contributed about little over about 1.6% in terms of top-line. It had fairly similar \u2013 that impacts from gross profit and OpEx but at the end of the day, on the net bottom-line, there was a minimal impact for the enterprise as a whole, but you\u2019ll have to wait on the impact, specifically for that segment until tomorrow. ","Bill Kirk","Okay. And maybe another way to get to the same idea. What were the cases \u2013 what were case growth for International segment in the 3Q?","Joel Grade","Yes, so that\u2019s not actually something we break out our volume metrics in our International business or not the same in all cases as they are in our \u2013 what we call our U.S. or Canadian businesses. And so, we don\u2019t actually have, again, there is different volume metrics across those businesses. We haven\u2019t get \u2013 what I would call harmonized volume metric for that segment. ","Bill Kirk","Okay. That\u2019s all for me. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Marisa Sullivan ","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I am not sure if you stated this exactly so far, but what is your expectations for inflation moving into the fourth quarter and then into the back half of the calendar year?","Joel Grade","Yes, I think the way I\u2019d look that is, it\u2019s pretty consistent with where we are at, maybe slightly up, I think is our view. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d necessarily call out anything really dramatic there. But certainly, again our three year plan expectations that we\u2019ve laid out at our Investor Day were, I\u2019d say, little below where we are at today and what our expectation is here as we move forward over the next few months.","Marisa Sullivan ","Got it. And I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, there was some operational challenges, was this just related to weather or is there anything else to call out there that might continue into the fourth quarter?","Tom Ben\u00e9","What I talked about, Marisa, was, primarily the weather-related impacts that we had. And some of the ongoing transportation challenges, fuel, obviously was also an impact for us in the quarter. So I think, fuel obviously is going to continue, but, a lot of the weather ones. Obviously, we are hoping we don\u2019t have those problems. ","Joel Grade","Yes, and I think one of the things, I mean, we do a better re-ramp up or bit of staffing in this time of year and when we had a little bit of a \u2013 given weather impact on volume that outsize of negative overall impact operational metrics. ","The only other thing I\u2019d add is, I did mentioned, we still \u2013 kind of we mentioned this in our Q2 and the \u2013 as we\u2019ve taken on some of this new business, mostly on the contract side, we have not mitigated some of those start-up cost as quickly as we would have liked. And so, there was a little bit of that in Q3 as well. And we do think that that will certainly, that\u2019s kind of mitigated now and we should be in good shape going forward. ","Marisa Sullivan ","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.","Kelly Bania ","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to ask again, maybe a different way on operating expenses. Can you help us understand of the growth and operating expenses this quarter and last quarter, maybe how much of that is maybe some of the investments and things like MA and technology, that maybe you have to accelerate some of your momentum versus maybe some of the things that are out \u2013 a little bit more outside of your direct control in terms of the operating expenses?","Joel Grade","Yes, Kelly, again, we kind of talked about each of these \u2013 I would say, I\u2019m not going to probably quantify specific level you would like each of those areas. But I think the important thing to remember is, many of these expenses in the quarter were planned expenses and again, it\u2019s built into that three year plan that we laid out 2.5 years ago at this point. ","And, knowing we needed to make some investments in these areas of business it\u2019s not a big part of what\u2019s happening in the U.S. I think, look, we just talked about some of these operational expense challenges and those are real, certainly on the transportation and warehousing side, whether it\u2019s the ramp up of new customers, or some of the weather impacts where we\u2019ve got the expense without the volume and sales are real and then the bad debt was the other one. ","So, those are the big areas. And when we talk about sales and MAs, I would include in that this technology investment we are making to make that selling organization more efficient, more effective and certainly continuing to work on how that experience our customers have with doing business with us gets improved. So, those are the big focus areas. ","But as I said earlier, most of these were planned. It just relates to the selling side of this and I think, as we talked earlier, we should start to see those mitigate in the first part of fiscal year 2019. ","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes, and again, I just \u2013 Kelly, I just remind you, I mean, again, we \u2013 part of my prepared comments, I did talk about we continue to anticipate seeing better expect this gap between GP and OpEx improve. And then, certainly, obviously, our next three-year plan as we laid out at out Investor Day continues this path as one of that point spreads and again, we feel good about where those are at. ","Again, there is just some \u2013 again, we\u2019ve talked, as we headed into this last part of the three year plan, while making some of these investments, you are seeing some of it. But we certainly still feel good about all of the \u2013 we talked about here both for the last part of this three year plan as well as the next one. ","Kelly Bania ","Okay. Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe just another one in terms of freight. You mentioned a little better performance this quarter, last quarter, but do you think we\u2019ve hit the peak in terms of impact of that or is this something we are going to be doing for a couple of years here? And also, at what point do we get to a level where either on freight or fuel that surcharges kind of come back in the industry?","Joel Grade","So, we\u2019ve talked a little bit about freight this morning. I think we feel good about what happened in our Q3 and some of that\u2019s driven by, probably industry, and some of it\u2019s driven by actions that we were taking. It\u2019s really too hard to call it right now, whether we think that level of performance is going to continue. ","And I think as I said earlier, a lot of this has to do with capacity and as capacity gets tight, then obviously the challenges, if anybody who is moving a lot of freight start to show up. And so, we obviously receive a lot of freight from suppliers. Because the pressure is really been on drivers and the drivers \u2013 that\u2019s not going to change overnight. ","There aren\u2019t a lot of drivers coming into the workforce as they are probably necessary. And I think we\u2019ve all got to continue to work for find better ways to move freight, rail at one point was a good option. It\u2019s not been as great of option in the last year or so. But, it\u2019s something we got to continue to look at. So we are going to continue everything we can. ","But it\u2019s hard for us to sit here and make a call on that. Regarding fuel and surcharges, that we have in place a surcharge approach for fuel primarily, and that process is out there and articulated to our customers. So, as fuel continues to grow, we have a process to mitigate some of that as and recover all of it. But we do have those plans in place. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Karen Holthouse ","Hi, thank you for taking the question. Just another one on the commodity inflation side. We are now a couple quarters in a row in the 2%, 3% inflation and I think when it initially moved, it started to move up a lot of that, what sort of attributed to noise around hurricanes and maybe produce? Are you starting to view it maybe as a little bit more structural or starting to see pressure in sort of the underlying grain or protein areas?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t see us getting anything really dramatic there. I mean, I would say, from a produce perspective, we are actually still seeing some level of produce inflation that I would say frankly as probably little higher and a little longer than we anticipated. ","So that\u2019s kind of still there. The main categories here are dairy, produce and meats. And so, I think, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d really call Karen, anything really kind of underlying structurally that\u2019s really outrageous there. But that again, I would just \u2013 I would say, the produce is probably been a little bit higher and a little bit longer than we anticipated. ","Karen Holthouse ","Okay. And then, on the current three-year plan throughout 2020, it sounds like this year is going to come in a little bit below sort of the implied case during \u2013 previously talked about, sort of pretty balanced cadence between the three years. How should we think about that as it translates into the next two years? Would it still be sort of balanced between 2019, 2020 or would 2019 potentially be a little bit of a catch up year?","Joel Grade","Yes, so, I guess, sort of I would say is, just as a reminder, I mean, Karen, we\u2019ve been very consistent in the time of the fact that we are very confident in our ability to achieve the objectives we\u2019ve set up for our last three year plan, which is sort of the high-end of the $600 million to $650 million. We feel \u2013 we are very much, we feel on track in terms of heading into our next three year plan or it\u2019s just being the first year of next three year plan. ","And one of the things we\u2019ve talked about as well at our Investor Day is that, there is, we are pretty balanced in terms of the growth that we are experiencing year-over-year as part of these plans. And so, well, certainly this year we anticipated a little - as Tom talked about, with some of the investments we\u2019ve made, we did anticipate some higher level of expense coming into this year that suggests a little bit of a bigger ramp over the next couple. But I would just say in general, we are kind of on track on where we said it\u2019s being and feel good about where we are at. ","Karen Holthouse ","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","John Ivankoe ","Hi, great. Thank you. Just a clarification, I think of two different comments that you made. So, do you expect on the corporate basis, GP dollar growth gap to expand versus OpEx in the fourth quarter, but still not with expansion in U.S. Food Service, is that correct?","Joel Grade","Yes, I didn\u2019t go into the second part. What I was really saying you is on the \u2013 on an overall enterprise basis, I was expecting that to expand, yes. ","John Ivankoe ","Okay. And \u2013 but I did hear, when as you were talking about optimizing the sales force, especially the new sales force, that you would \u2013 you kind of expect improvement beginning in fiscal 2019, so perhaps that you interpreted that fourth quarter would be relatively slow as third quarter. So, correct me if I am wrong.","Joel Grade","Yes, I don\u2019t know that we actually gave that kind of guidance, John. As you know, it does takes a little bit of time as Tom has pointed out for those sales people. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily look at this \u2013 there has been anything dramatic on that in Q4. But again, we didn\u2019t guided that.","John Ivankoe ","Okay.","Tom Ben\u00e9","And also, John, that\u2019s one piece of the overall cost puzzle for all the businesses and certainly the U.S. business. So, I wouldn\u2019t assume anything in that. ","John Ivankoe ","Okay. Fair enough. And finally, obviously, digital is very important for your customer, very important for your sales force efficiency and effectiveness. I mean, is there a certain point that you expect that you can have much more effective and efficient sales people? I mean, does that happen in early 2019 and based on that type of comment, I mean, are there any markets and specifically that you piloted that shows what the margin opportunity is with technology? ","Tom Ben\u00e9","We continue to feel really good about the work we are doing in the technology space and we continue to see improvement in the number of customers who are using our technology solution to both order products from us and operate their business. ","We also have seen, certainly as we\u2019ve talked a little bit more improved penetration in customers who use the technology solutions. But, broadly speaking, we feel good about where we are at in that space and feel like it\u2019s going to continue to be an investment we need to make and one that will drive some benefits for us long-term. ","Joel Grade","I think the only other thing I would add to that is, just as a reminder though, I mean, there is some of the investments we\u2019ve made that we\u2019ve talked about in our sales force are very targeted. So, in other words, this isn\u2019t necessarily in anyway sort of reflection of \u2013 like we were actually anticipating over time, both increased productivity from our sales force as a result of the technology, but the investments we\u2019ve made here are again, I would say, very targeted based on areas where we see additional opportunities to penetrate our market. So, just as a reminder to that as well. ","John Ivankoe ","Thank you. ","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. ","Neil A. Russell Well, thank you everybody. We\u2019d like to thank you for tuning into our third quarter conference call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and an introduction.","I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations, Communications and Treasurer. You may begin, sir.","Neil Russell","Thanks, Natalya, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Sysco's second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. Joining me in Houston today are Tom Ben\u00e9, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that states the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and actual results could differ in a material manner.","Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018, subsequent SEC filings, and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com or via Sysco's IR App.","Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Ben\u00e9.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Good morning, everyone, and thank you as always for joining us. I'd like to start this morning with some key themes that drove our results for the quarter, along with some comments on the current macro environment we are operating in, followed by a discussion of recent organizational changes, then continuing with our U.S. Foodservice Operations business results, and concluding with a discussion of our International and Other business segment. Joel will then discuss the financial results in more detail.","For the second quarter, we saw improved year-over-year top-line results and are continuing to execute on our strategic priorities designed to improve our overall performance. Our focus for the quarter was led by our efforts to enrich customers' experience of doing business with Sysco and to consistently provide excellent service, help our customers to be successful. We remain committed to achieving our three-year plan financial objectives. Although the manner in which we achieve them may look slightly different from what we originally outlined. Joel will discuss this further in just a few moments.","Our results for the second quarter include: a sales increase of 2.5% to $14.8 billion; gross profit growth of 2.7% to $2.8 billion; and adjusted operating expense growth of 2.1%, which delivered an adjusted operating income increase of 4.8% to $603.3 million; and an adjusted earnings per share decrease of $0.03 per share to $0.75.","Local case volume was solid within U.S. Broadline operations, growing 3.3%, of which 2.4% was organic. Total case volume within U.S. Broadline grew 2.9%, of which 2% was organic, with local growth outpacing national this quarter.","As previously discussed, we expected overall softer volume this quarter due to lapping of the HFM acquisition and the lapping of two large national customers. Looking at broader economic and industry trends, and as we think about the key drivers in foodservice and the segments in which we operate, there are number of factors which are important in the overall macro environment, including consumer confidence and discretionary spending.","Even with the recent somewhat volatile financial markets, we continue to see U.S. consumer confidence remaining fairly strong, driven by the solid labor market with unemployment remaining low at 3.9% as of December, which is normally a good indicator of that higher consumer confidence.","In the restaurant industry, we continue to see sales growth, particularly in same store sales, though traffic continues to be mixed. And lastly, from international economic outlook perspective, it's mixed where we do business. In the UK, the consumer is still dealing with uncertainty and concerns over Brexit next step.","However, this is balanced with some strength in other geographies. And generally speaking, we are seeing decent consumer spending and overall industry trends in the other international markets where we do business.","Turning to the topic of M&A, M&A continues to be an important part of our strategy for growth. Last week, two new acquisitions were made public: one in the U.S., Waugh Foods; and one in Ireland, Classic Drinks. Though these are examples of smaller transactions, especially compared to the size of total Sysco, these acquisitions are great examples of our M&A strategy.","Waugh Foods is a Central Illinois distributor with the overwhelming majority of its business with independent restaurants. And Classic Drinks is an established specialized wine and spirits distributor, which will further strengthen our existing product portfolio in our Ireland business.","I'd like to now transition to some organizational and leadership changes that we recently announced. In order to drive continued growth and to create value for all Sysco stakeholders, we implemented organizational and executive leadership changes, which will further align the company with its customer first operating model and streamline the business.","These changes will help us increase agility, reduce costs, and accelerate decision making across the business by getting closer to our customers and better aligning our resources to support and address their evolving needs.","Additionally, this reorganization results in an approximate 10% reduction in salaried corporate support positions. And while any decision which impacts our associates is a difficult one, this is an essential step to realign the organization and sharpen our focus on the company's key strategies to enable growth.","Now, I'd like to transition to our second quarter results by business segment beginning with U.S. Foodservice Operations. Sales for the second quarter were $10.1 billion, an increase of 4.2%. Gross profit grew 4.5%. Operating expenses grew 4.7%. And operating income increased 4.2%. Inflation during the first 2 months of the quarter remained relatively flat, but increased towards the end of the quarter contributing to the total gross profit dollar growth.","Overall gross profit growth was also positively impacted by an increase in case growth, a reduction in spot market usage of inbound freight, continued growth in Sysco brand, which was up 59 basis points in our local segment versus prior year, benefiting from our ongoing category management initiatives and our Cutting Edge Solutions innovation platform.","Our Cutting Edge Solutions continue to provide value-added products for our customers. We are excited about our next launch for these innovative new products that will be taking place in a couple of weeks, which we also believe could be our best yet.","Also of note, we continue to see an increase in the utilization of our digital ordering platform, which has improved over 50% of local cases ordered. Additionally, we continue to make progress on improving our customer-facing tools, including a refreshed delivery app and improvements to our digital shopping platform.","From an expense perspective, operating expenses grew for the quarter, driven primarily by continued supply-chain cost increases in both the warehouse and transportation areas. While we have seen increased cost in these areas in recent quarters, we continue to remain focused on better managing and mitigating these costs. As an example, we continue to focus on specialized recruiting, training and onboarding efforts. We are starting to see an improvement in retention, especially in the warehouse.","Moving on to our International Foodservice Operations for the quarter, sales increased 0.8%, gross profit decreased 1.6%, adjusted operating expenses decreased by 2.6%. And adjusted operating income grew 5.1%. In our International segment, from a top-line perspective, we saw improved performance in Canada, with strong sales growth year-over-year, despite some softness in Alberta.","In the UK, top-line performance for the quarter was impacted by continued uncertainties surrounding Brexit and our business in France was impacted by the Yellow Vests protest during the critical holiday timeframe.","From a cost perspective, in our International segment, we had some supply chain challenges in the UK, as we onboarded several new customers to the business. In Ireland, the team continues to execute strongly against our integration initiatives. And as a result, synergies in the merger of Brakes Ireland and Pallas are ahead of schedule.","Our integration of Brake France and Davigel into Sysco France is not only progressing well, but we launched our new Sysco France brand to the French market last week at the SIRHA World Hospitality and Food Service event in Lyon. This is an important step to building on our position as a leading European food service provider.","As we have also discussed, in Europe, we have accelerated the investments we are making related to our long-term strategic growth plans, which are designed to enrich the customer experience and position us well in these markets. Joe will discuss this point further in a moment and its impact our Certain Items this quarter.","Moving on to SYGMA, performance for the quarter was down as we continue to optimize our business in this industry segment and we remain focused on improving our overall operational performance.","We expect to see continued softness in the top-line as we make disciplined choices in an effort to improve profitability for the long term. And lastly, in our other business segment, Guest Supply had strong top-line performance during the quarter, with increased sales of 8.3% and increased gross profit of 5.2%, though cost continue to be a challenge due to continued impact of tariffs, product availability and the increased cost of shipping products to our customers.","Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the hospitality segment and remain excited about the long-term potential for this business. In summary, overall, the fundamentals in our industry and in our business remained solid. We plan to continue to deliver against our strategic priorities to provide an improved customer experience, excellent customer service and strong operating performance.","And finally, I'd like to thank our dedicated associates across the company for all of their efforts to make Sysco a distributor of choice for our customers and the leader in the food service industry. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Joel Grade","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I would like to provide you with additional financial details surrounding our performance for the quarter. As Tom noted for the second quarter for total Sysco sales were $14.8 billion, an increase of 2.5% compared to the same period last year. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.7%. Gross profit in the second quarter increased 2.7% and gross margin increased 4 basis points. During the quarter, particularly in December, in our U.S. Broadline business, we experienced 1.4% inflation, driven by a few categories, primarily frozen potato, meat, paper and produce.","Adjusted operating expenses for total Sysco were up 2.1% for the quarter, with regard to the leverage of operating expense growth, gross profit dollar growth our performance was in line with our expectations. While we did improved performance compared to the first quarter of this fiscal year. We remain focused on improving this trend to the third quarter, the second half of the year and for the remainder of the three year plan.","Total adjusted operating income was $603.3 million in the quarter, an increase of 4.8% compared to the same period last year. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased adjusted operating income by 48 basis points. We previously discussed transformative initiatives that we have in place, which will allow us to continue to grow our business and capitalized on our strong fundamentals.","As we continue to evolve as a company, we are placing further emphasis on the holistic assessment of our work in order to effectively centralize and standardize our business, including by leveraging technology and strengthening Sysco overall.","We'll continue to focus on strong implementation and execution, while accelerating some of this work, all of which provides us with confidence to achieve our financial objectives. As a reminder, we're expecting to see increased cost savings benefit from this initiative in the second half of this fiscal year.","Some of these initiatives include: first, our Finance Transformation Roadmap. This important work is about modernizing our global financial platform, starting mostly within our U.S. operations. We're centralizing activities, automating work and working with offshore partners where the transactional work can be done more efficiently and cost effectively. Changes have begun and we expect to see the benefits in the second half of this fiscal year.","The second area focus is our Smart Spending initiatives. Here, we take a detailed and accelerated view of indirect spending categories to identify and execute on cost reductions in these areas. Again, we anticipate benefits being realized in the second half of the fiscal year. In our Canadian Regionalization, this work is about optimizing the leadership and overall structure of our Canadian business, which historically has been highly decentralize. We have good opportunities here and feel great about the progress we've made thus far.","And finally regarding overall administrative expenses. We continue to aggressively look for new and innovative ways to drive cost out of the business, which aligned with our transformative efforts to drive growth. Areas that are not only in line with our three-year plan objectives, but also either accelerate some initiatives or our incremental to the original plan. An example will be the changes we discussed earlier regarding the new streamline organizational and business unit structure.","Turning to earnings per share. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter decreased $0.03 to $0.75 per share. Our EPS results this quarter were impacted by our tax rate. As a reminder, in the second quarter fiscal 2018, we saw retroactive benefit back to the beginning of our fiscal year in FY 2018 due to the adoption of reduced tax rates in the U.S., while U.S. tax rates are lower in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The retroactive benefit created a larger benefit in the second quarter of our fiscal 2018 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.","Our EPS results this quarter were also impacted by increased interest expense, which is higher than the same period last year due to variable rate changes, and less stock option exercises than in the prior year. I would also like to remind you that we anticipate our effective tax rate for this fiscal year to be 25%.","I would like to take a minute now to talk about, why we had a large amount of Certain Item in this quarter. We continue making investments in our business related to our strategic plans designed a position us for long-term growth. Our Certain Items in the second quarter are primarily related to these initiatives including the integration of our businesses in France and Ireland, European multi-temperature investments, our Finance Transformation Roadmap and Canadian Regionalization.","The largest in the Certain Items is related to the restructuring of our France business, which included significant severance. As we've discussed with the France restructuring, we are integrating our Brake France and Davigel businesses in to Sysco France. The merger of these two businesses will position us well for continued success in the French marketplace. And we expect to see benefit from this initiative in our France business beginning in fiscal 2020. Additionally as we have stated, we anticipate seeing benefit from our Finance Transformation Roadmap and Canadian Regionalization initiatives in the second half of this fiscal year.","Now turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $917.8 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2019, which was $15.4 million lower compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2019 was $700.9 million, which was $22.4 million higher compared to the prior year. The improvement in free cash flow was due primarily to continued improvements in payables and receivables.","As a reminder in the second quarter fiscal 2018, we deferred cash tax payments due to flood relief associated through Hurricane Harvey, so this is impacting our year-over-year comparison. Net capital expenditures totaled $216.9 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2019, which was $37.8 million lower compared to the prior year period.","In summary, we saw improved results for the second quarter and we remain focused on supporting our customers and executing our business initiatives to achieve our objectives. At this point, we are halfway through our three-year plan and an increase adjusted operating income by $241 million. We are committed to achieving our goals, and as always we are committed to performing consistently on a high level to achieve customer satisfaction and solidify our industry-leading position.","Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks. Just to clarify a couple of things, so as we look at the percent of savings coming from gross profit dollars versus OpEx, it does seem that it will be much more skewed to OpEx now with these layoffs. Can you maybe just give an update on how to think about that?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yeah, hi, Karen. So I would say it's somewhat more than we kind of - I wouldn't call it dramatically more. But again, just \u2013if you think about it, the first half of this three-year plan, for the most part we've had relatively flat levels of inflation. Certainly some of the challenges we've had in supply chain. So I guess, I would just say that some of the - there is a bit more emphasis on some of the administrative cost reductions. But, again, as we've seen little bit of inflation returning and certainly - obviously, continue to work to mitigate some of the challenges on the supply chain side.","Again, I would say somewhat more focused, but again, I wouldn't say we're really dramatically shifting, we talked about it earlier.","Joel Grade","And, Karen, I might just add. I mean, I think if you think about it as - we really have two big buckets, you had gross profit and you had cost. And what we're really talking about and what we've been sharing is that our supply chain costs have been higher over the last few quarters. So we're having to balance that still on the cost side. So it's kind of - cost and gross profit isn't the big shift. It's really more between some of the cost buckets that we're really focusing on.","Karen Short","Okay, but just for modeling purposes, to clarify, when I look at the corporate number, it's fair to say that that only included the benefit of the corporate layer or the supply chain - sorry, shared services for one month out of the three in the quarter, right? So going forward as we model corporate that number should be quite a bit lower?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yeah, so it would not have included any of that at this point, so there will be some impact on corporate expenses moving forward, yes.","Karen Short","Okay. And then, just my follow-up is I was curious if local organic case growth internally was in line with plan. And I know you said the kind of quarter was in general, but only asking, because you actually don't no longer have a slide highlighting case growth and you guys kind of had that slide in the past, so any color on that would be great.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Let's look back on that slide. I'm not sure about that. But the - as far as the local case growth, I think we feel really good about the case growth. I think there was a little bit of choppiness in the quarter. It kind of came back little stronger towards the end, which is we feel good about. But I would say it was maybe a little less than we had planned but not dramatically different.","Karen Short","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","Hey, guys. Tom, maybe a quick question, could you maybe walk through some of the changes you made here on the organizational side, because they sound more operational? So what happened in terms of chain of command - span of control, layers of management? How do you go to market differently because of this and then how do you guard against any adverse impact on your customer?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Great question, John, thanks. So let's start with, the changes we made were in fact around kind of streamlining the business. And when you think about spans and layers was the key focus, very focused in corporate. And so, when you think about impact to our customers or to our selling organization, or to our growth plans, little to none. I mean, that's not where the focus was. This is really about how do we kind of improve kind of the agility of this organization, our ability to make decisions more quickly. And so, it's heavily focused on corporate office. And as you probably saw or heard, there were a couple of changes with my leadership team.","So the headline here is, mostly kind of the spans and layers exercise in areas where we felt like we could remove some cost and maybe some redundancy and candidly get us more focused on the key priorities we got and then we've outlined to you all.","From a leadership perspective, there were a couple of changes that are probably worth highlighting. One is that we've been going through some work within our technology area. We've got a kind of an innovation technology group and we've got a core traditional technology group. And we're looking at how we bring those two organizations closer together. And we've been doing some work around that. And as we continue that work, we will continue to make some adjustments.","And so, what you saw there was a change taking place within the kind of traditional IT area. The great news for us is we've got a deep bench here. We feel very good about the team we've got and the work we're doing. And so I don't think you should expect and we certainly don't expect to miss a beat with our technology efforts.","The other thing is there were some - think about it in the administration area, we had a role that was kind of an administrative role. It was a combination of a lot of other things that as a company we have tucked under that role over the last couple of years, think about CSR, think about even some of our communications work. And so, we felt like there was an opportunity here to streamline that work and that organization. And so, we obviously - we placed the important part of that role, which was the Chief Legal Officer.","And we promoted a talented woman named Eve McFadden here at Sysco, who is now our new Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. And so, again, really no impact there, I think from an overall business perspective or certainly from any of our customers or our strategic focus. And so, those are probably the largest changes that are worth highlighting.","Joel Grade","Yeah, and if I could just add one thing and just to reiterate something Tom said, yeah, John, none of these were cost changes that were in any way inconsistent. We're not saying costs out that are actually supporting growth. So I think that's really an important point here that there is work been done to streamline and tighten the connection between our customers and our selves. But this is certainly nothing done that's going to impact growth.","John Heinbockel","And then one last thing, if you - and if you look at the step-up in inflation, right, you saw in December, and it's not clear if that's going to continue. But let's assume it does. How do feel about pass-through right now, right, relative to all the other cost pressures your customers are seeing? Maybe compared to the past, do you think you can pass it through as you have in the past or maybe it's a little more challenging?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yeah, I don't think we've seen really a big change there. I think, look, as we've always said, too much inflation is hard to pass through, but as long as it remains at kind of this modest level, I think we still feel very good about our ability to do that.","Clearly, we've got lots of tools in our tool-belt here including Sysco brand, which we continue to talk a lot about. But it's driving really good performance. I think it was 59 basis points we talked about this quarter. And again, we've just kind of seen that ongoing benefit that we get from Sysco brand. And that, again, helps our customers a lot. It generally provides them some value and, obviously, it's good for us as well.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thank you.","Tom Ben\u00e9","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","Hey, great. Thanks very much for taking my question, guys. Just wanted to follow-up on the headcount reductions. Can you just kind of give us maybe a little bit more color on how does that fit into kind of the grand scheme of the cost cutting initiatives, especially as we go through the next couple of years here? Is it fair to say that's kind of the largest bucket among them and other ones that might be worth noting in terms of progress?","Tom Ben\u00e9","So let me start and I'll let Joel talk here too. And I think it's important to go back to the things we've been consistently talking about. So certainly cost is an important part of us delivering the three-year plan. And as we continue to talk, I mean, the balance of that cost may be slightly different than we initially had talked about, primarily between the supply chain area because that area has been increasing and the administrative cost side.","But this recent action is really about maintaining the focus that we talked about on cost broadly. Yes, it was focused on administrative side of this. But I wouldn't say that this is a large part of the overall. When you think about the plans we had over the 3 years, all of these areas need to work together. And this is just one piece of that, that overall puzzle, in addition to the big buckets that Joel also has mentioned numerous times. So with that, I'll let Joel kind of build on that.","Joel Grade","Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add, Vinnie, is this - we talked about the fact that we've had some of these initiatives that we have that were multiyear in scope. And in some cases, some benefits are being able to be accelerated on those. And then in some cases there are also things that we looked at that were outside of the main scope of those. And this would be one of those things. And so, in other words as we sort of thought about and some of the things we talked about at overall cost discussions this will be one of those things that would be incremental to that.","And so, anyways, that's the way I would think about it. And again, just - again, as a reminder, there is obviously still a very large part of this benefit that we're looking is to get from our gross profit dollar growth as well. So I mean, this is - I still consider it as a very balanced approach, with just some further acceleration of those things. And again, some of these things that - like that were incremental to the additional plans that we laid out.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay. That's helpful guys. Thank you. And then maybe just a quick follow-up comment. I think you said in your prepared remarks that you had a reduction in spot market usage. Can you guys just give us a quick update on transportation, freight cost, kind of where you are on a sequential basis and how you're able to be better managing through?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yeah, if think about that comment, it's very specific to inbound freight. And if you think about a year ago when we really hit - I think in this quarter had a big increase in that spot market utilization because of the tight market hit and everyone was scrambling. We got - like probably everybody we got kind of pushed to the spot market. We just done as we talk for the last really four quarters a much better job of managing that.","And so as we went into this year, it's that overlap that I'm really referring to that was down. So I think we talked about this last quarter. I'd say the inbound freight is kind of the new normal. It's higher than it was certainly a year ago, kind of spread out over a year. But year over year for the quarter we saw some benefit just because that's when we took the biggest impact last year.","Vincent Sinisi","Got it. All right, that's super helpful. Thanks very much guys. Good luck.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yeah, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Judah Frommer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Judah Frommer","Hi, thanks for taking the question guys. Maybe first just on the independent case growth commentary. I think it's been a while that you've been talking about same store sales being flattish to positive and traffic being more mixed. And kind of at what point do you get concerned about the trajectory of that independent business? And can you talk about those very small one and two store independents versus the chains that you've been talking about more recently?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yeah, good morning, Judah. I think, we continue to feel good about the mix of our business. We've talked over the last couple of quarters about this kind of regional change or this kind of micro changes are growing and that continues, and I think we still feel good about our position there, because of the value proposition that we have for those customers.","We think about the true independents, the ones you're talking about this kind of one- and two-unit kind of operators. Look, we continue to see as we said a decent growth there. Now it is very much driven by the outlet and the type of the business that they're running and the experience they are providing. But generally speaking we still feel good about that. So I think, there - and as you've heard us talk a lot and I won't overdo it on the - this market is still very fragmented.","So the acquisitions were good example, even - while Waugh is a fairly small acquisition relative to Sysco's size, it's a great example of where there are a lot of really good regional distributors out there, who are still doing good business and are a good fit.","And so those guys are heavily independent driven and it's a great example of how we can leverage some great work and a great organization that they have with Sysco and the capabilities we bring. So long-winded way of saying, look, I think, we still feel really good about our position, our growth and certainly our prospects given the marketplace that we operate in.","Judah Frommer","Okay, great. And then, maybe just quickly, if we kind of rewind to Q1, I would say there was some combination of warehouse labor pressure and flattish inflation causing some consternation on your part that hitting the midpoint of 2020 guidance would be tougher against that backdrop. Would you saying that we fast forward to Q2 and kind of the exit rates there, that was kind of the offset in operating expense and inflation kind of re-ramping that, you do feel better about those 2020 targets than you did 3.5 months ago?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Well, I think, we feel good about the 2020 targets are long. So I think, what we've talked about is some shifting of how we might deliver that. But we have consistently said, we feel good about our ability to deliver this three-year plan and we still feel very comfortable about that.","Joel Grade","Yeah, Judah, I think, we just - we called out a couple of things that we've - since we've said are causing us to continue to accelerate some other things, because we're certainly not just sitting on our laurels, and saying inflation is low in the supply chain side. Obviously, we're going after some of that stuff. But I think, we've been pretty consistent in saying - in expressing our confidence in achieving our targets.","Judah Frommer","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America.","Marisa Sullivan","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about cost savings. As some of the initiatives that you've been talked about kind of roll in and kick in the back half. Do you think that you'll get back to that longer term 150 basis points gap between gross profit dollar and OpEx growth in 3Q? Or is that more of a - will that take more time to get you back to that long-term level?","Joel Grade","Hey, Marisa, it's Joel. Yeah. So the way I would think about that, obviously, we don't give the type of quarterly guidance, but what I would say is that again, as we continue to express confidence in our - achieving our three-year targets. And as mathematically would be necessary in order to get back to or exceed that rate over the next six quarters. I would think about that way.","Again, we've talked about the fact that our second half of this fiscal year, we believe, we'll ramp in some of those areas and including that gap. So again, I'm not giving specific guidance, I would just tell you that we continue to express that confidence, and I'd say mathematically that would certainly have to be the case over the course of those six quarters.","Marisa Sullivan","Got you. And then on the corporate reductions that you've announced this morning. When did they kick in? How quickly did they roll on to the P&L? And is there more room to go and you have to kind of find more incremental pockets to get to maybe back to that mid- to higher-end of the EBIT improvement range?","Joel Grade","So why don't I start here? I mean, so I think the question when does it start to kick in that will be in the third quarter. And so you'll start to see some of those benefits in Q3 and again over the second half of the fiscal year. I guess, the other thing I would say, and again certainly, Tom could chime in here; we're always continually looking for ways to do this. Again, we often get asked, hey, we've got this sort of key initiatives we've laid out. Are there other things you're doing? And then again, that's our job to always look for different opportunities. And so we'll certainly continue to do that. But hopefully, that gives you some clarity on the timing.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yeah, Marisa, I think that's well said. I mean, I think this - anytime you take an action like this, it's difficult for the associates involved and we take that very seriously here. But I think at the same time, it is our responsibility to be constantly looking for ways to optimize this business, and improve the overall experience our customers are doing business with us, and we're going to continue to do that as an organization, and we'll have to - time will tell whether or not some of those things need to be accelerate or not, but we feel really good about the plans we have in place right now.","Joel Grade","Yeah. And I think the only thing I'd just - again, not to sound like a broken record here, but again, these are not - again, we are not taking cost out of things that are actually facilitating growth in our company. And so I think that's just really important. We continue to invest in this company, we continue to ensure that we're investing in the right places to grow, and we also continue to look for opportunities to streamline. I just think, it's important to make sure that message is loud and clear.","Marisa Sullivan","Thanks. Super helpful.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.","Kelly Bania","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to the workforce reduction, I guess, two questions. One, can you just talk about the size of the impact of that on a dollar standpoint on an annualized basis? And then, I just to clarify was this always part of the three-year plan or was there any change into the size of the structure of it? Or was it just pulled forward in terms of timing relative to your original expectations?","Joel Grade","Hey, Kelly, thanks for the question. Yeah. So no, this is - first of all, a couple of things on that. We've been actually given the dollar amount, the dollar magnitude of that. We didn't talk about certain - 10% of the positions in corporate support, but we have not given that dollar amount. The question - and so again, as I mentioned in my remarks, this - I would characterize this as one of those things that are incremental as some of the stuff that we actually talked about as part of our plan. It's sort of fall in one of those categories we often get the question, hey, what else are you guys going? This would be one of those things.","And so this would not have fallen into one of the things we talked about specifically in our Investor Day or key initiatives that we often talk about.","Kelly Bania","Okay. Perfect. And then in terms of the inflation, it sounded like that started really in the latter part of the quarter? Just curious is that has continued into January and what maybe you're expecting for the back half in terms of inflation in your plan?","Joel Grade","Yeah, I would say, Kelly, at this point, that has continued. And I think our expectation is that called modest levels of inflation here over the next couple of quarters.","Kelly Bania","Okay, great. And maybe just a bigger picture on then, as you look at your competitive set, obviously, the big three of about one-third of the share. But just curious what you're seeing from that other two-thirds in this regional distributors, you talked about some of them performing well with independents or catering to the independents well. But are you seeing any changes in behavior or strategy with those group of distributors that we don't really get to hear from on a regular basis?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hey, Kelly, this is Tom. I don't think, we really - I mean, it remains very competitive, obviously, out there. And when we talked about this fair amount, but as you know, the big kind of the public three, while, that's very visible to everyone, there are very good and very capable regional distributors in this business, and many of them. But there are some fairly large ones as well on a regional basis that we all compete with. And I would say that they have always been good competition and they continue to be. But I don't think we've seen anything kind of new or different from them or just dramatically change, so highly competitive, but there are certainly a lot of good companies out there in this industry.","Kelly Bania","Thanks.","Tom Ben\u00e9","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just on the inflation commentary. So it was pretty flat in the first two months, and then you ended up a little bit ahead of 1% for the quarter really just driven by December. With that just the math would imply that you are running north of 4% probably in December?","Is that the right way to think about it? And - is that how to think about the run rate into the third quarter? Or were there really some parts of that that you would view as more temporary? Thanks.","Joel Grade","Yeah. So - Karen, it's Joel. We - first of all, I'd say were slightly inflationary or again over the first couple of months, so I wouldn't say we're flat. And for that was - the math for us doesn't apply 4% over the December. So it certainly implied some acceleration in December, as I mentioned. Some of that inflation, again, it's carried over into the third quarter. And we anticipate, again, modest levels of inflation as we head in the second half of the year. But I would not anticipate 4% inflation heading into the second half of the year.","Karen Holthouse","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan.","John Ivankoe","Hi, thank you. First, I wanted to get back to some of the prepared remarks about the industry, which I think were - you're discussing the expectation of same store sales growth, but traffic being mixed. Can you elaborate on what sectors that you're seeing in terms of that are participating in this overall economic growth and maybe how you're positioning towards the better sectors and less towards the slower even negative sectors might be changing over the next couple of years? And then I'll have a follow up as well.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Sure. I mean, if you think about - we've talked a lot about the various sectors over the years, and if you think about the restaurants obviously being the largest segment of this industry and of the market. Let's start there, but I think, we talk about the traffic and the spend, it's highly variable. So if you think about it from a NPD perspective, the total traffic during the last - during this last timeframe was basically up slightly, and the spend was up about 3%.","QSR was driving the majority of that midscale, they call midscale dining traffic was down about 2% and spend was up about 1%. And then casual was also traffic was down and the spend was up. So it's kind of mix, if you think about the various segments within the restaurant. As we've also talked a lot about though, we participate in lots of different segments. We continue to see growth opportunities in places like healthcare and certainly education, retail sector continues to be a growing Foodservice segment.","And so there continues to be lots of areas of growth out there. And we've also talked and it's been a focus for us for a few years now, but it continues to be is the ethnic segments within restaurants continue to see growth. And depending on that's somewhat maybe more a little more geographic based, but we see solid growth in certain ethnic segments as well.","John Ivankoe","Okay, helpful I wanted to see if there was maybe a change of tone in anyway regarding your comments and it sounds like it's more consistent. The next question if I can sneak another one in before the final one, digital ordering now at 50% of local case growth order that would suggest maybe you were at some type of a tipping point. Obviously, the marketing associates are doing less ordering and they're doing a lot more servicing or adding value to their customers.","Could you remind us whether we're now at the point where the level of marketing associates is relatively stable, despite the expectation of local case growth or maybe we can get to a point where the best marketing associates can serve more clients and just be more overall profit additive to the corporation?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Sure, John. That's a good question. So we've actually been over 50% for a few quarters now, but we have kind of hit this - it is a - I think it's an important question, because it's a good percentage of our business that is online. And remember this is the local business we're talking about our national or contract business a lot higher portion of that is actually done online or through things like EDI.","But within this local segment, about the same time a year ago, we also talked about we were adding some marketing associates. We've kind of gotten through that addition and we felt like that was really important at the time, because we had now had some tools available to us that were enabling us to target where those resources could go. Think about that is, where we had some bigger share gaps or share opportunities.","And once we identified that we wanted to make sure we were focused there. As we think about it today, given that percentage of ordering, given some of the additional tools we continue to provide our customers and our organization. I do think we're in a place where we're somewhat stable from a selling resource perspective. We are seeing larger territories, we think that's a good thing. But we aren't looking at this as a way to dramatically reduce or change our selling resources. We continue to believe they're a very, very important part of our model. And we know from our customer feedback that they are highly valued.","So it's really about continuing to give them more tools to help them be more effective, and obviously more consultative, but also making sure that our customers have the opportunity to do business with us the way they want to, which has been also our focus in our model.","John Ivankoe","Great. Thank you for that. And then the final question, the acquisition of wine - excuse me, of Classic Drinks, which does wine and spirits in Ireland. Is that - that segment, is that a one-off for you? Obviously the U.S. has, especially even on a per-state basis, have a lot of unique challenges in terms of wine and spirits distribution. But is that a unique-to-Ireland type of business segment for you? Or might there be other types of applications in your geographies around the world in that type of segment?","Tom Ben\u00e9","I would say it's a little more unique to Ireland or maybe some of the parts of Europe. In Ireland, we had a small - we sold a small amount of Wine and Spirits. In that market, in particular, the competitive set - wine and spirits is a big part of the competitive set.","So the Classic Drinks acquisition really puts us in a great spot to compete more broadly in that overall market. And so I'd say it is a little more unique, they don't have nearly the kind of the state-by-state laws that we have here in the U.S., and so it's - I'd say, at this point, think about it as something that's appropriate for that market, but not something that is a strategic shift for Sysco.","John Ivankoe","Thank you.","Tom Ben\u00e9","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.","Edward Kelly","Hi, guys, good morning.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Good morning.","Edward Kelly","I wanted to start off with a question on gross profit per case. Your gross profit dollars exceeded case growth in U.S. Broadlines again after really kind of, I guess, stalling over the last couple of quarters, so obviously encouraging. I would imagine that this is re-inflation, normalization of inbound freight, better local mix. I mean, all things that are good for you and the industry, obviously. Is there anything else in here that was driving that and should we expect that to continue going forward?","Joel Grade","Yeah. I think - Ed, this is Joel. I think the other thing you probably - I think, you summarized it pretty well. The only thing I might add is the - our brand growth. Again, that's something 59 percentage points up again in our local brand sales this quarter. So I mean, I think that's - I'd say that's one other area that's certainly strongly impacting that. And so I think you're right, I mean, again some of the few other things that you did talk about, again to Tom's point, the inbound freight piece was a little bit of an overlap issue, I'd call it that - if you recall a year ago, we were talking about, it was a fairly sizable impact for us.","So there's probably some heavier - a little bit of heavier influence from that, but broadly speaking, I think the mix, the brand, the more inflation and again some normalizing some of the impacts we had on the inbound freight, I think it's certainly a fair way to look at that.","Edward Kelly","All right. And then just on the OpEx side, the growth in OpEx moderated a bit from Q1, but still reasonably high, and obviously, that's warehouse labor and driver pay. Just thoughts on where you are in terms of having to raise wages on both of those sides and how are you thinking about the necessity of future wage increases? Just any thoughts on whether things are settling down at all there for you?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hey, Ed. I think, what's happening is we are kind of at a new level we talked about it on the inbound side, and certainly, I'd say on some of the internal operating expenses. Having said that, so I don't think we were necessarily anticipating any larger significant cost like hourly increases that are going to dramatically change the OpEx going forward. Where we're really focused on is how do we go after some of those big cost buckets that drive the expense. And so for - in this business, as you all know, there are things like miles driven, there are things like cases per mile.","So the efficiencies that we can drive that really impact the cost or the things that we're trying to focus on, and we've got a couple initiatives that we feel early days are helping us and performing well. We've talked about small delivery vehicles a bit in the past. We think that that's a mitigating factor in the fact that we can bring in kind of non-CDL drivers in that environment and deliver those cases at a lower cost per case.","So we're trying to do a lot of those things that ultimately help the overall cost, the operating expense, if you will, more broadly on a sustainable basis knowing that we do have higher wage rates than we did in the past, and then we'll probably continue to see that going forward. But I don't think it's a new spike that's coming in front of us, I think it's more - we've now kind of hit that number and we are now just trying to manage the overall utilization of our headcount and our resources.","Joel Grade","I think if I can add one thing to that also is just the - again, part of our challenge we are having was some of the retention of some of the newly hired associates. And so, I think it was which is then driving over time, which is then driving other things that are little bit lower productivity.","And so, I think some where we're also making significant emphasis on in terms of our hiring, our training, our onboarding processes to ensure that we do have a better retention rate with some of the hiring, both on the driver and the warehouse side, that I think - and again, I think to Tom's point, I agree. I think it's leveled out somewhat, but certainly not in a position to really say we're past the issue.","Edward Kelly","And, Joel, just one quick one for you on the tax rate, when you say the full year tax rate at 25%, I think the adjusted tax rate in the first half is lower than that. How should we think about the back-half tax rate? I guess that's what I'm asking you.","Joel Grade","Yeah, I would just look at the whole - about a 25% run rate would be the way I would think about that.","Edward Kelly","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research.","Ajay Jain","Yeah, hi, good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in. On the cost cutting that you've just announced, it sounds like those initiatives are mostly focused on U.S. operations. So I don't know if there's any international component for the headcount reductions. But can you give any additional geographic breakdown on the latest cost cutting initiatives?","And then, within the U.S., what's the relative breakdown of the cost cuts between regional operating companies and corporate?","Joel Grade","Sure, so I'll start here. So the discussions we had regarding the cost cuts here was - it was exclusively focused in our U.S. business and really on our corporate office and on corporate support. So I think this was not a, what I'll call, the U.S. field-related. It was again - it was really specifically in our U.S., and corporate and support operations. So I think the - some of them we did talk about on a few of the certain items was related to, again, some of the infrastructure changes we had in bringing our businesses together in France. But what you're specifically asking about is U.S. related only.","Ajay Jain","Okay. And I know you didn't want to provide a dollar amount for the cost savings in response to an earlier question. But can you at least confirm what you're expecting for overall restructuring charges, that's associated with the layoffs?","Joel Grade","Yeah, Ajay, we haven't given that out. We're not planning to.","Ajay Jain","Okay. Thank you very much.","Joel Grade","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bob Summers with Buckingham.","Bob Summers","Hey, good morning, guys. You talked about volumes being choppy during the quarter, but coming back toward the end. But any comment on how January was and any impact from the shutdown?","Tom Ben\u00e9","I don't think we saw much of an impact from the shutdown. I think what I'd say is that we feel good about how the quarter has started. And we feel like it's delivering on the trajectory that we had hoped.","Bob Summers","Okay. And then circling back to the cost saving numbers, when I think about the transformation and the Smart Spending and having second half impact, is it fair to say that you're trying to get us to weight that more toward the fourth quarter?","Joel Grade","I don't know that we've said that, Bob. I mean I think we we've been pretty consistent in saying that we anticipated improvement in the second half of the year. Having said that, that doesn't mean day one in Q3 is like everything happens. And so there is a little bit of a spreading over the third quarter, where things kick in, which I guess would then suggest fourth quarter be a bit stronger.","But we've been pretty consistent again as moving through second half. And these things do happen, again, it's a little bit of a ramp over the course of Q3.","Bob Summers","Right, of course. And then, lastly, as I think about all the expense savings that you've articulated and are they sufficient enough to drive the expense growth, say, below 2.5%, which would allow you the opportunity to flex that spread up, which if you think about achieving the plan, at some point you'll have to overachieve on that spread for a couple quarters to get back on track. Is that fair to hold you to that?","Joel Grade","I think it is. And certainly again, we certainly acknowledge that, and again, certainly continue to look for acceleration of opportunities there, but yeah, I think that's fair.","Bob Summers","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of Andrew Wolf with Loop Capital Markets.","Andrew Wolf","Thanks and good morning. So the quarter, the U.S. local case growth, I think you face the toughest year ago comparison of this economic cycle if you will. So given the commentary you just made, Tom, that you like how January is and what you said about the macro environment, really, I guess that you got easier comparisons.","It shouldn't be too much of a leap of faith for us to get the model somewhat better case growth than you showed this quarter?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Look, I think I'd start with, and we talked about this prior quarter and we talked about it again here. In the second quarter, we lost some cases from acquisition we did a year ago, HFM, also a couple of large national customers that we lapped. We have another acquisition that we're going to be lapping that we did last year, a larger one than the ones we've done that we're going to be lapping kind of in the third quarter. So I would say, my commentary around the start to this quarter is, it's in line with what we had hoped and what we expected. And so, we feel generally good.","Having said that, you guys all know, many of you were living the frozen - where the polar vortex happened a week ago. We saw - we see always things that come up and happen throughout the quarter that we are all happen to deal with. And so, you see little impacts from things like that as well in certain parts of the geography.","So I would just say we feel good about the momentum we've had. We feel like we're on the path that we had hoped for. And I don't think there's anything that would necessarily should change your thoughts, your projections one way or another. I think you should - the commentary we've given is we feel good about the back-half, we feel like we can deliver the incremental upside that we've talked about, primarily driven by a lot of the cost activities, and we're feeling pretty good right now.","Joel Grade","The only thing I would add to that, just a slight caveat is, just remember, I mean, our third quarter, our March, March is our big month. In other words, it's so - certainly couple, again, talked about - so Tom said some decent trends coming out of this thing. But, obviously, our Q3 is made or broken to some extent by March, but just as a reminder of that.","Andrew Wolf","Sure. Thank you for both of those comments. And just to close on product cost inflation and talking about how it inflected and we can see those in the numbers, the [governance] [ph] reports as well.","Just curious, do your systems and management allow for that to be passed through if possible almost real time, number one? And how about competitively, is there just a normal lag, just a sense that nobody wants to be the first guy to move up prices or do these prices get through pretty much, pass through pretty much as they occur?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Hey, Andy. I think what I would say to that is that just keep in mind the order of magnitude of these things too. I mean, we always talked about is that this industry, with a couple percent inflation, typically has been historically able to pass those things along. And so, certainly, we continue to feel good about that.","And I think - a little bit of a lag, I mean, I don't - if you think about half of our business being contract with some sort of cost plus, there is typically a little bit of lag in terms of when we actually are able to book cost increases and then pass that through. So it's not sort of an immediate thing. And on the - and the local side, again, I would just say in these times of what I call modest inflation, I think we generally feel pretty good about our ability to pass those things through. So I don't know the - I wouldn't call us in a place where we've got some rapidly accelerated inflation. I think we're in a pretty good inflation point and certainly feel pretty good about our ability to do so.","Andrew Wolf","Okay. And if I could, lastly, just on the international gross margin contracting a bit this quarter, sort of a trend, is that still mainly driven out of the UK where the cost inflation you're getting, because of their currency or is it more broad-based?","Tom Ben\u00e9","It's primarily UK, a little bit also in Mexico, but it's primarily UK.","Andrew Wolf","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yeah.","Joel Grade","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for joining us today. This concludes today's earnings call.

","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.","William J. DeLaney","Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales of $10.5 billion for the third quarter, a 7.6% increase. Case volume grew 3% including acquisitions, and we believe we continue to gain market share in the industry, which has shown little to no real growth for a number of quarters. ","Net earnings for the quarter were $260 million and reported EPS was $0.44. Adjusted EPS was $0.49 and excludes several items including gross business transformation costs. On this basis, adjusted EPS grew 2% for the quarter. We believe this adjusted amount is more representative of the performance of our underlying business. The modest improvement in market conditions we experienced in the latter portion of the second quarter continued through the third quarter, due in part to an unseasonably mild winter in much of the northern part of the geography we serve. Our volume growth for the quarter was solid across nearly all of our business segments as we improved our customer retention, increased our overall account penetration and attracted many new customers to Sysco. ","Our cost control performance at the operating company level was very encouraging during the quarter as well. Excluding the impact of fuel prices and prior year multi-employer pension plan charges, we reduced our cost per cases shipped. Conversely, gross margins continue to be a challenge. While 5.5% inflation and some difficult prior year comparisons contributed to the margin erosion we experienced during the quarter, we must execute more effectively in that area of our business. This area is always one of keen focus, and we have several initiatives in various stages of development that are designed to mitigate this pressure and still permit us to be highly responsive to our customers. ","Turning to an update on our multiyear business transformation initiative and as we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we implemented a new technology platform at our second pilot facility back in Oklahoma back in January. While we saw significant improvement in the system's performance compared to our early experience in our first pilot in Arkansas, we did identify certain processes that require additional assessment and enhancement. We are addressing those opportunities now and are targeting a third rollout early in fiscal 2013. Successfully implementing this technology platform is a critical component to our transformation of Sysco. ","Effectively driving our transformational change in a company such as Sysco, which has enjoyed a great deal of success over the past 40 years, can be challenging at times. However, in our case, we absolutely need to embrace such change if we are to continue to perform at a high level in a world that is much different than just a few years ago. Notwithstanding the predictable bumps that come with this type of journey, we remain highly focused on positioning Sysco to be a top-performing company for years to come. ","In that regard, we recently announced that Manny Fernandez has agreed to expand his role and become Sysco's Executive Chairman of the Board. Manny is an outstanding business leader with a deep technology background. His experience and capabilities will enhance the execution and expedite the implementation of our business transformation work. I've worked closely with Manny for the past 3 years and look forward to his input and support as we build an even more customer-centric and operationally excellent Sysco. ","Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter.","Robert C. Kreidler","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $10.5 billion or an increase of 7.6% compared to prior year, driven mainly by food cost inflation, which we estimated to be 5.5% for the period. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.7% and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.2%. ","Case volume for the quarter increased 2.9% year-over-year including acquisitions and 2.3% excluding acquisitions. We completed several acquisitions during the quarter, including European Imports, which we announced in late February and enhances our ability to address the specialty foods market. So far this year, we've completed 8 acquisitions representing roughly $260 million in annualized sales. We are on track to achieve our goal of increasing sales by 0.5% to 1% through acquisitions. We have a number of additional acquisitions at various stages of completion in our pipeline that we hope to close in the coming quarters. ","Gross profit increased 2.1% during the quarter. Gross margin decreased 95 basis points year-over-year to 17.8%, pressured by an intensely competitive market and high levels of inflation. Operating expenses increased $28 million or 2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of a $29 million increase in salaries and related costs due to higher delivery and sales compensation and acquisitions. ","Also impacting operating expenses were a $24 million increase in gross business transformation expenses and a $10 million increase in fuel expense. It's important to note that fuel surcharges offset this increase although they are reflected in gross profits. These operating expense items were partially offset by a $36 million charge in the prior year related to the withdrawal of one of our operating companies from a multi-employer pension plan or MEPP.","Reported operating income increased $11 million or 2.7%, and net earnings for the third quarter were $260 million, an increase of $1 million or 0.4% compared to the prior year. ","As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, excluding the impact of the business transformation project and the impact of COLI, which had a minimal positive impact this year, but had a significantly more positive impact in fiscal 2011 periods. In addition, last year's third quarter included the MEPP charge I just mentioned and a $10 million tax benefit. Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses increased 2.6% and adjusted operating income increased 0.9%. Net earnings on this basis grew 2.8% to $290 million and EPS grew 2.1% to $0.49. ","Turning to the impact of the business transformation project for a moment. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, gross project expenses totaled $49 million, and we capitalized $39 million related to the project. In the prior year period, gross project expenses totaled $25 million, and we capitalized $42 million related to the project. ","Now turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year were $908 million. In the prior year period, cash flow from operations was $666 million.","As a reminder, we are paying the final $212 million in IRS tax settlement payments during this fiscal year. We have paid $159 million in cash in the first 39 weeks of the year, and we'll make the final payment of $53 million in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. In total, we will have paid the IRS $952 million over 12 quarters including this final payment. ","Cash flow from operations improved by $242 million in the first 39 weeks compared to the prior year, due mainly to improved working capital management, the redemption of COLI policies, changes in accrued expenses and a lower pension expense. Working capital has improved year-to-date due mainly to smaller increases in accounts receivable and inventories this year compared to the prior year. This is due in part to improvements in DSOs, receivables and inventories and in part to changes in inflation trends. Last, as we discussed on the second quarter call, we redeemed some COLI policies, which benefited operating cash flows. This was an element of our previously discussed plan to reduce the market-driven COLI impact on our earnings. ","Capital expenditures totaled $199 million for the third quarter and $633 million for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year. This year, we are constructing new facilities in Long Island, Boston and Central Texas, as well as a major expansion in Lincoln, Nebraska, compared to having only one such major project underway a year ago. Our new facility in Central Texas opened recently, which allows us to consolidate our facilities in Austin and San Antonio. With this move, we have the dual benefits of lower facility costs and a room for growth in this important market. ","Before closing, there are a few guidance metrics for fiscal 2012 that I'd like to update. First, we now expect an increase in fuel expense of $35 million to $45 million this year, which is roughly $5 million higher than our previous guidance and is primarily driven by higher projected fuel prices. As a reminder, we implemented a fuel surcharge with a broader customer base late during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, which is intended to mitigate the increase in fuel expense. Fuel surcharges are recorded in sales and therefore benefit gross profit. We've wrapped the implementation of this surcharge, as I mentioned, late in the third quarter, so the year-over-year benefit from the surcharge will not be as apparent in changes in gross profit and gross margins going forward. ","Second, we now expect gross business transformation expenses for the year to be approximately $175 million to $195 million, which is roughly $55 million lower than previous estimates. We had previously expected to begin amortizing project costs late in the third quarter, but this did not occur. We now expect amortization to begin in early fiscal 2013 with our next planned conversion. In addition, we expect the capitalized spend on our business transformation project this year to be $145 million to $165 million. This is roughly $20 million higher than our previous estimate, primarily because of the timing of our next conversion in early fiscal 2013. As a result, we will continue to capitalize more of the project's spend than originally planned.","This increased CapEx spend on the project has impacted our overall expectations for CapEx for this year. As a result, we now expect total CapEx to be approximately $775 million to $800 million in fiscal 2012, which is back in line with the original guidance we gave in our 10-K. ","In closing, while we are encouraged by improving industry trends, we are taking action in many areas to improve profitability in both the near-term and long-term, and believe Sysco's unique capabilities and commitment to ongoing investment in our business provide a solid foundation for future growth. ","With that, operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the gross margin pressure. Is there a way that you might be able to tease out how much of that is from food inflation versus competitive pressures versus mix shift to lower-margin business? And kind of, I guess, as a second part of that is, if the current food cost environment holds, meaning the basket probably going to be down a bit next year based on the spot market, will GM rebound in fiscal '13?","William J. DeLaney","Mike, it's Bill. Obviously, I mean, I think you know us enough, well enough now to know that I probably can't answer with the kind of precision you'd love for me to answer it with. But let me try this. I would say to you that it's clearly coming from multiple places, all right? So you've got -- first and foremost, you've got our customers who are feeling a lot of pressure to continue to create traffic in their establishments, and that's where you see this difference in inflation, with inflation at the restaurant is, we believe, running 2% to 3% and ours has been in that 5% to 7% so far this year. So there's that kind of challenge that you work through there with your customer each and every day. There's certainly the typical type of competitive pressure that goes along with that. There's -- that's on the sell. Now there's also on the buy, where I think we have opportunities there to continue to find ways to work more effectively with our suppliers and that type of thing in terms of how we purchase the product. And then I think the third thing, and I think this is a little more clear this quarter, is there's us in terms of our mindset and our approach to pricing and trying to strike the right balance between being responsive to our customers and write an appropriate margin and that type of thing. So it comes from all 3. The reality, from where I sit, that makes this quarter a little different than the first half of the year is I just feel like we didn't do as good a job on the margin line in terms of what we can control and what we can influence in the short term. And I would just use an example and don't -- I'm not putting a pencil to this, but I think we're in an environment today with -- if you just listen to everything I just said and look at everything that you all look at, the environment today, I don't think, is an environment where anytime soon we're going to see margins turn around and necessary grow. I do think there's opportunity to mitigate that pressure. And if we had just had maybe 1\/2 of the erosion that we saw on the margin line, maybe even just 2\/3 of it, I think we -- the tone of my comments and the tone of the release would've been a little different, where our earnings would've -- they would've been good to maybe not great, but they would've been a very acceptable quarter from our perspective. So I think we're in a mode right now where our job is to continue to certainly be sensitive to our customers, work closer with our suppliers. But we've got to do a better job managing the margin. And I think from a messaging standpoint, when you're selling a box of food, and say our average box costs $30, $35, but some of the boxes in the area where we're seeing the most inflation, poultry, meat, those boxes can cost $45 and $55. It's very -- I don't think it's practical to expect that, that is going to be passed along in a short period of time on a proportionate basis. But I certainly think it's appropriate to expect us to do a better job managing the pricing on that. And that's obviously what we're working on.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And you mentioned -- you actually referenced in your opening remarks several initiatives to improve gross margin. Could you maybe, to the extent that you're able, give us an idea of what kind of things you're thinking about and if there are any 1 or 2 that we should have our eye on?","William J. DeLaney","Well, I think it's going to be hard for you to have your eye on it, but I think the things that we have our eye on is there's certain things that we do in terms of how we approach pricing and where we might make exceptions and that type of thing and how we work with customers and suppliers. We just need to be more consistent throughout the organization. And so it's not 1 or 2 things. It's several things that go into how we price both -- with both our large contract customers and also with our street customers, how we buy product and how we manage that process internally. And what I'm really alluding to there is we have opportunity to execute better and, in particular, more consistently throughout the company and just make some better decisions there. So I can't give you a lot of granularity for obvious reasons, but I can tell you there's opportunity there.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, maybe if you could talk about -- a bit about the cadence of sales in the quarter. And I know it's not one -- I hate to slice things so finely. But the change in casual dining sales trajectory intra-quarter this particular quarter was pretty significant, where you had a decent January, February and then a much weaker March, April. So curious if you can give us any color as to what you saw for the quarter.","William J. DeLaney","Well, we don't typically comment on cadence of growth month-to-month. And obviously, we read a lot of what you all write and we have a sense for what you're saying, which is, I believe, the industry view is that things did slow down in terms of growth in March and April. This quarter, as we talked last quarter, it was just a back-ended-weighted quarter for us. March is always going to drive our numbers. So anytime you've got a bigger denominator, I think sometimes that will affect the growth rates as well. But certainly, the things that helped in January and February were the calendar. I believe we had -- I think the holiday helped us early off -- early on in the quarter. In the scheme of the overall numbers, that's not that big a deal. I think weather was probably the biggest thing. And we've kind of gotten to where we stopped whining about weather. But at least on this call, I'm at least acknowledging that it clearly helped the industry and it helped us from the standpoint that, I think, in some of your more metropolitan markets in the north, we saw and felt better volumes. Now I'll quickly add, and I'm not whining about it as I said, we were hurt in areas where you would expect winter to be beneficial. So the big ski areas in Colorado and Utah and Florida, we did not do as well in those areas. And so I'm not going to say it netted out, but it wasn't a totally positive thing from a weather standpoint. So not trying to dodge the question too much here, but we saw good growth in the first couple of months. It continued maybe at somewhat of lower rate. But I'd have to tell you the biggest thing I think we're beginning to see, and we don't comment on this on a month-by-month basis either, is I think the rate of inflation is subsiding and that's going to affect the top line as well. And hopefully over time, it will subside to a level where it's more in sync with what our customers can absorb.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","My first question is just on the operating expense leverage, which I think was somewhat commendable. But you clearly benefited from the cycling of last year's charge for multi-employer pension expense. And then just wanted to ask if there are any other factors that you can talk about behind the cost savings and whether or not any of the SG&A improvement has spillover effect into the fourth quarter.","William J. DeLaney","Ajay, it's Bill. Again, yes, I think we did some good things on the expense line. We tried to call out the things that I would characterize as nonrecurring or unusual. So the business transformation expense because of where we are in the timeline was a little less than what we originally thought and we did have the credit last year. The point I made was that at the operating company level, our cost per case was down slightly, which is a big deal. I mean, to manage your cost per case flat to down is something we're always trying to do, and at times, we do it better than other times. So I think if you go and look at our first half of the year, certainly, we had margin pressure. The first quarter, we didn't see the type of volume growth we would've liked to see in that. We did do better in that area in the second quarter. But we had opportunities just on execution in terms of the expense side in the business. And I just felt that our folks did a better job managing expenses throughout the company in all facets, SG&A and operations. So I think we just executed better on that line, and that's a line we're going to have to continue to address, both structurally as well as just day-to-day management, to mitigate the margin pressures that we can't totally overcome.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And can you confirm if there was a significant payroll or headcount-driven benefit this latest quarter?","William J. DeLaney","I'll let Chris take that one.","Robert C. Kreidler","Got it. Really nothing to be called out, Ajay.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And as far as the change in the outlook for pension expense, Chris, can you confirm what's behind the updated guidance and if that's on the multi-employer side or presumably with your corporate-sponsored pension plan?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, Ajay. I may not be understanding your question. We actually didn't change our pension guidance. It's been the same all year. Was there a different question?","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","No. I'm sorry, I was just -- I was going off of your presentation materials. I thought the pension expense was indicated to be $25 million lower than fiscal '11.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes. And that's been the case. For the year, we said it'd be down about $28 million, roughly about $7 million per quarter, and that's been consistent during the year. That's one of those items you set in the beginning, and it's pretty much -- it's set for the year, so I was just calling out that on a year-over-year basis, it is lower and it's one of the reasons why the costs are lower.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, sorry, my bad. Finally, I understand that you were able to eke out some gross profit dollar growth this last quarter. But assuming that you are going to market now with a more aggressive pricing structure, the gross margin impact seems to be increasing each quarter. So even as inflation seem to be moderating, do you have any color about the gross margin outlook for the current quarter in June? I mean, could the impact be more than the 100 basis points from Q3?","William J. DeLaney","The only color I have, Ajay, is we need to improve, as I said a couple of times now. So I certainly hope not. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, that's an area of keen focus here. So we need to bring that number back. As I said to Michael, at this level of inflation, I don't know that it's realistic that we can totally reverse it, but we certainly need to lessen that variance.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you maybe talk about what the impact was in the quarter from the net impact of, I guess, the New Year's Day shift and the leap year on the volume front?","William J. DeLaney","I think it helped. I'm trying to be as descriptive as I can here. Leap year is always a good thing. You get an extra day. So I'm sure that helped, but -- and the holiday thing. But I think when you line that up with -- over a 13-week period and if you look at in those months, I don't think it's that big a deal, to be totally honest with you.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, Ed, this is Chris. We did take a look at that. And frankly, we didn't think it was enough to call out specifically. I think Bill's right. It helped a little, but it's really not material.","William J. DeLaney","I think the weather was probably a bigger help than anything.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And could we come back to the gross profit again? And I want to try to approach it a different way because there's a lot of questions on margin, and I'm not so sure how -- and I know margin's relevant. But maybe we could look at it a different way, right? If you think about gross profit dollar growth, which was a couple percent this quarter, your business is really all about driving more cases through the network, right? And gross profit dollar growth was less than real kind of volume growth, if you thought about it, for the first time in a while. So I wanted to get your thoughts on, going forward, is that how we should be thinking about this business? Can you grow gross profit dollars faster than volume? I'm just trying to figure out the best way to model this because up until now you've actually been doing a pretty good job there.","William J. DeLaney","Yes. I think I'm happy to come at it any way you want. We certainly look at it every way we can. I think it's a good callout in your point there and that's the unacceptable part of it. We can't grow gross profit dollars at a lower rate than what we grow cases. What I'm trying to acknowledge is what we've seen here the last few quarters and what I think we may see for a while is GP dollars may grow somewhat slower than the sales dollars grow, but that's, I think, where we're not pleased with the quarter. We should have -- we certainly sought to grow gross profit dollars at a higher rate. And I think if you looked at first half of the year, it was closer to mid-single digits, that type of thing. So that was our callout, and I think that's a very fair way of looking at it. But no, I would not -- we're certainly not planning the business around growing gross profit dollars at a lower rate than case growth. That's not acceptable.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is that something that you can fix quickly, meaning like over the next quarter or so? Or does that take longer?","William J. DeLaney","I think it's just something that you fix each and every day in our business and you bring focus to it. And I think at the operator level, our operator level, we don't necessarily talk about it quite like that. We try to get people just more focused on their categories, on their customers and so on. But I take your point. I actually agree with it that when I look at our business, I look at everything clearly. But if there's kind of 3 lines that jump out, one is volume growth, two is gross profit dollar growth and three is cost per case. So those are the 3 things that we're very focused on. And I think again, in terms of how I approached my comments, we're pleased with the volume growth, we're pleased with the cost per case performance and we're not pleased with the gross profit dollar growth.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And, Bill, could you give us your assessment of sort of business transformation so far? I mean, we've got Manny coming in. It looks like there's been some delays in the rollout again. Just help us understand, I guess, what's happening and where the project is today versus kind of where you thought it would be.","William J. DeLaney","Well, we're going to we talk at length about that next week. But I'll kind of dive in here and try to give you some color. So essentially, we've had some delays and we've had another delay here after Oklahoma. We're not happy about that, but the reality is this is new ground for us. And it's better to deal with these issues now in terms of getting the system to perform at a level or at least close to the level that it's going to need to perform. So you state then [ph] to get too deep into this and then have to fix a lot of things after the fact. Now with that said, I think what you're seeing from the board is, we certainly can benefit from Manny's input and Manny's experience and the relationships he has in this area. And so he's going to work closer with our team and with me personally to make sure we're striking the right balance here in terms of driving this out at appropriate pace but also in a way that it delivers the benefits that we expect it to.","Robert C. Kreidler","Ed, let me jump in there, too. We've talked about, today, business transformation primarily around the rollout of our new ERP system. And I think one of the messages you're going to hear from us next week pretty loudly is really helping the audience understand that business transformation is very, very broad and it includes a lot of stuff that's going on inside the organization, one stream of which is the rollout of this ERP system. And again, we're going to give you as much color as we can about all of the different things that we're working on. We're going to try to help you understand better which of those streams of initiatives have benefits that can be achieved in advance of an ERP and which of those are really tied to an ERP implementation, et cetera. So I'm saying all this only because when we think of business transformation around here, it's much more than just how quickly can we rollout the ERP system. As Bill said, it's a critical part of the future success of the organization, so we're frankly solidly supportive of it, and we've got to get it done and all those things. But at the same time, we're not waiting to do everything that we need to get accomplished for that ERP system to be fully rolled out. And again, we hope to give you a lot more color on that next week.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Do you think -- you had mentioned in the past that fiscal '13 would be the peak year for expense for the project. Is that still the case?","Robert C. Kreidler","I think going back 1.5 years and 2.5 years ago at Investor Day, the numbers clearly showed that the peak year would be 2013. Now when I've been asked about that since that time, what I've said is we've not put out new guidance for cost and expenses yet. We will get into some of that next week, and we'll update you on where we think the peak is, et cetera. I think, again, the way to -- you didn't ask me; you asked Bill. But if you ask me how I look at this at least from a cost perspective is we're going to have costs for the ERP rollout and additional business transformation stuff for the next several years, obviously, until we get this thing all the way completed. We're also going to have benefits from business transformation that we're going to start to realize throughout this. I don't want to go back to talking about the net -- cost net of benefits. We hope to be able to show you those kind of independently. But I don't want to just fixate on the cost side of the equation. We really want to give you more color around what we believe the benefits are going to be as well.","William J. DeLaney","Yes. I think just to kind of wrap it from my end here, Ed, and we will talk obviously more next week, business transformation is just something we need to do. And that's what I was trying to talk about. We need to go to market. We need to make some changes in terms of how we go to market, and that's a big deal in terms of how we've been running the company here for the last several years. And we need to do that because the landscape in the world that we're competing in and servicing customer in is a lot different than it was even 3 to 5 years ago. The technology platform, as you hear us talk about that, is a very critical foundational part of the entire spectrum of business transformation. But as we get deeper into this thing and as we hit some bumps here and there, we also have the opportunity to adjust our thinking on what defines business transformation, what other things can we do to create some benefits along the way. And those are some of the things we'll talk about next week.","Robert C. Kreidler","Ed, I feel like I dodged your question, so let me answer a little more directly in terms of the cost. While I can't tell you where the peak is yet, here's what I think we have said and will continue to say: 2013 will be more expensive than 2012. That should not be a surprise. As we start to depreciate this thing, we ramp up our shared service center more, 2013 will definitely be more expensive than 2012. What I don't have visibility on for you, as I sit here today, is whether '14 or '15 will be higher or lower or the same as 2013. Again, we hope to be able to talk more about that next week. We're still looking at all of that data as it flows in.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Bill, maybe you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment and what do you think your competitors are feeling. Obviously, you've had a gross margin hit this quarter, and case-wise, have gotten a little better. But what do you think is going on for the competitors out there? And are you seeing any further weakening that may cause some of them to exit the business?","William J. DeLaney","Great question, hard to answer because we don't obviously get a lot of visibility to their -- we don't get any visibility to their financial results, so a lot of what we get is somewhat anecdotal. My sense is that the larger players, the better operators of scale, are doing okay. I think this kind of market over time will be good for the people that have scale and who have the capital to invest in the business. So my sense is they're doing fine. I'm sure they're having to compete very hard on the margin line as well, but obviously, I don't have visibility to that. I think maybe we're beginning to see, and I'll let Chris speak to this, there's thousands of competitors out there. As we've talked before, I think perhaps some of the smaller ones are beginning to think even harder about what their future is in terms of the industry and that type of thing. I'm not saying it's a large-scale phenomena, but I think it is probably getting harder both for our smaller competitors as well as for some of the smaller operators in the space.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, I'll add to that. I mean, one of the things that we sense from the market, and again, it's more anecdotal than anything, is everyone is highly focused on cost right now. So that should tell you something about where the top line is with some, all of our competitors. It is easier if you've got some size and scale to get some cost structure improvement. I think the smaller players, while they may be great companies and they're highly competitive in their own markets, it is harder for them to get their cost structure down significantly, and it's becoming harder for them to -- I believe, harder for them to compete, and frankly, we're starting dialogues with more of them these days than we have been.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Just a question on the road map here on the business transformation. So I think the plan previously was you would do the second market and then do waves of openings. So now you're inserting one more third market test and then the waves of openings come. And is that moment where you hit the waves of openings, is that when you start depreciating at that point?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, actually -- and I don't know exactly what I said on our prior calls, so I'll just say it new and fresh, is we will start depreciating when we go to the next company. Now you're right. Originally we thought we would be going to a small wave of companies next. We're actually going to go to, we believe, one additional company, as Bill said, in the early part of the new fiscal year, probably a month or so later than we had originally intended. So that would trigger depreciation. And that's an accounting determination of when we're putting the machine into service. And so that is still the plan. And that's the only reason frankly the depreciation didn't start in the third and fourth quarter, is we weren't -- we had not rolled to that next conversion yet. Thereafter, we're not really commenting yet about what the conversion cycle or rate or run rate or road map was going to be at this point in time. We'll give you, again, more color on that next week. But it's not our goal to put out there a set number of companies for next year or a pace. It's more along the lines of here's the progress we hope to make in the next year, and it will almost certainly be a range. If we've learned anything about this, it's that the best-laid plans don't always come to fruition, and so we'll range it appropriately.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And are the cost savings more linked to the number of operating companies that are using it? Or is it there are other activities that might generate cost savings as well?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes. So let me go back to the comment I made earlier about business transformation, in general. Again, as we've gotten into this thing over 3 years now, there's quite a bit that we've been able to identify in terms of cost savings, other enhancements that are not directly tied to a new ERP system being rolled out into our company. As we've identified those and we've discovered how we can accelerate those, we're obviously going after those sooner rather than later and they're not tied to any number of companies being converted. There are obviously other benefits opportunities that are still tied to us having a new ERP system in all of our operating companies. That, of course -- or those, of course, would be weighted more towards the more companies you have, the more benefits you get. Those are things that primarily are tied to the types of business processes and functions that will be put into our shared service operation. So the more companies you roll out, the more of those functions we can consolidate into our shared service operation and begin to realize some of the benefits.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So, Bill, a couple of things. Where do you think you are with your analytics around pricing? And then getting back to the gross margin question, with respect to demand elasticity, right, and an ability to forecast or tell what the elasticity is per item in certain geographies, so where does that capability stand? And if it's not where it needs to be, what would you do to make that more robust?","William J. DeLaney","Great question, John. I would say to you that -- in terms of the way I'm interpreting your question, I'd say we have a lot of work to do in that area of pricing in terms of more sophisticated or scientific pricing. But we have done some work there and we'll continue to look at it. The balancing act here is again -- don't hold me to these percentages. But let's just say that roughly 1\/2 of our customers have some form of contract and the other 1\/2 don't. They work with a marketing associate and that type of thing. So what we're always trying to do is balance the value of having, say, a more scientific approach to pricing with the value of having that marketing associate in front of the customer, taking that order and really understanding what's important to that customer today in terms of their order, and frankly, down the road, over the next 1 to 3 months in terms of running their business. So our marketing associates typically and even our presidents probably typically don't think in terms of elasticity, but that's what they do. I mean, they're making a judgment call every time they take an order: what's the right balance in terms of maximizing that order, supporting the customer in terms of what they need and striking the right overall price, not necessarily per line item but for that order in general? And so that today and as you well know historically has been handled in a very decentralized way through our sales folks and through the operating companies on that large segment of our customer base. I believe there is opportunity to do more sophisticated work in that area, but it's work that's in its formative stage with us at best right now. And I think that will be one of our key -- that is one of our key initiatives that we've called out and that we'll talk a little bit about next week. But frankly, it will take some time to develop. So I guess my answer is there's opportunity there, but I don't necessarily see a scenario where you go all the way to one extreme and you want to be totally pulling levers from a centralized location on a group of customers that still are going to be somewhat -- their decisions are going to be driven, what's happening in that local marketplace, what's happening in their establishment. So I still think that local salesperson and local operating company visibility is going to be very important.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So to follow on then, the -- and I agree, you can't measure from Houston. But having said that, do the systems exist today to give the marketing associate more information on that? Do they have it -- can they access it? And then, is it more an issue of training so that they are more familiar with how the elasticities work?","William J. DeLaney","Again, I'm going to stay away from the word elasticity. They have more visibility. They have a lot more visibility today, John, than they did, say, 5 or 7 years ago to certain things in terms of cost movements and that kind of thing. They have more visibility today than they did to some other things 1 year or 2 ago. I'd say 2 things. One is our ability, to your point, to train effectively that will lend itself to execution. And then secondly, what else can we provide them in terms of not just maybe what's happening with our customers within what we see, but what else is happening in the marketplace? And that's a whole different level of analytics that is very difficult to get to, but may provide us an opportunity down the road. So they certainly have more information than they've had in the past. But your point is a valid one. There's training opportunities here and there's execution opportunities, and then there's a whole other body of work which is, what else can we provide both at the central location as well at the local location to make smarter decisions that are in the best interests of both our customers and ourselves? So we're making progress, John. I'm not trying to dodge here. We're making progress. But this would be -- this is a big opportunity for us over the next 3 to 5 years.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then when you think about tying that back into the macro then, if we're going to see disinflation here, which we probably should, that 5.5% should be a year from now from or quicker, what do you think the elasticity is that, that in itself creates demand, right? So we'll -- we lose a couple hundred basis points in inflation. We gain some percentage of that in unit demand. And I assume, would you agree that it's not one-for-one, right?","William J. DeLaney","Yes, it's not one-for-one. I'm not even sure that's a key variable anymore. I think if you and I were having this conversation 5 or 10 years ago, we'd be talking about that. I think what's more important is the mindset of the consumer and how our customers see that and their ability to absorb price increases and to get traffic to make themselves more profitable. So I think it's actually the psyche of the consumer is more important than that right now. But where the lowering of inflation, if it happens gradually, would be beneficial is it just creates less of a gap between what so far we've had to absorb and what we're able to pass along. Now look, I would also echo what I said earlier: gross profit is a function of a lot of things. You've got to move boxes. It's a function of how we price. It's a function of how we move prices within our system, transferred pricing, if you will. And it's how we buy. So there's other things we need to do on the buy as well. And that really comes down to reassessing how effective some of our strategic relationships are with our suppliers. And we're beginning to do that.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then lastly, right now, the plan for the third operating company is to be in test for roughly how long? And then when you start the rollout, what's the capacity within the organization to do this, meaning I don't know how you -- whether you're going to measure it by quarter or what. But what do you think capacity is to get companies rolled out?","Robert C. Kreidler","Well, we're going to roll out, as we said, the third conversion in the early part of fiscal 2013. We don't really have any intention of having a set period of time to watch the system before we make additional determinations. We'll actually put in place a schedule that says, \"Unless we find something that is material, we'll keep going and we'll do more.\" We're not really, again, commenting about how many more of these things we'll do. We'll talk a little more about that next week. But I'll plant kind of a concept is that in the past, when we've talked about the rollout for the ERP system, we've -- frankly, we've put out there what we hoped to be able to accomplish, which ended up being a fairly aggressive rollout schedule. And we've put the numbers out there appropriate for that rollout schedule, and we're learning a lot in the process that tells us that it is aggressive or it was aggressive and we might want to be a little smarter about how we roll this thing out. The way we'd hope to be able to talk about it next week is, look, this is a process that is going to be continuing for a while. There's a pace that we need to do that's a relatively conservative and smart and prudent pace. But if we get legs underneath us, if we start seeing great responses from the first few rollouts, we'll be ready, willing and able to go faster. But that's not going to be the way we plan it. We're just going to be ready to do it if we start getting some great news out of the system. So again, I think we'll talk a little bit more about that next week. But right now, we're not talking about any number of companies per quarter or per year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Karen Short with BMO Capital.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a couple of questions on gross margin. And I want to kind of focus on Broadline versus SYGMA, and maybe I'll separate this out into sales and -- or case volume in Broadline and SYGMA and gross margin. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about each segment directionally, which is seeing slightly better than you might have expected case volume growth and which is seeing less gross margin erosion? Maybe just kind of talk directionally about each of those.","William J. DeLaney","Well, let me take the first part. I don't know that we can say a whole lot about the second part, Karen. But in terms of growth, I would say, and I alluded to this in my comments as well, we saw good growth in all the segments, I would say, with the exception of our FreshPoint. The produce markets last year were a lot more volatile, and so that created some challenges this year in terms of both top line growth as well as margin management in that area. So I'd say the Broadline, with the exceptions of some of the -- maybe the weather-sensitive areas where we had some -- perhaps some better performance in places that characteristically we wouldn't see in the winter, up north, and some weaker performance in some of the more vacation spots, I'd say generally, the case growth was good throughout. It was good in Canada. SYGMA had good case growth. The earnings pressure -- they did have earnings pressure more -- they've had more pressure on earnings this year than the last 2 years, where they've had really strong years. Meat companies we've integrated into the Broadline now, so I don't want to call out too much here. But I would say it's generally pretty good with the exception of the produce side of business.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But would it be fair to say that SYGMA has gotten more competitive directionally than Broadline?","William J. DeLaney","No, I wouldn't say that. I mean, I think we've tried to be competitive on both. I think probably one thing I should say because sometimes I think it gets misunderstood, we've seen good growth and pretty comparable rates of growth both on the contract side of the business, including SYGMA, as well as the street side of the business. So I think -- sometimes I think people think all of our growth is coming from the contract side. But the reality is it's pretty balanced. It might have been slightly steeper on the contract side but not that much. Now we've invested in margin to get some of that, to be fair, but we're seeing good growth on both sides of that equation.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, that's helpful. And then just looking at gross margin, if you said this, I didn't catch it. Is there -- can you kind of give a directional split between the competitive environment and inflation on the gross margin pressure you saw this quarter, like 50-50?","William J. DeLaney","No, I tried there and I obviously didn't do very good. I'm almost looking at it in a different way. So I think in one bucket, you can put the customer and what they can absorb, you can put the competitor, you can put the supplier relationships and you can put, for lack of a better term, what's in between our ears in terms of what we think we can do. All right. So that's what the bucket is. It's impossible for me to tell you how much is one or the other. That's why you hear us talk about competitive pricing environment as opposed to competitive competitor environment. The other bucket, I think, is just the math of inflation, which is what I was trying to bring out, which is at this rate of inflation, I don't know -- percentages are not quite as relevant as they are when you have 2 to 3 points of inflation, whether you're looking at margin or whether you're looking at costs. Dollar growth -- at the gross profit line, dollar growth of that operating income line becomes very important. So the way I'm just trying to compartmentalize in my head is, what level of margin erosion could've still provided a quarter that would've met our expectations? And again, I'll let you do the math on that because I don't know what your expectations specifically were. But I would say if we had 1\/2 of the erosion on a percentage basis, we would've probably been pretty pleased with the quarter.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. That's helpful. And then I just was curious on the CapEx. Your CapEx for the year comes up about $50 million to $75 million. I think you called out $20 million was business transformation. What was the remaining bucket?","Robert C. Kreidler","Actually, the increase on the annual CapEx is really almost entirely made up of the increase on the ERP system. It's the comparison between the quarterly and the annual. But going back to the range of $775 million to $800 million from where we were last quarter is almost entirely made up of the ERP increase, the amount of additional capitalization there, which is $20 million year-over-year, I believe, but it's about $40 million quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","We talked a lot about inflation and passing it along. But maybe you could talk about -- I think you said you got some business by being aggressive. Could you talk a little bit about sort of what you're doing to go after business? And are there particular customers or segments of the business that you're being particularly aggressive about?","William J. DeLaney","I'll start with that one, Meredith. I think what we've -- what I've tried to say is that we've been aggressive in growing our business in terms -- and I think in a market like this, we certainly should be. I don't know that any of the issues that we're talking about today, whether margin pressure or managing costs or business transformation, I don't think any of those would be a whole lot better if we didn't grow the cases. And I would argue that they'd be even more acute challenges. So the first place we start, and we've had to do a little more of this over the last year or so than in the past, is we're kind of defending our own turf a little bit more than we've had in the past. We have a lot of different people that come after our customers obviously. And we have a lot of customers. We have a lot of good business out there. So we certainly have, I think, dug in over the last several months and tried to work with our customers in every way we can in terms of drop size; in terms of delivery days; in terms of products; and ultimately, where necessary, in terms of price points to give ourselves every opportunity to retain business. And then our most profitable business, beyond what we retain, is the business that we grow within the account. And so as we see opportunities where we might have 23% share of wallet and we see opportunities to grow that business, we certainly -- and this is not something new. I think maybe the degree of it's a little greater than in the past. We go after that business hard and we find creative ways that make sense for the customer and us. And sometimes, that may result in price accommodation with the expectation that we'll get more business and larger drops and that, that should fall to the bottom line on the expense line. That's why traditionally I've always focused more on the sales line and the operating income line, and then tried to explain those deltas between the 2 lines above, gross profit and expenses. And of course, the third area is an area where we're always, I think, very proficient, which is going after new accounts. And our best reference for new business is current customers, and I think it's just -- that's just the environment in terms of what it takes to go after -- if we're going to after business we don't have, that's typically somebody else's gold account. So we're coming at it from all directions, but I would tell you they're all important. But I think if there's a little bit more emphasis than the other in the last 12, 15 months, it's been more on making sure that we don't lose business with the quality customers that we do have and we find acceptable ways to retain that when other people come after us.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then a question about the business transformation process. You folks did actually invest in a shared services facility in Houston, but obviously, I don't think it is being fully anywhere near fully utilized at this point. I was wondering whether there are dis-synergies caused by the delay in rolling out the ERP system.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes. I think absolutely correct, Meredith. I think we've talked about that on a previous call, that one of the reasons why these numbers, these expenses are high right now is that we've got significant costs out at our shared service center because you have to ramp up in anticipation of additional converted companies. And so you don't get to kind of scale, if you will, until you're pretty far down the road. Now we've tried to be sensible -- once we got more of an idea about the pace of conversions, et cetera, we tried to be sensible about not getting the ramp-up -- or getting too far ahead of the ramp-up curve. But even still, in the early days of these things, they cost more money than the benefits that they derive for you, and that's going to continue to be the case for a while.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And actually, I want to go back to Bill and sort of follow up with my first question to you. I guess, you made a comment, I think, last quarter about the most important thing was to drive case volumes. And if you were successful, the profits would come. And I don't know. I've been around a really long time, and my experience is that you may drive volume, but sometimes the profitability of an industry just goes down permanently after that kind of aggressive behavior. And of course, it sounds like everybody's being aggressive. Could you comment on whether this is a phase for the industry? Or have we set a new lower bar in terms of profitability?","William J. DeLaney","I think, as far as I'm going to go today, Meredith, is I think what we've acknowledged for quite some time now is that we expect the rate of growth in this industry to be modest at best, perhaps even flat. And that we believe that our abilities and capabilities and scale should translate into us being able to grow faster than the market. Clearly, as I've mentioned here even a couple of times today, we're in a different environment than where we were 3 or 5 years ago. So I think a lot of industries are going to be challenged with profitability. So let me try to connect the points. So I think you've quoted me pretty accurately. I do believe that we should be out growing cases and growing volume, not at the expense of profitability at all levels. But I guess, I'm confident in our people and in our systems that we will turn those sales and those incremental business into profits. Now in the short term, obviously, we're seeing some pressure there and there's some execution issues and that type of thing. The connection, I guess, would be that doesn't mean that we don't have to do some things differently. And we'll talk some more about that next week as well. But it connects to some of the things that Chris alluded to in terms of, what is business transformation? So certainly -- I don't think I can just say it's a phase. I think we have moved into a part of the time in terms of the business world, our industry is no exception, where the consumer expectations and our customers' expectations are more acute and more specific than they've ever been. And so price, product quality are always going to be important. So I think it's all of the above. We need to continue to grow our volume. We need to grow it the right way. We need to continue to take our cost structure down, both in terms of our day-to-day execution, as I mentioned earlier, but also looking at our structure overall in terms of operating costs, our product costs, how we work with suppliers and all that as well, so -- and we clearly need to manage our margins along the way, so it's not one or the other. But no, I don't think it's a phase. I mean, I think we're in a new normal, so to speak, and we need to do all of the above. My only point is to just cut and -- or to try to squeeze too much out on the margin line at this point in time, I'm not confident that, that takes us where we need to go as a company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our Q&A session and our presentation for today.

Thank you for joining us. This morning, we announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, which reflect continued momentum in transforming our business and improved year-over-year performance. Our overall results were largely in line with our expectations.","From a top line perspective, we generated sales of $15.3 billion, a 0.6% increase compared to the same period last year. As we discussed during Q4 fiscal 2019, we saw top line softness and difficult comparatives during that quarter, which we said would also carry into the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We did, in fact, see that continued softness at the beginning of the quarter, but as expected, we saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter and therefore, feel confident about the future trajectory based on the exit rate of the quarter.","There were several things that contributed to our volume and sales growth rate for the quarter, including the continued growth of our local customers at a faster rate than our national customers, in part driven by the transition of certain large national customers, both in U.S. Broadline and SYGMA during the past year. Secondly, the divestiture of Iowa Premium, our beef processing facility, that was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. This divestiture had an impact in the quarter of $114 million, and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates, which amounted to an additional $100 million for the quarter.","Gross profit for the quarter grew 1.4% to $2.9 billion dollars. And gross margin expanded 15 basis points, driven by continued shift in our customer mix as we grew local cases at a faster pace than total case growth. And we continued growth and penetration of our Sysco brand portfolio across the various business units.","Turning to cost. Adjusted operating expenses decreased 0.5% to $2.2 billion, driven by strong expense management during the quarter, including greater operational efficiencies and benefits from our transformation initiatives, such as the regionalization work in Canada and our finance transformation. As a result, for total Sysco, we delivered solid adjusted operating income growth of 7.3%, which led to adjusted earnings per share growth of 8.6%.","Looking at the broader economic and industry trends in the U.S., GDP growth was 1.9% during the third quarter, and unemployment remains at an all time low. Consumer spending, the main engine of growth, rose a healthy 2.9% but it was down from 4.6% in the spring, all signs that the economy is doing well despite some broader global concerns.","While some other economic indicators have recently been softer than expected, we haven't seen a meaningful impact to restaurant industry trends and therefore, continue to feel good about what we're seeing in the food away from home market. During the quarter, according to Black Box Intelligence, restaurant same store sales rose slightly, driven by average guest check increases. Although, traffic in the food service industry continues to be mixed, it appears that market conditions are modestly favorable for food service operators in the United States.","Turning to international markets. Traffic and sales in the UK and Ireland continue to be soft as uncertainties around Brexit affect food service operators, as well as other economic activity. However, these trends are relatively stable compared to conditions in the prior quarter. In Canada, GDP and consumer spending are stable and unemployment continues to decline, which is reflected in positive broader restaurant industry performance. In France, GDP growth is expected to continue. Household spending has picked up, and employment is trending down, boosted by labor market reforms.","I would like to now transition to our first quarter results by business segment, beginning with U.S. Foodservice operations. We were pleased with our top-line results and strong expense management in the U.S. Foodservice operations segment in Q1. Specifically, sales for the first quarter were $10.7 billion, an increase of 2.5%; gross profit grew 2.6%; adjusted operating expenses grew only 0.4%; and adjusted operating income increased 6.1%. Local case volume was solid within U.S. Broadline operations, growing 1.5% and has now grown for 22 consecutive quarters.","As previously mentioned, this performance reflects solid growth at local restaurant customers, especially as we cycled one of our largest growth quarters last year, which was partially offset by the loss of some less profitable traditional bid-type business, such as local schools. Total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations grew 0.5%, reflecting our ongoing disciplined approach in managing our national account business. We expect to continue to see the impact of certain customer transitions in U.S. Foodservice operations into the second quarter as well.","Gross profit grew by 2.6%, driven by higher inflation, the positive mix of local cases to total cases, continued growth in Sysco brand, up 36 basis points, and continued category management efforts. Food cost inflation was 2.9% in U.S. Broadline, driven primarily by the meat, produce, dairy and poultry categories.","From an expense perspective, adjusted operating expense for the quarter grew only 0.4%, driven by strong expense management throughout the business, including the impact of some of the transformational initiatives mentioned earlier, which drove down costs during the quarter. This was partially offset by higher labor and operational costs. Similar to the larger discussion we had in the second half of fiscal 2019, our labor costs were slightly higher due to our decision to retain driver and warehouse personnel in a tight labor market. And while we do see some signs of improvement in the overall labor market, we will continue to evaluate this practice is the right one for our business over the next couple of quarters.","Moving to International Foodservice operations, we had mixed results for the quarter. Our international results were impacted by changes in foreign exchange, and Joel will provide more details on that to you in just a few minutes. However, on a constant currency basis, sales increased 3%, gross profit increased 2.1%, adjusted operating expenses increased 1.3% and adjusted operating income increased 6.2%.","Canada and Latin America had improved performance for the quarter, driven by a combination of positive business environments driving the top line with positive synergies coming from programs, such as the regionalization effort in Canada. In Europe, performance in our UK business remained stable, although, uncertainties around Brexit certainly remained in the market. However, challenges with our operational and supply chain integration in France continue to negatively impact our overall performance there, and most likely continue through the remainder of our fiscal year.","The relatively soft gross profit performance was offset somewhat by solid expense management throughout our international segment, as we continue to see benefits from the various integrations and other expense management initiatives [Technical Difficulty] improved operating income growth for the quarter.","Moving on the SYGMA, as mentioned previously, we remain disciplined and focused on improving overall profitability of our portfolio of customers in this segment, which included gross margin expansion of 73 basis points as we saw total gross profit reduce by roughly 3%. In addition, strong expense management and the closure of a distribution location drove adjusted operating expenses down 8.8% versus the same period last year, resulting in significantly improved operating performance. We continue to feel very good about the progress we're making within this segment, and look forward to continuing to improve our operating performance throughout the year.","In summary, we feel good about the trajectory of our business for fiscal 2020. We continue to increase profitability through growth at local customers, our disciplined approach in managing our national customer portfolio, managing our expenses and making progress in the various initiatives we have discussed to transform our business.","As we look ahead, we are excited to celebrate our 50th anniversary this fiscal year. For half century, our company has been at the forefront of the food service distribution industry, passionate about our customers, dedicated to service and committed to being socially responsible. Our team is enthusiastic about the changes we're making in our business model to ensure we remain the market leader, and fulfill our vision to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner for the next 50 years.","And finally, I'd like to thank our dedicated associates across the company for all their efforts to make Sysco the distributor of choice for so many customers. They are truly all in.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.","Joel Grade","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned, sales for the first quarter increased 0.6% despite a number of factors, including a difficult comparison versus the same period last year, our disciplined approach in managing SYGMA and national accounts within our U.S. Foodservice segment, the divestiture of Iowa Premium and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates in our International segment.","Local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations grew 1.5% for the first quarter, of which 1.4% was organic. While total case volume within the US Broadline operations grew 0.5%, of which 0.4% was organic. Gross profit increased 1.4% versus the same period last year and gross margin increased 15 basis points. We saw growth in our sales of Sysco brand products, which increased 20 basis points to 47.7% of local U.S. cases and 36 basis points to 38.8% of total U.S. cases in the first quarter.","We are pleased with our strong expense management for the quarter. Our transformation initiatives continue to generate benefits to the business as adjusted operating expenses decreased 0.5% compared to the same period last year, and slightly ahead of our expectations. As a result, the gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth was 190 basis points and adjusted operating income grew 7.3% compared to the same period last year.","It is also important to note that our adjusted operating expenses grew only 0.4% within the U.S. Foodservice segment despite a challenging operating environment. Although, we have strong expense reductions throughout the quarter, we continue to invest in areas of our business that will help facilitate future growth.","For example, our technology spend was higher versus the same period last year as we continue to make advancements in areas that help us streamline workflow, while better supporting our customers and helping to support better growth. During the first quarter in the U.S. Foodservice segment, we saw 220 basis points gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth, which translated into strong adjusted operating leverage for the quarter.","As Tom mentioned earlier, our results in the International segment were impacted by foreign exchange rates. In that segment, sales decreased 0.3% on a reported basis and increased 3% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit decreased 1.7% on a reported basis and increased 2.1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating expenses decreased 2.7% on a reported basis and increased 1.3% on a constant currency basis. And adjusted operating income increased 3.8% on a reported basis, but increased 6.2% on a constant currency basis.","As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 22% compared to 20% in the prior year period. While higher than per year, this rate was lower than our guidance of 24%, primarily due to tax benefits from share based compensation. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 8.6% to $0.98 per share, which is an increase of $0.08 compared to the same period last year.","Cash flow from operations for the period was $172 million for the quarter, which was $100 million lower compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $1 million, which was $170 million lower compared to the same period last year. Net capital expenditures totaled $171 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which was $70 million higher compared to the prior year period. The decline in free cash flow was due in part to an increase in working capital in the first quarter this year, driven primarily by an increase in receivables. Additionally, we saw planned higher capital spending due to the timing of investments in the prior year period. However, we continue to expect strong cash flow for the full fiscal year 2020.","In July of 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard that changes the way we recognize operating leases by including the related right of use assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of fiscal 2020.The changes are also reflected in the consolidated results of operations and consolidated statement of cash flows. However, there's only minimal net impact. We remain focused on delivering long term results for our shareholders through a strong and consistent approach to our capital allocation priorities, which are as follows; investing in the business, consistently growing our dividend, participating in M&A and maintaining a balanced approach to share buybacks and paying down debt.","We typically review our dividend growth rate each November, and expect to once again increase our dividend later this month. We also have previously committed to a modestly higher rate of share repurchases than in the prior year.","In summary, we had a solid first quarter that reflects the sustained momentum of our work to transform our business. as fundamentals of the industry and our business remained strong, as we continued to deliver steady local case growth, good gross profit dollar growth and strong expense management. These results give us confidence that we remain on the right path to enhancing the customer experience and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business, as we continue our progress toward achieving our three year plan objectives.","Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Edward Kelly","Good morning. And nice quarter on slower overall case growth, and that's really kind of what I want to ask you about, Tom and Joel. I was just hoping could you provide just a little bit more detail on your outlook for the case growth in U.S. business? And you've talked about an improved cadence throughout the quarter. Can you give us any color on the exit rate? You mentioned that you still expect some impact from customer losses in the second quarter. I'm kind of curious as to how we should be thinking about case growth here. And then just overall, as we think about the momentum of the business, what's an acceptable level case growth that you're thinking about as you progress through the year? And other than easing comparisons, can you maybe help us out with what helps to drive that?","Tom Ben\u00e9","So specifically to case growth, as we talked about the quarter, nothing is too specific. But we did see, as we talked about when we came out of Q4 and we all know we had some softer numbers there, driven by both the lapping of a good quarter of the prior year, but also just some general softness in certain parts of the business. Specifically, we talked about some of the national accounts and these more the micro chains.","What we're seeing, as we came out of the first quarter, was the local independent customers maintaining solid performance and continuing to grow. And so we feel good about, as we come out of that, that we're -- if you think about, we finished this quarter in this 1.5% local case growth, we feel like that is the lower end of what you should expect from us going forward. And we feel like that we'll be more in the range of what we have historically talked about with you guys over time.","And so that doesn't mean every quarter is going to be the same. But this idea that you should see us back in the 2% to 2.5% range on local cases is where I'd tell you that you should think about. As it relates to the comment I made about some of the national account and some of the account transitions continuing, it's just really the timing of we know some fairly large customers and transition in the back half of last year, fiscal year. And we have that overlap still ahead of us. We had it in the first quarter that\u2019s why you saw this softening in the total cases, and we'll have that again in Q2. So I think that's the headline there.","When you talk about what's an acceptable level. I think we continue to talk about the fact that we want to be gaining share, certainly, as it relates to the independent market. And we see that, even at the current rates, we're clearly close to being at parity with what the market is doing. And if we're at the levels I just talked about, we will continue to be gaining share, which is where we wanted to be throughout, really all of the last couple of years, and where we continue to be focused.","And so I think you should just think about that level being we want to be in a share growth in a shared gaining scenario. As you noticed from these numbers, very little case volume was attributed to any M&A activity. And as we go forward, you'll see a little bit more of that showing up in as we've had some recent acquisitions. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of what we're thinking about and where we're seeing things now and for the foreseeable future.","Edward Kelly","And just a quick follow up so on the competitive environment. Has anything changed really on that front? You have, over the last couple quarters, highlighted a little bit more competitive intensity in the micro chain. So I'm just curious as to what you're seeing there?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes, I don't think we've seen anything change dramatically from what we had talked about. And if you recall, I had made a comment at the end of last quarter about, maybe us not being as competitive in some areas. And so -- and the point we're trying to make then and that we'll just reinforce today is that, that was really on us and we have kind of re-stepped up our efforts to make sure that we're not losing business, because of somehow we weren't being competitive. And so I'd say it continues to be obviously competitive out there, but we're not seeing any increased level of activity from what we talked about in the past.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Blake on for Chris. Just wondering on the upcoming quarter, can you talk about any other details on timing of case growth in terms of year-over-year comparisons we should be aware of, or holiday timing, just anything like that.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Blake, not really, I mean, there's nothing major there. As we called out that some of this national account business that we're cycling still will still be there in Q2. So I think that you should expect that based on the comments we made. But nothing else that's unique or different other than what I just mentioned.","Unidentified Analyst","And then my follow up is on, some of the capital spending. I know you mentioned free cash flow impact from working capital and in CapEx. On the CapExside, I think you mentioned some project timing. Can you just talk a little bit more about what was going on with that investment? And then maybe, can you give us the cadence of the free cash flow throughout the year? Any commentary about that would be helpful.","Tom Ben\u00e9","So a couple things on that, specifically, on the CapEx piece. We had a little bit of an anomaly in our last year cash flow, because in Q1 of our last fiscal year, we had just come off of Q4 of the previous fiscal year, where we had actually accelerated some CapEx as related as the U.S. tax reform. So the tax reform has given us an opportunity to accelerate some CapEx at that quarter, particularly in the fleet.","So we actually had, what I'd consider, an unusually low first quarter of last year where it came to CapEx. So the year-over-year comparison, what I would -- I would characterize that as a bit of more of a normalized spend as we had it this year relative where we would normally be purchasing more fleet, particularly in that first quarter last year.","So that's where there's a little bit of a timing element. And again, it really relates to the Q4 and the U.S. tax reform actually in the year prior to that. We also, if you remember, we typically have a fair bit of just if you think about the overall kind of cadence and flow of our cash flow, we typically have a lower -- some seasonality related to our first quarter. The number we actually had last year, I would tell you, is actually somewhat of an anomaly relative to how we've actually looked over the last few years on our Q1.","And so I, you know, while somewhat, obviously, there's a bit of this timing and capital spend and again there's a bit of a word, there\u2019s some working capital impact, we certainly look at as somewhat short term. This is not necessarily an unusual sequencing of our cash flow as that relates to our numbers historically, even though last year had a better number.","So I would just tell you, when you take a look at some of the way our cash flow has gone outside of over the last few years, I think you should get a pretty good sense of what that will look like here. And then obviously, it certainly ramps up a lot as we head into the latter part of our fiscal year. But again, certainly, feel confident of our ability to have a strong -- continuing strong cash flow here, despite some of the time issue here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","John Heinbockel","So Tom, when you think about share gains, maybe parse that out between new accounts that you're taking over as opposed to existing account market share. So I think existing account market share is probably pretty static? Or is that not right? And then what are you seeing with regard to drop size? I assume that's getting a little bit larger.","Tom Ben\u00e9","As we think about share, I mean, you're right. It comes from two different places. It comes from new business and obviously, maintaining our current business, so holding on and retaining our current customers and driving penetration, or more cases through them. I'd say it comes from both places. And I wouldn't look at it and assume that the new business is an opportunity. Given our relative share in the market, there's plenty of new business opportunities for us. And for us, it will define a new business as we haven't done business with someone for roughly a year, no business, then that would be new business. So there are customers in this business that cycle on a pretty regular basis. So I wouldn't at all think that new business isn\u2019t still a big part of our opportunity to grow.","And then as it relates to penetration, I'd say we're very focused on penetration, because it's the more you can sell into any existing customer, that's obviously the most efficient case that we can ever get. And so we're very focused on that as well. And we've got some tools that are in place to help identify for our selling organization where some opportunities might exist in those customers. There might be some products that they either have bought from us in the past they may not be buying now, or based on the type of customer they are that they could be buying from us in the future.","So I'd say it's really pretty balanced between the two. And we always look at and talk about that mix of new retaining our current business and further penetrating our customers. And to the point, as we do better job on penetration that generally does help our drop size go up. So I wouldn't say there has been a significant increase in our drop size but overall, our drop size -- we're very comfortable with where our drop sizes are, and are always focused on trying to improve that as we improve our overall penetration.","John Heinbockel","And then maybe for Joel, the corporate expense adjusted, when I take out transformation, looked a little high. I think it grew 4%. Is that -- what drove that, and is that the new run rate, as we think about the rest of the year? Are you up in that 3% to 4% range, or $235 million to $240 million a quarter? Is that a run rate?","Joel Grade","Well, I guess, I would characterize that, John, and a couple of things. I mean, again as we think about -- again, where some of the transformation work is happening that some of those results in some further investments in our corporate spend that actually then, in some cases, coming out of our field organization. So I think some of what you're seeing there is a bit of a geography shift. Obviously, the net effect of which is actually a overall positive, when we look at our SG&A.","So I think, again, probably that's the way I would characterize the majority of that. So I think from that perspective, that's probably a reasonable way to view that. But again, I would just make sure we take a -- think about it more holistically in the sense of how we think about our overall G&A spend and again, we've made some good progress there, when you take that as a whole.","Tom Ben\u00e9","And John, I might just add a point that Joel made in his earlier comments around technology. So like a technology investment, it's going to show up in that corporate expense line. But there are other offsets as you mentioned some of the transformative work that we're doing. So we're going to invest where we need to. And area like technology continues to be a big focus for us, so just to give you little more context behind it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Judah Frommer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Judah Frommer","One of the areas that was more impressive to us was certainly the gap in gross profit dollars and OpEx in the U.S. business. Can you talk a little bit about balancing the pullback on OpEx, and making sure that you're finding the business in the right way to grow the top-line and margins going forward, and the opportunity to further reduce OpEx as you move into the back half of this year or next year?","Tom Ben\u00e9","I'll take a start at this, and I'll let Joel chime in. Judah thanks for the question. I think, look, the gap is important. We've talked about it a lot. And it continues to be something we focus on. Because when, if we're in a quarter where the volume may not be exactly where we all like it to be, we are very conscious of making sure that our expenses fit and flow accordingly. Having said that, I would say that, as we just talked about with technology as a great example, we're going to continue to make investments in the things that are going to drive and support this business. And you should absolutely expect that from us.","The types of things that we're getting the expense leverage on are the things we've been talking about. We've had some administrative costs focus areas here last year that we're still getting some benefit from. We've had this smart spending initiative, which is around just making sure that we're removing some non-value added expenses in parts of our business where possible. We talked about the regionalisation effort in Canada, and that's had some impact. And then we've had things like the finance transformation that's been a journey here, but we're still kind of benefiting from that work that's going on.","So I would say think about it as, we're going to continue to stay focused on cost, and we do believe there are additional opportunities there. But those areas of opportunity are not the areas that would, in any way, reduce or slow down our focus on both transforming the business and accelerating our growth and driving the share gains that we've been talking. Joel, if there's anything you want to add?","Joel Grade","I think it's well said. I think the only maybe small point I'd touch on part of your question in terms of what's the -- is there more to come on some of that kind of stuff. And I think the answer to that is that, in the context of what Tom talked about here, in terms of taking some of those things that are more, again, non-value added or transformative, or however you want to say it, there's certainly further run rate on some of that stuff. Again, we -- you know, obviously, we started receiving some of the benefits to that, a lot of that in the second half of last year. But obviously, we remain very focused on continuing to find additional opportunities.","And so that's something we certainly will continue to pursue, and you should expect to have some continued benefits of that over the course of the year. But again, just to reinforce Tom's point, none of those things are the things that are going to somehow get in the way of us investing for growth. And so that's a critical piece of that message I just -- certainly, we just can't repeat enough.","Judah Frommer","And just to follow-up on that. Historically, M&A is an important piece of both top line growth and I would say also, driving margin as you're able to strip costs that have acquired businesses. With what you've seen out of the regulatory bodies and kind of review of M&A over the last couple of years, largely on the larger size. But how does that affect your process going forward in terms of assessing deals and deal flow?","A - Tom Ben\u00e9","Well, I think one of the points you made, again, our historical M&A has been pretty strongly focused on kind of the smaller fold-in tuck-in type deals. And so I think -- and that certainly continues to be our focus. Obviously, as we talked about from time-to-time, we certainly have our eyes open for larger strategic opportunities. But certainly, the vast majority of the work that we do is within that smaller fold-in tuck-in space.","So I can't say truthfully that that's had that much significant impact on our perspectives on that. Obviously, we\u2019ve certainly paid attention to what's going on there. But I think, in general, again, the J. Kings deal we announced in the last quarter and just yet another example of one of those opportunities that we have that certainly fits really nicely into our existing portfolio. And so, I would just say, Judah, generally speaking, we feel good about our M&A pipeline. We feel good about the opportunities ahead of us. And I can't say a lot of that, even though we certainly took and to take a note of it, has been a real significant impact on how we think about overall M&A pipeline.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Marisa Sullivan","I just wanted to touch on gross margin, and see if you could maybe quantify what the impact of inflation was on the gross margin improvement, and then what the outlook for inflation would be for the rest of the year, and then as we think about modeling gross margin? Any other puts and takes just to keep in mind in 2Q and the rest of the year? Thanks.","Joel Grade","Sure Marisa. This is Joel, I'll take that one. I think the -- in terms of quantifying the specific impact of inflation, I don't know that we'll do that. But I think the -- I think maybe the takeaway is, again, we've had -- again, we always think about this sort of 2% to 3% range is as sort of an optimal range for our industry, where we have the ability to pass those costs along and generally speaking, our customers to have the ability to pass those costs along to their customers over the longer term.","And so I think we find ourselves in a pretty good place there. Again, it obviously is always driven, depending somewhat on the categories that are inflating and certainly nothing, again, that we see as something that's either particularly problematic or an issue for us at this point. So I think my view on this would be that we have a modest level of inflation than we expect to over the next few quarters. And -- but again, nothing really to call out other than the fact that we certainly like the place we\u2019re in from an inflationary perspective.","Tom Ben\u00e9","And Marisa, I think you asked about kind of going forward what do we see? I think what I'd just say is, as we've talked about remaining competitive in the competitive environment. I don't think you should be modeling big gross margin increases. I don't think, on the other hand, you need to be hitting self on those numbers either. But I think we feel like, and we've talked about this a few times in the last couple of quarters, we feel pretty good about where we are from a gross margin perspective you know where we sit, relative to our peer group. And so I think we feel comfortable and confident where we are right now, but probably at the high end of where we can -- you should think about us going forward.","Marisa Sullivan","If I can just quickly follow up with just another kind of modeling question, on SYGMA. Should we think about the 1Q sales performance as -- is indicative of what you'd expect going forward, given some of the business rationalization. And if so, when do you start to cycle that?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Similarly, I think Q1 was probably a little more aggressive than we saw in Q4. But as we talked about last year -- in the last year, we are in fact cycling some, some fairly large customer transitions there. So I would say for the next couple of quarters, you ought to think about similar numbers. And there is a balance of transition customers and also performance within existing customers. As you probably know, on the SYGMA side, not in every case, but when we have a customer we have majority of their business in geography. And so their relative performance will in fact affect our performance there. But the bigger numbers you're seeing are driven by the transitions we've been talking about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Two questions, one on the topic of chain versus independents. And you mentioned the ongoing transition of presumably some of the chain accounts. So I'm just wondering how you would characterize maybe the health of each of the sub-segments being chain and independent. And importantly, maybe some changes in sequential trends for either in terms of top line performance, again recognizing that you're pruning some of the chain larger business. But just how you think about change in independents in terms of their performance of late?","Tom Ben\u00e9","So as we mentioned earlier to some of the comments and you guys have access to the same kind of information. I think in general, the numbers you're seeing for us, have more to do with transitions than softness within certain customer types. I think we continue to feel good about the Independent growth potential out there, whether it's existing customers or our opportunity to gain new business as we were talking earlier. I think as it relates to some of the larger national type customers we have there are segments of the market that are growing faster than others.","Think about QSR is doing well, you see some of the casual dine maybe having a little harder time, but I think generally speaking, we feel like the environment is pretty good for the restaurant operators. And so I think we would say that the numbers you may see us talk about or reflected here will be more about decisions we made, or customers have made in doing business with Sysco. So right now, I'd say we feel pretty good about that environment, in that market.","Jeffrey Bernstein","And then just following up on the M&A discussion, I know you've often quoted that there's tons of room for growth for you guys, with only a 16% share in the US. And I think you mentioned you expected it to be a modest uptick for you guys, but still not huge M&A numbers expected. With that said the comment around the regulators in terms of seemingly being increasingly involved and scrutinizing. I'm just wondering, more so than just for yourselves. But do you think that changes the landscape of M&A and consolidation for the broader Foodservice industry?","Joel Grade","Yes, I don't know that we think about it that way. And again I think at Tom's point, I mean, look our M&A as we talked about, we anticipate between 0.5% and 1% of our total sales in any given year. And obviously that moves around a bit, given by quarter given what we may or may not have or lap. Again we feel certainly good about our pipeline of deals. Certainly feel good about the companies we brought on over the last couple of years.","And I think, I don't know, I think from an overall industry perspective, I just think there is plenty of room for consolidation, continues and again I think that will continue to happen. And I think you certainly should expect that from the broader industry and from ourselves as well. I think it's interesting to see how some of those things all play out. And what the regulators are interested in, in this math. But I would just, as I said earlier in the call, I don't believe, what's happening there as we have really significant impact on how we think about M&A.","Jeffrey Bernstein","And just lastly a clarification on what you said earlier about inflation. It looks like now, like I said, you're approaching 3% which is maybe the upper end of your two to three sweet spot. But has been kind of upticking the past number of quarters. I'm just wondering whether you would expect it to lag of that 2% to 3% range to the upside. And if it did, which commodity have you seen some more significant signs of inflation, whether it's protein, dairy or produce or otherwise.","Joel Grade","Yes, I mean as I think and again Tom can chime in here. I think our view would be that we still stay within that range for the most part again. Obviously, we've had some issues in terms of pork and some of the other pork related commodities that are on the higher end of that. Obviously, there have been some of the challenges certainly they are well documented. Obviously, produce has been certainly on the higher end of that range. A little of that's certainly is oftentimes the category of that that moves around a fair bit.","So I would just say, generally speaking, I mean, you're right. We're on the bit of a higher end of the range that we consider kind of the optimal place. But outside of that, I don't know if there's anything that, that we would see that would drive significantly. We get questions fairly often on the question on pork, just in general. But again, our pork certainly, a fairly small percentage of our overall business and not something that people are seeing, that our folks are seeing something that we should be overly concerned about over the near future.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Jeffrey, I think, the only thing I'd add is, as Joel mentioned the center of plate items are the ones that can drive the biggest impact for everyone, because it's such an important part of the menu for the operator and where they struggled to pass things along. So I think we just have to stay focused on those key center plate categories meat, poultry, seafood, and certainly pork falls within the meat segment of that.","And then the last thing as Joel mentioned produce. I think it's something we just got to stay close to. There were some ups and downs a year ago, seeing where that ends up. And dairy has been on the higher end too. So I think you're right. We're feeling good about where things are now, we think that -- we hope that they maintain within this range, but if we have any concerns it would be around those center plate and produce items.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wolf","On the acquisition side, I think you said you expect more -- you announced $155 million acquisition last, at the end of the -- toward the end of this quarter, the one you just reported. So doing the math that's about 25 bps, a little below what you think it sounds like you can get to. First of all, are there other acquisitions that we could model in right now that you've kind of would add to that 25 bps roughly. Secondly, kind of related to this, the next two largest distributors in the industry are involved in very large acquisitions at different stages, but pretty early on. How does the market look to you in terms of, as a buyer out there looking for targets in terms of availability and valuations?","Joel Grade","Well, a couple of things. First of all, as it relates to other acquisitions, obviously again the only thing I can reiterate there, obviously, I think able to reported anything specifically is that we continue to feel good about the pipeline that we have in front of us. And certainly, so again reiterating just our overall guidance around the sort of 0.5% to 1% in any given year, it's again moves around by quarter some. But all I guess I can say there is, without being able to go into specifics, it's again we certainly feel decent. We feel we're in a good place with our pipeline and obviously there's something we can talk about. We will certainly do that.","I guess just in general, I mean the sort of the view of the large, again, certainly, I don't want to speak for other competitors in the space. I guess the only thing I would say there though just in terms of context. You obviously the density of our network in this certainly are in the United States is, I would say, significantly higher than the others in our space. And so the ability for them to take on additional geographies or additional areas that you consider white space for them is obviously a bit different than the way we would look at some of those things. And so outside of the deals that we've done in Hawaii are recently and obviously outside of our core markets in North America.","But in our North American business, again the density of our network it puts us probably a little bit in a different place in terms of how we look at some of those deals and then are probably our two largest competitors. So I think just from that contextual perspective would be the way I would think about that. We certainly again have again lots of opportunities in front of us and we'll certainly continue to be aggressive in that space. But probably the best context I can give you there at this time.","Andrew Wolf","And then I just wanted to either circle back or just ask directly about this African swine fever in China and other parts of Asia that you hear different views on that from kind of semi catastrophic to sort of probably not -- not that great. How is Sysco sort of viewing this? I mean, I'm not asking you to make a prediction. But what kind of contingencies are you thinking about, what kind of scenarios you're looking at, and so on, if you have any? Thanks.","Tom Ben\u00e9","Andy it's Tom. Look, I think it's something that's, it's out there. It's something that we are starting to stay very close to. We think over the next six months that there could be some impacts in that area that especially if you think about other markets may be beginning more import of that because of their needs. I think if you think about the pork segment, there are various components of that, some that are more important and our bigger part of the sales and others.","And so I think we're staying close to try to understand what impact might exist in some of those different areas. So I think there are two, probably two things you should just think about. I mean, it's been out there for a while, we haven't seen major impacts yet, but we believe there could still be some. And the way we think about that is, we work closely with our restaurant operators and certainly with our suppliers.","We're not going to be in a position where we're not going to have availability. That's not going to be the issue, it's really a matter of do the prices in some areas get to the point where customers start to transition those menu items or think differently about those menu items. And I think that's the work we're always doing with our customers to stay abreast of the impacts that might be happening on these certain product categories. And try to proactively work with them so that they are not in a situation where it dramatically affects their ability to drive profitable growth in their own businesses.","So I'd just say, we're very close to these kind of things. We have lots of resources that are involved both with our supplier partners and here. And right now, I think we're saying our sense would be, over the next six months, we'll probably see some increased impacts here, while we are proactively trying to manage that both in the company with our customers.","Joel Grade","And I would say just even in terms of just sourcing availability of product, as well as substitutes. So I think that's one of the things that we've certainly been very active in working with customers and managers navigate through those things in the past and certainly we are moving forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kelly Bania","Tom and Joel, I wanted to just go back to the independents. And I was wondering if you could or the local case growth and wondering if you could unpack that 1.4%. Just help us understand kind of what types of trends you're seeing underneath the types of restaurants, regional trends, open new customer openings. And regarding the improved exit rate, can you elaborate on that. Is that just comparisons, or is that internal or external factors. And then the last part is, I think you had been targeting closer to a 3%. And so, I'm curious is that still on the table or should we be thinking about a 2% to 2.5% kind of going forward for that segment? Thank you.","Tom Ben\u00e9","So a couple of things, as we talked about earlier on the 1.4%, part of what we talked about is, we feel very good about the growth within the independent restaurants segment and including in that would be the this more of the regional or micro kind of change we've talked about as well. We did talk about we do see this from time-to-time. We talked about the impact from what we think about is almost local bid business. So we talked about local schools as an example. There is some of that that falls into these local numbers. It's not national business, because it's literally local school-type agreements or some kind of local governmental things that fall into that as well.","So I think what we see is and why we feel good and confident is that the restaurant side of it is strong, and we're seeing good growth there. And so I think that piece you should, rest assured that we feel good about the work we're doing. And I think it's a combination of, as we talked about, us making sure we're remaining competitive in that space. But also there are some, as I mentioned, also some tools that we're providing our selling organization that help them to understand where they can improve their overall penetration within those customers. So I think it's a good balance of both new business opportunities that exist and that we're able to pick up, as well as the penetration within those existing customers.","As far as the 3% number versus where we are today and maybe with 2.5%, I talked about earlier. I think we just have to continue to think about the fact that we're going to see improved growth in this segment given the fact that we have things like this local bid business in there. I can't sit here today and say that we still deliver the 3% overall for the whole time frame. But we still feel like that 2.5% to 3% is not an unreasonable number for us. So we are cycling two of our biggest quarters in Q4 and Q1 from prior year, as we've talked. And so I think we'll get some benefit of that may be going forward, but that really wasn't part of the sequential improvement, I talked about as we exited Q1.","Kelly Bania","And then, I think I heard you mention or maybe Joel mentioned some signs of improvement in the labor market. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on where and what you're seeing and what you're thinking about in terms of where -- how you are staffed appropriately for the rest of the year?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Yes, I had mentioned that we are seeing some settling I guess right, I'd say it. As we all know over the last couple of years, the labor market has been very tight, it continues to be tight. But what I think we found is, and we see this in our own associate retention numbers is we're seeing better retention. And therefore, when I say we're seeing -- feeling a little bit better about that labor market, we feel like we're having a little more stability than we had there for a while, both in our -- and I'm mainly talking about our front-line operating associates warehouse and drivers.","And so what we have also talked about is, one of the things we've been focused on is, not naturally transitioning some of that business when the season has got softer, because then we'd have to ramp back up as we came into the new season. And so what we're still evaluating is we need to be thoughtful here. We'd rather maintain our good associates and continue to invest in them during the lower seasons to ensure that when time comes to ramp back up, we're not in a situation like we were in the past where we are now scrambling for labor having to potentially do a lot of training. There's a lot of expense associated with new hires and not the least, which is the training and development of them and getting them up to speed.","So that's really what I was referencing. I think we\u2019ll continue to evaluate, we think the model we have right now is a good one for us. But as we get into some of the lower parts of the year, I mean volumetrically that could have some impact and we're just trying to make sure we understand the pros and cons of that business practice that we've employed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe","The Canadian regionalization was mentioned a couple of times, and it sounds like, at least in that market it's having some effect that at least in terms of delivering more profitability. And it looks like as well some more case volume as well. Are there any lessons to be learned from that project, as it relates to the United States? In other words, is that lagging the United States in terms of implementation of that structure, or might the United States to be able to learn something as to what is happening in Canada?","Tom Ben\u00e9","So the Canadian regionalization is something we have talked about a few times. And it's an effort that we started about 15 months ago and we were implementing it throughout last fiscal year. So we're getting some continued benefit as we move into this fiscal. And I would say that it's a little different than the U.S., because just the sheer geography and types of facilities we had there. We had regular size operating companies like you'd expect to see in the U.S. and we had some smaller operating companies, significantly smaller than we have in the U.S.","And in the case of Canada, we had a similar management structure at every one of those facilities. And so we just felt like there was an opportunity to better structure ourselves up there from a cost perspective to take out some of that additional expense associated with some of those smaller facilities.","There is certainly been learnings there that we do believe over time might have some applicability to the US, but it is a little bit different setup than what we have in the U.S. and that drives some difference in the way we have opt to think about it going forward. But we feel good about the lessons we're learning and we've had many, and I would say it's still work-in-progress, but we're feeling good about the effort and time will show whether or not there is some similar opportunities here in the US.","John Ivankoe","And this wasn't really apparent in the results, maybe a little bit just in terms of the overall inflation numbers. But there was some very unusual pricing behavior this quarter that happened because of the beef processing plant fire that happened where number of different state cuts actually in the spot market spiked up considerably. Did you see anything unusual happen within your P&L that happened because of this kind of intra-week volatility, specifically on the beef side or is your company just big enough that, that would have been noise?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Well, John, first of all, I mean, because of the way we go to market with the supplier partners, and our agreements, those things for us are probably a little bit of noise more than anything else, but not big impacts for sure. And that's one of the things as we've talked, I think over the years that their own should feel really good about is, the long-standing relationships, the way we've built our relationships with our suppliers are not short-term, they are longer term in nature, and that helps us I think dramatically as we go in and out of these type of events. It's unfortunate when they happen, and it's difficult for our suppliers. But we're generally able to manage through those pretty seamlessly.","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our last question from Bob Summers from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Bob Summers","Just a quick question on the calendar for second quarter, the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas has shortened. I think last time we went through something like this, Starbucks was impacted. I mean, I think it's really pent-up demand for restaurants. Did it impact you at all or should be expect any weakness associated with that?","Tom Ben\u00e9","Bob, I don't think, you know from where we're sitting today, we don't necessarily believe so. It's a fair question and something we're certainly have to go do a little more work on. But we don't, at this point, see any historical impact or feel like that's going to be a problem.","Bob Summers","And then second, you guys seemed really confident with the acquisition pipeline. Just curious what you've seen on the seller expectation price point, point of view? I mean, arguably two big competitors are now out of the market for some period of time. I'm wondering if seller expectations have accordingly modified.","Joel Grade","Bob, it's Joel. I don't know that I'd say we've had a lot of seller impact. We have previously been asked a lot about just sort of the overall high price that U.S. Foods SGA deal was. I mean did that impact expectations. Just I would say generally no. I mean we've got a pretty steady -- every deal is very different. I can't say we've run into a lot of situations where we just -- again, that aren't very deal specific where we would say, hey, there is some inflated view of expectations, or the opposite direction.","So I mean, I think we had -- we've historically had a pretty, I'd say, normalized view of what we expect our M&A multiples to be. And I would say generally speaking, discussions we have with people today are generally within that range. So there is nothing, again, outside of what I'd call very deal specific situations that come up from time-to-time. There is nothing that I would say impact, either what direction of, either higher or lower related to the deals or the, as you suggested, possible timing today.","Operator","Thank you.

Your perspective on our business and the surrounding landscape will continue to be important as we move forward.","Now, I will turn the call over to Joel, so we can walk you through our second quarter results.","Joel Grade","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, which represented improved local case growth in our U.S. Foodservice segment, primarily driven by our independent customers. I will start with second quarter results, continue with segment-specific commentary, transition into the first half of fiscal 2020 results, and then close with a general business update.","Our total Sysco results for the second quarter include a sales increase of 1.8% to $15 billion, which was driven by U.S. Broadline local case growth of 3.7%. Gross profit grew 2% to $2.8 billion, and gross margin increased five basis points. ","We saw growth in our sales of Sysco brand products in the second quarter, which increased 27 basis points to 47% of local U.S. cases and 42 basis points to 38.3% of total U.S. cases. Adjusted operating expense increased 1.5% during the quarter, which resulted in an adjusted operating income increase of 3.9% to $626.9 million. Adjusted earnings per share grew 13.2% to $0.85.","I will now transition to our quarterly results by business segment, starting with our U.S. Foodservice Operations. Local case volume increased 3.7% versus the prior year period and has now grown for 23 consecutive quarters. As previously noted, we remain disciplined in our approach to managing our national account business, which was reflected this quarter in our total case volume growth.","As a result, total case volume growth was 2% for U.S. Broadline operations. Sales for the second quarter were $10.4 billion, which was an increase of 3.2% versus the prior year period. This includes the divestiture of Iowa Premium, our beef processing facility that was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, which had a negative impact of $122 million for the quarter.","Gross profit grew 2.4% to $2 billion for the quarter. While we are pleased with the gross profit dollar growth, gross margin declined 17 basis points to 19.7%. This is primarily driven by a few key levers. ","First, we saw an unusually high rate of inflation specifically in the dairy and beef categories. As a result, we are unable to efficiently pass inflation through to our customers. Separately but still related, we saw a return to more normalized pricing in produce markets, compared to a sharp increase in the second quarter last year, which resulted in a negative impact to our gross profit dollar growth. We expect this year-over-year headwind to continue into the third fiscal quarter. Lastly, fuel surcharges, which appear in gross profit for us, were less this year than in the prior year period.","Turning our attention to costs. Our adjusted operating expenses increased 1% to $1.3 billion. As we have discussed in our previous quarters, our labor costs were slightly higher due to our decision to retain driver and warehouse personnel in a tight labor market.","We will continue to evaluate our staffing trends relative to our business model over the next couple of quarters. Additionally, we experienced a 12-day strike in Denver, which resulted in added costs from the business impact of continuing to serve customers during that period. Adjusted operating income increased 4.7% to $772 million within our U.S. Foodservice Operations segment.","Moving to International Foodservice Operations, we had mixed results for the quarter. Our international results were modestly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 0.9%, gross profit increased 0.4%, adjusted operating expenses increased 2.2%, and adjusted operating income decreased 11.1%.","Our business results in Canada softened for the quarter as a result of a slowing economy in some parts of the country and the loss of a large chain customer. Our business results across Europe were mixed.","As mentioned during the first quarter call, we continue to experience operational challenges arising from our integration efforts between our two businesses in France, which is offsetting growth in our other international businesses. We expect this to continue through the end of our fiscal year.","However, the UK business performance remained stable despite ongoing uncertainties around Brexit. We are continuing our work around modernizing the business and growing our customer base.","In Sweden and Ireland, we saw positive results versus the prior year period stemming from a positive business environment and solid independent sales growth. We remain convinced that Europe will be a growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead.","As for our business in Latin America, the companies are performing well and we remain excited about the growth opportunities in this region. We extended our retail cash and carry footprint from Costa Rica into Panama with plans to open more stores there in the future.","In Costa Rica, we saw solid growth despite a slight economic slowdown due to the recent implementation of a value-added tax. In Mexico, the business has improved meaningfully year-over-year despite continued economic contraction.","Our SYGMA segment continues to show improved profitability as we remain disciplined and focused on our portfolio of customers. As a result, we saw planned top-line softness as sales decreased 5.3% versus the prior year period, but gross margin expanded 62 basis points.","Adjusted operating expenses were down for the quarter, driven by a focus on business and routing optimization, which led to an adjusted operating income improvement of $8 million versus the prior year period. We feel good about the continued progress we are making within SYGMA and are confident in our ability to drive improved performance going forward.","Finally, it is important to note that our core business is performing fairly well as our adjusted operating income from operations increased 5.5% versus the prior year period. However, our corporate expenses increased due to several discrete items such as costs from the Denver strike and other liability claims. Therefore, our adjusted operating income increased only 3.9% versus the prior year period.","Now, turning to our results for the first half of fiscal year 2020. Sales increased 1.2% to $30.3 billion. Our local case growth in the U.S. Broadline was 2.9%, and total case growth was 1.4%. Gross profit increased 1.7% to $5.8 billion, and gross margin increased 10 basis points. Our overall expense management was solid with adjusted operating expenses increasing only 0.5% for the first 26 weeks.","Adjusted operating income increased 5.7% to $1.4 billion, resulting in a gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth of 120 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 10.7% to $1.83. ","Cash flow from operations was $754.5 million for the first half of fiscal 2020. Net CapEx for the first half of the year was $383.1 million or about 1.3% of sales, which as a reminder is in line with our previously noted guidance.","Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2020 was $371.4 million, which is $329.5 million lower compared to the same period last year. The decline in free cash flow was impacted by an increase in working capital as we continue to experience challenges from our ongoing implementation of the finance transformation road map as well as an increase in bad debt accounts. Strong cash flow has always been a strength of Sysco, and we are confident that we will see an improvement to this trend by the end of the fiscal year.","Before closing, I would like to make a few additional comments about our financial performance where we stand relative to our three-year plan goals and our outlook for the year. We have a chart on Slide 14 of the earnings presentation slides on our website detailing anticipated results compared to our most recent three-year plan guidance.","As you recall, our three-year plan included six different financial objectives. These included total case growth of 2.5% to 3%, for which we are tracking to 2.5%; local case growth of 3% to 3.3%, for which we are tracking to 3.3%; sales growth of 3.5% to 4%, for which we are tracking to 3.7%; gross profit dollar growth of 3.5% to 4%, for which we are tracking to 3.6%; adjusted operating income growth of about 8% or $600 million, for which we are tracking to 7%; and adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 15%, for which we are tracking to approximately 15.5%.","When we announced senior leadership changes last month with a goal of accelerating growth and operating improvements, we noted that our fiscal year 2020 performance was generally tracking along with consensus estimates. As you can see from the chart, we continue to generate strong performance relative to our three-year plan across virtually all metrics.","However, after closing the second fiscal quarter and considering recent performance even with some clear positives such as an acceleration in local case growth, we have decided to make adjustments to our outlook. ","Specifically given challenges we are seeing and have discussed this morning relative to year-to-date performance; specifically challenges related to inflation changes, integration challenges in France, discrete corporate expenses I noted earlier, and given certain investment opportunities we see today that can deliver strong returns overtime, we have decided to amend our plan.","Specifically, we are lowering our adjusted operating income growth target to approximately $500 million to $525 million to the previously communicated approximately $600 million target and lowering our three-year adjusted operating income growth guidance from approximately 8% to 7%.","We would note that the benefits we are seeing below the line in areas such as interest and tax rate provided added flexibility to make these investments now, while still delivering on our previously communicated top-line and bottom line earnings per share targets.","While we do not like to move backwards at any part of our previously communicated commitments, when given the decision between achieving a short-term goal or investing for the long-term, we will always choose to invest for the future.","The investments we are making will allow us to advance work that will both further enhance our customer focus while accelerating future growth and to continue our efforts to efficiently manage costs through improved processes. ","It is important to note that we are incredibly excited about Sysco's future, one that will include continued leadership across the foodservice industry driven by investments in our customer-centric strategies and fueled by the best associates in the business.","With that, operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.","Edward Kelly","Hi. Good morning, guys. And Kevin, let me just me be the first to say welcome to Sysco. My first question actually is for you, Kevin. I mean, I know it is obviously very early days, but you and the Board have clearly highlighted the desire to grow faster as a company overtime. Can you just give us some sense as to what that means and how you get there profitably? I think there is just some concern around when companies make CEO changes and talk about accelerating growth about what the cost of that potentially could be. And I'm just curious philosophically how you are thinking about - how you think about the path to that. ","Kevin Hourican","Yes, good morning, and I appreciate the call - the question on the call this morning. First, I do want to acknowledge the good work that the company has been doing and the strong results and, as Joel said, the very capable team here at Sysco. And to directly answer your question, where do we see opportunities for growth? ","The first is, we need to and can leverage our scale and our size more efficiently. Joel referenced improved processes, taking cost out of the system. That cost that we can take out of the system that is where we can fuel and fund top line growth in the future. We will be very pragmatic and disciplined on our pricing strategies. Joel, I know, has covered that consistently quarter-over-quarter. ","We will be very thoughtful about how we price the business. Ed referenced there are underserved markets for Sysco. A specific example would be the metro market where we under-represent versus our national average. ","There are some things we can do vis-\u00e0-vis how we serve those customers more strategically with, we will call, customized tailored supply chain solutions for those markets, and that would be again another area of where and how we can grow that is not tied to price. ","I guess, I would just wrap up with saying, as you know, this is a very highly fragmented market, one where the largest player in the space through the investments that we can make, the capabilities that we can bring to the table, we can take increased share overtime, and that is our plan.","Joel Grade","And Ed, if I could just add one thing to that. I think, look, we have said many times, and we have said that our strategy as a leader in this industry has never been to lead with price. It never has been, it never will be. And so, I think the - again, some of the stuff that you are seeing this quarter as we talked about was related to some - a bit elevated inflation that happened at a higher level and at an accelerated rate that allowed us some inefficiencies on passing that along. But again, I just want to reiterate - what Kevin said and just to add on to that question just a bit, and that is not and never will be a strategy of ours to lead with price.","Edward Kelly","Can I just follow up then, Joel? The case level profitability on gross profit per case this quarter was obviously disappointing. And you mentioned the inflation component. But inflation overall didn't really accelerate from Q1. I'm just - I guess I'm struggling with what changed from an inflation standpoint and why you had issues with passing through costs within dairy and the protein side? And then, why even through the back half of the year, it sounds like you expect that pressure to continue?","Joel Grade","Sure. So, a couple of points. First, I would say, one of the things that we saw - remember, the average that we talked about inflation is one number, but obviously it is made up of a lot of different categories. And some of those categories tend to be harder to pass along inflation with - than others. And again, certainly the Center of the Plate category is the ones that tend to be more emotional on our space. ","And so, what we experienced, and particularly in the later part of the quarter, was an acceleration in the areas that we talked about primarily in Center of the Plate and beef, in dairy and - as well as some in canned and dry. But really the beef and dairy categories were the primary ones.","And I think, again, as we have talked about a number of times, it is not just that overall number, it is the rate at which they're actually accelerating. And certainly that is part of what we saw again toward the later part of this quarter that we struggled to pass along.","The other point I would make, when you actually look at the overall, given if you will gross profit per case. One of the things we called out here is, some of the produce market that we had last year that was related to weather impacts in California. And so, at that time, we had some positive gains from the produce markets. That was the latter part of the second quarter last year, and we actually saw that carry into the early part of the third quarter of last year as well.","And so, on a per case basis, when you look at the overall gross profit, it really is related to, again, some of the struggle of the inefficiency of passing some of the inflation along to the produce markets, again the piece around the fuel surcharge, particularly areas that we struggled with.","The question that you had in terms of - as we see that outlook moving forward, I think one of the things we did continue to see is some of those challenges that we had toward the latter part of this quarter and carry into the early part of the third quarter.","And so, I think that some of it, again, will be somewhat self-correcting in a sense that in the case of our multi-unit customers, so that 50% of the business that we have on a cost-plus arrangement where it is a relatively short-time lag to pass some of that cost along. ","Again, we will anticipate seeing, I would say, some improvement there. But again, particularly the categories that we saw the inflation in and the rate that we saw the increase is why we had some challenges passing that along. And it impacted our margins, particularly in the U.S. Foodservice business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Mandeville with Jefferies.","Chris Mandeville","Hey, good morning. Kevin, I guess, similar to Ed's question here. I imagine a little bit more of a detailed go-forward strategy is going to be laid out at some point. So, I guess I'm just wondering what the reasonable time frame to expect there? And is there any ability to elaborate a bit more on the comments surrounding a desire to improve in underdeveloped markets and your ability to deliver strong results in large complex environments? I mean, I guess when I think about that, it sounds like you are referring to urban markets and from what we understand that is already a fairly competitive environment and comes with low margins. So, how do you navigate those waters and accelerating sales but yet not diluting your margin?","Joel Grade","So let me take that. I will let Kevin add in if he so desires. Obviously it is pretty much his first day on the job, so we should take that into consideration here. But what I will say is the following. The idea that the metro markets are competitive is certainly true. ","The idea that the metro markets are somehow inherently unprofitable, I would certainly debate that with you significantly, because again there is - one of the areas that we have been underdeveloped is in some of the most sort of dense urban markets.","And in some of those cases, it is about the ways that we go to market and the value that we provide to those customers. And in so many of the cases, and particularly in some, again, the - some of the high-end restaurants and some of the different metropolitan areas, again, price becomes much less of an issue when the go-to-market strategy is the right one.","And so, I - so I will let Kevin chime in here, but I just want to probably a little bit debunk this idea that somehow we are just charging into the less profitable area. Kevin, I will let you take it from here.","Kevin Hourican","Yes, Joel. So what I was referring to, yes, was the more metro markets where our share under-represents. And the why as I mentioned earlier was the supply chain solutions and the go-to-market strategy that works in more suburban or rural area does not necessarily work in a downtown metro environment. ","Some of these high volume, let's just call, New York City restaurants, they may need delivery multiple times per day. And what we will work on are solutions that provide more tailored support for those types of customers in a cost-efficient way so that the business would be profitable. And Joel already covered the profit per customer, so I won't build on that.","Joel Grade","I think the other thing I would point out, Chris, when we talk about investments that we are making, some of the investments that we are talking about here are to continue to enhance the way that our technology tools interact with our customers, to continue to enhance the way our technology tools allow our salespeople to be supported in a different way that allows, again, for these types of interactions.","So I think, again a lot of these things that we are talking about here is certainly - are where we see opportunities, and again particularly in these areas where we are very - we are significantly underpenetrated.","Chris Mandeville","Okay. That is helpful. And then, Joel, I guess recently I believe there was a decision to outsource your customer service department. Any way that you can elaborate on what went into that analysis with respect to potential cost savings versus maybe some service disruption or just changes for that matter? How does the department change with respect to its overall interaction with account? And does anyone else in the industry necessarily have a similar model?","Joel Grade","Well, let me start with the premise of why that decision was made and the thought process around that. If you look at Sysco historically, one of the challenges that we have had in servicing our national customers is the idea that we have primarily had customer care at each operating company level.","So name the CMU customer, and you had to solve issues whether it were credit issues, whether it were customer service issues, your primary points of contact were in a very decentralized - we service in 50 locations, you basically had 50 points of contact, which obviously is suboptimal in terms of the service for a large national account.","So the basic strategic premise for doing this was to actually have a situation where you actually had, again, sort of a one call, one single point of contact for customer care, single point of contact for credit issues. ","And so, the whole reason strategically for doing this was around that. Part of the work that we did and the decisions in terms of why we chose to do things in the way that we did was again both to have a partner that would allow us to provide the technology support to enable that work, and again to restructure the team somewhat differently in a way that again it was really more focused around teams of this sort of single point of contact for customers.","So, I actually look at this as a very good strategic enhancement for our business both from the perspective of the ability to actually sell those customers and serve them in a different way and take care of their needs. ","But in addition to that, and again, I would say a little bit later down the line from a cost perspective. Obviously, there is some initial work required to invest in this model. Overtime, we do believe it will be a more efficient model, but that is the premise of what that was done for.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","Maybe for Kevin. When you think about the market share opportunity, right, particularly in those metro markets, what is your early thought on the structure and size of the sales organization, right? Do you think you need to step-up hiring of MAs in some of those areas? And then, distribution platform, do you think capital is required to put facilities in closer to some of those metro markets or it is really not a capital issue as much as it is maybe trucking equipment and scheduling?","Kevin Hourican","Yes. Thank you for the question, John. I would say, on the talent and people side, it is too premature for me to comment upon that, as Joel mentioned, just started with the company. And a big part of my on-boarding will be, what we call, listening tour, which is going out and talking to our MAs all throughout the country our sales associates to listen and to learn from them.","Some of the best most customer-centric ideas, innovations come from that front-line-associate. It could be the MA, it could be the driver that is been delivering to an account for many, many years in some instances at Sysco decades.","They have great ideas on how we can better serve the customers. So, I can't wait to get started in regards to traveling around the country and meeting our great associates, and learning from them on how we can best serve our customers.","So too premature to comment upon are there more or fewer overtime. You will hear more from us later in the year on our strategy and where we are headed in that regard. As it relates to supply chain solutions, this is my expertise by trade and by background.","We will do a thorough end-to-end network optimization review to determine number of facilities, optimization of which end points are stored from those facilities. The work we do there though will be thoughtful, and we will self-fund the work that we need to do.","We are not at this point communicating a need to increase capital investment. We can reduce cost and use that reduction in cost to fuel and fund the investments that we will make. That is our remit, that is our charter, and I know you are looking for specifics today. Those specifics will come in due time.","John Heinbockel","And then, Joel, maybe - I don't know, if you have an idea of how much lower your share is in these urban metro markets. I assume it is more than half what your overall share is, but any idea how much lower it is?","Joel Grade","It depends on the market as you can imagine. There is some that we are better penetrated than others. But I would say, generally it is - I would say, somewhat less than half would be the way I would think about that.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thanks.","Joel Grade","Yes.","Kevin Hourican","I just want to add one thing to that. I don't want the participants on the call to perceive that our singular whole step growth is through those metro markets. We have multiple vectors of growth. We just highlighted one of them as an example to answer a question earlier on in the call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse.","Judah Frommer","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back on kind of this decision to pull forward operating expense, and then what is going to effectively kind of limit the adjusted operating income growth over this three-year period. So, there are clearly some issues with operating expense and delivery on operating income growth both internationally and locally, whether it is labor in the U.S. or the consolidation in France. So, can you help us with the decision to pull forward and kind of layer on top of what seems to be going in fits and starts? And then, maybe more specifically, is a lot of this tied to the metro market share or are there other aspects you can highlight as well?","Joel Grade","Sure. So, a couple of points. Again, just as a - the general gist of the three-year plan to takedown, it was - as we talked about some of the things related to some of the margin, challenges and opportunities, the work - the integration work in France, some of the discrete expenses from a corporate perspective.","The investments in the business, the way I would actually characterize that and again, this falls into the category of the point I made literally toward the end of my prepared remarks, where we talked about the decision.","Would we just simply hold off on investments that we believe are really important in order to hit short-term goals or in order to accelerate some of those investments to continue to move forward on some of the things we believe are really important? And a little bit - and certainly we always have and always will choose the latter in that scenario.","So, the point Kevin made earlier, again, the metro example was just simply one idea or one point that was an example of some of the areas we are looking to accelerate. But the investment is really centered around a few key areas that I would probably highlight for you. It centers around these areas around accelerating work in our customer-facing technologies.","It centers around accelerating work in the technologies that support our salespeople and allow them to go to market, support our customers in the way that we think, again, certainly moves some of these things forward in an accelerated way.","They focus on areas what I would call simplification of our business in terms of the way that we interact with our suppliers, with our customers. They look at the way that we can actually accelerate.","And when I say cost savings, I look at cost from almost an end-to-end view in terms of both how we accelerate areas of cost of goods all to indirect spend, all of those types of things that some of the investments that we are making, we believe, will allow us to accelerate in each of those areas, again both due to simplifications as well as some of the enhancements again in technology. And then, so those are the way I would categorize some of the work in the investments.","And certainly, as we have talked about the need to continue to accelerate growth in this business, they need to leverage scale in a better way, they need to go-to-market in a way that enhances our ability to service this wider group of customers in a better way. I would characterize our investments as falling into that. And again - and frankly, we felt it is important to - they're important long-term investments that we thought were very much worth accelerating.","Judah Frommer","Okay. Maybe just a follow-up on that. Kevin, would you say you had a hand in kind of pulling forward these investments or are these kind of investments that have been now there beyond the current three-year plan that the Board is deciding to pull forward? And then, Joel, if you could just help us with modeling the EPS growth coming in, in line, any help on the interest expense or tax line would be great.","Kevin Hourican","Joel will start and then I'm going to do a follow-up close to what Joel covered.","Joel Grade","Yes. I mean, what I would say is that there is - it is a continuation of some degree of investments that have already been made, but an acceleration at work. So what I would say is - and again, I will let Kevin say this to you. I mean, I think Kevin, there is an alignment with the strategic approach we are taking.","But to say Kevin was one that directly said, hey, we would accelerate that would not be a fair statement. We certainly believe that as a leadership team that that was important work, again, supported by Kevin and by our Board. I will let you...","Kevin Hourican","I will build on. I will ask a question and answer, and it is - Kevin, are you aligned with the Sysco priorities and the investments that Joel just referred to are directly driving those key priorities? The answer to that is, yes, I am. The Company\u2019s number one priority is to be a customer-first culture, and I'm 100% aligned to that culture.","As I mentioned earlier, the best ideas, the most innovation - innovative solutions come by better understanding the needs of your customer and providing solutions that help you do better business with those customers. Joel referenced that. It is also our MA sales force, providing them with better tools to be able to be more effective at their roles. That is a part of this investment, and I'm 100% aligned with that.","The second one is our local transformation. And Joel talked about essentially a framework of capabilities that can then be deployed to match the needs of a local trade area. One of those happens to be metro, and that is customer on-boarding, I mentioned supply chain solutions and a customer ordering tool improvement. I'm aligned with all of those things.","And last but not least is business optimization. Joel talked about funding sources for growth by improving the manner with which we run our business. We have talked about leveraging our scale.","Leveraging our scale is, we should be the lowest cost operator in the business, and therefore then be able to pass upon to our customers savings tied to the efficiency improvements and also create sources for investing growth dollars. So, I am aligned with the priorities and I'm very supportive of the decision that was made.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Kevin, you have talked about traveling the country and meeting with associates and management across the organization. I'm just wondering, how long you think before you complete that initial review and maybe we get an update on the - what you see as the vision for Sysco and whether or not we would get another three-year guide or how you kind of think about the strategy of providing guidance to the Street?","Kevin Hourican","Yes. That is a great question, Jeffrey and thank you for it. I think most new CEO is coming in, there is a 90-day, 100-day plan and this listening tour will be a part of that. In addition by the way, it is doing very specific deep dives into the business while doing that. It is not just a listening tour, but the listening tour is a vital and important part of on-boarding. I think what I would say at this point in time is late summer is when you could expect to hear from us from an update perspective on where we are with our strategies. And more on that later, Neil will help manage and communicate in that regard.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it. And then, I know you mentioned in your - up to kind of three-year plan guidance chart within the slide deck you talked about continued disciplined approach to profitable growth with your national and SYGMA accounts, and this has been something we have been hearing for a little while now.","I'm just wondering as it relates to that, where do we stand on that? I mean, is that a process that you think is just something that we should expect to hear about for just ongoing, and therefore it is just every quarter every year that is kind of that? Or maybe is there kind of a short-term opportunity to pull that forward in order to no longer happen to be focused on pruning those national accounts?","Joel Grade","No. I mean I would think that - again, that is something I think you'll actually continue to hear us talk about. Actually we have talked about that consistently for actually many years in terms of how we view that. Again, those customers and the opportunity are really disciplined in how we grow.","I would say, the only thing I would maybe say is, I mean, what you are seeing in our SYGMA segment right now, which actually has a fairly acute decrease in the top line that was planned for and as part of this thing, again, that is probably a little stronger year-over-year than you may anticipate as we move forward. But I think, generally speaking, we will remain disciplined in this space.","It is an important area to us both strategically and in terms of covering fixed and providing opportunities for us to enter in service markets and outlying areas that may have that type of business that then allows us to have a great local business there as well. So, again, it is a strategically important part of the business, but nonetheless one that I think you'll continue to hear us talk about as one that we will be disciplined in terms of how we approach.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Understood. And then, lastly, I think, Joel, you mentioned something about bad debt expense. It sounds like you are making reference to an increasing of late. I'm just wondering if you could talk about where you are seeing that pressure from. We didn't get much color in terms of from a restaurant industry perspective whether you are talking about national chains or independents or maybe one or both of their operating environments becoming more difficult leading to the elevated bad debt expense?","Joel Grade","Yes. Here is how I would answer that. I mean, there is a little bit of both in terms of the market. I think, again, just one thing I would really emphasize here. There is no panic button being pushed for us in terms of the market itself. There is a bit of softness. We have had a few increased bankruptcies. ","And again, I would say, it is really both across the national and the local. I would say, the bigger impact though at this point certainly remains just continued challenges around the stabilization and implementation of some of the work that we did that really centralized credit activity in an area that used to be a very decentralized activity across our businesses.","And so, that is accelerated a bit over the last couple of quarters. We are certainly doing a lot of work to continue to stabilize that and certainly anticipate that happening. So, again, I would say, it is a little more self induced. But again, there is, I would say, a little softness certainly though not ready to push the panic button on the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Nolan with Piper Sandler.","Josh Nolan","Great. Thank you for taking the question. Wanted to circle back to the commentary around outsourcing the support. That was very helpful. Curious if that was more of a proactive decision or if this is feeding off of commentary you have received from your customers and your key members?","Joel Grade","Well, I would say, it is probably a little bit of both in the sense that obviously feedback from customers in terms of how we have serviced them over many years is that, hey, I would rather have a single point of contact.","Instead of calling 50 people, I would rather call one. I would rather have a team that knows my business well that can relate to me, again, both from a care perspective, from a credit perspective, et cetera, et cetera. So I would say, it is in response to customer feedback and how we can do a better job servicing.","But again, in that sense then, I would call it proactive in the way that is something that we believe that was an important investment, one that we again found both the right what we believe structure, partner and technology support in order to do that. It is still new.","We are still again moving into that, and it will continue to improve and evolve, but the team has done a great job of rolling that out. And so, again, I would call it proactive, but in response certainly to listen to our customers and feedback that we received from them over a number of years of doing business with us.","Josh Nolan","Great. That is very helpful context. And then, thinking about the international strategy, particularly in Europe, sounds like that is still a long-term growth opportunity for you. Can you talk about what you have learned with the integration process, particularly with the French businesses that you mentioned and kind of how that process is coming along?","Joel Grade","Sure. So, I think, a couple of areas that I would say thinking about how that business is integrating. It was two businesses that were acquired even prior to our acquisition of brakes. They were similar-sized businesses that we have then ultimately chosen to bring together.","And I would say, the two bigger challenges really are, what we call, a single delivery, meaning instead of customers getting delivered by both businesses are being delivered by one, and the technology to support that. And so, I think, in both cases, there has been challenges in making that happen.","On a positive note, doing some of that type of integration in France is often complex due to some of the labor and work councils and all that. And I think actually we have got through that part of it very well. But nonetheless, those challenges remain.","And then, some of the impact you have seen have been service levels that have been less than we would like them to be, which then has translated into gross profit dollar impact there. And then, what I will call dual running costs, meaning we have had to have some of those things where both businesses running longer than we would have liked them to have done.","So, I think, again, we are certainly - we have got a strong leadership team there. We have got lots of resources that we have dedicated both there and from here in order to enhance that. Some of the investments that we are talking about here as well fall into the category of how we accelerate the stabilization of that.","But as you said, again, we certainly are confident that we will get there. And certainly, as you pointed out believe that, again, this is a good long-term investment for us and, again, in a market that we certainly think will be one of the strongest ones that we have in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.","Kelly Bania","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering, maybe for Joel, the decision to kind of the less consensus two weeks ago and lower kind of the outlook today. Can you just help us understand that decision? You talked about some of the factors. I'm just trying to really understand how much was the quarter and how much really is these investments and certain opportunities that you talked about. And I think what people are trying to struggle with understanding today is, how many more investments really need to be made out there over the next couple of years?","Joel Grade","Sure. Let me start with the first. And what I would say is a couple of things. So, the timing of the announcement that was made on January 13th was obviously fairly early in both the processes of closing as well as the - how we got into the third quarter.","So I think one of the things that I would say, as we have evolved and certainly finished the closing process of this quarter as well as saw some of the results that we talked about as we moved into the third quarter, part of that was some of the reasons that you probably heard a little bit different tone from both of those things.","And so, I think, as we looked at some of the challenges that we talked about from a margin perspective that we continue to see fall into the third quarter. We took a look at some of the work that, again, was happening in this business in France as we talked about. And I'm certainly looking forward to see some continued challenges there.","And in addition to that, again, it was just some of the work that we talked about with some of the investments again, these aren't brand-new investments. They aren't things that we have never talked about doing. But certainly the opportunity to accelerate that growth - to accelerate as we build some momentum at the end of this year and head into the next year, we thought were very important in terms of how we did that.","And so, I would just say the combination, Kelly, of some of the kind of wrapping up of the quarter, seeing some of the way the third quarter was starting to play out in a number of different areas of the business, obviously some transition costs as well of the leadership change, and then thinking about how we actually spend that investment dollars moving forward.","The question is how much are continue to need to invest in this business. Look, I think, this has been, as I know you know, a multi-year journey of transformation because the reality of it is, is that this company, again even 10 years ago was a business that it was significantly decentralized in a way that we approach the marketplace.","If you think about the things that used to happen at a local operating level, where for the most part, I always joke about this a little bit, but pretty much only things they couldn't do or they couldn't give themselves a pay raise and then to report according to U.S. GAAP. Other than that, it was for the most part their business to run.","And so, when you think about the things that we have done in terms of how we standardize, how we leverage scale, the category management processes and the way that we go to market and set an assortment in a different way that is not just decided by every individual operating company, those type of transformations.","Again the latest one again we have talked about on this call things like finance technology roadmap, things like the centralized customer care, all those things are one step along the way to continue to drive a more leveraged efficient nimble organization that can go to market in a different way. And so, again, there is not necessarily sort of a beginning and an end point to that. I do believe this business will continue to invest in itself.","As we have talked about our top capital allocation priority is and has been, the ability to take the cash we generate and reinvest it in this business to continue to get better. And as Kevin said, as you have heard Ed talk about, our ability as the market leader to continue to leverage scale to drive the things that we can do and again go to market in a different way I think are important. And so, you should expect us to continue to invest in our business that way.","Kelly Bania","Okay. And then, maybe just one follow-up on the gross margin and the inflation impact. How much of that, just given that it does look relatively manageable on an overall basis, but obviously there is more happening, I think, in meat and dairy, but how much of that is just pure mechanics of the type of inflation and the environment you are seeing versus the execution of that either at the local or the chain side?","Joel Grade","Yes, it is a little bit of both. I mean, on the chain side again, it is actually a fairly mechanical process in the sense that as we have talked about before, there is - depending on the category, there is about a seven to 30-degree - 30-day lag in terms of when prices recalculate. So that one is a little more, I would call, mathematical and environment-driven. Obviously there is some market-driven and there is some execution as well on the local side.","Although as we have talked about, historically one of the areas that is actually really allowed us to do a better job of that certainly over the last few years is our revenue management function. That is been an area that we have leveraged well both in deflationary times and inflationary times.","And I certainly anticipate work that we have done and will continue to do in the rev man area will help us work through that. But we have also talked about the fact that in certain cases where inflation - and in certain categories, when inflation hits higher levels and escalates in a more rapid way that we still have some challenge in passing some of that along.","So, I think that is how I would frame it up. It is probably a little bit of all of that, but certainly something that I believe moving forward we will get a handle on. Again, our rev man function has certainly done a good job of helping us work through that over the number of years, and I anticipate that continuing to move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Summers with Buckingham.","Bob Summers","Good morning, guys. So, just help me understand of the operating income revision, which I think is really just what two more quarters, how much of that is being driven by this investment pull forward? And what I would really like to understand is, what is the run rate of that investment? How should I think about it as we bleed into 2021? And then, on the benefit side of the equation how are you thinking about the return on this, either through cost savings or bolting on acceleration and case volume growth? And when is that or when should we expect that?","Joel Grade","Sure. So, just starting with your first point on sort of the takedown. Again, we haven't broken out the specifics of those things, but just to reiterate again a couple of the key points. Again, there is a portion of it that is related to some of the challenges we have talked about both, again, as we kind of exit this quarter and enter the next one as it relates to some of the margin challenges.","Again, it is related to some of the challenges that we have talked about in France. Again, there are some discrete costs in corporate that, I would call, are unplanned things like the strike we had in Denver, things like that we have seen a bit of higher level, I will call, claims activity in terms of things like auto liability and workers' comp.","Some of those type of things that were part of - where you saw our corporate expenses elevate a bit obviously as well as some of the transition costs we talked about related to leadership. So those are things that are, again, some of the components to that as well as an investment.","Bob, I don't know that we are going to go and break down the detail of every one of those components. I would say, and the biggest ones really fall into the category of some of the point on the margins, the areas in France as well as the investments broadly speaking.","And I guess, from a run rate perspective, as I said, I don't know if we are going to go into that type of breakdown detail. What you should expect though as we head into our Investor Day and as we talk about, as Kevin on-boards as we talk about our ongoing strategic opportunities.","We certainly plan to go into more detail of that both in terms of how it impacts our growth, how it impacts the expenses and the ability to fund that growth through some of the efficiencies. So, certainly more to come on that. But I would say, again, those are the main categories of how to think about why the takedown happen?","Operator","Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Hi. Thank you. I think the comment was made that we shouldn't expect an increase in CapEx, so I just want to make sure that I heard that correctly. I guess, especially in the context of what may be in coming years kind of a broad need to modernize facilities really not just for you but across the industry, and also potentially the use of new facilities into smaller facilities to better penetrate some of the urban markets. So that is kind of the first point.","And secondly, is part of the plan or part of the thought at this point that you would enter new European countries or is kind of you are getting the current countries to your acceptable returns the priority in the near-term? Thanks.","Joel Grade","Yes. So let me take that one first and then I will go back to your other one. I think the answer on that is that certainly stabilization is the highest priority right now in terms of that. And then, again, maybe just to reiterate one thing, and then we talk about Europe is just one entity. Within that, again, three out of the four main countries we are in Europe are actually performing, what I would call, acceptably well.","And obviously the biggest challenge is in France. But from a priority standpoint there, definitely stabilization is our focus at this point in time. Certainly over the long-term, we will continue to look for opportunities to grow in that part of the world.","The CapEx piece, so look a couple of things I would say on that. As we have talked about actually over the last couple of years, we actually have accelerated, even heading into this year our CapEx level a bit.","In other words, we have been running in that 1.1%-ish range, somewhere in the 1.1%, 1.2%. As we talked about this year, we actually bumped that up a bit to 1.3% of sales for some of the investments we plan to make. And as we talked about a little bit earlier in the prepared remarks, we are actually running at that rate.","And so, I would say, on one hand, there is a bit of acceleration from the perspective of that, but that was talked about and it is where we are going. And so, I think Kevin's point was, we are not certainly saying what we are doing now at this moment in time.","There are going to be, I think, some increased potential investments. But as we also look at how we rationalize those things at the moment as a percentage of sales, I think you can think about fairly consistently how we have talked about as we are headed into this year we have talked about a bit of acceleration.","John Ivankoe","Okay. So more or less model 1.3 would be safe?","Joel Grade","I think that is fair.","John Ivankoe","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rebecca Scheuneman with Morningstar.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Good morning. So I would like to circle back to protein inflation. Given the global protein shortage that has resulted from African swine fever, it is likely to think that this protein inflation will continue for at least the next year. Are you beginning to like proactively work with your customers on some price increases or are you just kind of playing it by ear? They have been admittedly volatile, the prices. I'm just wondering what we should expect if there are possibly some further gross margin compression due to difficulties passing on this expected inflation? Thank you.","Joel Grade","Sure. Thanks for the question. So, I would, first of all, decouple a couple of these things a bit. The impact that we have seen from the African swine flu has actually been very minimal, I would say. And this is something we have taken questions on for some time. And again, that is not something I would say has been a sizable or even, again, just barely above minimal impact in terms of us.","I think the markets for Center of the Plate and beef do move around some. And I would say, again, we experienced a little bit more of acute inflation here in that category. I don't know that I would look right now though out a longer term and say, yes, there is some fundamental reason that there is going to be a highly inflationary Center of the Plate markets for any time to come of any real significance.","Here is what I would say though, just as a reminder, in terms of how we deal with some of those things and why - back to maybe your customer point, why this has been something actually we have historically been a strong partner for our customers. And obviously we have scale benefits that have allowed us to in any of these types of moments have access to products, have a traceability that obviously is deep and well appreciated by our customers, the availability of substitutes.","And so I think, the alternative products - and so, I think, if you think back a few years ago even when we had the issues with avian flu, one of the things that we were able to bring to our customers is simply the availability of product. And again, a traceability program that actually ensure that those are safe and in a way that they would expect.","So I guess, what I would say to summarize that all, again, decouple a little bit the African swine flu elements that has not been something that we have had a significant issue with. Some Center of the Plate challenges right now although again not necessarily looking at what I would call acute inflation in that area over the longer-term. But in the event of any of those things, I think the company is well positioned to manage through that stuff in a better way.","Operator","The next question comes from Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America Securities.","Marisa Sullivan","Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to circle back, Joel. I think you have referenced some challenges with the implementation of your finance transformation road map.","Joel Grade","Yes.","Marisa Sullivan","Just wondering, if you can give a little bit more color on that? And then, in the timeframe for working through those, and then as it relates to working capital and free cash flow, can you just comment on when or how quickly you might start to see improvements there? Thank you.","Joel Grade","Yes. Sure. So a couple of things. So think about the finance technology road map in our history, we would have had all of the finance-related functions, things like credit, things like cash app, accounts payable, general ledger, each of those types of areas that would actually have been in each individual operating units that over the last couple of years enabled by technology, we have moved many of those functions into a centralized place and, in some cases with an offshore partner as well.","And I think, what you are hearing us talk about here are challenges related specifically to local credit, where in the past each one of our operating units would have had a credit department responsible for credit and collections in each of their local markets.","And in today's world, it is certainly again through the uses of technology and a bit of different structure. We are just working through some of the bumps in terms of managing how to do that in a way that is more somewhat market, but also is much more centralized. And so, again, an interesting example on working capital of a process.","Accounts payable had some bumps along the way as well, and we had a little bit of a positive benefit, if you will, on working capital on that in our previous year. That process has actually stabilized and again in a strange way had a little bit of a negative impact on working capital in a sense that we paid our suppliers in a more efficient manner.","So, I would say that, in general, we certainly feel confident about our ability to stabilize that. We are certainly making the appropriate investments and leveraging the technology in order to do so, but there are some short-term bumps that we are having along the way. I actually certainly in some of my prepared comments talked about the fact that we anticipate some of this continuing to improve over the course of the year. And I certainly expect that to be the case.","The other point I would make, and just as a reminder, as part of the free cash flow is related to CapEx on a year-to-date basis. If you remember, at the end of our fiscal 2018 based on some opportunities presented by U.S. Tax Reform, we actually accelerated the process of investing in some fleets. That actually then allowed us to invest at a lesser rate at the beginning of our fiscal 2019.","So, where we have gotten back to, what I will call, a more normalized capital spend as it relates to fleet, the year-over-year comparison certainly for the first half of the year and again this will level out a little bit as the year goes by, looks worse, particularly due to that factor. So, again, all that to say, I do think we will see some improvement in this area in the second half and certainly over the long-term, I feel good about where we are at.","Marisa Sullivan","And then, just very quickly, I'm wondering if you can give any comments about the current trends you are seeing with independent restaurants. You saw a nice acceleration in your local case growth this quarter, and I'm just wondering if you expect this to continue in the third quarter or if you can comment on quarter-to-date trends. Thanks.","Joel Grade","Yes. I think, look, a couple of things. I mean, I think the team did a great job, we talked about actually a favorable exit rate from the first quarter. That continued to accelerate over the course of this quarter, particularly in our local business, and I would say particularly in the area of account penetration.","So, what this was not was just kind of going out and just - people often ask where did the growth come from? And it wasn't so much in the area of new customers, but is an area that actually as we have talked about is best for us in that further account penetration.","The market itself, I would say, is kind of where it has been. I think it is in a decent place. There is sort of lots of reports that move around from time to time. And the check size has generally seemed to be continuing to elevate. Traffic seems to be flattish.","You say it is up a little, you say it is down a little. But I would generally say the market is in an OK place, probably similar to what it has been. But I think, again, certainly a lot of good work by our teams in the U.S. to drive a strong level of growth, again certainly in the independent space, and we anticipate some of those trends continuing as well.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference.

Just search for Sysco IR app to have easy access on the go to all of our filings and important investor material.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.","William J. DeLaney","Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales and net earnings for the fiscal year of $42.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Earnings per share was $1.90. Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per share for our underlying business was $2.13, representing a 4.4% increase year-over-year. Sales grew 7.8% for the year as case volume growth of 3% and product cost inflation of 5.5% contributed to the highest annual sales level in our history.","Earnings growth was not as strong as pricing pressures resulted in only modest gross profit dollar gains. However, we did experience improved expense management in the fourth quarter and expect to continue that trend in the new fiscal year.","Cash flow from operations approximated $1.4 billion, a significant improvement over our performance in the prior year. On the capital investment front, we recently completed construction and began shipping from 3 new and more efficient distribution facilities, a 420,000-square-foot facility outside of Boston, a second 420,000-square-foot facility located between Austin and San Antonio and a 240,000-square-foot facility on Long Island. All 3 of these operating companies are located in large markets that provide tremendous growth opportunities for Sysco.","Looking forward, we remain totally committed to profitably growing our business in the $225 billion market that we serve today. While industry growth is expected to remain modest, we are highly focused on strengthening and expanding our customer relationships, as well as reducing the cost structure of our underlying business. To do so requires transformational change in all aspects of our business.","Successfully deploying a new and enhanced technology platform is a foundational component of such change, and we continue to progress on that front. Specifically, we recently converted our East Texas operating company to our new ERP system in late July, our third location to go live. We are pursuing a market-based approach for our rollout schedule, which we believe will enhance the conversion process in 2 key ways: First, we have more -- we will more effectively leverage our market leadership team; and second, the close geographic proximity of the operating companies will permit us to utilize all of our resources in a more flexible and efficient manner. As a result, our next 5 planned conversions will be facilities in Texas and Louisiana, all of which are expected to occur this fiscal year.","As conversions have occurred, we have become increasingly encouraged with the ramp-up in services provided and the quality of service at our Shared Business Services center, or SBS, here in Texas. SBS is staffed and effectively supporting our 3 converted companies with multiple centralized functions, including financial support, replenishment, national account pricing and a customer support call center.","We have also begun to make progress on our key business transformation cost reduction initiatives. These initiatives focus on improving productivity in our operations, selling and administrative areas, as well as lowering product costs. For example, each of our Broadline operating companies has already taken action in a variety of areas and begun to implement processes designed to enhance productivity in delivery and warehouse operations.","On the SG&A side, after careful and thoughtful analysis, we have elected to restructure our domestic nonunion retirement programs. Specifically, effective December 31, we will significantly enhance our 401(k) plan and freeze our nonunion-defined benefit pension plan. The enhanced 401(k) plan will provide benefits to our associates that are highly competitive in the marketplace in a manner that results in meaningful cost savings to Sysco over time. Chris will discuss the financial savings in a moment.","On the product side, we are moving forward with developing our category management process, including preparing to pilot several food categories.","Returning value to our shareholders remains a top priority for Sysco. We recognize that our dividend represents a significant component of Sysco's shareholder return, especially as we navigate through the transformational changes I noted earlier. Accordingly, we increased our dividend during this past year, the 42nd time since our founding in 1970. In total, we distributed $623 million in dividends to shareholders during fiscal 2012.","Looking back on 2012, it was clearly a year of transition for Sysco. While fiscal 2013 will undoubtedly provide its share of challenges, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead to profitably grow our core business and expand beyond the core over time.","In closing, I want to thank all of our associates for their efforts this past year in supporting our customers. Their contributions going forward are critical to fully realizing Sysco's vision to become our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.","Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.","Robert C. Kreidler","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, sales were $11 billion or an increase of 5.9% compared to the prior year, driven equally by case volume growth of 3.4% and food cost inflation of 3.3%. Excluding acquisition, case volume increased 3.3%.","In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.6% and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.5%. During fiscal 2012, we completed 9 acquisitions, representing nearly $270 million in annualized sales and met our goal of increasing sales by 0.5% to 1% through acquisitions. Nearly 20% of our new case growth came from acquisitions in fiscal 2012. We have a number of additional acquisitions at various stages of completion in our pipeline and are targeting to increase sales in excess of 1% through acquisitions in fiscal 2013.","Gross profit in the fourth quarter continued to be pressured by an intensely competitive market. Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased 2.9%, but gross margin decreased 54 basis points year-over-year to 18.2%. Fuel surcharges provided no benefits to year-over-year comparison as surcharges were comparable in both periods.","Gross margins have historically increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, but we broke that trend in the fourth quarter of 2011. We are encouraged the gross margin increased 39 basis points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, which is more in line with historic trends.","Operating expenses increased $103 million or 7.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period. This increase included $23 million in certain charges that were mainly related to the withdrawal of one of our operating companies from a multi-employer pension plan or MEPP. Excluding these certain charges, operating expenses increased $80 million or 5.7%.","Operating expenses were also impacted by a $38 million increase in gross business transformation expense and a $20 million increase in salaries and related costs. Operating income decreased $45 million or 8.1% driven by a decrease in gross margin, partially offset with gains in case volume. Excluding the certain items that I mentioned previously, operating income decreased 4%.","Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $309 million, a decrease of $27 million or 8% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.53, a 7% decline compared to the prior year. Excluding certain items, diluted EPS was $0.55.","As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes certain items but also excludes business transformation expenses and the impact of COLI. As a reminder, COLI had a minimal positive impact on our results in fiscal 2012 but had a significantly more positive impact in fiscal 2011.","","Adjusted operating expenses, which excludes these items and better reflects our underlying business performance, increased 3.3%; and adjusted operating income increased 2.2%. Net earnings on this basis grew 3.7% to $367 million and EPS grew 3.3% to $0.62.","Turning to the year-over-year comparison. Sales increased 7.8% or $3.1 million, due mainly to inflation of 5.5% and case growth of 3%. Food cost inflation declined steadily throughout the year from 7.3% in the first quarter to 3.3% in the fourth quarter. Excluding acquisitions, case volume grew 2.5% for the year. In addition, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.7%, and changes in foreign exchange rates did not have a meaningful impact.","Gross profit increased 3.8% during the year while gross margin decreased 69 basis points year-over-year to 18.1%. The decline in gross margin was due to high inflation combined with weak restaurant traffic, competitive pressures, segment mix and a more aggressive go-to-market strategy.","Operating expenses increased $323 million or 5.9% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Operating expenses for both years were impacted by certain items primarily consisting of MEPP withdrawals. In fiscal 2012, these certain items were approximately $13 million lower compared to the prior year. Excluding these certain items, operating expenses increased 6.2%.","Operating expenses also included $147 million increase in salaries and related costs due to increases in delivery and sales compensation, increased volume in acquisitions, a $91 million increase in gross business transformation expenses and a $40 million increase in fuel expense. These increases were partially offset by a $27 million decline in corporate-sponsored pension plan expense.","Cost per case in our Broadline Companies was up $0.04 year-over-year. This was mainly due to increased delivery costs, including a $0.02 increase related to an increase in fuel price. Operating income declined $41 million or 2.1% for the fiscal year. Excluding certain items, operating income declined 2.7%.","Net earnings for fiscal 2012 decreased $30 million or 2.6% compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2012 EPS was $1.90, a decline of 3.1%. Excluding certain items, EPS was $1.93.","To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 4.1%, adjusted operating income increased 3%, adjusted net earnings grew 4.7% and adjusted EPS grew 4.4% to $2.13.","Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, gross project expenses totaled $70 million, and we capitalized $23 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter, gross project expenses totaled $33 million, and we capitalized $49 million related to the project.","For fiscal 2012, expenses for business transformation are $193 million compared to $103 million in fiscal 2011, and total capitalized amounts were $146 million compared to $196 million in the prior year.","As we discussed during our Investor Day, we expect cash flows to improve significantly over the next several years due to our business transformation initiative and improved working capital management. Cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2012 was $1.4 billion an approximately $300 million or 29% increase compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. This improvement was due mainly to improved working capital management and lower tax payments during the year.","Working capital has improved year-to-date due mainly to smaller increases in accounts receivable and inventories this year compared to the prior year. This is due to improvements in DSOs for receivables and inventory, partially offset by a decline in accounts payable DSOs.","Of note, we paid our final IRS tax settlement payment during the fourth quarter for a total of $212 million during this fiscal year and $952 million over the last 3 years. The completion of these settlement payments will have a significant positive impact on our cash flows in future periods.","Capital expenditures totaled $152 million for the fourth quarter and $785 million for the fiscal year. We had 4 new facility projects during the year, including the facilities Bill discussed earlier, which were completed during the year, as well as a new facility under construction in California that we expect to be complete late this fiscal year. This is compared to having only one such major project underway in the prior year.","In addition, capital expenditures related to our Business Transformation Project increased by $50 million year-over-year.","Free cash flow increased 36% or $165 million to $620 million. During the quarter, we accessed the capital markets with very attractive rates, completing a bond offering of $750 million. The transaction was completed in 2 tranches, $300 million of 3-year securities at 65 basis points, the lowest rate ever achieved for a 3-year deal at the time and $450 million of 10-year notes at 2.6%. The effective rate for the entire issuance was around 2%, a continual reminder of the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows.","Before closing, there are few guidance metrics for fiscal 2013 that I'd like to provide. First, based upon current market conditions and external forecasts, we expect fuel expense to be relatively flat year-over-year; second, regarding business transformation. As we shared with you at our Investor Day, we expect gross business transformation expenses, net of direct benefits related to SBS, to be approximately $300 million to $350 million for the year, including the amortization of project costs.","As Bill mentioned, we are now in the deployment phase of our new ERP system. And so this month, we began to amortize the capitalized costs related to the development of this system over a roughly 7-year period. The majority of work occurring going forward is expected to relate mostly to conversion and training, which is expensed for accounting purposes. As a result, you'll see a decline in the amount of capitalized spend on our Business Transformation Project going forward. This year, we expect to capitalize roughly $5 million to $20 million, which is $130 million to $140 million lower than our capital spend for fiscal 2012.","As we outlined at our Investor Day, we expect that we'll achieve $550 million to $650 million in annualized benefits from business transformation by fiscal 2015, of which we expect to achieve roughly 25% in fiscal 2013. As Bill said earlier, we have begun to make progress on all of our key business transformation initiatives.","Third, total CapEx for fiscal year 2013 is expected to be approximately $600 million to $650 million, which is substantially lower than the $785 million we spent in fiscal 2012.","Lastly, I want to address pension expense for fiscal 2013. As we were developing our 2013 financial plan, we learned that we were facing more than $100 million in additional pension expense for next year, primarily driven by continuous declines in interest rates. This substantial increase would have been in addition to the significant increases in 2 of the last 3 years. We determined we needed to carefully review our retirement programs.","As a result of our analysis, as Bill discussed earlier, we announced this morning that we made the decision to freeze our defined benefit pension plan effective December 31 and simultaneously enhance benefits to employees under our 401(k) or defined contribution plan. The net impact of these changes will result in the roughly $25 million in additional retirement expense in fiscal 2013. While still an increase, this represents a more than $80 million cost avoidance.","It's important to note that the net impact of these changes in our retirement plans will not be even across the quarters during the year. Retirement plan expense in the second half of the year will be higher than the first half. Because these changes become effective at the midpoint of fiscal 2013, we estimate that our retirement plan expenses will be lower in 2014.","In closing, while fiscal year 2012 was a year of transition, we continue to stay focused on our future. Fiscal 2013 will be another critical year for us as we work through the first round of ERP deployment and begin to realize benefits from several areas of our business transformation plan. Sysco has been a leader in the industry for over 40 years; and while the change we are undergoing is difficult and requires a substantial investment, it is important to the future success of this company. All of us here at Sysco are focused on transforming the company and believe that this will enable us to further strengthen our financial results over time and enhance our industry leadership position.","With that, operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","It's actually Steve Forbes on for John today. Just a couple quick questions. The sequential improvement in gross margin this quarter, is that tied to getting more pricing through or a conscious effort to pull back on some promotional spending?","William J. DeLaney","I think, Steve, it's just some modest improvement on our part in terms of execution. As Chris pointed out in his comments, there's a seasonal flow that we tend to participate in as you go into the summer, and I think that helped as well. So I think we're executing somewhat better. I don't think there's anything dramatically different in terms of the promotional spending.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And now when it comes to the inflation and pricing for next year, how do you keep your marketing associates focused on gross profit dollar growth and\/or case growth?","William J. DeLaney","Well, the way our commission program works, the bulk of our marketing associates are paid on commission, and the biggest factor in that commission is gross profit dollars per delivery. So we continue to tweak that particular model as time goes on to do just what you're suggesting here, which is to keep us focused on growth and quality growth. But the bottom line is they're highly incentivized to service our customers well, but at the same time to strike the right balance between sales and gross profit dollars.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly on case growth. Did you see any change from June to July in case volume growth, I guess, after what some of the restaurant operators reported last week?","William J. DeLaney","We don't comment on inter-quarter type of developments, but I would tell you that certainly, we service pretty much the whole spectrum of the marketplace, and you can see that we saw somewhat of a slowdown in the fourth quarter. Pricing eased a little bit as well, which was good, I think, but at the same time, our top line fell off some, and I think we're going to experience, to some degree, what you're seeing from some of the other people in the space.","Operator","And our next question will come from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Alvin Concepcion for Greg. Just wanted to ask another question related to the margin, gross margin. Sounds like there hasn't been much of a change in the promotional spending. What's your outlook on promotional spending in fiscal '13? And would you expect a year-over-year improvement in gross margin next year?","William J. DeLaney","Okay. Maybe I should take a minute and let's talk about promotional spending because that's 2 questions right off the bat. As far as I know, we don't really talk about promotional spending. So the bottom line is we do promote -- we have various marketing vehicles that we promote locally and to some extent here at corporate. That hasn't changed to any large extent over the last quarter, over the last year. I think as we've talked about margin pressure over the last 12 to 18 months, we've attributed a lot of that to the challenges of passing along mid to high single-digit rates of inflation in a marketplace that's still pretty fragile and just kind of an uneven business recovery on top of that. So I think -- I don't think this really has much to do with promotional spending. The bottom line is we're out there competing. We feel very appropriately and very aggressively in a pretty challenging marketplace. And we saw improvement, as you saw, and pointed out in the fourth quarter and certainly as we talked about in May, we expect to continue to improve those trends. But I don't believe that we've indicated in any way that we would expect to be over last year's gross profit.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I see. And on the promotional spending front again, I mean, that's from your end, what about from the competitive standpoint? Are you seeing any changes there relative to last quarter?","William J. DeLaney","I'm sorry, could you repeat that question?","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I'm just wondering if the competitive promotional environment has changed very much relative to last quarter.","William J. DeLaney","I don't think so. Again, I'm going to just attribute that to kind of the competitive environment. And we see different things in different parts of the country, and frankly, we see different behavior with different types of competitors. As you know, we deal with very large regional, national-type competitors, and then there's a lot of niche players as well. So I have to tell you that the environment remains very challenging from a competitive standpoint, and we expect it to continue that way. But I wouldn't say it's changed a whole lot.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then the case volume growth in the quarter, it accelerated relative to last quarter, and obviously, I think you mentioned that you might see some more -- the weak restaurant traffic impact your results. I mean, can you talk about what some of the drivers were in the quarter in that accelerated improvement in case volumes?","William J. DeLaney","Well, I think in this particular quarter, I don't know if there's anything particularly different than any other quarter. We're highly focused, as we've talked about at length over the last several calls and in our public presentations, on the importance for Sysco as a leader in the industry to continue to take share and to do that profitably. But we've got 8,000 marketing associates out there on the street. We've got a strong sales management team. We have great leadership throughout the country and in Canada, and we work very hard in staying close to our customers. All the basic things that we talk about every time we have an opportunity to speak publicly from menu analysis to good quality business reviews to a very focused time with our salespeople spending with their customers. Those are things that we feel we do better, by and large, than our competition. And as a result, that allows us to grow the business. So with that said, still very competitive and we still have some opportunity to work on our pricing and margin management.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Ed Kelly with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can I just start on the volume side, that 3.3% case volume growth. Can you talk about how that compares to sort of like the true underlying trend, and what I'm getting at is, an easy comparison this quarter versus last year. Did that play a role? Does weather and calendar play any role in this? And just, could you just give us a sense as to where you think the true business is running sort of underlying all that today? Is it really that level?","William J. DeLaney","Well, yes, it is at that level. We'll take credit for it. I think going to your point, as you go back and look at the latter part of last fiscal year, maybe even the first quarter this year, the volume trends were a little bit more modest. And frankly, that led to us becoming more aggressive as we've talked about here in the last 2 or 3 quarters. So I would tell you that yes, we grew the cases 3%. Part of that was acquisitions, which we feel is a big part of our arsenal. And I wouldn't overweight comparisons when you're talking about the difference of 1% maybe from 1 year to the next, that type of thing. So we feel good with the volume, and we'll take credit for it.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And it sounds like, and I don't want to put words in your mouth, Bill, but it sounds like so far in the current quarter, things, just generally speaking, haven't been great but maybe haven't gotten worse. Is that how I should read that?","William J. DeLaney","Things are always great here at Sysco. But no, look, the market, what I'm trying to tell you here without getting into a disclosure area that I can't, is that we're going to participate in what goes on in the market. So I expect us to continue to grow cases. I expect us to take share and to some extent, as we've talked about in terms of our medium to longer-term outlook, we are going to be impacted by the market itself. So to the extent that we see a slowdown as this quarter proceeds, I'm sure we'll feel that to some degree.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on gross profit dollar growth relative to case growth, this was another quarter where it was slightly less, and I know that's not your long-term goal. So could you maybe just walk through a little bit what was the driver there? And then how long do you think it takes to get us to the point where gross profit dollars maybe are doing a little bit better than volumes again?","William J. DeLaney","Well, we need to get there. It's the bottom line. It's a very fair question. So the way I look at it is we did better in the fourth quarter than we did in the third in terms of that particular relationship but not good enough. So we need to continue, as I mentioned a question or 2 ago, to strike a better balance between the case growth and the gross profit dollars. So I'm encouraged that we saw some modest improvement but there's a ways to go. And all I can tell you is that we're highly focused on it here as a management team and throughout the country, into our sales management and into our sales force. So it's a delicate balance in terms of the economy and the marketplace and trying to be responsive to the needs of our customers, but we certainly see that as an issue and an opportunity for improvement.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the MEPP side, maybe could you give us a little bit more color on the charge this quarter? And then within your 10-K last year, you disclosed about a couple hundred million dollar withdrawal liability. And I'm just curious as to how that's calculated. Is that your actuarial value of the underfunding? And could you also give us some sense as to what you think the fair value of the underfunding might be at this point?","Robert C. Kreidler","That question just got worse and worse.","William J. DeLaney","Time for Chris to answer a question there.","Robert C. Kreidler","Started off I said, I can do this one and then you just took it down the rabbit hole. Let me see if I can help. The charge this quarter was related to Cleveland. So 220 employees at our Cleveland operating company withdrew from the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters plan, and therefore we recorded a withdrawal liability of approximately $17 million. We did have some liabilities earlier in the year that were basically true-ups of prior year withdrawals. And the way that works is you have to record the liability at the value that you know when the withdrawal was actually made. But then, each quarter thereafter there are going to be true-ups until you actually are allowed to withdraw from that particular plan, which can be 1.5 years later. So I think that's the first part of your question. The second part, we've generally recorded in our 10-K roughly $200 million of liability. I wouldn't call that an actuarial. That is basically our assessment of the materials that we get from those plan trustees about the status of their plans. We don't manage those plans, we just get materials. And unfortunately, it takes a long time for us to get those materials. We're still stating that liability based upon materials that are as old as year-end 2009 to 2010, so they're just not given to us very timely. And the 10-K that you'll see in a couple of weeks, we'll update that number, which is just, as we described it, it's the total withdrawal or the potential liability if we withdrew from all the plans, which is, of course, not something we would ever foresee doing. But then under new guidelines, we're required to put down a number that we believe is related to plans from which we would reasonably, possibly, either voluntarily withdraw or there would be a mass withdrawal. That number is about half that $200 million. It's about $100 million. Did that get close to answering your question?","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I think. And I think when your K comes out, we'll probably be able to do more work on that as well. Another question for you on the national account pricing. I don't -- I'm not sure if I heard this correctly, but it sounded to me like you had suggested that pricing would be moving to the SBS level. Is that right?","William J. DeLaney","No, not the negotiation of pricing or the relationships. We handle our contract customers in various ways, but we have a significant group that works out of the corporate office that covers what we call corporate multiunit, and then we obviously have regional and local chains that we tend to handle those relationships locally through the operating companies. What's going on at SBS is more just the facilitation of the processes themselves.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And one last question for you here. Your CapEx guidance, I think, was a little bit higher today than at the analyst meeting. And then related to that, with the IRS payment being done, you should start generating some free cash flow again. So the question is, what do you guys plan on doing with that free cash flow?","Robert C. Kreidler","The CapEx actually is in line with what we talked about at Investor Day. You're focused on the $600 million that I showed at Investor Day, but right underneath that was a line for business transformation capitalization, which was a range of $5 million to $20 million. So depending on where you are in that range, we just put a range around CapEx, $600 million to $650 million. Nothing has really changed in the assumptions that we're using for this year. We just put a range around it so I think it's generally in line with what we talked about. We do intend to generate additional free cash flow this year. We've not changed our posture with regards to how we view our cash. We're reinvesting into the business. We're certainly making sure that we can have a substantial and growing dividend, and we're looking for additional acquisitions as much as possible. If we start to generate significant additional free cash, we'll take a look, again, at the shares. But right now, that's just not the case.","Operator","And the next question comes from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","On the -- I wanted to ask, did the lower rates of inflation, did that help with the gross margin management? I know you said, sounded like you're just getting a little more acumen with managing it. But I just want to -- in relation to lower inflation, did that help? Do you think a lower inflation had any effect on the case growth?","William J. DeLaney","Andy, I'll start there. Sure, it helps. I mean, as we've talked over the last 2 or 3 quarters, there's a certain math to this whole inflation discussion. So when you go from 5.5% to 3.5%, give or take, that definitely helps. And it goes category by category, that type of thing. So there's no doubt that, that contributed to it, as well as I do think we executed, as I said, modestly better and there's plenty of room for improvement there. I think as far as case growth, I don't know that, that happens quite as fast. I know there's kind of this analytical way of looking at it. The key for us, I think, as it relates to the inflation is over the medium to long term, we've been very consistent on this and we truly believe it is that it's just better for our customers and our customers' customers if we can see a more moderate level of say 2 to 3 points of inflation over time. That's just a better environment for business, and whether it be our customers or ourselves. And so I think, if we can stay there and be relatively consistent and not have too much volatility in the respective categories, I think that's more of a medium-term benefit for us.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. On the case growth getting better, how do you -- how do we look at that or how do you look at that? Was any of that improvement or at same customers? Or was it really mainly new customers and really taking market share in that way?","William J. DeLaney","It's a combination of 3 things. We continue to improve our customer retention. That's had a lot of focus here, and we've talked about it somewhat publicly. So our customer retention numbers have improved over the last year or 2 and that certainly helps. We have seen penetration. That's obviously going to vary by customer and be somewhat dependent on how healthy their business is, but overall, we've seen some case penetration. And yes, largely or not largely, but we tend to do a good job on new business as well. So it comes from the 2 that you mentioned, which is new business as well as penetration. But also, again, just an environment like this, we just need to stay closer and closer to our customers and just minimize lost accounts.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. Are you willing to say if it's more one than the other?","William J. DeLaney","I'd be willing to say if I knew. I mean, it's actually -- it's hard to kind of get precise information on that, but I actually think it's a little bit of all 3, Andy.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Fair enough. My last question is back to the pension freeze. I had to drop off the call for a second. Could you just give the swing, what this year's swing for that? I think you gave the numbers in --  or the numbers that get us to the math, either way.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes. And actually, I think, we flashed the chart on the screen as we were going through it. But the net-net is an increase of about $25 million for this year, and it would have gone up over $100 million save for the freeze and then we expect it to be lower in '14.","William J. DeLaney","I think there's a broader issue here, though, Andy. And obviously, this is a very sensitive issue internally and it's just being announced today, clearly, throughout Sysco. So we've been looking at this for a period of time, and the reality is as growth has slowed industry-wise and even for Sysco, we've continued to see the liability of the pension plan grow meaningfully faster than the business is growing. So the broader picture here is that we needed to address that in a prudent way, and we feel that we have and we feel, as we communicate the new planned structure with the 401(k), I think our folks will find that it's a very competitive plan and provides a lot of opportunity to appropriately save for retirement.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Absolutely. I mean, you definitely were one of the last companies with a generous pension plan. I just wanted to ask us one last thing about that, then I'm going to drop off, is from my understanding of these plans is they have different vesting, 20, 25 years and so on. And obviously, that helps to keep senior management in place. What's going to happen with those provisions? Are those also frozen, or does the vesting continue just with no more increased contribution?","William J. DeLaney","Which plans are you talking about, Andy?","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So your plans are fully vested without relation to time of service?","Robert C. Kreidler","No, the pension plan you do vest over time in the pension plan. What we're doing is we're freezing the pension plan. Whatever benefits you have today, you retain. All of your new benefits will come from a 401(k) defined contribution plan going forward. So upon retirement, what you'll have is the vested benefits in your pension from the date at which we froze it plus your defined contribution benefit that grew from that point going forward.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Yes. So if somebody's a year away from the hurdle for vesting, next year it'll vest, it'll just be on today's amount.","William J. DeLaney","That's correct. And just a point of interest, I mean, our plans, I don't have the specifics but our vesting tends to be pretty much 100% within 5 or 7 years, something like that. So you vest relatively quickly here. So most of our people are vested, and then it will work like you say. And then what we'll be doing over the next few weeks is communicating the components of the 401(k) plan and so on and so forth.","Operator","And the next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I recall you guys saying in the past that 1% to 2% inflation is a sweet spot for you, and it appears like we're heading there. And I guess, my question is why won't your gross margins be up in 2013 if that happens if we hit your sweet spot? Or are gross margins going to keep going down regardless of the level of inflation because of the broader industry conditions?","William J. DeLaney","Well, obviously, Michael, we don't have the answers to those questions. Those are great questions. I would tell you, we've had now 1 quarter of 3% inflation, and it looks like this quarter's starting now in a similar way. So I mean, I think we will see some moderate inflation for a period of time. We're not clear on how long that'll stabilize given what's going on with the droughts and various things around the world. So I think we need to wait and see to some extent how this thing plays out here over the next 6, 9, 12 months. What I said and what I do believe is, I think, the lower inflation will take some pressure off of our customers, and that will take some pressure off of us, so that should support some of the initiatives we have to strike the right balance between growth and margins. But the other thing I'm saying is what I also said pretty consistently is this is different than 2 years ago or 4 years ago or 5 years ago. Until this economy shows more consistent improvement and until our customers participate in that, there's going to continue to be a lot of pricing pressure out there. So I'm not saying that we can't improve our margins over time, I'm just saying we need to take it one step at a time and right now, our goals are -- is to reverse the trends that we saw this past year.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the spike in grain that you alluded to, I mean, what kind of a lag before something like that will hit your P&L? And when it does, whether it's a quarter from now or 2 quarters from now, whatever the right answer is there, should we expect that the pace of gross margin declines to accelerate again as we get into the heart of 2013?","William J. DeLaney","I don't know. I wish I did know and I wish I could give you more specific answers there. But typically, what happens is it takes a while for it to work itself through the food chain, into the meal for the cattle and the poultry and all that, so works its way through the feedstock and then into our cost of center of play items. And I would expect that, that will take 3 to 6 months at least for us to see that play out. And we'll just have to see how the business climate is in general. So we're not hiding behind that. We would love to see a nice, stable inflation environment but I'm just pointing out that we could see some pressure on pricing here later in the year. That's all.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And kind of switching gears, another thing, you had mentioned that in 2013 that acquisitions would drive over 1% to sales. That actually hasn't happened in 7 years, and so I thought that was interesting. I was curious if there was one specific acquisition of size that's in the pipeline that you're thinking about? Or if it's reflective of a bunch of smaller deals? And if it's one of size, is it in the U.S. or international? Is it a traditional competitor or somehow tangential? Just kind of a better idea as to where you guys are going on the acquisition side would be great.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, what we continue to talk about on the acquisition side is a string, as many as possible, of these smaller transactions that are, in combination, become meaningful to us, so that's what we said. We did 9 transactions for $270 million. Actually, I think, last year, we were above 1%. I'd have to go back and check my numbers, but I thought we were just above 1%. But our goal has been 0.5 to 1 point. What we're really pointing out is we're starting to accelerate that and we're starting to increase our pipeline. Our goal this year is north of 1% through a combination of these smaller-ish transactions. I don't want to characterize them as being small and meaningless. They're not at all. Every one of them is important to us, but they're smaller than the $500 million or $600 million regional-sized transactions that we'd love to get, but are just frankly very, very difficult to get and they don't come along very often.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then lastly on these changes to the retirement plans. Just simplistically, is your pension expense no longer going to move with interest rates as we look forward? If -- I mean, just so I understand when you say a freeze, I mean, is that -- are interest rates no longer relevant for you?","Robert C. Kreidler","No, they're very relevant to us. We still have a $1 billion-plus pension plan that's out there that has to be revalued every year. What the freeze does is it stops growing in terms of the assets and the liabilities, so that's [indiscernible] the growth of it will now cease. The next step in managing our retirement plans is starting to go after the volatility of those assets, and we do have more work going on in that area as well. But as Bill said, this is something we've been looking at for a while. Pension expense has been going up significantly over the last few years. It was growing at a rate that was just frankly not sustainable, and so we needed to come up with a different set of plans that would be beneficial to our employees and to help with retention of our employees and help them plan for their retirements, while at the same time not causing our expenses to grow at a rate that's frankly our earnings could not sustain. So we've looked at a number of things. Step one is we've got to freeze what's there. Now we've got to go about looking at how we reduce the volatility of the liabilities that still exist on the balance sheet.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And are you guys still then at this point looking at what your assumptions are for your existing exposure? And how conservative do you feel like those assumptions are at this point given how long interest rates have stayed low and returns have stayed low?","Robert C. Kreidler","Well, so there are 2 separate components to figuring out the pension expense. Obviously, the first one is discount rate, which we unfortunately have nothing to do with. Interest rates drive down the discount rate. It's declined even more this year from a rate that I didn't think it could even decline from last year, so that cost us a tremendous amount of valuation and was driving our interest -- or driving our pension expense to be significantly higher for '13. The second component is the discount rate that you -- or sorry, the return that you assume on the portfolio. We evaluate that every year. You look at 70 years' worth of history on a portfolio of assets that you invest in. Obviously, the last 10 years are not good compared to that 70-year history, and so we're constantly evaluating, are we too aggressive? Are we too conservative? That's something we evaluate every year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If you look at the gross margin rate, I was curious how your new business wins look versus the existing book on the gross profit rate.","William J. DeLaney","Great question, Mark. It's another one of those ones that when you have as much new business as we have, I mean, you're talking about double-digit new business, it's hard to critique that, but I would say it's a mixture. Generally, the new business, as it comes these days, comes a little bit harder and a little bit more competitively. So I don't have a lot of data on that in terms of the entire company. But more than likely, it probably comes in a little bit less than the average would be my best judgment on that.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And as we look at the business transformation savings as they come in, what kind of timing should we expect on that? Is this something that builds throughout the year? Or do you expect any quarters bigger than others?","Robert C. Kreidler","We've not given any quarterly breakout of that, but I think it would be fairly safe to assume it will build over time. Just as it's going to build over the 3-year period, it's going to build during each of those 3 years.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on the inflation, what is your protein team saying? It seems like there's a pretty good chance you're going to be looking at much higher inflation next year. I'm curious what your thoughts are there.","William J. DeLaney","Well, we're seeing higher prices now in beef and poultry. And we're seeing deflation actually in dairy and produce right now, and then everything else is kind of around the average. So they're pretty much saying what we're reading and what I tried to say earlier, which is that we should expect to see some pressure as the year goes along.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Yes, I just wanted to get some more color on your outlook, your near-term outlook for ERP in fiscal '13. So could you maybe talk about how much your guidance is in related as far as expenses and the projected cost savings? It looks like $150 million is still what you're roughly expecting on the cost savings side. But if at some point over the next year, it looks like you're not getting the benefits at the rate that you're currently looking for, I mean, would you still plan on absorbing as much as $350 million on ERP cost? How much variability could there potentially be on the expense side?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, Ajay, those 2 things really aren't tied. So as we tried to do during the Investor Day, we tried to explain that the expenses are primarily due to the technological implementation of our new ERP system. So the $300 million to $350 million, net of direct benefits from SBS, that's the expense that we plan to incur as we now implement and roll out the ERP system, and we gave guidance of 520 companies during the course of the year. Bill gave you a little more color about where the next 5 of those were going to be. So that's kind of part A. Part B is we also have the business transformation initiatives, cost-saving initiatives, that do not rely upon that technology to go forward. And so we're going down the road on a variety of those that we outlined in great detail, and that's where we expect to receive the 25% of our overall benefit in the first year.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I just had one follow-up question. It's maybe just a variation of some of the questions that have been asked on inflation. So just wondering internally, how concerned are you guys based on the current weather and drought conditions that a lot of that recent volume improvement, case volume improvement, begins to slip away very quickly if inflation starts to get out of control?","William J. DeLaney","I don't think we're overly concerned, at least, not any more concerned in the last 2 or 3 years, Ajay. I mean, it's part of what you deal within this business and when you put it in the context of some of the other challenges that we have out there in terms of the marketplace and our customers' ability to grow and that kind of thing, I think it's certainly -- we take it seriously. But it's also -- comes into the bucket that we don't really have much of an ability to influence it. So I wouldn't -- I'd be probably more concerned about the economy and whether we can see a little bit more stability and a little more consistent improvement there, because then that creates a mindset in the consumer wanting to go out to eat more, and that's always the key, I think, for our business is that people want to go out to eat and they're not totally focused on what it's going to cost or how many times they go out and all that kind of thing. I mean, right now, our information is a little dated, but we're still seeing increases in traffic and check size. And it varies between concept and that kind of thing. But we just need to see improved -- consistently improving psyche of the consumer, and I think we can weather the rest of it.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","So can you comment as far as quarter-to-date have volume trends deteriorated at all sequentially?","William J. DeLaney","I really can't. As I mentioned earlier, we just don't do that. But again, you know us real well and we play in the entire space in this market so to the extent that you're seeing softness out there, we would certainly expect to participate in some of that as the quarter goes along.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And finally, can you confirm if there were any quantifiable ERP benefits in the fourth quarter?","William J. DeLaney","We really didn't look at it that way, to be honest. I'm sure they were modest, but essentially what we have said is -- what Chris just talked you through, is we've laid this thing on in terms of our roadmap, and we're looking to knock down about 25% of that cost savings here this year. And it's going to come from operations, it's going to come from SG&A and it's probably going to come a little bit more toward the end of the year than at the beginning of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","At this point, I think it's fairly short. You made a comment, and I think it was Chris that did, I don't remember, talking about expending Sysco beyond the core over time. And I guess, is that a 2013 event? Is that the type of technology initiatives that may come from Sysco ventures or are there other things that we should be thinking about in near-term significance just to put some parameters around that?","William J. DeLaney","John, it's Bill. I think that was actually in my prepared comments. So Chris can take a break here. No, it's no different than what we've talked about before. I think, again, in terms of our communications and messaging, we want to make sure that all of our constituents understand that we're primarily focused on the core right now. We've got a lot going on, a lot of opportunity out there. But yes, we continue to look for ways to grow in an adjacent manner. And over time, we still would like to grow international. But I didn't put a timeline on that as much as I said. Over time, I think was actually words that I used. So it's more of a strategic objective here over the medium term.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And you said outside the core is international as opposed to something within the U.S.?","William J. DeLaney","Well, it could be -- we could look at adjacencies of the Sysco ventures as you mentioned as kind of bridges both as you start talking to folks who have opportunities for us to partner with in terms of business solutions that are more technology-driven, those types of things. But the attraction there, obviously, is to create a stronger relationship with our customer base and more traction to help them grow and to solidify our position with our customers over time. So no, it would be both adjacencies as well as international.","Operator","And our question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I first want to just talk about the money, the 25% of savings that you're expecting to get this year. That isn't really part of business transformation process, right? Those are a whole set of separate initiatives that you've started working on last year -- or this year, I should say this year, is that right, '12?","Robert C. Kreidler","No, we view all of the initiatives that we have undertaken as part of the transformation of our business from what was the old the business model, if you will, to what needs to be the new business model in order to compete going forward. Many of them originally were described as being enabled by this new ERP system. And as we got further and further into the ERP system design and implementation, we realized we did not need to wait on the ERP system in order to attack some of these other business transformation initiatives. So now we're talking about them as separate streams of work, but it's all under the moniker of business transformation because frankly most of this is different than what we've done before.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So they're not actually benefits from the ERP system, there's just other ways to save money?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, that's fair. I mean, again, business transformation is not ERP. ERP is the technology change that we set out to put in place several years ago. And again, the original plan if we step back before my time, but I certainly understand it now, the original plan was if we're going to do through all the work to develop and design a new ERP system that changes all of our processes, everything about how we go to market, let's go and do this operating company by operating company and change the business model one at a time. So everything was really on one kind of rollout schedule. As we got further into it, we realized it doesn't need to be done that way, and especially as the ERP implementation slowed down, we realized we needed to go faster on the rest of it. So we just disconnected them.","William J. DeLaney","Meredith, if I could just jump in there, I want to -- there's a key point and I think it's key to anybody who would be listening to this call, inside or outside Sysco. If you go back to our May presentation there with all of you, we took a fair amount of time to reframe this deal and to, if you will, rebrand it to some extent from a standpoint of what Chris just took you through. So business transformation is essentially us coming to grips with what we need to do, the changes we need to make in terms of our processes, how we go to market to continue to enhance our leadership position in this industry going forward for the next 5 or 10 years. Now 3 and 4 years ago, when we had more of a design than anything else, we bundled it all together in terms of one. So where we sit today, we're talking to you about deploying the technology platform effectively throughout Sysco so that's one big bucket. And then we're talking about taking a look holistically at all of our practices in terms of how we run the business, selling, general, administrative, all the different things that we do, how we organize the company and revisiting those, some of which, as Chris said, would have been part of the original business case for 2012, a few of which weren't; many of which do not require new technology platform to get those going because a lot of it has to do with a more consistent go-to-market implementation of our business practices. And then third is sitting down and partnering with our suppliers, our product suppliers and finding more efficient and more effective ways of sharing cost savings on product, and at the same time doing it in a way where we can grow the business. So this is a key point. The business transformation going forward for Sysco encompasses all 3 of those buckets, if you will, and not just the technology platform. Now we can't get to the finish line without the technology platform. So that remains very foundational, as I said, in my comments. But it's just one piece of it.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And I guess where I was confused is I thought some of these new cost saving initiatives truly were new and had not originally been envisioned when you laid this out. But you're saying it's just an acceleration of how you implement those things.","William J. DeLaney","I'm saying there's a lot of that, and then I'm also saying, look, we're running a business here, right, so we're somewhat behind on the deployment schedule. We've got some cost overruns, so we're running the business and we've taken stock over the last 6 to 9 months of other things that we can do in the company to offset the cost overrun. So it's a combination but largely it's an acceleration of the original business case.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. That's very clear. I have one other question. This wasn't a great year for the company as a whole, and I don't know how that compared to your internal plan. But I was wondering what happened with bonuses for the company this year? Were they up or down versus last year and kind of how did that play out over the quarters?","Robert C. Kreidler","Well, we haven't actually talked about bonuses internally, but I can describe our bonus objectives to you. From the corporate perspective, we basically had 3 bonus objectives: The one was sales, which we have actually achieved our plan and actually somewhat exceeded our plan in terms of sales. We had one that was operating profit and that, of course, was as you -- I'll use your words, was not good in terms of the year. And then one was return on invested capital, and that one kind of went the same way as operating profit. If you don't get your earnings, it's very hard to achieve your ROIC objectives as well. So while we haven't, I don't think we fully ruled on what the bonus outcome is to the employees, that's the general sense of where we were. Compared to last year from a corporate perspective, I would say we'll definitely be lower than the last year, where we had a slightly different bonus plan. Now the operating companies have their own bonus plans. Typically, they're tied partially to the corporate, their leadership team, but then also predominantly to their own performances. So those are going to vary depending upon the performance of the operating company.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And have you -- the fourth quarter numbers, do those reflect any assumption about bonus for the year, or is that something that gets actually recorded in fiscal '13?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, we had already adjusted and accrued appropriately for where we thought the payouts would be.","William J. DeLaney","So, I think, Meredith, just I'll pile on here a little bit. You're going to see different results on bonus so you won't see them but, obviously, we had some operating companies that performed well above plan and plan, and those folks will make some bonuses and some who didn't. To Chris's point overall, we didn't achieve our earnings goals for the year, so we will not hit our target bonus, but we will pay bonuses this year. I don't know what it is compared to last year to be straight with you, but as Chris also pointed out, we moved to more of a plan-based bonus structure this year and, I think, in the end I think you're going to find it to be very appropriate.","Operator","And with no further questions, we'd like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.","William J. DeLaney","Thank you."],"19855":["Sysco (NYSE:SYY) Q2 2013 Earnings Call February  4, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Neil A.

DeLaney","Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales of $10.8 billion for the second quarter and net earnings of $221 million. Earnings per share was $0.38 and adjusted EPS, representing our underlying business performance, was $0.49 or 4.3% increase year-over-year.","During the quarter, solid case volume growth contributed the highest second quarter sales level in our history. This growth was driven by both acquisition and organic growth as we were particularly successful in growing with our large regional and national customers.","Adjusted operating income grew nearly 5% for the quarter. Gross margin trends improved for the third consecutive quarter but were lower than the prior year due in part to the change in customer mix I just noted. We were especially pleased with our expense control performance in the selling and administrative areas of our business, as we benefited from successful implementation of several strategic initiatives. However, managing our expenses on the operating side of the business was challenging, as fuel and payroll costs grew at a faster rate than our productivity improvements.","To date, in fiscal year 2013, we have completed 10 acquisitions representing approximately $775 million in annualized revenue and expanding our presence in the United States, Canada and Ireland. The acquisition environment remains favorable, and we continue to have a number of additional opportunities in the pipeline. Our core market potential approximates $235 billion and grew by about 1% in real terms in calendar year 2012. Based on preliminary industry data, we believe we grew our market share this past year at a rate consistent with our strong historical performance. However, consumer sentiment and restaurant traffic trends have softened of late due to ongoing economic pressures, reinforcing the need for Sysco to aggressively transform our business so that we remain well positioned to provide greater value to our customers and reduce our overall cost pressure.","Two critical components to deepening our customer relationships are more effectively marketing the Sysco brand and gaining greater insight into our customer's value and how we can most effectively address those needs. We are making good progress in both of these areas under the leadership of Bill Goetz, Senior Vice President of Marketing, who joined Sysco about a year ago. One development that we are very excited about is our recently announced marketing relationship with the Food Network, its highly rated show Restaurant: Impossible and its chef, Robert Irvine. This is a first for Sysco, and we believe it will enhance our brand, strengthen our relationships with existing customers and extend our reach to new customers. This multi-platform relationship will include TV commercials and show product integration, digital integration and personal appearances by Chef Irvine.","Turning to the technology appointment portion of our multi-year business transformation efforts, we are making progress at our operating companies in North Texas and West Texas, where we deployed our new ERP system in November. Particularly encouraging has been the improved functionality of the order entry system compared to earlier rollouts. In addition, our shared business service center, SBS, continues to ramp up to support a broader array of administrative functions in a centralized manner. We have encountered some challenges, however, in the recent rollouts and are in the process of proceeding to make additional changes to further enhance the functionality of the system. We are confident that we will be able to resolve these matters as we move forward, and we'll refine our deployment rollout schedule accordingly. At the same time, we continue to move forward with other aspects of transforming our business.","In closing, I would like to thank all of our customers for their support as we move through our business transformation journey. I would also like to recognize all of our associates for their ongoing dedication and commitment to Sysco's success, especially those that put forth tremendous effort to service our customers in the midst of Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath. The transformational change that we are currently navigating throughout Sysco is both extraordinary and foundational to our profitable growth in the years to come.","Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter.","Robert C. Kreidler","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $10.8 billion or an increase of 5.4% compared to the prior year, driven by a case volume growth of 2.8% and food cost inflation of 2.5%. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 1.1%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by 0.3%.","Gross profit in the second quarter increased 3.9%. Gross margin in the second quarter declined 26 basis points. Roughly 1\/2 of this decline was caused by a slight shift in customer mix as a result of growth in large regional and national customers. The remainder of the decline can be attributed to continued competitive pressure and a difficult sales environment that softened further during the quarter.","Operating expenses increased $116 million or 8.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the prior-year period, driven mainly by a $45 million increase in business transformation expenses and a $17 million increase in salaries and related costs. In addition, during the second quarter, we recognized $22 million in charges from certain items related mainly to severance from the restructuring of our IT function, which we discussed last quarter and the restructuring of our executive retirement plan, which we discussed in the 8-K we filed on January 16. As a result of all of these items, operating income decreased $44 million or 10.4%.","Net earnings for the second quarter were $221 million, a decrease of $29 million or 11.5% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.38, an 11.6% decrease compared to the prior year.","As you know, Hurricane Sandy had a devastating impact on a large part of the country during the second quarter. We have been deeply saddened by the tremendous personal and professional toll it has taken on our customers and the communities we serve. Our operations and crisis management team did a tremendous job protecting our assets before the storm and in helping our customers recover afterwards. In addition, as in many natural disaster events, Sysco played a key role in ensuring first responders can serve the community. While we avoided substantial asset losses, we estimate that the storm and its aftermath cost us about $0.01 a share during the quarter.","As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes the $22 million in certain items I just mentioned, but also excludes business transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business as we go through our business transformation: adjusted operating expenses increased 3.7%, slightly lower than the growth in gross profit dollars; adjusted operating income increased 4.6%; adjusted net earnings grew 4.7%; and adjusted EPS grew 4.3% to $0.49 per share.","As Bill mentioned, the acquisition environment is currently quite favorable, and we have been very active in this area. To date, in fiscal 2013, we have completed 10 acquisitions with annualized revenues totaling approximately $775 million. As a result, we have already exceeded our goal of adding 0.5% to 1% in sales from acquisitions this fiscal year, and we still have a number of additional potential transactions in the pipeline that we are working to complete over the next several quarters.","Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment, in the second quarter, project expenses totaled $81 million, and we capitalized $3 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter, project expenses totaled $36 million, and we capitalized $33 million related to the project. We continue to make progress on our other key business transformation initiatives. With regard to our initiatives to reduce our operating costs, we have completed the implementation of the SAP maintenance module throughout our U.S. Broadline Companies, and we have also created specific action plans for every OpCo to implement best practices in warehousing and delivery.","On our initiatives to reduce our SG&A cost, we have completed the rollout of our sales productivity initiatives, including the deployment of our new CRM tools throughout our U.S. Broadline operating companies; we've implemented substantial changes on our IT function, outsourcing our managed services work; we have begun to implement the SAP Human Resources module throughout our operating companies; we restructured the retirement benefit plans for associates and executives; and we have begun the process of centralizing some of our field finance work to our shared services center.","And finally, with regard for initiatives to reduce our product costs, we have progressed our 4 pilot categories through the category management process to the point where we are now awarding new contracts to suppliers. Even though there is a lot of hard work left ahead of us, we are pleased with our overall progress today on our key transformation initiatives.","Turning to our cash flow performance, at our Investor Day last year, we discussed our plans to reduce capital expenditures in both our underlying business, as well as for the Business Transformation Project. We've made good progress on that objective, with CapEx declining $172 million in the first half of this year compared to last year. We've seen a decline in capital spending related to the Business Transformation Project, mainly driven by the fact that we began implementation of the new technology earlier this year. In the underlying business, we've seen lower capital spending because of a reduction in the number of major facilities project this year compared to last, and a more disciplined capital allocation and approval process.","As a result of the reduction in capital spending, free cash flow increased 20% year-over-year to $125 million. We expect the effect of continued lower capital spending this year, combined with the completion of the IRS payment last year, will result in an improvement in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. The other component of the free cash flow equation, cash flow from operations declined year-over-year in the first half by $152 million or 28%. Increased inventory levels drove about 1\/2 of this decline. We also had an increase in certain current period tax payments mainly due to timing.","Before I close, I want to remind you of guidance we have provided previously on a few significant items that will impact the second half of the fiscal year, 2 of which we discussed in more detail in our 8-K filed in January. We believe our transformation initiatives will provide meaningful long-term benefits to Sysco. However, as we discussed at our Investor Day, some of the initiatives will result in onetime charges. I discussed a few minutes ago a $12 million charge we incurred in the second quarter related to the restructuring of our executive retirement plans. The total charges are estimated to be $24 million, and we expect to incur the remaining $12 million in charges related to this action in the second half of the year. This restructuring more closely aligns the executive retirement plan with the employee retirement plan. And we believe over the long term, will reduce the volatility retirement-related expenses, as well as the total cost of retirement-related expenses.","On our fiscal 2012 year-end call last August, we discussed the more than $100 million potential increase in pension expense we were facing as we were developing our fiscal 2013 plan. In response to this potential significant increase in expense, we restructured our employee retirement plans to freeze our defined benefit pension plan and subsequently enhance our defined contribution or 401(k) plan. As I mentioned a few moments ago, during the second quarter, we recently completed the restructuring of our retirement plans by also restructuring our executive retirement plans. The net effect of all these changes is that we now expect pension expense to be lower in fiscal 2013 by $21 million, with $15 million of this decrease occurring in the second half of fiscal 2013. The additional expense in fiscal 2013 related to the increase in 401(k) and other retirement plan changes will be in the range of $55 million to $65 million, all of which will impact the second half of this fiscal year. These 2 components together will result in a net increase in retirement-related expenses for the full year of between $35 million and $45 million. This includes amount that we categorize as certain items.","Finally, in the third quarter, we expect to incur a $40 million charge related to the withdrawal from an underfunded multi-employer pension plan. This withdrawal will help us mitigate our exposure to multi-employer pension plans and underfunded status.","In closing, fiscal year 2013 is a critical year for us as we work towards significant milestones in our business transformation plan and begin to realize benefits from several areas of our company. The work we are doing will favorably position us to take advantage of opportunities to continue to grow our market share and expand upon our leadership position in the industry.","With that operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things. Is there any update on either the rollout schedule, where you expect to be by fiscal year end in terms of OpCos or the benefit because I think it's 25% of the ultimate benefit would be seen this year. Is there any update on either one of those?","William J. DeLaney","John, no, I don't have an update for you this morning. What we're telling you, I think, in our prepared comments is we're in somewhat of a delay here from what we originally anticipated in terms of rollouts, and we're going to take the next few weeks to continue to assess the things we need to improve in terms of the functionality of the system. I think over the next month or 2, we should have an update on the rollout time line. As far as the 25% of the benefits, I want to just keep reminding everybody, and I'll let Chris speak to this because he's the one that's really managing this pretty well, that is off of a overall targeted savings of $600 million give or take over a 3-year period, which incorporates, not just the technology side of it, but some big initiatives we have going on, which Chris referenced in detail here today on the SG&A side of the business as well as the product cost side of the business. So I think we're in a good -- pretty good place there. And I'll let Chris provide some color for you.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, John, with regard to both parts of your question on the rollout plan, I won't add any color to what Bill said other than the guidance that we have out there right now is 5 to 15 operating companies being converted this year. I think it's fair to say we're going to be at the lower end of that range, but as Bill said, we're working through whatever revisions we might need to make to our plans right now. But that's the current guidance. On the savings, again as Bill said, it's across all of our business transformation initiatives. I kind of walked you through where we made progress on many of the others and frankly, we feel pretty good about where we are on our overall cost saving initiatives for this year, as well as going forward.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So just as a follow-up on, I guess, ERP, 2 key things, the functionality challenges are coming primarily where? And then as you've rolled out the CRM component, have you seen yet much of a benefit to how the salespeople are doing their day-to-day job, whether it's calling on more customers or anything like that or is that too early yet?","William J. DeLaney","I think we're beginning to see benefits, John, on the CRM. But it is pretty early. I mean, we've -- it's a huge rollout for us in multiple companies. But for us to be able to successfully implement some of the other initiatives in the SG&A side that we've undertaken, we're going to need to see effective implementations of CRM. So I think we're in a good place there. But that's like a lot of things. It probably takes a good year to get it out and get people to use the system and to trust it and then to hold each other accountable for results. So I'd say still early, but we're very encouraged and very pleased with the system itself that we're using. As far as the functionality, let me do this. I went back and I looked at some things we've said to you all in recent calls and I'd like to put it in context. And I think the first point I want to leave with you is we're very confident in the direction we're going in here. We're very confident that we are going to be able to resolve some of the challenges that we have right now. We're just not as confident in terms of the specifics of the near-term time line. With that said, what we've talked about in the past is concerns, issues with speed, performance, in particular with the order entry system. We had some issues with reports early on, and we spoke a little bit in the past about inventory management service levels, those types of things. I would say to you where we are today with these recent rollouts, we're pleased with the progress we've made on the order entry and the speed and the performance of that system. So we've done well there. We're very pleased with, as I said earlier, with the ramp up of SBS, and that group beginning to take on a broader array of support services, even without the technology being as further -- as far along as it will be at some point. So we're not waiting on the technology to begin to centralize the things that we believe that can be centralized effectively. Our challenges today, we've had some hardware blips, to be honest with you, around Thanksgiving time. We ran into some issues there and it took us a while to resolve that. We've had an event or 2 here of late as well. So we still got some things to work through on the hardware side, highly confident that we will be able to do that. And then on the, well, I'll call it again, the inventory management service level issues, still not clicking here at the level that we need to be. We came out of the chute pretty well after the deployments themselves, but the service levels aren't where they need to be. We've ran into some issues with connectivity and our system to our large customer systems. And those are things that we're working through today. Now I'll remind you that this deployment, we did back in early November, was very important for a couple of reasons: one, it's the first time we deployed 2 companies; but second, North Texas or -- essentially Dallas is by far and away the largest OpCo we put on the system, and it's one of our largest Opcos overall. So these challenges we're going into right now, well, some were frustrating at times, not unexpected, and we're working through them with our customers and with our people and again, really appreciate the patience of the customers and very, very appreciative of the efforts our people are putting forth.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just one last thing, it looks like the level of price investments have moderated from where they were 9 months ago, a year ago. Is that likely to continue, or does that go the other way, given the macro and maybe a resurgence in inflation? Do you think the pace of price investments gets more intense on your end the next remainder of this year or do you continue -- think we continue to moderate?","William J. DeLaney","John, those are your words. I don't think I've used those words exactly. I will say about 1.5 years, 2 years ago, we did talk a lot about strategic pricing initiatives and there were some things we are doing there, a category or 2, that we have pretty much cycled through, and we're pleased with what we've seen there in terms of growth. I think the relative improvement you're seeing on the margin trends is a combination of 2 things. I mean we are working very hard at it, trying to strike the right balance in terms of growth and being responsive to our customers. And secondly, is because the inflation has subsided that takes a little pressure off the percentage change issue there. So we're continuing to try to grow the business aggressively but be smart about it, and we need to continue to improve on the margin side.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Edward Kelly with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So if we could go back to -- just a quick follow-up on the ERP implementation. Is there any impact on the cost that you expected to incur this year, the $300 million, $350 million, as well as on capital because I know you talked about some hardware issues.","Robert C. Kreidler","The second one first. At this point, we don't really anticipate an increase in the cost of capital. And if it is, frankly, it's going to be minor. Hardware really doesn't cost that much in the grand scheme of a project like this. The capitalization of labor, which typically occurs when you're developing a system, not when you're implementing it. So I don't anticipate a significant increase in the capitalization. In terms of the overall cost, to the extent that there's a delay here, just like what we talked about the last time when we talked about the more significant delay, it's not really in the current year, it's just that additional time down the road. So while there may be some additional costs, I don't currently anticipate those being significant. But anytime you have a delay, of course, you're adding more time to the end of the deployment cycle, and you'll pick up additional cost for a longer period of time.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I'm just trying to frame sort of like the net cost of business transformation, as well as the cost savings that you talked about this year. And, I guess, the way we think about it, if there's $300 million to $350 million in business transformation, and let's call it, roughly $150 million in cost saves, you're sort of at this $175 million level net for the full year, which is lower year-over-year than last year, right, because you gross cost in those savings. Are we thinking about that the correct way?","Robert C. Kreidler","You're generally correct. We gave you a lot of guidance at our Investor Day, which I'd encourage you to pull back up, there are a couple of charts there that are pretty good. That, frankly, if you listen to our calls we try to talk in the same language as those charts every time so you can keep up. But that's how we outlined it. We just had gross business transformation cost. We netted against that, some benefits from our shared services center to get to a net business transformation cost and then we also broke it down into cash cost, and cash is where we expected to pick up some benefit this year as we slowed down the implementation and started depreciation --  sorry, slowed down development and started depreciation.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Now on the cost savings side, I know in the first quarter you were reluctant to, really, kind of give any color on where you stood. I don't know if you could help us understand how much you've achieved today in the first half or how much of that is back half weighted, just as kind of how we think about the model here.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, we're pretty -- we're going to be very cautious about giving quarter-by-quarter guidance because there's going to be a lot of timing elements to this, to be real candid with you. But look, I'm not going to dodge the fact that this whole thing was a build up from one quarter to the next all the way through 3 years. So we told you 25% in the first year, 50-ish range, around 50-ish in the second year and all of it by the third. So you can see the ramp-up. Throughout the year, they ramped up as well. So if the 25% -- yes, more than 1\/2 of it is going to be the latter half of the year.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Bill, could you maybe talk about just general consumer and industry trends? Maybe start with sort of volume growth, what was the cadence to that volume growth throughout the quarter? And then it sounds like things have weakened up so far in the current quarter, volume standpoint. I don't want to put words in your mouth, so if you could just help us understand what you were sort of referring to there.","William J. DeLaney","Yes, sure. I would say to you that the volume trends have softened, I think, as we went through the second quarter, in particular on the street. We're doing a really nice job with the large regional national chains that -- Kent Humphries and his group have brought in some great accounts there. We've been able to grow with some big existing customers so that's been a real positive for us. I would say on the street, we have seen some softness. And then when Hurricane Sandy came, that just exacerbated it. And things picked up after that, but not to the level that we were at before. I'm not really putting that on the hurricane, though. I just think as you read all the things that come out in terms of economics confidence and you look at some things coming out of our industry in terms of the operators and just looking at a lot of the things that you guys publish in terms of restaurant trends, I think you can say that things have softened out there and we're dealing with it. And bottom line is we're continuing to find ways to stay close to our customers, work even harder on retaining the business that we do have and going after new prospects that are good fit for Sysco. So I think it's going to be soft here for a while from everything I read and that just means that we need to work a little bit harder and continue to, as I mentioned in my comments, continue to aggressively go forward on some of the transformation initiatives and continue to develop that acquisition pipeline.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And i just want to ask you one last question on gross profit dollar growth. Your gross profit dollar growth exceeded your case growth this quarter for the first time in a while. Just probably an encouraging sign. Could you maybe talk about what the drivers of that were? It might be something [indiscernible] at SYGMA, but SYGMA didn't grow much. And then how sustainable that is in the back half?","William J. DeLaney","Well, to be candid, that's not exactly a high bar. But it's -- we need to at least get to that and we -- fortunately, we did. So it is encouraging. And again, I would attribute that to some modest improvement on our part in terms of managing growth and profitability, and we need to continue to improve it or to be totally candid. So it's encouraging but a lot of room to go.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you keep that up in the back half, though, do you think?","William J. DeLaney","We're planning to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just first off, a quick one on the recent delays on the ERP rollouts. Do you expect the delay to be measured in months or quarters?","William J. DeLaney","Right now I'm dealing with the weeks, Michael. All right, so basically we're -- as I said, we're taking a look at some of the challenges we have, and we've got some very capable people internally and externally working with us on that and we're staying close to our customers. So I think over the next several weeks, we'll have a better update for you on that.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then on the business trends commentary that you've given, anything you can help us with on the trends you're seeing over, let's say, the last 4 or 5 weeks in the current quarter? Are they stable or is there any evidence of an impact from the recent payroll tax increase?","Robert C. Kreidler","I -- first of all, January's hard for me to make any great commentary on, just there's a lot of volatility from 1 year to the next on weather and that kind of thing. And I don't talk a lot about weather. But keep in mind, this quarter for us, March is disproportionately large because of the seasonal changes where you'll continue to, hopefully, have good business where people go on vacations, as well as people up north getting out a little bit more. So it's hard to draw any conclusions, but generally soft. I will re-announce that. I don't know that I can attribute any of that to the payroll tax. What I would attribute it to is confidence just what the countries going through on the economic side and, I guess, the payroll tax will be a piece of that. And just everybody is, I think, continue to be pretty careful with their dollars as they start the year. But I think our operators I just saw some numbers this morning and these go up and down. And the outlook from our customer base is a little bit better, even though we're not seeing it in the numbers yet. We said this 2 or 3 years ago, and I think, unfortunately, we were right. This recovery is slow and it's uneven. And going back to your earlier question, it seems almost to be quarter-by-quarter at times. So hard to predict, but I think comparisons will be a little tough this quarter again. And I say, one more thing on weather, and I've seen in it -- some of you guys' reports we did have a very mild winter last year and that did help us, in particular, in the northern states. So a little cautious here early in the quarter and certainly hopeful that things will pick up as we get into March.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then on the SYGMA business, I know it's not the biggest chunk of your business, but it was up less than 1% in the quarter despite the 2.5% pricing, which implies that division at least temporarily is actually in decline on a real basis. Is there anything we should be aware of in terms of lost customers or anything like that, or is it just some temporary time shift of some sort of orders, anything like that?","William J. DeLaney","It's more the latter. I mean SYGMA's going to have a little bit more volatility on the pipeline because when you bring in a new account or you pick up a significant more business with an existing account that will jump your numbers for a period of time, but we've essentially wrapped some of the new business pickup there and there's been some wins within existing customers and some modest losses, that type of thing. But basically it's a function of we've wrapped some of the new business from a year ago and what you're seeing there is a pretty good reflection of the overall growth of the customer mix.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you give us a little comment on what was going on with inflation during the call -- during the quarter, and also your prospective outlook for inflation here for the rest of the year?","William J. DeLaney","Yes, the way we measure it, Mark, I think we said we have about 2.5 points of inflation on our cost. It's pretty stable with most of the categories. Meat was up, I think poultry is up quite a bit, we had some deflation in seafood and the rest of the categories were not overly significant, although some were certainly larger categories than others. So pretty stable from that standpoint. I would expect certainly to see a modest increase over the second half of the year, but I don't know that we've seen enough yet to be projecting more than that. It's just -- we watch it closely, but I guess my best judgment is a modest increase.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Karen Short with BMO Capital.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A couple of questions just on the OpCos we rolled out -- you've already rolled to. Can you maybe talk to what's happening with volumes, in general, their attention with the customers or anything you can point to that's encouraging?","William J. DeLaney","You're talking about the last 2 rollouts, Karen?","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes.","William J. DeLaney","Yes, I think it's a little early for that, but as I said really on, we did a great job. We had a record sales week in one of the companies at a rollout, and our leadership team and our sales people and our support people here in the 2012 team and SBS have done a great job supporting our sales people and our customers. As you would expect, I mean, as you do run into some of these issues, that will spring some relationships and we've had some good discussions with customers that are experiencing some of the same challenges we are. So they've been very supportive to date, and we are working very hard to get the service levels to the level that we have had historically and that they would expect. So I would say so far, good partnership with the customers but as we've noted, there are some challenges out there.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then in terms of the categories where you've looked at rationalizing SKUs, what about the impact on customers in those categories or on volumes overall in those categories, any color there?","William J. DeLaney","I don't think that's had a big impact on customers. It's had an impact internally, but most of the SKUs that we rationalized were, as you would expect, pretty low velocity type SKUs. So anytime you reduce SKUs, it creates some angst and tension in the organization. But Mike Green and his team have done a great job there, and we're down about 10% in our SKUs. So I think the real test there will be as we go further on the category management work, I think Chris mentioned that we're in pilot stage right now. Part of that whole package is to put together a more optimal assortment that's broader but less redundant. And that will create some SKU pressure as well but in the right way. And so our challenge there will be to work through that with our sales force and our customers from a value added perspective. So all in all, I think we've done a good job there and there hadn't been a lot of pushback.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then just last question, looking at your cash flow on the acquisition side of it, the multiple -- if that dollar amount is actually your total payment for the acquisitions that you made, it seems like a pretty attractive multiple of sales. Is there -- are there any deferred payments or anything that will be part of the acquisition price or is that the actual multiple that you paid for those acquisitions?","Robert C. Kreidler","Typically when we do acquisitions, we will have an earnout agreement, which will last 2 or 3 years, which generally just says that the former management team owners will stay around and help integrate the company and retain as many customers as we possibly can. And for that, if they're able to accomplish that, there's a portion of the purchase price that gets paid out over time. It's not a huge number. So what you're looking at in terms of multiples is fairly reflective of what we're actually paying for these things. We don't typically look at it on a multiple of sales. I know sometimes people do that. There are a lot of different types of businesses that we look at. They have a lot of different operating margins. So that sometimes will cause a pretty broad range if you look at it on a percentage of sales basis.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right. Unfortunately, that's all I can look at but...","Robert C. Kreidler","I understand.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit about what you're doing in terms of retirement expenses. You talked about a pretty big increase in 401(k) expense. Is that because it's a new program, is that kind of an initial expense or will there be continuing -- will that expense continue or will there be incremental higher expenses in the coming years?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes. First, Meredith, we -- I've got to back up and I always have to start with where we would have been this year. We would have been $107 million more in terms of retirement plan expenses, which was obviously not something that we were looking forward to and our shareholders wouldn't have enjoyed either. For that and many other reasons, we look at restructuring our pension plans. That was something we were always looking at as part of business transformation. So we think of it in terms of that was the bogey. We had to do better than that. Now on a year-over-year basis, it is going to be higher, so the direct answer to your question is, yes, within the charges that I've read out earlier, there are some what we call certain items, which are onetime charges that will affect us this year. We talked about $24 million in terms of that, that will hit us this year and then we'll get more to a run rate. We're going to give you more color as to what that run rate is. If not, next quarter certainly in our fourth quarter reports that you can model for next year. We're trying to just give you the visibility for this year. The reason why we all set ranges around it is 401(k) expenses depend upon participation, of course, and that's somewhat hard to predict, especially with employees' paychecks going down because of tax changes. So we've got a fairly wide range in those numbers because we're not sure what the 401(k) benefits are going to look like.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I think it's great that you froze the defined benefit. It needed it to be done, I'm afraid. I was wondering if you -- I was just wondering if you could talk about the 10 acquisitions you did and whether there is any commonality or anything in particular you're looking for? Are these filling in geographical holes or line of business, or just great opportunities?","Robert C. Kreidler","It varies depending on the acquisition. So I'm going to say they're across the board. I'll give you a little color. In Ireland, while we have a very strong business over there and it covers much of the country, we were able to find 2 other companies that together with ours now cover kind of all of the whitespace on the map. We can reach all the way up into Northern Ireland without doing long haul, et cetera. And so that gives us, we believe, coverage over most of the country, not to say we won't look for additional transactions there, but those are great transactions for filling out the map. Canada, we still have a little bit of whitespace left, and predominantly in some of the larger cities, Qu\u00e9bec, Ontario area, there we were underpenetrated and so that gave us the opportunity to increase our penetration or market share in an area where we thought we had plenty of opportunity. Here in the U.S., most of what we're doing now are fill-ins and there are companies that's -- and families that we find that we believe have built a great business and a great name, and we like the way they operate and we enfold them into our companies.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then maybe just my final question would be obviously inflation is pretty modest right now. I think there was a time when inflation was a lot higher than when it was just challenging to pass it all along to your customers. Is there any reason to believe that, that's still an issue? I mean 2.5% is kind of on top of big numbers last year, or would you say that this is just -- you're not having any issues passing it along?","William J. DeLaney","Meredith, it's Bill. I would say this is as good as it gets, all right? We're in that 2% to 3% zone. That's what we've historically have always signaled is best for our customers and for us. I'm not going to tell you it's easy to pass along, but I think we're doing a little better job of it. It really comes down to the pressure that the foodservice operators are feeling and their outlook. So I think we're doing a decent job right now. If inflation were to pick up materially, that would put pressure on our customers, which ultimately puts pressure on us. So we'd love for it to stay right around here and  maybe tick up a little bit.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, the thing we have to keep reminding ourselves, though, and helping you all with is at the other end of this equation, we still have the problem of consumer demand, the ultimate restaurant patron. They're just not as -- they're not out there as much as they used to be out there. And that's the part that's never really recovered from the Great Recession, if you will. So as long as we have kind of a weak consumer demand and restauranteurs are trying to get as many customers into the restaurants as possible, you're going to have this competitive pressure in the industry. So it's inflation, yes, but it's also just weak demand on the other side.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then just one final question about the things you're doing in your shared services facility, it sounds like you've moved a lot of new activities to that facility. Is there anything that you're doing there that perhaps you hadn't originally contemplated and you've now seen an opportunity to use that facility more effectively?","William J. DeLaney","I don't know if there's anything we hadn't contemplated. There are things we're accelerating because we're not to the point where we thought we would have been originally on the technology side. So Chris mentioned several of them, HR, finance, we're doing some things in marketing out there. I'll let Chris add to that, but it's more about acceleration, I think.","Robert C. Kreidler","Absolutely right, Meredith. As we've said and tried to explain a number of times, rather than wait to get the full technology rolled out one OpCo at a time or 6 OpCos at a time or whatever the original plan was and then bring all of those companies into SBS, we've been doing it, frankly, function by function. And we talked about maintenance, that one's done. We're starting to prepare ourselves to receive benefit from that. HR is now being rolled out, finance is underway already. We're just bringing them in function by function, everywhere that we do not need to rely upon the big system going into place. And indeed I think I mentioned and several of these, we're using the SAP modules. We're just turning them on without the overall system being in place. They work just fine coupled in with our existing systems. So it's really about accelerating everywhere we can so that we can get the benefit that we originally described.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Yes, actually most of my questions were already asked, but I just had a question on the payroll increase in Q2 and maybe a lot of this was already covered in the prepared comments from Chris. So I think, Chris, you mentioned that there is going to be an additional $12 million of payroll increase in the back half of the year, but I'm trying to understand the net payroll impact, like, what's been cumulative effect on payroll net of the severance charges year-to-date, and can you give any similar commentary on the outlook for the back half of the year?","Robert C. Kreidler","I believe we talked about payroll being up $17 million, if I recall correctly, quarter-over-quarter. Let's see if I've got any detail on that, that I can talk about. Yes, $17 million up for the quarter. I don't believe actually that number has any of the onetime charges in it. So what you've got going on in there is we've talked about cost being up on the labor side in our delivery area and costs being down on the SG&A side of the equation. You've got those 2 things kind of playing together and the rest, frankly, are just normal increases in payroll expenses as we move forward.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, yes. I was just trying to understand the net impact of payroll expense year-to-date and what's your outlook for the balance of the year. But maybe I can follow up off-line.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, look, we can talk about that. I think Bill said in previous comments that we haven't been all that pleased with some of the increases on the delivery side of the equation. We had some overtime issues, some shortage of driver issues, things of that nature. Those costs have been higher than we anticipated. On the other hand, some of our initiatives are kicking in on the SG&A side and specifically the sales side, and those costs are lower. So you get a bit of an offset there. So you're going to have, hopefully, the latter continuing, the initiatives continuing to hold, and we actually start  to gain said benefit or, frankly, just get some control over the delivery side of the equation. So in terms of what we would like the outlook to be, that's it. If this is where we -- we just have to operate really well.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up, my understanding was that a lot of the cost savings that offset ERP spending, those -- whatever was targeted, I think $150 million for this year, that was supposed to be heavily headcount-related. So if that -- if my assumption is correct, I mean would it be reasonable to infer the payroll expense goes down even open in the back half if you look at the year-over-year comparisons?","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, let me take that in 2 parts. Is it reasonable to expect that payroll expense will go down? It will certainly -- it should not go up as much, let me put it to you that way without giving you specific numbers. I want to be careful, though, I don't believe we ever said that the vast majority of the $150 million was going to be headcount-related. You may be confusing that with statements we've always said most of the hard dollar benefits from business transformation or the ERP systems would be headcount-related, which is a different concept. The $150 million fell into various buckets we've described, including product cost reductions, SG&A reductions and lower operating cost reductions. So it's across the board. There's a lot of payroll in it, I'm not trying to dodge that. And so we would expect it, like I said, to at least not continue to increase and hopefully go down a bit. But there are other cost savings in there as well.","William J. DeLaney","Yes, I think the only thing I'll add, Ajay, is I mean payroll doesn't have to go down for us to leverage our productivity improvement. And so I would say, yes, I would echo what Chris said, we're not quite where we want to be at this point. There's different things going on in different parts of the business. And we have a very aggressive plan for expenses this year. So if -- I'm not sure you have -- I mean, when you look at the expense growth, it's not bad. I mean if you go back and look at it historically, it's just we have a very aggressive goal, given some of the impact of the initiatives, so I don't know that it has to go down. And I think it needs -- the delta, the increase of the delta, it needs to continue to come off, and that's what we're managing, very much focused on cost per case.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Chris, I heard some of your prepared remarks regarding CapEx control in general and just some increased discipline in general, about how the money is being spent. I mean, have you been able to update kind of fiscal '14, fiscal '15 CapEx guidance? I mean, is it still the intention that those numbers continue to come down as ERP gets finished up?","Robert C. Kreidler","We typically update our 5-year capital plan as we go into the end of the year. So we haven't updated future-looking years. I will say this, alleviate maybe one of your concerns, we're not pushing off CapEx this year into next year so that we get a -- gain some benefit this year. I know sometimes you can play with the numbers that way, but we honestly don't feel like we're pushing off just to be making the numbers look better. We're just hitting a little bit, as I said, a little smarter about where we spend our money.","William J. DeLaney","I think if you look at last year and this year and pull out the technology and divide it by 2, I think that's a more representative view.","Robert C. Kreidler","Yes, so we're down $177 million on the capital line. In fact, if you double it, we're going to be well under our guidance. I don't anticipate being well under our guidance, but we're certainly running at the lower end of our guidance right now in terms of our forecast for the year. I just don't have a good view of '14 right now.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, regarding acquisitions, I mean it seems like kind of your acquisition are being made almost kind of independent of what's going on the ERP side, especially with some of the modest delays that are happening. I mean is that the case or are you just kind of -- are you conscious of the size and the amount of acquisitions that you can make until your legacy system can be running exactly the way that you want it to be?","Robert C. Kreidler","No, so we've talked about $775 million annualized sales across 10 transactions. So just do an average of $75 million sales per transaction. They're not extremely large deals that we would worry about disrupting us. Now that being said, I don't think we would be doing a deal in the middle of Dallas right now and trying to integrate it in Dallas. There's no reason to complicate our lives when we don't need to. So it's a little of both. They're smaller transactions in general, which we feel comfortable taking on regardless of where we are with the ERP. At the same time I think we're thoughtful about where we're going to be trying to integrate deals with our ERP rollout schedule.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Chris, I want to just ask you about Hurricane Sandy, the $0.01 impact you called out, is that all from forgone sales or was there some inventory involved?","Robert C. Kreidler","It's a little bit of everything, so we had a little bit of asset loss. We moved as much of our equipment out of the area as we possibly could and literally ran out of storage area for some so we had a little bit of asset loss, some inventory, damage to facilities and then sales loss. In general, what happens is you lose the sales, but you don't necessarily lose the expenses. So you're effectively losing the gross profit on all of that for a period of time. So we measured it as best we can. These are more art than science for the quarter. Some of this impact will last for a while and we're probably going to feel some of the impact when the summer months roll around and some of the businesses that generally will open and thrive during the summer aren't there anymore. But we're starting to see some recovery in the area.","William J. DeLaney","But, Andy, I will tell you -- I mean, if you looked at our sales that week, and I don't think I need to tell you in this call the impact of that hurricane, but from the mid-Atlantic right up into Maine and even into the Mideast a little bit, it was dramatic and in particular in metropolitan New York, New Jersey. So that week was obviously devastating to people and our people and customers, but financially, it was a very significant event for that week.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Sure. No, just as we're trying to carve out potential sales impact. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And moving onto M&A, where you helped by the change in the tax code or do you think this -- the M&A environment still remains equally favorable as it was in the quarter?","Robert C. Kreidler","No. I mean, look, we -- towards the -- we had a very busy December. The teams put in a lot of hours trying to close transactions that needed to be closed by the end of the tax year. So yes, that was the case. At the same time though, I don't think that the pipeline has continued to be rather robust. It's just the number of the deals were desperate to close by the end of the tax year.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And is this environment wearing on potential sellers in terms of valuation expectations -- from what you think, is that -- if we were to take out the tax part of it, what you think of that?","Robert C. Kreidler","I would say -- I'd characterize where we are currently as more normal, which means you've got sellers that are at least somewhat reasonable. Now, look, in any normal environment, you got some sellers that are being irrational with expectations and some, frankly, that aren't  asking enough for their businesses. So you've got to range. But the range is more, what I would call, traditional and normal than it was, say, 24 months ago. That's what we've been seeing. And that helps us in terms of getting to a \"yes\", with -- on a deal that both sides win at.","William J. DeLaney","The biggest thing though, Andy, year in, year out it's still going to be the mindset of that owner, that family or whoever the decision-maker is in terms of how they see their business over the medium term of 3, 5 years, and are they prepared to invest in that is this for the other part of the environment, which is remains pretty tough market out there. So as we've said, I think we're still confident we'll see some activity here going forward.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And if I could, just a follow-up. I know you've been asked about the SAP a lot, but I just want to check my understanding. Is it the hardware issue you're now having, is that tied directly to the service level issues, or is the service level also go back to the code to the software side of thing?","William J. DeLaney","The service level is a result. And what I was trying to say is we have had some hardware issues. And again, we're confident, we're working through them and that we're confident we'll resolve those. But that will create slowdowns in the system, that will create late trucks and that type of things. So we've had some of that. But on top of that, we continue to have challenges as it relates to the functionality of the inventory management system. And that's a separate issue that needs to be addressed separately and -- but they've both result in service level variances from our typical levels.","Robert C. Kreidler","And the biggest issue in hardware is, as you might imagine, is just stability. Now if you've got hardware issues, you've got an unstable system, and that's the part that you've got to resolve before you can gain confidence in the system and then as Bill said, everything else kind of drives from that.","William J. DeLaney","So what -- I need to be careful here. Let me be clear. We're shipping groceries. The service levels are not at the level that they historically have been at, which is a very, very high level, all right? So the levels are not quite up to our norm. The challenges that we have had, in particular hardware is -- we might have a day or 2 where we have issues with slowness of the system and we have a hard time getting trucks out on time and that creates its kind of issue. The other issue is more of, if you will, steady-state issue that we're working on as well. So we're delivering groceries, it's functioning. We just have very high standards and so do our customers. And that's what we need to continue to perfect here.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Yes. And the other thing, just to take your temperature on this, if I can say it that way, let's say 9 months ago when you had what's, not a similar, but you also had a delay and some challenges. How do you rank this compared to that in terms of your confidence of resolution on getting back on track on a reasonable period of time? How do you felt then? Back then it sounded like it was -- to me, it sounded more serious. I'm just trying to take your temperature on that.","William J. DeLaney","I'm actually much more confident than I was 9 months ago in terms of getting back on track and in terms of taking this system to the level it needs to be to scale it and to provide, not just the service to our customers, but the efficiencies that we need and some of these are doing business that our salespeople need. What I'm not as confident on in the short term is the time line. But that's -- those are 2 different questions. So I feel better today. We've got our -- I'm very proud of our people, not only are they working hard, we're making progress, we've brought in some good people internally and externally to help us and each day and each week, even good weeks are challenging weeks. You learn more about it.  So I feel very good about where we're heading. I wish we could give you a little more definitive update on the time line, but I certainly hope we can here over the next several weeks.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just lastly on sales again because -- I understand the weather is -- are you trying to say for a January status, it's kind of too light? Too light a month to really say there's a change on trend based on to say that the payroll rate or the payroll tax going up or -- is that what you're trying to say or did you, in fact, say maybe things have softened? I'm just trying to get some clarifications.","William J. DeLaney","I think I'm trying to say 2 things, Andy. I'll help you work on it.  One is -- the business has slowed, especially on the street, over the last couple of 3 months and that includes January. Two, whether we have a great January or poor January, it's not as material to the quarter as what you see in the second half of the quarter, in particular in March.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's first quarter financial results announced this morning reflect important early progress toward achieving the three-year financial targets we established for operating income and return on invested capital at our September Investor Day. The key leverage for realizing these targets are accelerating local case growth, improving gross margins, leveraging our supply chain costs and reducing administrative costs.","The quality of our overall business results for the quarter was very good, driven by strong volume growth with both our locally and corporate-managed customers and sound gross margin management. However, sales growth was minimal and earnings were essentially flat due in large part to the unfavorable impact of both food cost deflation and currency translation. These two factors have somewhat restrained our performance for a good portion of the calendar year and we expect that these headwinds will persist for the next few months.","Looking at broader economic and industry trends, we continue to see mixed data points with evidence of both underlying strength and optimism, but also pockets of concern. Consumer confidence recently rebounded to its yearly highs in September, but then fell back in October. Unemployment remains at low levels although non-farm employment levels have decreased steadily since May.","NPD data for the three-month period ending in August showed continued positive restaurant spend with traffic growth rebounding from the prior three-month period. The QSR segment continues to be the main driver of positive restaurant traffic while fine dining segment also returned to a positive growth rate. Overall, restaurant traffic appears to be slightly positive. While still favorable on an absolute level, recent NRA data for September showed a decline in restaurant performance and foodservice operator confidence to levels last seen in late 2014.","Turning to our first quarter results, I'm especially pleased with performance of our U.S. Broadline business. As you know, this part of our business represents approximately 70% of Sysco's revenues and 90% of our profits. During the first quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.4% including local case growth of 2%, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth. Gross profit dollar growth of 4.6%, nearly 2% more than our operating expense growth of 2.7%, and operating income growth of 6.4%. This performance was strong, especially after considering the impact of 1% food cost deflation in U.S. Broadline business, and drove Sysco's overall gross profit growth of more than 2% and year-over-year gross margin expansion of approximately 0.25%.","Expense management trends continue to improve in much of our business as reflected in the $0.01 per case cost reduction in the U.S. Broadline business compared to the prior year. However, such improvement was offset by planned investment in merger-related carryover technology spend for projects that will provide key support to achieving our financial targets over the next three years.","As I stated a moment ago, two of the key levers to achieving our three-year financial plan are: one, accelerating our local case growth; and, two, improving margins. Our results this quarter reflect good progress on doing exactly that. A few examples of the progress we've made in various areas to produce these results include our category management work, which continues to provide incremental benefits to both our customers and Sysco; improve Sysco brand penetration, especially with locally-managed customers; and continued progress with our revenue management development work and early success in our pilot locations. In summary, our underlying business has good momentum and we are in the right path to achieving our long-term financial and strategic objectives.","For now, I'll turn it over to Joel for some additional details, and then I'll come back to summarize before we go to the Q&A.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results were of good quality, in particular for our core underlying business, the U.S. Broadline. Today, I'm going to discuss the details of the first quarter results on an adjusted basis, which mainly excludes expenses related to the termination of the proposed merger of the US Foods, as well as provide some additional pro forma comparisons on a constant currency basis.","Our first quarter sales increased by roughly 1%, despite the deflation and currency headwinds Bill noted. For some additional color on the inflation volatility we've experienced over the past year, we have transitioned from 5% inflation last year to a 0.2% deflation this year. In addition, as Bill mentioned, deflation in the U.S. Broadline was even greater at about 1% for the first quarter.","From a category perspective, center-of-the-plate protein and dairy drove the majority of this deflation with disinflation across many other categories. To put the deflation in context, the deflationary environment has developed two times over the past 10 years, lasting three months to nine months in length when it occurred.","As for foreign exchange, this quarter we saw continued strength in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the euro. Since Canada represents the majority of our international sales, the Canadian dollar valuation was the main driver for the negative 2% impact to sales in the quarter, which is the largest impact we've experienced in recent history. When we look at our sales on a constant currency basis, they're up 3%.","Turning to other sales drivers, we reported solid case growth this quarter, including 3.4% total and 2% local in U.S. Broadline. In addition, local and corporate-managed case growth across our total Broadline operations remained healthy. Despite the headwinds from foreign exchange and deflation, gross profit growth was solid at 2.3% and gross margin expanded by 23 basis points over the prior year. Positive contributors to gross profit growth include solid local case growth, category management and improved Sysco brand penetration. On a constant currency basis, gross profit increased by 4.3%.","Turning to expenses, certain items during the first quarter totaled $108 million, the vast majority of which were related to the termination of our merger agreement with US Foods, including $10 million that was adjusted out of operating expenses and $95 million that hit the interest expense line. As previously mentioned, this will be the final quarter to be impacted by certain items pertaining to the US Foods merger termination.","In total, our adjusted operating expense in the first quarter increased by $52 million over the prior year, mainly driven by payroll, which was impacted by both volume increases and a $9 million increase in our long-term incentive accruals. The increase in the long-term incentive accrual was related to our total shareholder return metric and was driven by the improvement in our stock price performance relative to the S&P 500.","During the first quarter, we also started to see early signs of productivity improvements and cost reductions within our supply chain, as cost per case is down approximately $0.01 in our U.S. Broadline business. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses grew by about 5%. Adjusted operating income was down 0.5% or $3 million. However, on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income would have been up 1.2%.","As for our SYGMA business, we are beginning to see modest signs of improvement. For the first quarter, SYGMA sales were down 6.2%, as segment operating income grew 1.4%. As we previously mentioned, we have transitioned some SYGMA business, which did pressure sales, but did not negatively impact our profitability. That said, we remain focused on improving productivity, efficiency and customer profitability in SYGMA and will continue to closely monitor its progress.","Moving to other income, I want to remind you that we consolidate the results of some of the entities we control, but do not have 100% ownership of. These represent investments in joint ventures, including some that are in the early investments or start-up phase. As such, our other income line this quarter reflects a $15 million improvement that is mostly attributable to the elimination of the non-Sysco portion of the results associated with these ventures.","Our income tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36%, both on a GAAP and on an adjusted basis. As a reminder, the adjusted rate is on the low end of our 36% to 37% normalized rate. The GAAP rate benefited from the impact of merger-related items, which offset the strength in our U.S. business. Adjusted net earnings grew about 1% and benefited from both higher other income and a lower tax rate versus last year.","Adjusted earnings per share were flat for the quarter. Foreign exchange impacted earnings per share results by $0.01 per share. In addition, share count was up over 7 million shares versus the prior year, negatively impacting earnings per share by $0.01 per share as well.","As a reminder, we have historically repurchased shares in the open market to offset dilution from new share issuances, but we have not done so for the past five quarters. We expect to resume these purchases later this year.","As you may know, we have commenced an accelerated share repurchase program or ASR, but it had no impact on share count in this quarter. For those of you not familiar with the mechanics of the ASR, here's some details. Our broker borrowed 85%, or approximately 32 million shares, and delivered them to us on September 28, at which time our outstanding share count was reduced by that amount. Over the next several months, our broker will then acquire these shares through various mechanisms, including open market purchases. The balance of the shares covered by the accelerated share repurchase will be trued up during settlement over the next several months.","As it pertains to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the first quarter was a negative $261 million, including the cash impact of certain items which reduced cash flow from operations by $260 million. Excluding the impact of certain items, adjusted cash flow from operations was essentially flat.","From a working capital perspective, we saw improvements in net working capital this quarter, driven by improvements in both the accounts receivable and inventory areas. This resulted in working capital using approximately $70 million less cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 than it did in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.","Net CapEx was $120 million for the quarter, generally flat year-over-year, mainly reflecting fleet replenishment and our investments in technology initiatives that we discussed during Investor Day. Free cash flow for the first quarter was a negative $381 million, which includes the $260 million impact of certain items. Please keep in mind that our free cash flow is seasonal, as we use more cash earlier in the fiscal year and then see larger sequential quarterly increases in free cash flow throughout the remainder of the year.","Finally, I want to remind you of the expected impact of the accelerated share repurchase on our fiscal 2016 share count and earnings per share. On our last earnings call, we said that we anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016, driven by a 4% to 5% reduction in average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense and new debt issuance. Now that we've begun execution of this plan, we still maintain this guidance.","I'll now turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Joel. In summary, I am encouraged by the quality of our first quarter results and in particular with performance of our U.S. Broadline business. We are now experiencing consistent improvement in our local volume growth trends and gross margin management in this all-important part of our business, as a result of improved execution of several commercial initiatives implemented over the past few years. Expense management trends have improved of-late, and we are also making good strides in developing and refining action plans to accelerate additional cost improvement benefits, both in our supply chain and administrative areas of Sysco. We will provide regular updates on an ongoing basis in achieving our targeted results for improving our customers' experience, enhancing associate engagement and meeting our 2018 financial goals for operating income and return on invested capital.","And with that, operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead, sir.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, Bill. So two things: number one, what's the update on the competitive pricing environment? I think it had heated up a little bit going back a couple of months, but yet I would think as we go forward here and things normalize that we would see that calm down quite a bit. And then, secondly, if I look at your U.S. Broadline EBIT up 6.4%, is there any way to kind of parse through what that might be in a more normal inflation environment? Would it be the same but have different components, or would it be different?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Good morning, John. On that competitive environment, I would say pretty much what we've been saying. The competitive environment remains very acute and comes in all forms of competitors, large, small...","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...local, regional, et cetera, national, that kind of thing. As far as I think what you're getting at, some of our larger competitors, they're on different stages right now in terms of where they are in developing and driving out their strategic plans and that type of thing. So I would say generally, John, the competitive environment remains very competitive, but reasonably rational. And yet at the same time, I would tell you in any given day, in any given market, there's probably some volatility and probably some inconsistencies with what I'm just telling you there. But I don't think a big change from when we would've talked a few months ago.","As far as the U.S. Broadline's concerned, it's good question, I would say to you \u2013 let me, without the deflation, honestly, I would just tell you it would have been much better, or at least somewhat better without the deflation. We had good gross profit growth, as I said, even with deflation, very good case growth and we managed the margins well. We've got work to do, John. So we still have work to do on the expense side here, in all parts of our business, and we're beginning to make some strides there. But I would say, without the deflation, the U.S. Broadline would have been \u2013 probably had somewhat of a stronger performance.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then, just as a follow-up to that, when you think about your long-term targets, I mean, it strikes me that with all you're doing on revenue management and kind of where you've been, gross margin \u2013 and I guess this was hit on a little bit during the Analyst Day, but gross could surprise to the upside, the other piece, right, as it holding SG&A growth to 3% seems a little tough if you're seeing some case growth. At the end of the day, do you \u2013 I mean, the 1% spread, that's the goal. Do you think it's pretty likely that that spread holds? But it's possible that we see both the gross profit and SG&A growing some \u2013 a fair bit faster than that, or that seems unlikely?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think it just depends. I mean, right now, deflation is somewhat of a headwind as it relates to the gross profit growth. And there's a lot of things, as you know, John, that impact margin from macro events to mix, and all that type of thing. I think what I'm conveying to you today is a lot of these initiatives that we've taken on over last two years or three years are beginning to bear fruit, whether it's how we manage our sales force, rolling out CatMan, continuing to work on the brand in the right way in conjunction with CatMan, and early days of revenue management which manifests itself in a lot of different ways. So I'm feeling good about our ability to manage margin. I think what you heard us say at the Analyst Day or the Investor Day, there's things we don't control. So right now our GP was up \u2013 it was up what it was up overall, was up nicely in the U.S. Broadline.","But I would \u2013 we're not at that spread right now overall. So I would say to you the plan here is to get back to that spread of at least 1% between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth. And what do we need to do to do that? We need to maintain the momentum we've got on local case growth, we've got to continue to manage those gross margins well, and we do need to get our expense increases to a lower level.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Meredith Adler from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if there were any particular initiatives you were using to drive the locally-managed case growth? And then, I have one other quick question.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's a lot of things, Meredith. If you recall the Investor Day, Tom Ben\u00e9 spoke, he took you through a lot of different strategies and processes that we're doing. I would say under Tom's leadership, there's some basic things, there's a very tight cadence of meetings between him and his market leadership in the field, weekly, monthly, quarterly, that type of thing. So we've got good continuity there. Some of the segmentation work that Tom spoke to, both in terms of customer segmentation, product category opportunities, those are \u2013 looking for opportunities within every cell that we operate in, whether it's geographically across customer segments, we talked about Hispanic, we talked about potential more opportunity in the local fresh area, that type of thing. But also just basic things where you sit down, as a management team, whether it's locally or through the CatMan group and look at categories that you may be underpenetrated in.","So we've got good alignment around good basic business principles, good connectivity between what we're doing here at corporate into the market and then obviously where it all happens in the field. And I will also tell you, CatMan continues to help. It's going to \u2013 as it matures in terms of some of the sourcing aspects of it, it's going to help us, I think, create more momentum on innovation and, over time, optimizing our SKU count as we strike the right balance between reducing SKUs where we have redundancies, but also broadening our SKUs for some of the items that may be new or maybe don't move quite as fast, but they're particularly important to customers. So a lot of it's process and a lot of it's, again, going back to these commercial initiatives that we've been developing and employing here over the last two years or three years.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So is it \u2013 are these changes, or would you say just getting some things that you've started working on sort of coming to fruition?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's both. So if you go back and so the \u2013 some of the sales tools and that type of thing we've been using for three years or more, they're beginning to mature; CatMan has been out there for two years or three years. But the revenue management work is really just beginning. And so we're in various stages on all these. I think probably the biggest thing right now, outside of that, Meredith, is I just feel we have really good alignment right now across that whole triangle we took you through between facing up, where it matters most which is at the customer level, supporting that in the market and then continuing to develop good tools here, but field-ready tools and we're getting better at that.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then just my quick sort of follow-up question is, I noticed again this quarter you had added back some severance costs and I was wondering was there some kind of a severance program or a layoff program somewhere in the company that you hadn't specifically called out?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have some ongoing opportunities there. I'll let Joel speak.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Meredith, this is Joel. I'd call that more just on a normal basis. There's nothing significant that happened there.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So they're added back for what reason, if they're ongoing?","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","They're added back because I think as we go through this transformation, Meredith, there's going to be some peaks and valleys on that line and right now we're in a little bit of a valley, which is nice. But it's \u2013 again, we're transforming here a $45 billion, $50 billion company that's been in business for 40 years. So we'll continue to optimize our workforce.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I see. Okay, thank you.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Operator","And next from Jefferies, we have Mark Wiltamuth. Please go ahead.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Wanted to just kind of find out where some of the weakness is here, because if your Broadline business is 90% of profits and that was up 6.4%, and SYGMA was actually modestly profitable, where is the big missing link here to get you down to a flat operating income performance? Is there some sizeable international losses, or just non-core businesses that are weaker?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say most of our businesses perform very well. There's a couple that didn't. I wouldn't say those are overly material to your question. As I mentioned in my comments, we've got some planned expense increases at corporate, largely in the business technology area. We talked about this over the last couple calls. We had some projects that we're going down the road in anticipation of US Foods merger on some opportunities here that we think are very compelling, especially in the customer-facing side of the business. And so we've continued on with those and that's created, on a year-over-year basis, a bigger delta on the expense side of corporate. And Joel mentioned, we took a hit on some long-term incentives here because of the stock performance. So it's a little bit of everything, but it's mostly corporate, some of which was planned, some of which was just kind of the mark-to-market, if you will, of the LTI.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As well as the foreign exchange impact, just as a reminder.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And this \u2013 over time, is there going to be some normalization of the corporate expenses now that you're kind of not pursuing US Foods? And maybe can you give us an arc on what that spending looks like?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I would answer that in the context of all expenses. And so again, as we continue to evolve here as a company, there's certainly a corporate group and there's markets and OpCos, but we look at optimizing the spend throughout. And so if you go back to those four levers I talked about, the last two levers are really about optimizing our expense management and so there's significant opportunity there, we believe, both on the supply chain side as well as on the administrative side and we're working through that now. You saw some of it on supply chain side this quarter. We had a pretty good quarter there. And on the administrative side, those are more thoughtful processes that we need to go through and we'll communicate those to you over the next few months.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And following, we have Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, Bill, just a follow-up on the cost control side. Your expense growth up in the 3% range and, clearly, just looking at the way that you reported U.S. Broadline performance, there were some expenses in here that sound like over time should eventually kind of roll off. How should we think about SG&A growth over the next few quarters? And then, over time, is there an ability to grow SG&A at a slower rate than what it's growing at today? Because the case growth was pretty good, you had 3% SG&A growth, but there's a lot of corporate spend in there. If you could just sort of help us put it all together in terms of how we should be thinking about this?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Ed. The way I would be thinking about both the way we laid out our three-year goals as well as the way this year's plan is targeted is, in that three-year plan we said it wouldn't be linear, this year's not going to be linear, and there's less of a trajectory, if you will, in the operating income in the first year than there is in year-two and year-three. The short answer to your question is, yes. I think as we get into breaking down those costs, especially, I don't really want to call them SG&A, I'm just going to call them administrative costs regardless of what part of the business they're in. Whether they're locally or corporate or in between and whether they're purely admin or just administrative in nature, you should expect to see those numbers \u2013 that growth to \u2013 that curve to become more shallow as we go forward.","What I was saying on the earlier question was we did plan in some meaningful technology spend this year to finish off some projects that we had started with the merger that are very compelling from a customer-facing standpoint, but also have significant costs. And so that's driving a lot of that expense delta here right now. So I was pleased with the overall cost per piece in the business. The corporate department's actually managed their expenses fine. We have the technology spend and then we had this other issue here on the incentive accrual. So short answer to your question is, it will begin to grow at a slower rate, and that's probably going to take us another couple quarters to give you some visibility to that.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. But then after that, shouldn't like the true performance of Broadline's, which is really what you're trying to communicate here, should be more evident?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Correct.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then just a follow-up for you here. It's been a few months, I guess, at least, since Trian's become more involved with the company and, at the Analyst Day, you had kind of suggested that there hadn't really been too much, I guess, influence yet. I was just curious as to whether you could provide some update in terms of the impact they're having on your business and the way you think about things strategically, if at all, yet?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. Well, I think at the Analyst Day, they had just come on (30:54) the board, I think, within a week or two that \u2013 or two or three weeks at least of that day. So I don't want to speak for them, but they've been doing \u2013 continuing to do their work. So they've pulled a lot of data and they're looking at a lot of information, they're visiting facilities, they're meeting with our management team, that type of thing. Their first real board meeting is our board meeting in November. And I'm sure we'll, at that point, between now and then and then after that, get better clarity on their thoughts in more detail and the breadth of their thoughts. And as board members, we'll work through it appropriately.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks guys.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And following, we have Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I had just two housekeeping questions and then a bigger picture question. Can you give us the case volume growth including SYGMA? That used to be a metric that you gave us, just wondering if you could give us that again?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We can get that for you, Karen. The only reason we don't show that anymore is because, obviously, we're going through some transition with SYGMA, so we don't think it's overly reflective of what's going on in the company. But if we can't give it to you in the call, we'll get back to you.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And the second housekeeping I just had is, do you have the private label penetration as a percent of sales at the local level? Is it fairly consistent with the Broadline number that you have in your press release, or is it lower, higher?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We track it that way, but because you have customers that transition back and forth. Generally they go one way into pure Street to local contract to corporate-managed. We think looking at it in total is better. So I would say generally we're seeing a comparable growth with the local business as well.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then I guess just a bigger picture question. I guess, obviously, you've told us a lot about how you plan to focus on local customers, and it obviously sounds like the right strategy. But is there anything about Sysco specifically that give you a competitive advantage in capturing and retaining the customer? And I guess I'm asking because it's obviously a higher margin customer, so that strategically makes sense. But I mean, it doesn't make sense that all your competitors are going to be doing the same thing? So what is it about Sysco that makes you more attractive as a supplier or affords you better retention? Any color on that would be great.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Karen, I didn't understand, can you just restate the first part of your question? What is it about Sysco, is that what you're asking?","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, it just seems obvious that everyone should be going after the higher margin customer, which is the local customer. So all your competitors are doing the same thing, I would assume. So is there anything specifically about Sysco that would help you retain or capture a customer or have better success at capturing that customer and retaining them versus your competitors?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Well, I think there's a lot of things. I mean, I think it's not like we just started doing that, okay, we've been doing it for 45 years. Half of that $50 billion we do, roughly half of that is with local or Street, a little bit more if you go to local. So it's the DNA of the company. It's in our \u2013 it's woven into the fabric of this company. It's how we've grown to where we are today. I think the point we made at Investor Day is with some of the challenges we've had in the macro environment and the acute \u2013 the increased competition that came from 2009, simultaneously with us driving out a heck of a lot of transformational change. We've struggled over the last few years until last year to drive the local case growth. So it's nothing new, it's just something we haven't done as well as we would have liked over the last few years, and there's reasons for that.","So in terms of why Sysco? I think it starts with our sales force. We've got 7,000 marketing associates across the country. Our structure that we continue to find ways to optimize, but one of the reasons we've remained very local is because, as I said many times, about two-thirds of our revenue stream comes from customers whose decision makers are domiciled within 100 miles, 150 miles of that operating company. So that creates a need, not just for local sales representation, but for local leadership with our presidents and senior teams there. So I think our geographic footprint, the talent of our operating teams, the experience and the breadth of our sales force, all these new things that we've been talking about earlier on the call on the commercial initiative side, from CatMan to rev man to segmentation, listening to our customers in a much more effective way through over the last three or four years, that have led to increased loyalty. The fact that we had the courage to take on transforming this company at a time \u2013 key inflection point in our country and in our industry, we're one of the few people in our industry that has taken on this kind of change. So I think the fact that we're forward-looking and we've got great people and we've got great strategy, I think those are all reasons why we should continue to have a lot of success.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Karen, this is Joel. Just the total Broadline plus SYGMA case growth was 2.4% for the quarter, as a follow-up.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to go back to inflation and deflation, what you're seeing on a category basis. I know that the slight deflation you call as center of the plate and dairy primarily, but how was that relative to your internal expectations for this quarter? And then has anything more recently changed? I know that you said kind of for the next few months, just maybe a little bit more color on how you see the inflation\/deflation outlook this year?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Vinnie, I'll start and then let Joel kind of tighten it up a little bit. I would say what's different is there's just a little more deflation than maybe what we would have expected three months ago when we were on this call in U.S. Broadline, and it appears to be lasting longer. And so I would tell you it's probably going to get a little worse before it gets better. We're seeing that early part of this quarter, and I think it could be with us at least into the third quarter. Joel?","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And I guess the other thing I'd just remind you of, again, we certainly think about inflation in our business by category. And so, again, many of the categories we have are relatively flat and then so some of the volatility we're seeing really is in a couple categories. It's a little bit harder to see where that's headed, but again as Bill mentioned, it certainly feels like it's going to get a little bit worse before it gets better as we move throughout the rest of this year.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys. And as a quick follow-up, at your Analyst Day you had made a quick mention of you doing some work with Kroger and some of its fresh products, I know that obviously that's probably pretty small at this point. But maybe just any kind of early reads or color on the scope and if that overall initiative is something that you could see expanding going forward?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Vinnie, I think what we said was, we're just beginning to do that work and it's just been a few weeks. So, so far so good, early days, but we're very excited about the opportunity.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks, Bill.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And following, we have Andrew Wolf from BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. On the 2% local case growth, do you have a feel for how you would split that between what the market's giving you in terms of growth, maybe with independents having positive same-store sales, if they are, versus how much share you might be taking?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, that'd be difficult, Andy. Certainly, as I said at the Investor Day, the market environment, even today's comments, there's not a lot of consistency to it. But I think when you look at it in the context of where we were five years or six years ago, or even two years or three years ago, we're in a better market environment. So I'm sure that's helping everybody to some degree, but I certainly would think that we're taking share with 2% growth. And we update those numbers about once a year.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. On the Broadline, the preview to the segment numbers, could you give us a sense of what the sales were up in U.S. Broadline?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not following you. What's the question?","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","I'm sorry. You gave us U.S. Broadline operating profit, you gave us all the \u2013 sort of the mini P&L except for the sales increase on the U.S. Broadline. And just so we could get a sense of where the leverage was, sort of back of the envelope I got to a little over 3%. Is that about right?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let us dig for that and we'll come back to you on that one, too.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Again, I just wanted to follow up on, when Joel was talking about the other income, because fourth quarter was even a bigger number than this quarter. And to be honest, I didn't quite understand what you meant by the elimination of some non-Sysco portion and what that meant. So first it's \u2013 the last two quarters combined, it's added $0.03 to EPS, about $0.01 this and about $0.02 last quarter. So is this something that's going to be a meaningful or smallish meaningful part of earnings going forward? Or do we just get two more quarters of some kind of change in accounting?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would just tell you it's line item gymnastics and then I'll let Joel kind of take it from there.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The way I would think about that, again, it's joint ventures that are reported on a consolidation method. So if you look at each one of the lines in sales, gross profit, expenses, operating income, up above the operating income line, they're consolidated and then below the line the portion that's, I'll say, the non-Sysco, the part that we don't own is backed out. So if you net out all of it between the above the line and below the line, it's a relatively small number, but that's the way the accounting works and that's why that part of it shows up in the other income. Hope that helps?","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay.","Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. There's a non-majority ownership, in other words, and then so the whole thing's reported up above and then the minority, the part that we don't own, is backed out down below.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Andy, and the U.S. Broadline sales, looks like it's a little over 2%.","Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Little over 2%. Okay, thank you. I'll just talk to you offline about the other income thing. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research Group.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Oh, boy, thanks. I just had a question about some of the cost-cutting opportunities. It seemed like at your investor conference one of the major themes was you've got a very growth-oriented outlook. And I understand that it's very early in your three-year planning process and that it's not a linear runway. But just from a cost-cutting perspective, where do you see the addressable opportunity and what are some of the major pockets, if you can talk about that? And then as a related question, like could you significantly reduce some of the variable costs like payroll costs without hurting your sales? So to what extent is that an issue in relation to your three-year outlook? Thanks.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Ajay, I think what we certainly attempted to convey at the Investor Day was we need to continue to grow. We believe we can grow profitably and take share in the right way, but it needs to be more targeted growth than what we've seen over the past. We need a little more balance between the corporate-managed growth and the local growth. And it's not that we don't want corporate-managed growth, we do, we just need to see a little bit more balance there. So I think on the cost cutting, the way I actually look at it in terms of running a business, we'll go to your last question, which is to cut costs, there's no trophies for cutting costs, right? So to cut costs and to do it in a way where you don't anticipate what the downside would be, would be somewhat foolish on our part. And that's why we're taking some time here on the administrative cost side to go through and look at the work, look at the prioritization of the work, look at the sequencing of the work, look at the structure, look at how much we still need to do on the technology side, for example, to continue to be up there in front with our customers and be responsive to their needs.","So what we're doing right now is prioritizing all that in a way that we need to put it together in a fiscally responsible way and then we'll bring it back to you and to our customer base and to our associates in the most balanced way that we can and in the least risky way that we can. So certainly, if we were to go out and cut back dramatically on customer-facing technology support or customer-facing associates, that wouldn't be very smart way to proceed here. So we're proceeding \u2013 we see opportunity, as I've said multiple times now, in all parts of the business. Where you're seeing us focused primarily right now is on supply chain and the administrative side. And I think over the next couple quarters, we'll be able to give you more visibility to that.","Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was just curious as you look at your case growth, either local or in total, if you could talk about any of the trends that you're seeing there, either product types or categories that are really working well? And I guess, somewhat related to that, many restaurants and QSRs have recently announced plans to transition their proteins towards antibiotic-free, and I was just curious if you could talk about how you're positioned against that trend with both your customers and suppliers?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Kelly, it's Bill. I think on the first part of the question, if you go back and look over the last two or three years and look at where our growth has come out, I think we've done a really nice job in building out the center of the plate. So in particular, those protein items that you're talking about, whether it's meat, seafood, poultry, and even the produce and dairy, along the way, so continue to, I think, see good opportunity there. A lot of it's fresh, not all of it though. I think it's still a little early to tell. We certainly acknowledge and are reacting and trying to be as proactive as possible in terms of some of the accelerating trends as it relates to the local and the organic and that type of thing as well as the ethnic opportunities. I would tell you those are real trends and meaningful and very important to our customers. I don't know that I can tell you today that that's really driving substantial dollars, but certainly it's an area where we need to be going forward.","I think your second question, I probably need to do a little more work on. I think we've had some good initiatives going on, both on the merchandising side of our business, in particular in conjunction with CatMan, in the sustainability area, and we're putting more resources into those. So let us come back to you on that in terms of how all that winds up going forward.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's helpful. And then just on deflation, I think last year when inflation was running quite a bit higher, there was some difficulty in passing all those on. Could you just talk about how deflation impacted your gross margin in the quarter? Was there any lag in passing that along? Was that helpful to the gross margin? Or I guess it depends on the category, but any color you could provide there?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I get this question a lot and I'm going to stay consistent with what I've always said. The ideal place for us to be would be to have two to three points of inflation across every category. I mean, that's as good as it gets, I've never seen it in 27 years of doing this. But that would be very good. And why is that? That's because history tells you and the data tells you that most of our customers are able to pass that type of increase along in a reasonably manageable way, and in a way that works for their business. So 2% to 3% overall would be fine. When it gets up over that, 4%, 5%, 6%, that's not good for our customers, and that's when it starts to also make it difficult for us to pass that much along on a timely basis.","Deflation would be the least attractive of all of those. It probably does \u2013 it certainly does help your margin to some extent in terms of the percentage. But as we all understand, you're taking fewer dollars to the bank to pay bills. So it puts a lot of pressure on your expenses along the way. So deflation, we haven't seen a lot of it. We did some work on this. I think over the last decade, we've only had deflation a couple times and I think it's ranged from, in one instance, 0.25% or so, in another instance, maybe up to 0.75%. We think we'll probably be on the longer end of that this time around. But it's a challenging environment. But I will tell you, I think we're doing a good job, striking the right balance in terms of managing that down in a way that works for the customer, but still is working for us, and I think you saw that in the numbers this quarter.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. And then just one other question. You talked in the beginning about some of the economic factors being somewhat mixed overall, but then you mentioned, I think, that there was a pretty sharp pullback in confidence among restaurant operators. And I was just curious you had any color on what you think drove that or what maybe you're hearing from your customers about why that would be?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think what we said on the restaurant part of it was it went back to kind of where we were about a year ago. So I mean it's still much improved over the last three or four years, both in consumer confidence and in those NRA statistics. We're almost back to where we were in 2009. Again, that's 2009, so need to put that in some context. It's hard to pinpoint. Look, restaurant operators, they're people like all of us. So I think when you see a stock market going up and down with that kind of volatility, it makes people nervous, and that could be part of it. What we're really telling you is there didn't seem to be any discernible medium-term trend. It's up for a quarter or two and then it's down and then back up again. So overall, in the context of looking back two, three, four years, it's much better. It's just hard to see a pattern here.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Just actually a quick follow-up on your comments on the industry. Could you talk a little bit about, if it's appropriate, October? And I ask this, whether it's casual dining or even some fast casual that there was some apparent slowdown in October relative to previous months. Is that something that you're seeing in terms of your Street and Broadline accounts as well?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually, I haven't seen a lot of October data yet, John. Our trends are pretty similar to what we saw in the first quarter. As I said, deflation has accelerated a little bit more, but we're not seeing any big change. It's tough for us week-to-week. Holidays fall on different weeks or days and that kind of thing, but I would just tell you sitting here, I can't tell you there's been any big shift in demand or anything like that.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And thank you for that. Then secondly, obviously, the restaurant industry gets the opposite of what it was a couple of years ago where there's no labor inflation and there is significant commodity inflation. So as you think about the pricing environment as you can pass on pricing to your restaurant customers as your own labor costs are higher. Do you think we're in an environment that could be modestly better from a pricing environment relative to what we've seen before?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry, could it be what?","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Are we in an environment where you can pass on more pricing to restaurant customers than you could before? I mean, I understand that you are \u2013 the pricing of your products coming in through your back door is deflationary, but is this a potentially better pricing environment from Sysco into the restaurant customers as restaurant customers are seeing (51:08)?","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't know about that. I think what you're hearing from us is we begin to develop a real revenue management process as there's opportunities for us with analytics in terms of the segmentation we're doing, both across product categories as well as customers. There's opportunities for us to be smarter and more consistent and to be more on the market in terms of what's important to our customers. So I think that's the bigger opportunity. I was with a customer the other day, and you were pointing out labor, it's the biggest thing we hear today from every customer we talk to, and you see it in the press. There's a labor shortage out there. They're having to adjust their cost structure accordingly. And I think that actually does the opposite of your question, it puts a little more pressure on us on pricing because they're always looking for opportunities to manage their costs. But overall, I'd say it's not a bad environment right now from a pricing standpoint, other than the deflation aspect of it.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thank you.","William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session.

Sysco\u2019s financial results announced this morning reflect a year of significant challenges, tremendous change and solid progress on multiple fronts. While the business environment remained challenging throughout the year and contributed to financial results that fell short of our initial expectations we did have many successes during the year.","Sales for the fiscal year grew 5% to $47 billion and adjusted net earnings were $1 billion. Cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $1.5 billion and free cash flow excluding the impact of certain items was $1.1 billion. We reduced our operating expenses per case by $0.06. We continued to implement transformational change on a broad scale throughout Sysco and remain on track to achieve our targeted three-year business transformation benefits in F2015.","We recommenced the rollout of our technology platform with much improved stability and performance. We increased our dividend during this past year, the 45th time since our founding in 1970. In total we distributed nearly $670 million in dividends to shareholders during F2014 and repurchased more than $330 million in stock. And we announced our intention to merge with US Foods which will provide substantial benefits to our customers and help us achieve more scale and efficiency in an evolving and highly competitive marketplace.","Turning to our results for the quarter, sales grew 5.9% to $12.3 billion and net earnings were $254 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.50 for the quarter which was flat compared to the prior-year period. While we did experience more expense pressure during the quarter than we had through the first three quarters we are pleased with the 4% increase in gross profit we achieved.","Inflation increased significantly at the end of Q3 and was 4.1% for Q4, contributing to our sales and gross profit growth while also pressuring our gross margin. However, a more beneficial mix of our local and corporate managed sales mitigated some of this pressure during the quarter. Our results reflect the impact of the slow and modest economic recovery in a food service industry that as a whole remains under pressure.","During the June quarter restaurant industry data indicates that some sequential market improvement occurred but year-over-year industry sales growth continues to be modest and traffic patterns remain stagnant. It\u2019s important to note that while restaurant traffic was essentially flat for our fiscal year Sysco\u2019s case volume grew more than 2% excluding the impact of acquisitions.","During the year we made significant progress in achieving our business transformation strategic initiatives that are aimed at implementing an enterprise resource planning or ERP technology platform, lowering product costs, and reducing our operating expense structure. ","Regarding our technology initiative in July we implemented our new ERP platform in our Salt Lake City and Albuquerque operating companies. In the past eight months we have successfully deployed seven operating companies under the new platform, bringing the total to twelve. Several of these recent deployments took place at some of our larger and more complex operating companies and many conversions occurred during a particularly busy time of year. We continued to learn and adjust with each go-live and as a result each one has been progressively more successful.","As disclosed previously we will focus for the remainder of the calendar year on implementing an SAP software version upgrade and further developing IT-related merger integration and sequencing plans. Our goal with the latter is to prioritize SAP implementation where it will help us achieve targeted synergies as soon as possible with minimal disruption to our customers. We will also continue to work to enhance the scalability of our shared business services processes to prepare for more conversions in the future. Our confidence has grown as we have gained more experience with our ERP conversions and we believe we have a solid foundation from which to move forward.","As we continued to implement our category management initiative this year we also focused on enhancing our execution of this effort in several important ways. We developed and implemented new field-ready sales tools, enhanced our customer service in support of this initiative, and improved communication and coordination with the field. Looking ahead we expect to launch the remainder of the categories in scope into the market by the end of F2015.","Regarding our operating initiatives during the year we continued to roll out our routing optimization project which is resulting in reduced routes and miles driven while improving on-time deliveries. We completed the conversion of our largest operating companies during the year and expect to complete the remaining by the end of F2015. ","Our fleet and equipment optimization initiative will reduce costs and optimize our capital spend as we move forward. During the year we established standard terms and specifications for fleet and warehouse equipment purchases and expect to complete the rationalization of our fleet by the end of this fiscal year. ","We also continued to implement our driver and warehouse incentive pay program, increased the application of best practices, and implemented tools to more effectively manage labor costs and expenses. In one of our US broad line markets we successfully piloted a program that increased the amount of recycled material in our operations by 75%. We expect to roll out this program across the country by the end of this calendar year which will also reduce costs.","It is appropriate to note at this point that much of the progress we have made in the last few years in driving out key strategic business initiatives has been led by Mike Green, Executive Vice President of Foodservice Operations. Mike recently announced his intention to retire at the end of the calendar year after a very distinguished 24-year career at Sysco. We wish Mike great success as he moves on to the next chapter of his life and we thank him for his service and many contributions to Sysco.","Turning to an update on the status of the US Foods merger, last week we announced a future senior leadership team that will report to me following the closing of the merger. This is an important step that will allow us to make further progress in our integration planning efforts, and I look forward to working closely with this team post-close. We also continue to work closely with the FTC as they review the transaction. Our discussions have been productive to date and are progressing as anticipated. We expect the merger to close either late in Q3 or in Q4.","In closing I\u2019m very encouraged with our progress during F2014 in strengthening our management team and enhancing our capabilities to serve our customers more effectively and operate our business more efficiently. I\u2019m very grateful to all of our associates for their hard work and dedication throughout F2014. The scope, breadth, and pace of change at Sysco during the year has been remarkable and importantly has provided us a solid foundation to take the next step in our transformational journey as we prepare for our proposed merger with US Foods.","Now I\u2019ll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for Q4 and the fiscal year.","Chris Kreidler","Thanks, Bill, and good morning everyone. For Q4 sales were $12.3 billion or an increase of 5.9% compared to the prior year. Food costs inflation was 4.1% driven mainly by inflation in the meat, dairy and seafood categories. In addition, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.6% and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.7%. Case volume grew 2.2% during the quarter including acquisitions and approximately 2.1% excluding acquisitions.","Gross profit in Q4 increased 4.0% and gross margin declined 31 basis points to 17.55%. During our May earnings call we indicated that inflation jumped substantially at the end of March. That trend continued and we saw a meaningful increase in inflation throughout the quarter. The overall rate was driven by inflation in the meat, seafood and dairy categories which together total more than one-third of our annual sales. ","We believe the rapid and marked increase in inflation during the period contributed to the sequential and year-over-year decline in gross margin; however, as Bill mentioned we also experienced a more beneficial mix of our local and corporate managed sales that mitigated some of this pressure during Q4.","Operating expenses totaled $1.7 billion in F4Q 2014 including $58.0 million in certain items. Excluding certain items, which mainly related to merger and integration planning expenses, operating expenses increased $78 million or 4.9% driven mainly by increased corporate and delivery costs and incremental expenses from acquired companies. Operating income for the quarter was down 7.7% year-over-year. After adjusting for certain items operating income increased 1.2%.","Net earnings for Q4 were $254 million, a decrease of $29 million or 10.2% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.43, an 8.5% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 which was flat compared to the prior year.","Now, turning to the year-over-year comparison, sales increased 4.7% or $2.1 billion. Product costs inflation was 2.1% driven mainly by inflation in the meat, seafood and dairy categories. In addition, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 1.4% and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates for the fiscal year decreased sales by 0.6%. Case volume grew 3.4% during the fiscal year including acquisitions and approximately 2.2% excluding acquisitions.","Gross profit increased 2.3% during the year while gross margin decreased 42 basis points year-over-year to 17.59% due mainly to weak restaurant traffic and competitive pressures. Operating expenses totaled $6.6 billion in F2014 including $150 million in certain items which primarily related to merger and integration planning expenses, a change in Sysco\u2019s self-insurance reserve, and a legal settlement. ","Excluding certain items operating expenses increased $201 million or 3.2% primarily due to new costs from acquired companies, higher delivery and corporate expenses, higher payroll costs and higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by lower sales organization costs and a decrease in retirement-related expense.","Operating costs per case excluding certain items declined year-over-year by $0.06, exceeding one of our key objectives for the year. As we\u2019ve discussed previously it is very difficult simply to hold operating costs per case flat due to typical inflationary pressures. This result reflects the significant impact from business transformation benefits during the year. Operating income was $1.6 billion, declining $71 million or 4.3% for the fiscal year. Excluding certain items operating income declined 0.9%.","Net earnings for F2014 were $932 million, decreasing $61 million or 6.1% compared to the prior year. F2014 EPS was $1.58, a decline of 5.4%. Excluding certain items EPS was $1.76 compared to $1.78 in the prior year.","Reflecting on our financial results for F2014 our overall results fell short of our expectations. However, if you look at the two halves of the year separately they were vastly different. The first half of the year saw low inflation, weak local sales growth, and weak gross profit growth of 1.2%. ","During the second half of the year inflation picked up as did local sales growth. Gross profits grew at a more robust rate of 3.4% in the second half of the year and 4.0% during Q4 in part driven by the increasing impacts from our business transformation initiatives. We are encouraged by the trends we have seen in the second half of the year and we are working hard to maintain and improve upon them for F2015. ","Business transformation expenses totaled $277 million in F2014 which was lower by $54 million for the year. Similar to what we discussed last quarter, roughly half of the variance year-to-date relates to a change that we made in how we allocate internal labor costs to the project. ","Prior to F2014 we allocated the costs of internal associates based upon the percentage of time they spent on the project. We are now allocating either all or none of an associate\u2019s cost to the project depending on whether they spent the majority of their time on the project. This has had the effect of shifting some expense from business transformation expense to general corporate expense.","The remainder of the year-to-date variance in business transformation expense is the result of capitalizing more of the work effort than originally estimated. Had we not experienced these changes total expenses would have been within our original guidance range of $300 million to $350 million.","As of the end of F2014 we were ahead of our business transformation benefit goals, achieving significant progress across multiple areas of our business. These efforts allowed us to exceed our cost per case objective and to mitigate the pressure on gross margins.","Total capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset sales totaled $497 million for the fiscal year, which was essentially flat compared to last year. This result was just slightly lower than our guidance of $500 million to $550 million. Free cash flow adjusted for the impact of certain items was $1.1 billion for the fiscal year, increasing approximately 3% compared to the prior-year period.","Looking ahead I\u2019d like to provide some guidance for key metrics as we typically do at this time of year to set expectations for the coming fiscal year. Please keep in mind that this guidance is for our current business only and does not include any impact from the proposed merger with US Foods. We anticipate providing additional guidance for the combined companies following the close of the transaction.","As we\u2019ve stated previously our long-term sales growth expectations are for sales to fall in a range of 4% to 6% annually. We believe this long-term guidance continues to be reasonable. This is nominal sales growth so it includes the impact of inflation which we assume will return to more modest historic levels. ","With regards to our three-year business transformation initiatives, we were well ahead of our objectives after years one and two. As we enter the third year of the initiatives we expect to achieve or exceed the high end of the $550 million to $650 million objective that we established two years ago. ","As a result, we expect that continued momentum and achieving lower cost of goods from our category management and sourcing initiatives will continue to help mitigate gross margin pressure from the intensely competitive marketplace. In addition we expect our business transformation initiatives will contribute to meet our objective of holding operating costs per case excluding certain items flat year-over-year in our North American broad line business. ","We expect corporate expenses will be higher, reflecting investments we are making to provide important new capabilities such as the new revenue management function and the implementation of organizational changes that we believe will drive greater functional support in our broad line operations. In addition we expect to make various investments in certain core technology resources. While the absolute dollar amount of expenses will be higher year-over-year our objective is to grow operating expenses at a slower rate than gross profit growth. Lastly, we expect capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset sales to be in a range of $500 million to $550 million. ","Turning to the pending US Foods merger, we continue to make progress in our integration planning efforts which are focused around three areas \u2013 day one readiness, value creation, and long-term organizational design. While we continue to work to finalize our synergy targets and the pace at which we will achieve these synergies we remain confident that we will be able to achieve or exceed the level of synergies we\u2019ve previously communicated.","Regarding the regulatory process, our dialog with the FTC continues to be productive and is progressing as expected. We continue to believe that this merger will benefit customers and help us become more efficient in an evolving and competitive marketplace and also believe the FTC will agree that our customers have many choices in the fiercely competitive marketplace in which we operate today. As Bill mentioned we expect the merger to close either late in Q3 or in Q4.","Finally I\u2019d like to take the opportunity to welcome our new Vice President of Investor Relations, Derrick Vialis, who joined us most recently from BMC Software. Derrick has significant experience in IR and finance and has been publicly recognized by the investment community for his professionalism and financial acumen. We are very pleased to have him join our team.","I would also like to take a moment to thank Shannon for stepping up to lead the IR team on an interim basis while we conducted our search for a permanent leader. Because of her leadership and efforts we didn\u2019t miss a beat. Once Shannon helps Derrick get up to speed she\u2019s going to transition into a new role here at Sysco heading up our sustainability efforts. I know you will join me in wishing her success in her new role.","In closing, while F2014 included its share of challenges we are excited about the progress in transforming our business and our integration planning efforts related to the US Foods merger. While we continue to have much work ahead of us we strongly believe that we are making the right strategic investments to strengthen our leadership position in the industry. With that, Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator instructions.) And we\u2019ll go first to Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","Hi, good morning, thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the ERP rollout. I know that you guys made some commentary earlier about how each one is really doing better than the one that was done prior to, so can you just talk a little bit, give us some color around what is new and what are you learning from the previous rollouts that you\u2019re putting into the newer ones?","Bill DeLaney","Sure Vincent, I\u2019ll take a shot at that one. So as we\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks we\u2019ve done about seven during the last eight or nine months \u2013 we did five in the fiscal year and just did two more here in July. I would say to you if you go back a year, a year and a half it goes beyond even the deployment, but the system itself is more stable today and then as we do deploy I believe we\u2019re doing a better job working with our people in the field, preparing them, making sure we\u2019re understanding what their challenges are so that not only do we have a good go-live weekend but once the system is live that we\u2019re able to operate the business with fewer glitches, that type of thing.","So there\u2019s still challenges. I would say two examples of things that are better is our service levels continue to come up and come back faster than what they did originally. And I would also tell you in some of the early conversions we would have some issues, especially with larger customers, that type of thing that, not to say that we don\u2019t have any today but I think we\u2019re much more coordinated internally with our corporate sales group and with our op cos as well as with the deployment team to plan for those challenges, anticipate them, handle them when they come up. But as we said in the text here learn from each one so that there\u2019s fewer issues as we go forward.","So we\u2019ve always done pretty well on the go-live weekends. I would just say post-conversion we\u2019re able to operate the business better; the systems, the performance of the systems is faster, it\u2019s more stable; on the sales side generally much fewer issues today with our sales force and our customers in terms of some of the basics on order entry, that kind of thing.","Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","Okay, thank you. And one just quick follow-up if I may: with inflation I know you said you were expecting it to return to kind of more modest levels. Have you been seeing some evidence of changes within those three particular categories that you called out this quarter?","Bill DeLaney","We haven\u2019t seen it yet. I think what we\u2019re saying is people that we all follow and just looking at some overview reports on commodities and that type of thing, and just the math of this thing as you get into the last third of next year we would expect it to subside some. But at this point it\u2019s still very comparable to what we\u2019ve seen in the last three or four months.","Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","Okay, great. Thanks very much, good luck.","Bill DeLaney","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse ","Yeah hi, good morning guys. A quick question for you on expense growth: it was a little bit higher than what we expected this quarter. It seems like, and I might be wrong but it seems like cost per case may have been up this quarter and it was down I guess for the first three quarters of the year. Can you maybe just talk about what is going on with expenses and then how we should sort of think about it from here?","Bill DeLaney","Yeah, why don\u2019t we tag team this one, Ed? So I would say it was up and more than what we would have liked to have seen, and there\u2019s two pieces to it which Chris took you through on the operations side. ","Our delivery costs, we\u2019re still having some challenges there. We\u2019re doing some good things on delivery but there\u2019s challenges in the labor market, in certain markets we\u2019ve had some basic issues that we could have managed better I think on comp and that type of thing. So there\u2019s still some transition. Even though we\u2019re putting in some good initiatives on the delivery side it\u2019s still early days; it takes some time for those to get traction. And delivery\u2019s always the hardest expense to manage, but we should do better than what we\u2019re doing there right now and I would expect us to as the new year goes along.","The second part of it was more conscious on our part that Chris alluded to, where you know, we\u2019ve got some good things going on here with cat man and revenue management. There are some areas where we need to invest in the technology infrastructure beyond the SAP platform and so we have begun to make those investments. So we did that consciously and those are the right things to be doing for the company, not just in the short-term, in the mid-term. So we could have, probably should have managed the expenses a little bit better. Again, I\u2019m real pleased with the gross profit dollar growth and hopefully you\u2019ll see that get calibrated more effectively here as we go into the new year.","Chris Kreidler","Hi Ed, the only thing I\u2019ll add on the cost per case, your specific question of whether it was up in Q4, it was actually. If you recall a couple of quarters ago when I was commenting about where we are versus our nickel, we were actually pretty far ahead of our nickel per case reduction \u2013 I think at the time we were $0.09 or $0.10 down. ","And I was telegraphing that while we thought we\u2019d beat the nickel I wasn\u2019t expecting us to maintain the $0.09 or $0.10, and the reason for that is the delivery costs kind of plagued us throughout the year. They continued to be up and we were lapping some of the SG&A benefits that we got from the selling costs and some of the G&A costs as well. So we actually knew that coming into Q4 if we didn\u2019t start to make some headway on the delivery costs that we were probably going ot have a reversal in Q4, which is what happened.","So I\u2019ll agree with Bill. I think there are things we can and should be doing and doing better and we continue to work on those, but that\u2019s kind of the color on the cost per case. And the answer on the corporate costs was dead on.","Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse ","Okay, and then just to follow up on gross profit per case, you did a nice job this quarter of growing gross profit ahead of case growth again this quarter. Could you just maybe talk about, maybe a little bit more about the drivers? How much is internal, things like category management versus mix versus what\u2019s going on from a competition standpoint and how that\u2019s impacting you? Any color behind the driver there and then the sustainability of this trend would be helpful, thank you.","Bill DeLaney","Well I think, Ed, as we said and I know it\u2019s kind of a recurring theme here but that\u2019s the reality of our business right now \u2013 the marketplace continues to be highly competitive. Our customers are under a lot of pressure from the consumer to offer innovative experiences in food and presentations and to do it more and more cost-effectively. So obviously we need to be more responsive and we are responsive to that. So there\u2019s a macro headwind that we continue to fight.","In terms of where the mitigation of the improvements are coming from, I think from all the areas you just mentioned. I think certainly since late last fall we\u2019ve done a better job managing our margins I think more effectively internally. I think you are seeing some benefits of cat man begin to become more pronounced. The mix did help a little bit this quarter. It\u2019s more of a balanced mix between locally managed customer growth and sales growth and corporate managed. Inflation helped some too, there. ","So we\u2019re kind of at a point where inflation\u2019s probably a little bit higher than what we\u2019d like to see right now certainly in those three categories but it is a little bit of a tailwind as it relates to that, to the margin dollar growth. But at the same time it\u2019s more difficult to pass that price increase along to our customers as fast as we might like, and I think as we said on the last call in most instances we frankly shouldn\u2019t pass along that fast and we have to manage that as best we can. So it\u2019s coming from all areas.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. ","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities ","So Bill, going back to the gross margin topic, two things \u2013 what was the cadence of pass through roughly, because again, it looked at first glance that it was perhaps a little more rapid than I would have guessed but it sounds like it wasn\u2019t. And then secondly, with the mix changes was that more tactical, some course corrections or more strategic that\u2019s been brewing for a while?","Bill DeLaney","Probably I\u2019d plead tactical on the latter. We feel we\u2019re running our locally managed business better. We put this company and in particular our sales force and op cos and customers through a lot with a lot of these initiatives, and many of them either directly, John, or indirectly impacted our salespeople and to some extent our customers. So we\u2019ve cycled a lot of that on the sales side and now we\u2019ve gotten the benefits from it, but I think things are a little more stable on that front. ","We\u2019re able to focus more, and like I said we\u2019re giving them better tools to support the cat man rollout, (inaudible) revenue management work is starting to gain some traction. So yeah, I think we\u2019re doing a better job managing the local business. It\u2019s still modest growth but it\u2019s growth. I would be fine with a little bit more growth on the corporate side; it just so happens it\u2019s moderated to some degree so there is no big, strategic initiative there. We are obviously always trying to get better at the profitability and how we manage the profitability of the business. ","So I think it\u2019s mostly that we\u2019re managing the locally side better. As far as the first part can you take me through that question again? I\u2019m not really sure I understood it.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities ","Yeah, I was curious how you\u2019re managing the pace of pass through. You had a big step up sequentially, that\u2019s always challenging. Again, it looked at first glance like you probably got a lot of pass through one during the quarter but my guess is that\u2019s not the case, right?","Bill DeLaney","Well I don\u2019t know exactly how you\u2019re interpreting the data. We got 4% GP growth on 2% case growth and 6% sales growth, so I\u2019d say we got our fair share but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s more or less. I think our people do a really good job responding to the environment that they\u2019re in and trying to make good decisions on how much to pass along, when to pass along, how to work with the customer to find ways to cut their costs so that they don\u2019t have to pass along as much to their customers or to the consumers. So yeah, I think we\u2019re getting better at it, John, but I wouldn\u2019t say we necessarily passed on as much as theoretically we could have.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities ","Alright. And then lastly you talked about \u201915 operating expense growth being less than gross profit growth. Is that more expense growth being ratcheted back or just with the prevalence of inflation here GP dollar growth is going to be a bit elevated because of that for the next couple of quarters?","Chris Kreidler","John, that commentary was mainly just to help a little bit with expectations for \u201915 and how are we going to look at whether we\u2019re spending too much money on operating expenses or not. We clearly want to grow gross profit dollars as much as we can where as we\u2019ve talked in the last few quarters we\u2019re struggling with a number of things on that front right now and we think we\u2019re seeing some good trends on that front. But in the meantime we\u2019ve always got to control operating expenses. So that\u2019s the governor we\u2019re putting on it \u2013 we\u2019re not going to get operating expenses grow faster than gross profit dollars, not in our planning anyway.","I think the only other color I\u2019d put on it is as Bill commented, we\u2019ve stood up some capabilities here at corporate and in the field that we think, both new functions and strengthening existing functions, that we think are going to add a lot of value. You take some upfront costs to put those in place and then they\u2019re in your run rate, so the growth rate should diminish over time because those are now built into your run rate.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities ","Alright, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.","Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey there. Just a couple questions on the integration costs. It looks like obviously you\u2019ve given us $90 million for the year-to-date integration, and I guess I was just wondering if you could give us a little more color on what exactly goes into those costs just to get a sense of kind of how far you are along?","Chris Kreidler","Yeah, the vast majority of those costs is what I\u2019d call professional fees, so between our integration consultants, McKinsey and other third parties that are helping us in each of the different functional areas prepare for the integration, do the planning work for that. There\u2019s just a lot of external cost that goes into that. We also throw into that categorization anybody that is fulltime on the integration project, which is not a large number of people but we make sure that we pull those expenses out as well.","Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of corporate for next year just remind me, is this Q4 the first time that we\u2019ve had this change in the allocation of the expenses in the corporate, because corporate was quite a bit higher in Q4 than what I would have expected.","Chris Kreidler","Yeah, I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re referring to about changing the-","Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank","In terms of the labor allocation, instead of allocating any labor hours you were either all allocated, it was either all allocated to corporate or not?","Chris Kreidler","Yeah, no, with regards to the ERP project that\u2019s actually a change that we put in place at the beginning of the fiscal year so no, that wasn\u2019t a Q4-only impact.","Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So what would have driven the higher corporate specifically this Q4, and then I guess the follow-on is this kind of Q4 run rate the right type of number to use for next year, because obviously if we use that it would be up and would not be consistent with your guidance. I\u2019m just wondering how much higher it could be.","Chris Kreidler","Yeah, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right run rate to use for next year. We obviously can\u2019t give you an actual run rate or a percentage number to use. I think you guys have to build something into your models. As I said earlier, we stood up some functionality; we started taking some increased expenses in Q3 and in Q4 for that. You\u2019ll eventually lap that so on a growth basis you won\u2019t see that particular piece of the growth going forward. So that\u2019s part of what occurred in the corporate, and there\u2019s some other stuff that\u2019s in there as well but it\u2019s certainly not a run rate that we expect to continue.","Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then just a last question, in the press release that you issued last week with the new positions, I guess there were two positions that stuck out to me at least as being fairly new to Sysco \u2013 the Lead of Sysco\u2019s Domestic and International Operations as well as the Lead on End-to-End Supply Chain both joined in 2013. I\u2019m just wondering those obviously seem like fairly significant roles in terms of the combined company \u2013 maybe just some color there given that they both joined fairly recently.","Bill DeLaney","Sure. Let me make sure you\u2019re talking about Tom Ben\u00e9 over in Operations and Scott Charlton over Supply Chain, Karen?","Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yep.","Bill DeLaney","Yeah, so these gentlemen are both folks that have joined us here over the last year, year and a half. Tom has twenty plus years with Pepsi and Scott has twenty plus years in multiple areas, retail grocers but big types of supply chain background. So they both have come in. Tom has spent the last 15 months or so building his presence, both working with our merchandising team initially, getting cat man rolled out to the field; and then beyond that has gotten more involved in sales and marketing and some of the inbound aspects of supply chain over the last 9 to 12 months. So two very highly experienced people that have been great additions to the team and have great capabilities, so we\u2019re very excited about it.","Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks for taking my questions. I think, Chris, one of the recent questions you were asked was about these investments and I was just wondering, particularly technology investments, if you can quantify that and give us some sense of the cadence of those costs?","Chris Kreidler","Yeah, I\u2019m just trying to think about what I said that would lead to that specific type of question. So we\u2019ve continued to spend on technology. Most of our expenditures on technology have been around the ERP implementation, so within business transformation; and we kind of called out those expenses, and on a kind of like-for-like methodology they were right in line with our guidance of $300 million to $350 million. ","We didn\u2019t spend substantially more on technology if you will during F2014 than we expected to spend, so while there\u2019s an uptick there it\u2019s not a sizable uptick. What we\u2019re calling out for \u201915 in terms of guidance is there is a little bit more that we anticipate spending for next year. It\u2019s not going to be huge, huge dollars but there\u2019s going to be a little bit more. ","As we roll into the new year we\u2019re going to look at perhaps calling out some additional guidance around technology spend in total, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re talking about internally. It\u2019s a big part of our budget. We understand that; we also think it\u2019s a big part of our competitive advantage so it\u2019s something that we may give more color to as we move forward.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, I was just hoping to get that color now as I work on my model for next year. I have I think sort of almost a housekeeping question: it sounds like you\u2019ve made great progress in rolling out ERP. Could you talk about how many facilities in total you intend to implement the technology?","Bill DeLaney","Well, we\u2019ve rolled it out to a dozen, Meredith, and we\u2019ve got 70 give or take in the US today. So I would say that 70 would be the target. Obviously that doesn\u2019t include Canada and we\u2019ll deal with that when we get there. The bigger point I think and what we alluded to in my comments was that with the merger on the horizon here we\u2019re going to focus on some updates to the software packages themselves and put together as best we can a cohesive deployment integration plan, factoring in obviously the new facilities and the new businesses that will come in from US. So it\u2019s 70 today and we haven\u2019t determined in totality yet how many operations we\u2019ll have going forward. So it\u2019ll be clearly more than that; it\u2019ll be less than the two together, I can tell you that.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Bill DeLaney","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.","Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies ","Hi, good morning. Just want to know if you\u2019ve found any other insights in working in that clean room with US Foods \u2013 any new insights on synergies or are things tracking as you had originally thought?","Chris Kreidler","Yeah, Mark, they don\u2019t let me in the clean room so I really can\u2019t tell you much.","Bill DeLaney","There\u2019s nobody on this call that can handle clean room insights, Mark. [laughter]","Chris Kreidler","You know, Mark, it\u2019s a good question and let me just take it up to maybe 50,000 feet because I think that\u2019s the essence of your question anyway. What I said in my prepared remarks I\u2019ll obviously stick to. The more we get into this, the more work that we do, the more integration planning that we\u2019re able to do especially around value capture the more confident we get that we will be able to meet or exceed the guidance that we\u2019ve already put on the table. We\u2019ll obviously come out with more information when we\u2019re ready but yeah, we\u2019ve gotten quite a bit of confidence as we\u2019ve been into the details.","Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies ","Okay. And how much timing do you need to really close things from the point that you get a decision out of FTC?","Chris Kreidler","I\u2019ve got to be careful how I answer that because the term \u201cwhen you get a decision from the FTC,\u201d I think I\u2019ll answer it this way: once we know that we\u2019re allowed to close the transaction we\u2019ll close it as rapidly as possible, so literally within a very, very short period of time so that we can begin the integration process.","Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies ","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald. ","Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald ","Yeah, hi, good morning. First on business transformation on the rollout, so far it seems like the operating companies that have been converted seem to have a very regional profile. So do you have any plans to convert companies on the East Coast for example? Can you give any plans for the rollout to other regions, and also maybe comment on why you\u2019re focusing on any particular geographies at this time? Thanks.","Bill DeLaney","Yeah, Ajay, we actually consciously went to more of a regional focus in the Southwest and then up into the Mountain states, and the original plan was then to do the Mountain market and come back and finish the Southwest. Those early conversions were a little bumpier, we needed some time to go back there and address some issues, that kind of thing. But again, with the merger on the horizon I can\u2019t really tell you. ","So on a steady state basis I think you\u2019d find us finished up in those two regions or markets and then we\u2019d go to a third. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s a better way to do these types of things. You get leadership engagement, both the market leadership level and the op cos tend to work together on a lot of things \u2013 it just creates more of a team type of approach. So we\u2019ve actually found that to be quite successful and that\u2019s a change we made about a year, year and a half ago. Again, going forward I\u2019m going to defer I think until we get to where we have clear visibility as to what the whole landscape looks like post-merger.","Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald ","Okay. But there\u2019s no structural impediment to rolling out to other regions.","Bill DeLaney","No. We have RDCs, you know, a big RDC in the Northeast and one in Florida so there was some work that we needed to do to prepare for that, but it\u2019s not an impediment, it just needed a little bit more time. There\u2019s no impediments.","Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald ","Okay. And I think Chris talked about the shift in allocation from business transformation expenses to ordinary operating expenses. And this is a follow-up to Karen\u2019s question earlier \u2013 I had a question as to whether the opposite is true in the case of integration and planning costs for US Foods. So first as a comment, I know you talked about consulting fees but it seems like the costs that you\u2019re absorbing are merger expenses, it seems very high especially given that things are still in the review process and it sounds like that review is taking longer than you previously expected. ","But in terms of how you\u2019re allocating those costs, is it possible that if the merger was not happening that some of those expense, like certain headcount expenses for example that you\u2019re currently allocating towards integration, that those would otherwise be considered ordinary operating expenses? I\u2019m just trying to confirm if all those integration costs are incremental.","Chris Kreidler","It\u2019s a very good question, Ajay, and I think we could have a robust debate about it. We actually, I believe I\u2019ve been fairly conservative about what goes into those categories. We\u2019re not putting in the cost of a lot of folks that are working a lot on merger integration planning because they also have their fulltime jobs, and so we\u2019re being pretty judicious about what goes in there. Your comment about professional fees, believe me, I wish they were much lower but these types of services and this type of experience comes with a hefty price tag and so we are paying a significant amount of dollars to be prepared. ","And while I respect your comment that it doesn\u2019t seem like we\u2019re very far in the process, believe me there\u2019s a regulatory process that occurs in the background and we\u2019re going to continue to say it\u2019s pretty much going as expected. But in the foreground you\u2019re doing a tremendous amount of planning to be ready the day that you close the transaction. And so we\u2019ve had a fairly large group of people allocated into 30 different business functional teams working in each of these areas on how to merge the two companies on day one, how to go after the value capture and synergies, and then how to design their organizations. ","There\u2019s been a tremendous amount of work that\u2019s been done and we\u2019ve had external consultancy professionals helping us all along the way. So it\u2019s a tremendous amount of work that\u2019s been done, a lot of hard work by a lot of people that is reflected in these dollars as well as the hours so that when the thing is approved you\u2019re ready to go. Unfortunately you can\u2019t wait for it to be approved and then decide that you\u2019re going to plan for how to integrate the two companies together. It\u2019s something we have to do every day.","Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald ","Okay, and if I can just ask one final question \u2013 I wanted to ask about your recent investment in Iowa Premium Beef. That seems like a nontraditional type of venture for Sysco so I\u2019m just wondering if that signifies anything. Are you looking to potentially get more involved in food processing and be more fully integrated in food production?","Bill DeLaney","I think all it signifies, Ajay, great question, is we see an opportunity to partner with some really quality people in that business and to create a premium product, a value-added product which we believe will create more traction with our sales force and with our customers. So I think you could see us do niche type of investments in the future but that\u2019s an opportunity that came our way and we\u2019re moving forward with it, but I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it.","Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald ","Okay, thank you.","Bill DeLaney","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Thanks, good morning. Given really how quickly the inflation accelerated right at the beginning of the quarter in meat and stuff, seafood, dairy, I think you guys said you managed it pretty well. What\u2019s your sense of what happened at the restaurant level with customers and passing it through? It looks like the macro numbers you gave for the industry suggested there\u2019s a little strengthening in the industry. So getting at this inflation seems like it\u2019s going to be here for a while at an elevated level in some of these key categories and what\u2019s your guys\u2019 sense of how long it\u2019s going to take to pass it through?","Bill DeLaney","Yeah, let me be clear \u2013 I\u2019m not clear on how long it\u2019s going to be here but certainly it\u2019s been with us for five or six months now. And I think from what I\u2019ve been reading which is I\u2019m sure the same material you read in those categories, customers are\u2026 Obviously they have to pass them along at some point. These are double-digit increases. So I think they are selectively passing it along where they feel that they can support it in their business; I\u2019m sure they\u2019re also working their menus. ","Poultry is a category that at least to date has not experienced much inflation so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re seeing more poultry offerings and that type of thing. So I think they\u2019re managing the portions, I think they\u2019re managing the mix of the menu and they\u2019re passing it along where they can. That\u2019s been my experience in terms of going out to eat. ","As we\u2019ve said, medium- to long-term the data we\u2019ve seen over the years is about what gets passed along from the restaurant to the consumer is about 2% year in and year out, so that\u2019ll oscillate a little bit but probably not a lot. So there may be a little bit more being passed along right now but I don\u2019t think a lot. And I think the other thing that validates that is when you look at some of the other numbers from the summer that you know, we\u2019re seeing year-over-year sales growth at the restaurant level but we\u2019re seeing flat to down traffic, so I think that would validate that as well.","Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Gotcha. And moving on to the, I think this was the first quarter in a while where your MA served business is up at broad line \u2013 it\u2019s up marginally but it\u2019s up. What should we look at? You referenced just lapping when it was down but I\u2019m trying to tie it into some of the investment it sounds like you\u2019ve made internally into sales management, whether it\u2019s the sales (inaudible) you called out or the regional management and coordination. Can you just give a little color on that?","Bill DeLaney","Yeah, I think what I was trying to articulate was not so much lapping as just a fair amount of the stress that we\u2019ve put on the organization in particular in the sales arena, and that we\u2019ve lapped a lot of that. So yeah, I think things are more stable out there today than they were 12 or 18 months ago in terms of people just going to work every morning. They know what their role is, they know what their territory is, they know what their commission plan is, they know how cat man works, they\u2019ve got better tools for that and we\u2019re giving them some other tools to work with in other areas like revenue management. ","So I think from that standpoint we\u2019ve made a lot of investments and we\u2019re at a point now where we\u2019re managing that better. So I\u2019m pretty optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to see a good improvement. To your point, it\u2019s modest but you know, everything in this industry right now is modest. As long as it\u2019s positive you know, we\u2019re going to be very pleased.","Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Yeah. And just a last thing on, it seems like a pretty good environment for business that\u2019s generating a lot of savings on the cost side, on the cost of goods sold side with all the inflation out there to go after share, maybe really invest that more into the customers than previously planned in sort of a more flat inflation environment. What is your business\u2019 appetite for that kind of strategic sense in the next little while?","Bill DeLaney","I think we\u2019ve been able to grow our share consistently year in and year out, so that\u2019s what we do. We think that\u2019s very important but to do it the right way. So our way of going after share is really to become more efficient in everything that we do, to take costs out of our system. It\u2019s one of the big opportunities. We see this merger as very pro-customer, pro-competition; it allows us to take costs out, that kind of thing. ","So the way you grow your share ultimately is to take costs out of the system, develop your people, hire better people where you need to and compete as well as you can in terms of the acute pressures in the marketplace, but to also differentiate yourself over the medium- and long-term as well with your products, your services, your business solutions. So we\u2019re always looking to grow but we need to grow profitably both in the short-term and the medium-term.","Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Bill DeLaney","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Erin Lash with Morningstar. ","Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar ","Thank you for taking the question. Obviously US Foods is getting a lot of the attention but I was just wondering if you could talk about the overall I guess acquisition environment and kind of your appetite for future deals, as well as just kind of the premiums that sellers are potentially looking for in this type of environment.","Chris Kreidler","Yeah, Erin, I\u2019ll take that one. We continue to look at transactions. We\u2019re obviously fairly occupied right now with planning for the merger integration so we don\u2019t have as many resources probably looking at transactions as we would in other quarters, other years. We also, it\u2019s going to be a little difficult to do deals in the US for a little bit of time at least while we get this one approved but we continue to look in our other markets and we continue to look in new markets, and we\u2019re fairly prudent especially if it\u2019s a new market. So they\u2019ll come a little slower. But I\u2019d say we\u2019re still pretty active and still looking for opportunities in other parts of our geographies and new geographies.","The second part of your question in terms of expectations, I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019ve really seen a marked change in expectations in terms of pricing from call it a year ago. I think there was a time when we talked about it on these calls, where expectations were pretty high given where the macroeconomics were. I think those moderated some. We\u2019ve been able to get a lot of deals done and I think they\u2019ve held in that kind of reasonable range since then.","Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar ","Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just one other question: obviously I get the sense with the US Foods integration that there isn\u2019t a target I guess this year for the ERP rollout. Is that true or are there maybe a certain number of operating companies that you are looking to complete by the end of the fiscal year?","Bill DeLaney","There\u2019s not a specific target, Erin, you\u2019re right. What we want to do is get the merger closed and then get the integration connected to that, and then we\u2019ll put together a rollout schedule that would incorporate both platforms if you will.","Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar ","Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan.","Amod Gautam \u2013 J.P. Morgan ","Hi, it\u2019s actually Amod Gautam. In terms of the acquisition question maybe a little bit more specifically, in your F2015 planning are you budgeting any cash flow for acquisitions? Or I guess asked another way, is the 4% to 6% sales growth, does that include some contribution from acquisition obviously ex the US Foods?","Chris Kreidler","Yeah, we actually plan those differently. So what we typically do is we look at a long-term expectation for sales growth. We\u2019ve said 4% to 6% for a while. We build that up from the standpoint of what do we think real cases are going to grow in the industry, how much more do we think we will grow because we\u2019re typically pretty good at growing faster than the industry; what\u2019s the rate of inflation that should go on top of that; and then does that fall within the 4% to 6% range, yes or no? We still feel good about 4% to 6%, that\u2019s how we build that up.","Some of those cases may indeed come from acquisitions when we think about how much more than the industry we can grow so that\u2019s how it gets baked in there. Separately we typically task ourselves with a certain percentage of growth through acquisitions, what we\u2019ll call kind of the smaller, non-US-Food-type-size acquisitions. We\u2019ve traditionally said that we want to grow at least 1% from those types of acquisitions. We haven\u2019t put that guidance out there for next year again because of the pending merger here but we certainly challenge ourselves to hit some internal targets along those lines as well.","Amod Gautam \u2013 J.P. Morgan ","Okay, and then on the gross margins I guess, Bill, you alluded a little bit to the mix shift being somewhat tactical on the locally managed versus the corporate business. I mean as you think about F2015 gross margin percent has kind of come down over the past few years but it does seem like you have some potential tailwinds here, whether it be that mix shift or inflation coming off or some of the category management initiatives. So just broadly on F2015, is this a year where maybe gross margin percentage can stabilize after several years of decline.","Bill DeLaney","Well, I think you\u2019ve got to start with improving over F2014, so that\u2019s our goal. And as Chris pointed out in his comments we saw that improvement kick in the second half of the year. So we saw 4% here in this quarter so that\u2019s encouraging. There\u2019s some inflation in that like we\u2019ve acknowledged, so I think if we can just show good, steady improvement throughout the year and manage our expenses appropriately we\u2019ll have a successful year. ","And as we continue to drive up these initiatives, and these are not just one-time initiatives. These are different ways of doing business. Category management is a different way of selling and marketing and merchandising. Revenue management is a different way of segmenting your customers and trying to approach your customers with the best offerings that we can with the right presentation with the right channel, those types of things.","So I would just say to you we\u2019re in the early days of transforming this company in terms of how we need to compete and how we need to support our customers for them to be successful. And that will undergird all of this in terms of our ability to price effectively and manage our costs along the way.","Chris Kreidler","Yeah, I\u2019ll just add a little more to that. I mean I\u2019ll pick up on Bill\u2019s comment of early days. We\u2019ve said before that we\u2019ve got two of the waves, the majority of two waves kind of fully into the market at this point of our category management initiatives and we\u2019ve got a lot more waves to come. Now those two that are out there were a lot of dollars but we\u2019ve got a lot more waves to come. And the point of that being that we still have a lot to roll out. ","We still have the opportunity to do better and better and we just have to keep working at it. It required some patience on our part to build the teams, build the processes, get it started. We believe we\u2019re starting to see some of those results in the numbers now and we\u2019re hopeful those numbers continue to shine in the numbers every quarter. And that as we\u2019re saying we believe mitigates whatever competitive pressure is out there.","Amod Gautam \u2013 J.P. Morgan ","Okay, great. Thanks and good luck.","Bill DeLaney","Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. We thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. ",""]}}
