Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Liz Werner","Thank you, Anthony. Before we get started this morning, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. Actual performance and events may differ, possibly materially, from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause this include the factors described in our first and second quarter 10-Q and our 2016 Form 10-K under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and under Risk Factors. AIG is not under any obligation and disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","Today's presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in the slides for today's presentation and in our financial supplement, both of which are available on our website.","This morning, you'll have the opportunity to hear from various members of our senior management team including Brian Duperreault, Sid Sankaran, Rob Schimek and Kevin Hogan. And with us in the room today are Peter Zaffino, Seraina Macia and Doug Dachille.","The format will follow the past calls then we'll ask you to ask one question and one follow-up and then please get back into queue for any additional questions.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Brian Duperreault.","Brian Duperreault","Well, thank you. Good morning. It's great to be here today and talking to you about AIG. It's been busy few months and I'd like to give you a sense of where we are as a company and why I am excited about AIG's future.","The second quarter was a great indication of breadth of our businesses and the opportunities for grow they provide. Overall, our second quarter results were solid. Consumer delivered another strong quarter led by personal insurance profit growth. Commercial continued to execute on its mix shift and managed through a very challenging Property and Casualty market. Before I get into the numbers, I want to note that going forward we will no longer be providing guidance or targets, but today I will speak to the actions that will improve the bottom line and drive shareholder value. Financial targets are important in how we manage the Company, but they have to put in balance. I would like to share my thoughts on Commercial, Consumer, talent, growth and capital.","Over the past few months, I spent my time in the field and with our business leaders. As you might expect, I started with Commercial. Our goal in Commercial is to improve the bottom line and the best way to do that near-term is to shift our mix of business while continuing the emphasis on risk selection. The Commercial team has made good progress reducing our U.S. casualty exposure, shrinking the gross book by a third from 2015. Those risks were easily absorbed by the market and we\u2019ve seen a market with capacity and underrated prices, terms and conditions that we find unacceptable.","Improvements in our underwriting are emerging and will continue to positively impact our results, but we are not done, we still have portfolio that don't meet profit targets including Property. Given market condition, fixing them most likely will require further reductions in premiums written. Disciplined underwriting should also reduce the concern surrounding our reserves. This quarter roughly 16 billion of reserves were reduced, including some of our most challenged lines where we've seen adverse development in the fourth quarter of previous years. Most recent accident years which are still green are developing as expected. I believe our reserve review and loss pick process is sound.","Moving on to Consumer. These businesses represent roughly half of the Company's core equity and are valuable source of earning stability. We enjoy leading market positions across many products and distribution channels, which allow us to maintain profitability in evolving markets. Personal insurance in particular has significantly contributed to the quarter's profit growth and provides a great opportunity for future growth. Expense discipline is a hallmark of a great company. Good work has been done to reduce our cost structure. A balance needs to be set so that we invest in both people and technology that produce long-term productivity gains while addressing costs that produce no value add.","I heard many concerns about talent before I arrived. It is no question AIG lost talent. It was also blessed with a strong bench. The job now is to rebuild that bench. We're regaining our position as the best company to work for in our industry. I'm going to take full advantage of that as a net acquirer of talent. You've seen our recent announcements and we're excited that Peter Zaffino and Seraina Macia have joined the team. I have spent five years working with Peter. I know that his focus on leadership and leadership will drive operating excellence and expand AIG's franchise.","Seraina is no stranger to AIG and she's coming back as the CEO of our new technology driven subsidiary. Under her leadership, we will build upon the Hamilton USA platform where she was previously CEO. I also intend to maximize the value the AIG's international footprint in over 80 countries. The global presence simply can be duplicated and we will empower our people to develop and expand upon it. As I mentioned back in May, I'm here to grow the Company profitably. In addition to targeted organic growth opportunities, we will consider acquisitions that are strategically complimentary. I have a track record of building value to acquisitions and you could expect that bring that experience and philosophy to AIG.","We will consider opportunities that are additive with respect to diversification and the balance they bring to our existing portfolio and capabilities along with future profitable growth. Areas where we see opportunities may be found internationally, in personal alliance, life insurance and in the U.S. small and middle market to name a few. Our capital management strategy will support our goal of profitable growth, and while we will return capital shareholders, we intend to prioritize our investments in organic and inorganic opportunities. We still have a buyback authorization in place and we will consider return, but there are no longer targeting an annual amount per share repurchase. We\u2019ve already repurchased half of the Company\u2019s market cap over the past three years.","Going forward, our priority is to allocate capital to support profitable growth both organic and inorganic. This company generates a significant amount of free cash flow and as we generate excess cash, we can consider capital return including our dividend payoff given our growth outlook. To reiterate, my comments at Consumer Investor Day, growth and profitability and book value are the measures of success in our business. Finally, on the topic of being a bank city -- non-bank city I should say. I've looked at it and I think, if you consider where we're today, we would not meet the hurdles for that designation. This company has dramatically changed its risk profile and controls since the financial crisis.","The data use for designating firms supports that statement when you compare us to peers and we will continue to work with our numerous regulators to demonstrate the substantial and successful de-risking that AIG has achieved. I often remind everyone that there are few companies in the insurance industry with the scale, global footprint and brand of AIG, not only I'm excited by what I've seen, I know what this company is capable of doing based on my long history at the Company and my prior roles at one of the largest broker partners and largest competitors. My goal is to make AIG better than it's been.","In closing I look forward to speaking with you again on our progress, and with that, I will turn it over to Sid.","Sid Sankaran","Thank you, Brian, and good morning everyone. This morning I'll comment on our second quarter financial results and provide an update on our capital and liquidity.","Turning to slide 4, we reported after-tax operating earnings of $1.53 per share, driven by solid operating performance, led by our Consumer business and in particular personal insurance. Our results benefited from strong alternative investment returns driven by favorable equity markets and lower than expected cat losses. Even after we\u2019re moving except alternative investment returns, prior year development and lower than expected cat. Normalized EPS was $1.33. Book value per share ex-AOCI grew 2% during the quarter to $76.12 and 4% year-to-date. Book value per share growth in the long-term remains an important objective for us in accessing value creation for our shareholders.","AIG's adjusted ROE was 10.5% and is shown on Page 5, and our core normalized ROE was 9.9% for the quarter. Capital management, operating efficiencies and personal insurance profitability positively contributed to the core ROE and were offset by increased commercial loss fix from the second half of 2016. The year-to-date core normalized ROE was 9.2%, and we believe we are on track to demonstrate profitability in our core insurance operations for the full year.","Consumer delivered another strong quarter and saw 33% increase in pretax operating income relative to prior year. Consumers normalized ROE was roughly 13% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. Nearly 90% of Consumer insurance attributed equity generated a double digit return this quarter. Commercial continues to execute on a strategy of mix shift and risk selection in a challenging market environment, which is evidenced in our reduction of net written premiums. Year-over-year comparisons are impacted by the second half 2016 increases in loss picks for U.S. casualty and programs as well as an increase in Property and Special Risk losses. Rob will speak to these items further in his remarks.","During the quarter, we accelerated the number of detailed reserving reviews we performed at Liability and Financial Lines compared to a year ago. We completed reviews of reserves totaling roughly $16 million, including primary and excess general liability, medical malpractice and environmental. Historically, these have been among our most challenging lines and had contributed roughly half of prior year development in the past two years. Also note that typically these lines have been reviewed in the fourth quarter in previous years. Based on our reviews, we recorded 21 million of net adverse prior year development in liability and financialized operating earnings, net of reinsurance.","This figure primarily includes AIG's 20% share of development on covered reserves that are part of the ADC, offset by the 62 million in quarterly amortization of our ADC gain at inception. The adverse development on the 80% of reserves ceded to Berkshire Hathaway was $273 million, and as reported below the operating line. The development associated with ADC and the deferred gain treatment are provided on Page 47 of our financial supplement. Prior year development for liability and financialized was due to adverse claim experience in U.S. primary and excess GL that related primarily to construction defects and multiyear construction project that cover all contractors on site, also known as REP business, along with other large individual clients. This was largely covered by the ADC. Based on the results of our detailed reserving reviews, we remain comfortable with our 2016 and 2017 loss picks in these lines.","In addition, we also saw higher than expected losses in Property and Special Risks due to two large aviation losses and recorded $41 million of prior year development in PSR. Historically, we've had modestly favorable reserve development in these classes, which results in an unfavorable year-on-year comparison for Property and Special Risk. Our balance sheet and free cash flow remain strong. Current liquidity at quarter end was $7.8 billion. During the quarter, we received $1.7 billion of distributions from our insurance companies including tax-sharing payment. Current also received a total of $1.2 billion in proceeds related to legacy asset monetization and the sale of Arch shares.","Total proceeds from the sale of Arch shares were $652 million of which roughly $400 million were received by the holding company. Our remaining 4% stake in Arch is held in preferred shares in our P&C subsidiaries that are subject to lockup until January 15, 2018. We continue to have commitment and discipline in executing our legacy strategy. Legacy capital release in the quarter was $800 million for a total of $7.9 billion since the beginning of 2016. Cumulative capital release and cash flow from legacy have exceeded our expectations. We continue to project strong free cash flow to the holding company from insurance subsidiaries and the legacy portfolio.","We've returned $2.7 billion capital to shareholders in the quarter. While we have $2.5 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization, as Brian said, we'll be more opportunistic in our buyback activity and are no longer targeting an annual level of repurchase. We've already returned roughly $20 billion in capital over the past 18 months inclusive of our Q3 dividends. Going forward, our priority is to allocate capital to support profitable growth. Our balance sheet strength as an asset will use to maximize return and value to shareholders. To sum up, we are pleased with the second consecutive solid quarter. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow profile distinguish us from others in our industry and leave us extremely well positioned for the future.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.","Rob Schimek","Thank you, Sid, and good morning everyone. During the second quarter, we continue to execute on our strategy to improve Commercial's profitability by achieving a healthier balance in our portfolio. We remain focused on disciplined risk selection, advancement of our pricing tools and improving our mix of business as we work to create long-term sustainable value for all of AIG's stakeholders.","On Slide 8 Commercial's second quarter normalized ROE of 7.6% which includes the full capital benefit from the adverse development cover, represents an improvement from the first quarter and is in line with prior year quarter, after adjusting for the increase in loss picks reported in the second half of 2016. The adjusted accident year loss ratio of 66.1% reflects elevated non-cat property losses and higher loss picks in Liability and Financial Lines, which offset improvements in risk selection, mix of business and strong performance in special risks.","We continue to take aggressive underwriting actions across the portfolios poor performing lines particularly with the U.S. casualty and global property. The chart at the bottom of the slide illustrates our focus on risk selection and improvement achieved in our mix of business over that course of last year. However, the pace of our progress is partially dependent on market conditions and as a result we do anticipate quarterly volatility as we execute our strategy.","Turning to Slide 9, Liability and Financial Lines reported a solid second quarter normalized ROE of 11.3%, which reflects the full capital benefit of the ADC and strong performance in Financial Lines. The adjusted accident year loss ratio was essentially flat to the prior quarter after adjusting the second quarter of 2016 for the increase in loss picks recorded in the second half of the year. During the quarter, benefits from risk selection and business mix improvements were offset by more conservative loss picks and market conditions.","In Financial Lines, we achieved meaningful growth in segments where we\u2019re earnings our target rate of return and hold market leadership positions, that includes primarily public and private D&O where our claims capability that helped us to achieve above market rate increases as well as side D&O, M&A and cyber were AIG's technical expertise is a clear competitive advantage. We continue to see opportunities in Financial Lines and we're committed to innovating and growing with our clients.","Moving on to casualty, we made progress on improving risk selection and enhancing this sophistication of our underwriting tools and achieving year-over-year above the average market rate increases of 3% during the past seven quarters. As Sid mentioned, this quarter we updated our reserve analysis on many of the most challenging classes within U.S. casualty. Premium rate increases our lagging lost cost trends and we've been prudent in setting our loss picks. Casualty is the long tail line most vulnerable to uncertainty within our portfolio and we recognize that we have more work to do.","Turning to Side 10, the second quarter normalized ROE for Property and Special Risk was 1.2%, reflecting strong profitability in special risks that was mostly offset by an underwriting loss in property. We\u2019ve shared our property remediation plan with you in the past and we acknowledge that the business is not performing at an acceptable rate of return. The quarterly increase in Property and Special Risks adjusted accident year loss ratio is attributable to property's non-cat losses.","With respect to special risk, the second quarter marked our best adjusted accident year loss ratio for the quarter for specialty lines in the last five years. The proportion of our business coming from special risks has grown 5% over the prior year quarter, highlighting a deliberate shift to areas where we see profitable opportunities.","I'll make three key observations with respect to our property business. First, cat loss has performed better than our average annual loss expectation and better than the prior year for the first six months of 2017. Second, while severe losses were elevated compared to the past few quarters, they are in line with our expectations for the first half of the year. Third, we experienced higher property attritional losses in Northern Europe, as a result of elevated claim activity relating to the 2016 underwriting year.","In 2017, we believe improved risk selection which is led to property's premium decline and significant enhancements to our tools will result in a stronger portfolio. Looking to our 2018, you can expect further remediation actions particularly in Europe as we approached the important January 1st renewal season. Shifting to some recent successes, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the significant progress we've made in advancing our model and capabilities.","In Europe, we recently gained PRA approval of our Solvency II internal model, an affirmation that external parties are gaining confident in our tools. Our development of data, analytics, tools and modeling has been a multiyear process but our efforts are increasing in maturity and hoping to our business decisions.","Turning to our product and service capabilities, we are focused on brining innovative solutions to our clients and brokers. We recently announced that we successfully piloted the first multinational smart contract-based insurance policy using block-chain in partnership with IBM and our client Standard Chartered Bank. This is just one example of a broader body work dedicated to learning and working alongside our business partners as part of the commitment to client service and innovation that spans across the commercial organization.","In closing, the second quarter marked another step on our journey to improve Commercial underwriting profitability. Our strategy will remain focused on risk selection, underwriting discipline and improving the mix of business within the portfolio. We are extremely pleased to welcome to work alongside Peter Zaffino who brings with him an accomplished track record and a fresh perspective from the broker community. I have confidence in our strategy, our team and its ability to execute as we continue through the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Hogan","Thank you, Rob, and good morning everyone. As you can see on Slide 12, Consumer produced strong results for the quarter. We earned nearly $1.3 billion in pre-tax operating income and expanded normalized ROE to 13.3%. There were a number of positive developments in the quarter which benefited our returns including an unusually low level of loss activity in the Personal Insurance business and strong tailwinds from equity markets, supporting fee income in our individual and Group Retirement businesses.","The strength of the equity markets helped to partially mitigate the challenges and impact of the low rate environment on our results. Lastly, we had a onetime benefit from legal developments and group retirements and a positive adjustment to that in our life business. During the quarter, we continue to take further actions to enhance returns, strengthen our platforms and pursue targeted growth opportunities.","Turing to Individual Retirement on Slide 13, uncertainties surrounding the impact and implementation of the Department of Labor fiduciary Rule as well as potential delays and possible modifications to the rule have continued to significantly affect distributors, negatively impacting industry sales in particular annuity products. The impact from our distributors focus on implementing the DoL rule along with more invested competition in the fixed annuity space led to materially lower Individual Retirement sales and net flows from a year ago.","In the phase of industry challenges, we continued our disciplined approach with respect to product pricing, product features and asset quality; and continue to benefit from our broad product portfolio and diversified distribution network. Net spreads remained strong but are not immune to low rate environment, while increases in policy fee income reflect tailwinds from robust equity markets.","Turning to Group Retirement on Page 14, our investments in VALIC to transform the plan sponsor and participant experience continued to pay off. Deposits decreased slightly for the quarter, but are up year-to-date primarily due to increased new group acquisitions which remained at a very high level. Net flows declined for the quarter and year-to-date due to the timing of group surrenders. Also despite disciplined rate management, net investment spreads declined due to the run off of higher yielding assets and reinvestments in the low yield environment.","Looking forward across Individual and Group Retirement absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our net spreads will decline by approximately one to three basis points per quarter. Before moving onto Life, let me say a few words about the DoL Fiduciary Rule, we believe that we implemented the system changes and processes necessary to achieve compliance with the provisions of the rule that became effective on June 9th. We're also on track for full compliance on January 1st while closely following the DoL's ongoing review and assessment of the rule. We are in constant communication with our distribution partners through this complex transition to ensure that we can continue to meet their evolving needs.","Let's now move to Life Insurance on Slide 15. Our Life Insurance business continues to make progress executing our plans to enhance ROE and return to growth. We've now transitioned the bulk of our new business processing to our modern administrative platform and have outsourced administration of our legacy portfolios, allowing us to focus on current new business and further improve operating efficiencies. In the U.S., premiums and deposits increased and we had strong growth in both term and universal Life Insurance sales. Also, overall mortality experience continued within pricing expectations.","Turning to Slide 16, Personal Insurance produced very strong results this quarter. The significant increase in PTOI was driven by an unusually low level of loss activity including no severe losses and minimal catastrophe losses, strategic actions to reduce expenses and higher net investment income. Our Personal Insurance results reflect our focus in markets and customer segments where we have a competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects. We are executing on a number of unique partnership arrangements and expanding our multinational offerings. While this quarter represented unusually favorable experience, in Personal Insurance, we are moving our focus from margin expansion to growth of targeted margins.","Finally in Japan, we continue to make progress in our transformation while producing strong operating results. We are successfully conducting business under FSA-approved pre-merger status and remain on track for the legal entity merger on January 1, 2018. During the quarter, we also completed the sale of AIG Fuji Life, allowing us to focus on our strong P&C position going forward.","To close, I'm pleased with Consumer's results this quarter and the progress we are making across our business. Now, I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up for Q&A.","Liz Werner","Anthony, could we open up the lines for Q&A now?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. First, congrats to both Brian and Peter for your new positions. My first question is on reserve. You took another like $400 million gross charges like before the reinsurance recoverable. I'm wondering Brian because you start as actuary in AIG many years ago. What's your reserving philosophy? And do you see will it continue in the near-term to see some slow bleeding in terms of reserve charges or another sort of kitchen sink quarter in the fourth quarter?","Brian Duperreault","Hey, Kai, thanks for the congratulations to start with. And thanks for reminding me, I was an actuary in this company once. Look at reserves, you have to be realistic, you got to be conservative, you have to take fax on when they come in that change your opinion about it and you have to have a consistent approach to your process. So what I've seen is a process that I mentioned in my remarks is sound. I think the positions we're taking are reasonable. I think there is conservatism in there, in their approach.","But that doesn\u2019t mean that you can have moments both up and down and in old years. But what I've seen in this quarter doesn\u2019t give me pause, doesn\u2019t increase my anxiety that anything. I think it's -- the process has been reasonable and there are some movements, but as I said earlier, I think the current years are put in a reasonable position even though the green I think they're reasonable, didn\u2019t have much activity there that's probably what I'll there. Thank you.","Kai Pan","My follow up is on -- I assume, if I may, on capital management. You said you will take a more balanced approach. You no longer give sort of any target for annual buybacks. I'm wondering what's the balance between buyback in your mind, between buybacks and the investments? How do you value the return on buyback buying to a low yield book value versus potential gross opportunities out there?","Brian Duperreault","Thanks, Kai. So with the buybacks, it\u2019s a capital management tool, it's not a strategy it's not a growth strategy in particular. And so, if you set yourself as a company that grows and increases its profits overtime in a sustainable way and developing franchise value then you have to take that capital that you're getting every quarter and deploying it. So that means that a buyback process has to be blended in with deploying the capital in some way that gives you a long-term value.","So that\u2019s what we do, I mean we got the capital as management in this company. We've been given that responsibility in charge, to do the best with it, to create long-term shareholders value. And as I said, my priority is to take this capital and find ways where we can increase its franchised value of this company. If we can't, obviously, we would return it. But that would be something I would prefer not to do, if I can find something better to use it with. Okay? Good, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis","I had a question and John had a follow-up, but I guess my question is just in terms of the improvement in P&C. How long should we expect this to take? I think you mentioned that some of the problematic lines are property, I would imagine that those are little bit faster to fix in some casualty lines? And where should we see the improvements? Should it be more on the expense ratio side or on the loss ratio side? Thanks.","Brian Duperreault","Okay, well. That's always a great question. I was like how is the piece of string? It takes some time in certain lines, takes longer some another and you pointed that out. They've been working on the casualty for some time -- look at probably works that's been here frankly. I mean it's not easy to do what they have done. And I like the fact that they have been intellectually honest with themselves about what's good and what's not good here. And that\u2019s terrific. I mean that\u2019s another hallmark of the great companies. So, this casualty business it takes time earn out, it takes time to yield its secrets, those things were lobbing. I think a lot of that work has been done, but as I said in my remarks, in those still some -- some of those positions that we have, they are still not reducing a good result. And this market is not going to led us, fix it through price terms and conditions, not going to led us. So that means in selection and that means reduction probably. So if you reduce, you are going to have that premium earn out overtime. So you just going to let that -- you just going to have to let that play out, have to watch us, continue deploy the disciplined that has been deployed.","Property is usually a little easier to fix. I mean you can see the results quicker because it's really the last couple of years of activity that\u2019s going to be affective. There are some idiosyncrasies in the property book, it takes a little bit longer like this one, one renewal in Europe as an example, maybe we start some multi line businesses. So, yes, where do you see it, okay. If I reduce business, we stop rating premiums, the loss ratio will go down, the expense ratio is going to go up. Okay, net-net, you better off. So that\u2019s why I said don\u2019t quite -- don\u2019t force me to give you expense number and a loss ratio number because it\u2019s a very complicated new ones process.","If the property is going to be attacked, your loss ratios probably going to go up because property tends to have lower loss ratios, and I think that\u2019s occurred already in the portfolio management, the Rob has been doing. It's going to continue. So what we are trying to do is make underwriting profit and that\u2019s a combination of those two and they are going to be in balance. And that\u2019s really what you have to look for. Are we improving the underwriting profit of this company? And that\u2019s the real indicator. You got a follow-up?","John Nadel","Good morning, Brian. This is John Nadel. I think it probably comes as little surprise to most folks who known you for most of your carrier then you talk about an interest in inorganic growth on the Property Casualty side. But I was curious about your comments about some interest on the Life Insurance side. It seems to me in the environment where you can actually monetize pieces of the life portfolio at very high levels, giving some irrational exuberance maybe in long-term or long dated liabilities. I am curious as you think about how to bolster either strategically or directionally the life side of the portfolio. What areas geographically your product sets might be interested in?","Brian Duperreault","Well, I'm going to start this but I might ask Kevin to help me out here. But I think if you look at the life business we have, it is localized, it is substantial in the U.S. But in the U.S., it's quite balanced. We have got nice balance in what we described as life. So, my philosophy is always the balance is a wonderful thing because you can shift from one to other as markets present themselves. So if I am buying an IM, after more balance I think the life business recently expanded outside the US, but it should have those same characteristics as we do, as we do in the U.S. Kevin, do you want to add to that?","Kevin Hogan","Yes, sure, John first of all just as a reminder, we have a very unique position in the United States in the Individual Retirement space, we're a major player in all three of the relevant products, variable investment, fixed annuities and there's little uncertainty in the market right now, but there's going to be a new normal that emerges after the regulatory environment settles down and distributors understand how to respond and nobody's better positioned than we are to be able to serve the needs of that market. And the Group Retirement business is also a business that is extremely well positioned for us.","We're in the top three position in the major segment of K-12 upper education and healthcare that our focus is there, so there's tremendous franchise value in these businesses and the spectrum of the entire retirement space that we participate in. And in our life business we worked in the last couple of years to dramatically evolve our distribution and our new business is faster than the quality that we expect and it\u2019s growing quite robustly at this point. We have the opportunity to expand outside the United States and attractive markets according to where our skill sets are and where the opportunities are and you know a few years ago we made a small acquisition in the UK as an example that's actually doing very well.","When we started with that business it was entirely an independent financial advisor space we just expanded to our first bank partnership with the Royal Bank of Scotland a program we just launched in the last couple of weeks and we see a lot of upside with that business which is a very attractive albeit relatively modest sized business, but there're plenty of other opportunities for us in various places around the world. We don't provide direction in terms of specifics, but we're certainly in a position to evaluate entry into markets which are attractive which have appropriate legal and structural foundations and which are growth opportunities for us in the medium and long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning, I had a couple of questions broadly related to things that have already been addressed, but just a little bit more detail. First, on just for Brian, on your comfort with loss ticks and reserves, I'm just little surprised just wondering whether you're basing your views on detailed analysis of reserves or just a preliminary look because for the past several years management's been assuring investors that the Company's becoming more conservative at risk selection, more conservative in setting loss ticks, but we've seen continued adverse development even on recently sold business. And then secondly on M&A, are there any specific, you mentioned what you're interested in -- are there any specific financial targets besides just being a good strategic set that the deals would have to meet for you to be -- for you to execute on them?","Brian Duperreault","Okay, well, let's. Yes, the reserves I can understand your questions around reserves. You know look I'm not the actuary here, so I'm not going to go through the details that the actuaries would do with the finance departments would do. But I am knowledgeable about the business and the process, and so I just spend a lot of time with them understanding how they do it? What they do? What their assumptions are? What the discipline is around the process? How they get their data? And I think what they are doing is sound, and I can\u2019t really comment on what happened before I can only look at what we're doing now, and as I said I think it's reasonable and sound.","As far as M&A is concerned, yes, I like accretion. Who does it? I mean I think things should be accretive. It should start with being strategic. I mean we -- we don\u2019t want to double down on things we already do. We want a balance what we\u2019re doing with other things. I'm going to be primarily looking for strategic balance that gives us ways to deploy capital when things we do have issues. Accretion, it\u2019s a wonderful things financially. You would like to see it, improve your profits short-term, but certainly better make it improve the profits long-term. But I also like accretion in terms of people, capabilities, spread. And so that accretion has to be more than just a number, can't just see the profit, better give us a whole lot more capabilities then we have now. Okay next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb","On the merger and acquisition front, could you give us some prospective on whether you're looking more for bolt-on size acquisitions or perhaps something larger or transformational?","Brian Duperreault","Look, Jay. If I can find something transformational, who wouldn't do that? Playing the odds the more likely scenario our things that are smaller than what might be described as transformational. Yes, I would mind doing both. But if you\u2019re playing the odds, you got a better chance of doing a series of acquisition then large one, we will see what happens.","Jay Gelb","That\u2019s helpful, thank you. And then my follow-up on capital management is, I know you not giving targets or guidance. But in this scope of share buyback, should we think of a small fraction of annual earnings as something your mark for buyback and absence of being able to deploy another opportunities?","Brian Duperreault","Jay, if I say I'm not going to give you guidance there I'm not going to give you guidance. So let's leave it at that, but thanks for the question. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI.","Tom Gallagher","Brian, I know it's early in your tenure there, but just as you evaluating things. You look at results in the Commercial business. Why do you think AIG has underperformed peers by so much? Is it the right strategy just not enough reserve? Is it too much growth in property? Does something need to be changed with the execution or the strategy? Pretty broad question, but just curious what you're evaluation is there?","Brian Duperreault","Thanks Tom. I guess I could give you a very detailed expensive discussion about all the parts that could cause this, but I think in its simplest form if you're going to outperform the market, you need some maneuverability in that. And I think we got to be a very, very large player particularly in the large Commercial space, such that there really wasn\u2019t a lot of room to manure. And therefore, your ability to select goes down, your ability to get prices that you want to goes down.","So what I'm seeing them doing is the intelligent thing, which is to cut back to those areas where they select with the same professionalism or that in did price with the same professionalism that naturally produces smaller book of business, but that book of business should be sound. And the other way of process surrounded should be sound going forward. And that drives the need to reapplying what Commercial is, so it's not just a largest of the large risk, but it\u2019s a balance of full gambit of Commercial business particularly in the United States.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. And then just as a follow-up. You said the 16 billion of reserves that were reviewed this quarter related to some of the more challenging lines. Would it be fair to say that in response to evaluation or reserves from the time you joined through -- into the future that you feel like that was the hardest part, that you feel pretty good overall about the reserves as you think about balance sheet risk and aggregate? Or is it still more with the job with evaluation of reserves.","Brian Duperreault","I think we have to have a disciplined process around this. You don't save everything to the last quarter. So, they chose these, they chose I think wisely because they were some of the more challenging lines as I said. That doesn\u2019t mean that, there isn't a review of the entire portfolio just mean that there is a debt review in one quarter for certain segment, but you are looking at all because we have to set all the reserves. And so as we look at the rest of the portfolio, there wasn\u2019t anything that would have caused just not concerned to do and earlier in that review put it that way. But we will see what happens in the third quarter, but I think I would take that as some comfort.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","I was wondering, if you could -- maybe just kind of review where you did end up at the end of the day relative to the old target of the capital return in such, throughout the trade. I realized that\u2019s not prospectively what you are focused on, but I think some general thoughts is to whether you not, you think this game was ultimately successful in region strategy is ultimately successful?","Brian Duperreault","Hey, Sid, why don\u2019t you take that one.","Sid Sankaran","Thank you, Brian. Paul, as I said in our remarks, we've retuned over $20 billion of capital in the past 18 months. It would be announcement of our dividend. So we have done that and the most important thing that we've alluded to here is we have an extremely strong balance sheet and are well positioned for the future. So, $7.8 million apparent liquidity and extremely good cash flow projection. So I think I can leave it that.","Paul Newsome","The follow up -- yes, I am thinking capital allocation respectively. Am I right to think that we should end up with more capital allocation towards the life businesses in general? And maybe you could talk a little bit about that?","Brian Duperreault","I think this is -- it\u2019s a great question. I mean the Life business was going to be the area where we felt we had a strongest change of delivering superior returns and by the way that\u2019s doing pretty well. Then, the answer will be, yes. I think everybody is presenting me with ideas about where we could deploy it and the best story wins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","I think my first question is for Rob. I'm just trying to understand given the -- cutting it so much really, really bad business in Commercial while we didn\u2019t see improvement in the underlying accident loss ratio and financial liability.","Rob Schimek","What I want to emphasize within Liability and Financial Lines is that we've had a lot of effort to improve our risk selection of business mix and reduce the reserve volatility. And just remember, we've achieved an 11.3% ROE this quarter, and so first thing I would say is, if you just pause on that we believe that we've got a clear path to an ongoing double digit ROE which is sustainable, and that's really reflecting the quality of the mix of business that we've achieved. I think we had a great quarter with respect to Special Risks as I mentioned. So actually Q2, our return there was even better than Liability or Financial Lines.","And so, it really brings you back to property and I think Brian talked a bit about that, I think what I would emphasize for you is there's really three elements to us for Property. We've done a very good job of managing our cat exposure both with improved modeling, risk selection and user reinsurance. Our sub-year losses as a percentage of the premiums that we're earning in Property and Special Risks have continued to come down, year-over-year. And that leaves us with improving the attritional loss ratio in the property book.","And as Brian mentioned you know in particular, we've got our sight set on Northern Europe, but there's timing issues associated with when you can actually make those moves, so just to put it in context for you, 55% of our property book in continental Europe were used on January 1st. So the next bite of the apple is not until January 1st of 2018, and the two most challenged countries in Northern Europe are Denmark and Germany and 70% for their book renews on January 1st. So, there's just structural impediment to being able to move it faster, but if you ask about the confidence and the actions that we've taken. I'm completely confident that we've been taking the right actions to achieve the results.","Brian Duperreault","I might add that. You know look, it's a very competitive market so you know you can have a very nice piece of business portfolio today and then it's tax and price terms and conditions and you got to react to it. So you know it's a constant play. This is something kind of market where you can just go out and write a whole bunch of new business and declare success. So I think Rob is Rob, he is fighting with pressures of the market at the same time to continue to keep his Liability business in particular in a position to returning that, those good returns on equity. Do you have follow on?","Meyer Shields","Yes, just a quick one, Brian. You mentioned in your introductory comment and I think you're right that AIG is no longer should qualify for non-bank city status. Can you talk about what that would imply if that designation was removed?","Brian Duperreault","We'd imply we wouldn't have the fed as a regulator, we regulated again by the states. We're still regulated by the states. So, we would lose the fed as the group supervisor, simple as that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith","Thanks, welcome back Brian. First question is. How long do you think it takes to get the platform in Commercial Line space Brian to where you'd be comfortable in kind of growing organically profitably?","Brian Duperreault","By the way thanks, it's nice to be back, Brian. Well, in the Commercial -- the Commercial book is, it isn\u2019t just one thing right. So, you heard from Rob that the specialty business has been performing well and the financial or the financial and liabilities are performing well. So, those are areas that we look to expand in growth as the market and let's say our professionalism allows us to do that. In some of the cash business, I just don\u2019t see it, I really don\u2019t see it. And property is a mixed bag, property is a mixed bag because there is something that like in Europe that we should be doing, we will be doing those both to improve the book and business that we can go answer and that in a greater way. So it\u2019s a broad front kind of business and again it's concentrated at the higher end. So the other thing is to get into down, down the risk chain as well and expended in that area.","Brian Meredith","And going down the risk chain that was my next question for you. Do you have the distribution relationship to kind go down that risk chain right now? And is this the platform there to go down? Or is your some build out still need?","Brian Duperreault","No, the answer is not really and that been an area that AIG has done well overtime, and so we don\u2019t have the classic distribution channels for the small business. Now, we have Seraina who is sitting here with us right now, developing a portfolio of business and the technology around it, which would go after that business but in a way where we would develop to technology the kind of distribution we would need. So that\u2019s at the lower end of that business. We have Rob at the higher end of the business. And we do play to some degree in that and that tends to be match our existing distributing channels where the business is on the larger end of the middle market or it\u2019s the business that has the certain characteristic terms in this risk profile, where may be its not a large sales or large employee population company where they has certain characteristic that naturally fill our skills sets. So, Rob will be working in that area stronger. Seraina will be working in her area stronger. And we'll see what else out. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen","Just I guess may be one last try this capital management topic. Brian, should we expect an outright pause in buybacks in the near-term as you start to build up capital?","Brian Duperreault","Look, this is great. Thanks a lot. Okay, so I think I said it already look at the -- let's just do it in probability, right. The chances that we will be buying, at the levels that we've been buying, a very low, let's just put it that way. But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t necessary use that tool. What Sid said is, it\u2019s a tool and you use the tool opportunistically. So if I see that it is the right thing to do, the opportunity is there for us, I will deploy the tool.","Jay Cohen","Okay understood. Second question, maybe for Rob and for you. On the Commercial side, it sounds as if the premium declines are now likely to continue and that makes sense. Will you have to take another step at expenses as well as just to descend to some extent the expense ratio?","Brian Duperreault","Let me answer that. I said it earlier like expense discipline is the way of life, I mean if you don\u2019t have -- if you are not running your company, it's one of your leverage, if you are not running your company with attention to your expense in this kind of market and this is usually the kind of market we are in. Then you are going to fail eventually. So, yes, expense will continue to be something we will look at all the time, all the time. But I want to emphasize that we will spend money too.","And if we have a rising expense ratio with an improving bottom line, I'll be happy guy too. So I'm not -- I want to put it -- it\u2019s a balanced situation where we will continue to reduce our cost, because our cost structure is high. But we are going to invest in areas that one will help us, we'll repeat when gives us a growth are. And if I had to choose between reducing the volume because it's not reducing the profit, but that would cause the expenses to go up, I am going to make that choice all day long. That\u2019s it, everybody else up.","Liz Werner","Thank you, operator. We appreciate you joined our call this morning. We know you have a lot of calls, so with that I think we will close day and we will look forward to following up with you on any additional question.","Brian Duperreault","I just want to thank all the people in AIG for great work.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

We have our CEO, Peter Hancock; our CFO, Sid Sankaran; and many others in the room, including our Head of Commercial, Rob Schimek; and the Head of Consumer, Kevin Hogan.","With that, Peter, I'll turn it to you.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will speak briefly to our performance this quarter as well as our outlook and ongoing transformation. AIG's second quarter results showed strong improvement towards all the goals the board and I announced in January. We've executed more quickly and smoothly than expected and our confidence in reaching our 2017 financial targets is high as our earnings become more sustainable.","In the second quarter, we continued to execute and delivered strong operating earnings of $0.98 per share, including a $0.17 charge from the worker's compensation discount, which Sid will discuss. Adjusted commercial insurance underwriting improved again this quarter, which Rob will speak to. Consumer's expense discipline also resulted in increased profitability, particularly in Personal Insurance and Kevin will address this in his remarks.","Across AIG we are simplifying the company, accelerating our decision-making and adhering to a consistent management philosophy. We're executing on our objectives of managing our core operating portfolios to increase return on equity and managing our legacy portfolio for capital return. As we had previously announced, Charlie Shamieh is leading a team focused on our legacy portfolio and is actively moving forward. Our managerial discipline across AIG is based on a guiding principle of building economic value, which is consistently applied throughout the company. We frequently discuss our focus on value over volume when speaking to commercial underwriting and the value of new business for consumer businesses. The flexibility we have earned by focusing on expense discipline and growth in segments with sustainable value has allowed us to maintain positive operating leverage, while we have reduced our top line aggressively.","Normalized ROE was 8.8% for both the quarter and the first six months of this year. Our operating improvements and return of capital will continue to positively impact ROE, and we're solidly on track to deliver full year normalized ROE in our targeted range of 8.4% to 8.9%. As a reminder, our third quarter normalized ROE will reflect a higher level of expected catastrophe losses.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, increased 5% in the quarter, and we continue to expect to achieve double-digit growth for the full year. Our confidence in the future is based on our focus on what we can control. Our active value management framework for capital allocation and product design allows us to navigate through volatile markets. At this time AIG's transformation to a more efficient and nimble organization is more important than ever. We anticipate and address challenges such as sustained low interest rates, Brexit and other market forces across our strategies.","Sid will follow my remarks with greater transparency on the impact of low interest rates specifically. In the case of Brexit, we believe we're well-positioned, given our branch structure. It may be some time before the requirements associated with Brexit are known and any potential economic impact from Brexit materializes. We're positioning AIG for changing economics, political and regulatory environments and for future earnings sustainability.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sid.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, including notable items. I'll also discuss the impact of the current interest rate environment and close with comments on capital management.","Turning to slide four, our core operating earnings showed good progress this quarter, with strong underwriting results, particularly with respect to the commercial accident year loss ratio as adjusted and expense discipline across AIG. In addition, UGC delivered another quarter of solid results, driven by improved loss experience and growth in net premiums earned.","Our year-on-year comparisons were impacted by four items of note. First, the workers' compensation discount amounted to a $300 million charge this quarter versus a $400 million benefit a year ago. The workers' compensation discount rate adjustments are recorded in earnings, while offsetting changes in the fair value of securities backing these liabilities are recorded to AOCI. This results in minimal impact to reported book value. Accordingly, when we report our normalized ROE, we remove this non-economic change in net reserve discount. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate, which is comprised of the U.S. Treasury rate plus an assumed credit spread, has a roughly $100 million pre-tax impact to $125 million pre-tax impact on reported earnings.","The second item was a modest $29 million of overall net unfavorable prior year reserve development, compared to a net unfavorable development of $329 million a year ago. Included in the quarter was a $109 million strengthening of Florida workers' compensation reserves, partially offset by favorable reserve development in Property and Specialty lines. The Florida workers' compensation reserve increase was due to recent industry-wide Florida court rulings, which occurred during the quarter. The judgments created an increased liability for previous years, which made a reserve increase in this segment prudent. AIG has a 5% market share in Florida and an average market share of 8% for the past 10-year and 15-year periods.","The third item was that Q2 was our highest natural catastrophe quarter since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. We had higher cat losses in the quarter of $414 million compared to the roughly in-line level of $225 million in catastrophes for the prior year.","The final item was the meaningful change in market-sensitive asset returns, as shown on slide five. Overall, the impact of last year's outsized Q2 returns and our actions to reduce market-sensitive assets resulted in approximately $1 billion decline in mark-to-market income versus a year ago. However, of note in the quarter, these assets contributed just under $300 million to income, which was close to our expectations. Our steps to reduce market exposure will allow for more sustainable, and less volatile earnings going forward. Since 2010, our market-sensitive assets have declined by over 40% or by $19 billion.","Turning to slide six, we provided an overview of the impact interest rates may have on our in-force as well as on new business for key portfolios. With respect to the in-force, we have a strong discipline around asset liability management, led by our Chief Investment Officer, Doug Dachille. We see limited in-force impact on long-tail casualty, where assets are slightly longer than liabilities and on variable annuities, where in 2014, we made a decision to fully hedge the interest rate risk on living benefits, which is accounted for at fair value.","On Fixed Annuities, approximately 72% of the book is already at guaranteed minimum crediting rates. The sustained low rates may reduce the lenders, and we see potential spread compression from declining portfolio yields. We are projecting a two basis-point to four basis-point quarterly decline in net spreads.","On our Life business and legacy structured settlements, while we're exposed to some potential ALM mismatch on the long end of the curve due to limited investible assets, its impact on earnings in the next few years is modest, although it will grow somewhat over a very long time horizon with reinvestment.","On new business, we maintained a continued focus on pricing, product design and risk management across AIG. We expect some ROE compression in long-tail casualty. However, we continue to push on pricing and risk selection.","For our annuity businesses, we expect the primary impact to be a decline in volumes as we frequently reevaluate our products to ensure that we're meeting our return targets. Considering both the in-force and new business we're presenting a scenario to illustrate the potential headwinds to our January 26 stated targets from the current environment. The 2017 average 10-year treasury rate assumption that was used in our plan was 2.6%. Assuming interest rates are 100 basis points lower than our original 2.6% assumption, we would anticipate a potential 25-basis-point to 35-basis point reduction in 2017 normalized ROE, based on a decline in normalized pre-tax operating income of $250 million to $350 million. However, if rates were to move steadily higher from the levels today back to our initial projection, we would not expect this impact to materialize.","Also, as Peter said, our guiding philosophy is around managing to economic value. Since year-end, we estimate the decline in interest rate and markets has impacted our estimate of intrinsic value by approximately 5%. Despite the challenging interest rate environment we remain committed to our stated targets. We believe that our ability to manage our expense and capital structure, as we will discuss, where we are ahead of plan, give us the ability to withstand potential 2017 earnings pressures.","Turning to slide seven, we've executed against our plan and have reduced operating expenses by 11% year-to-date on a constant dollar basis. While the pace of this improvement should slow in the second half of the year we expect to exceed the 6% targeted GOE decline for the full year. Our expense reduction targets are carefully aligned against our projections of new business volumes to meet our objective of improving operating leverage.","Slide eight shows the expansion of our second-quarter normalized ROE to 8.8%. This improvement reflected almost $15 billion of capital return to shareholders since the second quarter of 2015, as well as continued improvement in normalized operating results.","Slide nine shows strong growth and book value, driven by earnings, realized capital gains, our estimated DTA utilization and accretive share repurchases during the quarter.","Turning to capital, on slide 10, we continue to execute against our $25 billion capital return target and have returned $7.2 billion of capital to shareholders for the first half of the year. During the quarter we deployed about $2.8 billion towards the purchase of 50 million common shares, and we also repurchased five million of our outstanding warrants for $90 million. Since quarter-end and through August 2, we repurchased an additional $698 million of common shares. Our remaining authorization stands at approximately $4 billion, including the new $3 billion authorization announced yesterday.","Our balance sheet remains very strong, with $6.7 billion of parent liquidity, a financial leverage ratio below 20% and RBC and rating agency capital ratios that continue to remain within our targets.","With respect to the key levers funding our capital return target, free cash flow continued to be strong in the second quarter as shown on slide 11. We announced that we would reduce our hedge fund allocation by about half, which we expect would free up $2 billion of capital towards our capital return target by the end of 2017. Submitted notices of redemption are $4.2 billion and through the second quarter, proceeds have freed up approximately $400 million of capital in our Life companies, which have come up to the holding company in the form of dividend payments. Additionally, distributions from the Life companies during the quarter included $315 million from the sale of AIG Advisor Group.","We continue to make solid progress on monetizing legacy assets with $4.3 billion of total free cash flow generated over the last three quarters. During the quarter, the holding company recognized $500 million of proceeds, largely from the sale of the PICC Group stake held at parent to the non-Life companies. We've completed the majority of unencumbered assets dispositions or transferred, outlined in our January 26 strategic plan, as of the end of the second quarter. Charlie Shamieh and his team are focused on the disposition process going forward for many of the insurance liabilities and legacy, which we've ticked off for several portfolios. It is important to note that some of the legacy insurance portfolios will have more extended time frames for exit. We'll provide further disclosure at year end with our modular segment reporting for legacy and provide additional information on a timely basis as we close any material transactions that are in progress.","As Peter stated, we're focused on continued execution of our strategic plan that we first outlined in January, providing you with additional disclosure as we progress throughout 2016. Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. Commercial had a strong second quarter despite the backdrop of a generally soft market. Today I'll discuss how the execution of our strategic plan is improving commercial mix of business and creating a leaner, more focused and profitable organization. We're committed to making economic-based decisions while we remain true to our vision of being our clients' most valued insurer.","Turning to slide 13, commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio of 62.4% improved 4.2 points from the prior year quarter with 3.4 points related to the strategic actions we announced in January and 0.8 points attributable to a lower level of severe losses.","We reduced second quarter net premium ratings earnings by 20% after adjusting for foreign exchange as part of reshaping of the portfolio. About half of the change was driven by increasing our use of reinsurance, the targeted exits we communicated in the first quarter and market headwinds from lower rates. The vast majority of the other half was attributable to underwriting actions in poorer performing sub-segments of Casualty and Property. These actions included addressing unprofitable single or two product client relationships and micro segmentation and re-underwriting of risks using enhanced analytic tools. As always, we make underwriting decisions initially on a product basis and then on a client-by-client basis taking a holistic view across each client relationship. We've placed a priority on limiting disruption for our clients and broker partners and preserving the strength of our valued multi-line client relationships. Retention for our major clients remained very healthy at about 94% on a year-to-date basis.","Our objective is to deploy our capital in higher performing sub-segments where we earn our target rate of return. The market is practicing less restraint and we've taken advantage of the opportunity to shed underperforming and highly commoditized businesses while having the flexibility to retain more attractive risks with the same clients. As a result of the pace of our actions and underwriting discipline, we're updating our 2016 full year estimates to reflect us managing net premiums written down by a total of approximately $3 billion in 2016 as we seek to optimize our portfolio.","Globally, rates were down about a point reflecting competitive international conditions, while overall rates in the U.S. were about flat. U.S. casualty rates continued their positive trend, increasing over 4.5 points and rates were up two points in our specialty businesses. Partially offsetting those increases, we continued to observe pressure in the excess and surplus lines property business and we saw more aggressive pricing in financial lines where rates decreased about 2%.","I'm pleased to say that during the first half of 2016 we recorded double-digit growth in several lines, where we are a market leader and offer a compelling value proposition including M&A, middle-market property, cyber and credit lines. In addition, multi-national programs increased by approximately 9%, demonstrating our enduring advantage in this important client segment and we continued to experience growth in large-limit properties. We're placing emphasis on investing in analytics and engineering capabilities to offer our clients unique data-driven insights that go beyond traditional risk transfer capabilities.","Switching gears to expenses, I'm happy to share our GOE ratio improved 1.2 points in the quarter as a result of AIG's expense initiatives. We expect that expenses will continue to decline, although at a more modest pace, in the second half of the year. The GOE ratio will likely trend slightly upward from its current level as the impact of our lower written premiums earn in during the remainder of 2016 and 2017. With that said, we're proud that the improvements in our loss ratio are not expected to be significantly offset by deterioration of our expense ratio.","Slide 14 shows the continued improvements in commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio between 2011 and the second quarter of 2016, including the effect of 2012 through 2015 prior period development in each accident year. The second quarter result of 62.4% represents a 3.8 point improvement over the full year of 2015, reflecting the impact of our strategic initiatives to improve the loss ratio. Our team is doing a terrific job executing against our plan and we've received excellent support from our clients and broker partners, who recognize the value of a strong AIG standing by their side. We remain confident that we will reach our previously announced 62% exit run rate target for 2016.","As we've stated in the past, we do not expect our progress to be linear. Notwithstanding this quarter's performance and the low level of severe losses our results are subject to volatility, particularly in property. Late in the quarter we put in place a focused reinsurance agreement for classes of business that have generated the greatest volatility in our international property business. We're also pleased that we've been able to avoid several recent notable losses in property as a result of our engineering and risk selection capabilities. These actions should dampen the past volatility we've experienced but we will continue to have a degree of exposure to risks that are difficult to predict.","Slide 15 is the same slide we provided last quarter, updated to show the change in our business mix and adjusted accident year loss ratio between 2015 and the first half of 2016 using three business strategy groupings; grow, maintain or improve and remediate. I'll highlight four points. First, the business we want to grow and maintain has increased from half of our premiums in 2015 to 60% of premiums through the first half of 2016. The weighted average adjusted accident year loss ratio was an attractive 56% through the first six months of 2016, which is broadly in line with the full year 2015 result of 54%. During the quarter we continued to focus on growing these highly profitable areas of the business and investing in its clients.","Second, the business we're remediating decreased from 15% of the portfolio in 2015 to 9% through the first six months of the year and the accident year loss ratio has improved from 91% in 2015 to 84% over that time. Our improvements are the result of the exits we announced in the first quarter and the fact that we've not been writing new business that falls in this worst performing group.","Third, the business that we're seeking to improve declined from 35% of premiums in 2015 to 31% of premiums in the first half of 2016 while the accident year loss ratio improved six points from 73% to 67% over that time. Our client and risk selection strategies and expansion of reinsurance were the primary drivers of those changes.","Finally, collectively the business that we're remediating and the business that we're improving declined from half of the portfolio in 2015 to 40% for the first six months of 2016, while the weighted average accident year loss ratio improved by seven points from 79% to 72% over that time. As you can see from this slide we've achieved significant improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio by truly transforming our portfolio.","In closing, the second quarter was marked by focus on our strongest performing businesses and most valued client relationships, while we continue to execute our strategic actions. The results are a testament to the commitment and pace with which we're implementing our plan, which provides me with the confidence that we will achieve the targets we've communicated.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin T. Hogan - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Consumer","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, Consumer Insurance produced solid results for the quarter on an overall basis, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of retirement, Life and Personal Insurance businesses. Before specifically addressing the results I would like to briefly provide some context.","We are pleased that the benefits from a number of our strategic initiatives are positively emerging in our results. For example, our focused strategy in Personal Insurance and investments we been making in Japan have lowered our overall expense ratio while producing profitable premium growth in select areas including our high net-worth client group business.","In Group Retirement, the investments we've made to enhance both our plan sponsor service and participant experiences are starting to pay off in both our acquisition and retention activities. For our U.S. Life business, we are realizing meaningful cost benefits from the consolidation of numerous risk policy administration and field compensation systems into modern common platforms. Realizing these types of benefits from our strategic initiatives is particularly important as our businesses face various challenges associated with economic and regulatory environment.","In particular industry variable annuity sales are being pressured due to volatile equity markets and uncertainty about the DOL fiduciary rule. We are confident we will be prepared in time for implantation of the DOL rule and we remain in active discussions with our distribution partners as they determine their chosen paths for implementation, which we will in turn support. The combination of our leading market positions across annuity product lines and our multichannel distribution network positions us well to respond to various market conditions and regulatory landscapes.","Also, recent actions we have taken in our U.S. retirement and Life proprietary distribution channels make us more nimble with respect to changing market conditions. With the completion of the sale of AIG Advisor Group during the quarter going forward nearly 100% of our retail variable annuity sales will be from third-party independent distribution. Separately in January of this year we substantially reduced our Life career distribution channel. Independent distribution accounted for over 80% of our U.S. Life sales here today. At this time our main proprietary distribution channels are our valid financial advisors who play a key role in serving our Group Retirement plan sponsors and participants and our direct-to-consumer business, AIG Direct.","Increasing our focus on independent distribution reduces our fixed cost burden and enables us to change emphasis in product sales according to opportunity, as we maintain pricing discipline. Across our businesses we are constantly looking for new opportunities to reduce costs and variabilize expenses.","Now I will briefly discuss the results of the quarter. Turning to retirement on slide 17, we saw 6% growth in retirement sales from a year ago. Growth was led by Fixed Annuities, Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement, while variable annuity sales declined, reflecting industry challenges. Fixed Annuity sales rose significantly from the low levels in the prior-year quarter although sales and net flows declined sequentially reflecting lower interest rates during the quarter as well as a more competitive market environment. We continue to maintain our Fixed Annuity pricing and asset quality disciplines.","Group Retirement benefited from higher deposits and lower surrenders, resulting in improved net flows. While these results reflect the investments we've made in the business including our client-focused technology platform, competition in this space remains robust. While variable annuity sales and net flows have been impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the DOL rules and market volatility we are maintaining our pricing and product discipline to navigate these uncertainties. These challenges validate our strategy of offering a broad portfolio of product solutions to meet our clients' needs.","As you can see on slide 18, we continue to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Trends in the quarterly reported base yields and spreads are impacted by volatility associated with bond accretion and commercial loan prepayment income. Looking forward, and Sid mentioned, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we expect our net spreads will decline by approximately two to four basis points per quarter.","Turning to slide 19, lifestyle growth in premiums and deposits of 5% from the same period last year on a constant-dollar basis. Operating comparisons reflected more favorable mortality experience. U.S. Life sales showed good growth from the same period last year particularly in term life. Our positive sales trends in Life reflect the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of independent distribution. We are also making progress in transactions supporting our previously announced plans to reinsure our remaining redundant reserves. We will provide you with updates on these transactions as they are completed.","Turning to slide 20, I'm happy to report that Personal Insurance reported another strong quarter of operating performance. The operating improvement reflected our strategic actions to reduce expenses including direct marketing costs as well as early emergence of operating benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets. While we continue to expect that expenses will be the key lever to future margin expansion and Personal Insurance, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments, including in Japan.","With respect to Japan, we remain focused on delivering current results while preparing for the successful execution of the legal merger, as previously reported. To close, I am pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic priorities across all of our consumer businesses and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan.","Now I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator, can we open up now for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President, Investor Relations","Hi, Kai? Hello? Kai?","Operator","Your line is open.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Can you hear me?","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President, Investor Relations","Yes.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you. So first, my question is on the 62.4% core loss ratio in commercial lines. I just wonder how much more will each of the buckets, reinsurers as well as underwriting actions, contribute to future reduction in that loss ratio? Can you talk more about how do you deal with these multi accounts and which you need to take some actions?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Okay. Kai, it's Rob Schimek. So first of all let me just refer you back to page 15 of our presentation, and let me make a quick observation for you. In total, through the first six months of the year, our premiums have declined by approximately $1.9 billion, and what you can see is that, because the left-hand side of this chart, Product Set 1 and Product Set 2A, have stayed \u2013 they've increased proportionally, but dollar amount wise it's very close to flat on a first six months of 2016 versus first six months of 2015 basis. So what you can see is that almost all of our decline in premium volumes has come from Product Set 2B and Product Set 3, which is the improve and remediate buckets of our business.","The weighted average loss ratio of the business that is no longer being written out of Product Set 2B and Product Set 3 was approximately 90%. So you're talking about literally having not written business that ran at a loss ratio of 90% last year and now the business we're still writing in Product Set 2B and Product Set 3 have a weighted average loss ratio of about 72%.","So I give you that to say that we've truly reduced the amount of writings in those lines of business and what you can see is we did that without significantly disrupting the business we wanted to grow and maintain in Product Set 1 and Product Set 2B. I would generally say to you we continue to be focused on remediating and improving that right-hand side of the page, and our real objective would be how much more can we improve that without disrupting the business we want to grow and the business we want to maintain.","The last observation that I'll make for you here is that our primary emphasis is on maintaining our multi-line client relationships and the percentages that you see here on page 15 are probably generally speaking in line with what you might expect us to continue to work toward for the full year 2016.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President, Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Another question for Rob. So if I look at the year-over-year improvement on Commercial P&C, it looks like you actually had more coming from international instead of North American Commercial. Now I've been thinking that the story of pruning the underperforming casualty plus the impact of reinsurance should be concentrated on the North American side. I'm not sure if I have that right, but that's been my assumption up until now. And if that's so, does that suggest that international is running ahead of plan and North America is more in line? Or can you shed some light on that?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","So Tom, thanks for your question. I would first say that yes. This is very much a story about business mix,. And what you can see is that the business in North America was what \u2013 was our primary target when it came to reinsurance. And so when we did our reinsurance agreements that I described in the first quarter, those reinsurance agreements really focused around North American casualty business. We continue to see, broadly speaking, our international business as attractive and are continuing to try to grow in most lines, in particular, in our multi-line multinational business.","With that said, we see opportunities on a kind of selective basis to remediate, even faster, some of the business that was in product set 3 and the business that was in product set 2 in North America, partly because the market's been just pretty aggressive. And if the market's aggressive and we have an opportunity without disrupting the broader relationships to remediate to improve faster in North America, we're happy to do it.","I think surely property in the U.S. is a very important part of the story. As I mentioned in my opening comments, property rates are down in the U.S. in the excess and surplus lines property business and so we have, in fact, reduced the amount of writings that we're doing in the E&S property space and we will continue to be very thoughtful about the property business we do write. We're focused on our highly engineered lines, in middle-market, in large limit where we have a sustainable, competitive advantage and where we think our engineering capabilities can help reduce the likelihood of a loss in the first place for our clients.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. The implied decline in commercial property casualty insurance in 2016 is around 15%. I realize introducing new reinsurance arrangements has a pretty big influence on that. Do you envision positive growth in 2017?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Jay, thanks for the question. I think the market will dictate a lot for us because we really want to take advantage of where we see opportunities. In some cases, what I can tell you for sure is, we do expect for 2017 to show opportunities for growth in lines of business that we've been targeting. So we do expect that we'll continue to see growth in multinational, in our highly engineered property lines of business, in financial lines for us, more broadly, but a lot of this will be dictated by where we see opportunity to further shape the portfolio, whether that's in the U.S. or internationally based off of market conditions. But in general, I think that you should expect that 2017 premiums, overall, will not significantly grow from the level we close out at, at the end of 2016.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. You guys talked about the changes in the Florida worker's comp market, obviously, addressing that with your reserves. I got to tell you we haven't heard much of anything from other companies and I'm wondering, do you believe you are acting more quickly than others in this regard?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Jay. It's Sid. Yeah, in this case, look, we believe we reacted to new information. There were court rulings in the second quarter and they were, obviously, unexpected and we do see this as an industry event. So it's an important set of rulings and we responded quickly as we told you we would around reserving.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Just for Rob, just thinking about the shift here, I mean, you're clearly shifting away from casualty on a net basis towards property. How should we be thinking about Cat load and severe losses from here? I mean, you mentioned some reinsurance in international commercial, but it looked like severe losses were a little bit lighter in the U.S. in the second quarter and, really, the first half of the year. So just want to get an understanding of whether or not you've taken any actions on the reinsurance side as far as property is concerned. Thanks.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","So Mike, thanks for the question. I can't resist to take a quick moment to say \u2013 to put a plug in for our casualty team. We've got the best casualty team in this business and we will absolutely pursue opportunities to raise casualty business where we think we can get the proper pricing and where we think we can deliver value for our clients.","With respect to property, let me make three key observations for you. The first thing I want to say is that over the past few years you'll see that we've been very actively managing our P&L to make sure that we manage the amount of exposure that we have to catastrophes. We've done that by reducing some of our risks, for example, in the Gulf Coast here in the United States, and being willing to take exposures around the world where we think that along the efficient frontier there's probably better opportunity between the risk reward trade-off for pricing and risk.","The second thing that I would observe for you is that we've really done a lot of work to build our engineering capabilities in property, as you know. And the growth that you see in property is coming very much through our middle market and our large-limit, highly engineered property space where we really think we have a competitive advantage and where we think we have the ability to change our loss ratio in a positive way.","And the third point that I would make is that absolutely, we believe that reinsurance provides an opportunity for us here. As I mentioned in my comments we did take advantage in the second quarter of the opportunity to use reinsurance in a strategic manner to reduce the level of volatility associated with severe losses coming from the property book. We entered into that agreement at the end of the second quarter. So we think that we'll see much more of the benefit from that moving forward in the rest of 2016 and into 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Another one for Rob. I guess, just looking at the components of the reduction in GOE, it looks like one driver has been loss adjustment expense. And I guess coincidently, that's also been a pretty good tailwind for the improvement in the accident year loss ratio in Commercial. I'm just trying to get a feel for, I guess, how much of the four points to six points of the four this year and six next year in accident year loss ratio improvement was supposed to come from that versus kind of the way I think we had been thinking about it, which was mix shift, risk selection and reinsurance.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Ryan, thanks for your question. The first thing I would say to you is I know that you should walk away understanding that about three-tenths of a point of the improvement in our adjusted accident year loss ratio comes from loss adjustment expenses. When you look at page nine of the financial supplement and you're trying to make sure that you can sort of reconcile that thought, just remember that any of the GOE that we put into loss adjustment expenses is effectively deferred and amortized in like a DAC type of concept. And so therefore, you need to be thinking about what is the effect in the adjusted loss ratio on an amortized basis. And so three-tenths of a point is the right answer for you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Rob, back to you again. I was wondering, could you give us a sense of what the year-over-year benefit to the underlying loss ratios were in commercial from reinsurance, ceded reinsurance, and also the combined ratio?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Let's see. Let me give you this as maybe a way to observe this for you. One, just remember that, I said this in my opening comments, if our total premium decline was 20% in the quarter after foreign exchange, about half of that came from reinsurance and our exit end-market headwind. So you could dissect that piece a little bit further and let me help you. I commented already that rates, so the market headwind for rates was about 1%.","I commented that, that would then leave you with 9% of the decline associated with reinsurance and exits. If you thought about the exits, about $500 million worth of business is what we've exited, which is pretty small. It's about 2.5% of the $20 billion of premium that we wrote last year. So you might think of the benefit from exits as being something like, let's call it two to three points. And so if you \u2013 if you said hey, he explained 10% through reinsurance exits and market headwinds, I think it's pretty fair to say that you've probably got about six points of your reduction in premium coming from reinsurance. And so that's the effect that it had on the reinsurance. And then as you want to know what effect it had on the loss ratio just remember most of that happened in Product Set 2B and Product Set 3, but Product Set 2B. So you can see the loss ratio on the dispersion chart that we show on page 15.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Following the quarter's rate increases in Casualty and Specialty, can you talk about where your rates sort of compare to overall market rates?","Kevin T. Hogan - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Consumer","I think our rates are consistent with market rates.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","... market rates before these increases?","Kevin T. Hogan - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Consumer","We compete in a highly competitive market every day. I would tell you that when we lose business, more often than not we're losing business to a competitor who quoted a lower rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the call, and, Craig, congratulations on obviously making a ton of progress in the quarter. So Peter, I was hoping to have just a bit of a strategic question for you. So earlier in sort of this journey there was a lot of debate and concern as to whether perhaps AIG was sort of too big to succeed. Your modularity approach seemed like a logical way of pivoting the conversation and making it a more manageable series of businesses.","I'm wondering if you can talk about, now that you've got six months on sort of in the real world of like, your guys' day jobs, what that has actually translated into; systems, people, staffing, new ways of underwriting. And then walk us through a little bit how you think that informs how we should think about that informing the future, how far modularity goes and perhaps just a bit of an update on your sort of broader sort of divestiture strategy? Thank you.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","So I think that, as the last 20 minutes has illustrated, the focus on the sub-segmentation of the commercial business, as illustrated in the dispersion chart is just one example of modularity in action. That chart has 80 individual dots. Each of those dots is a module, and our ability to grow some and shrink others is indicative of what we're doing throughout the organization as we segment our business by product, by geography, by customer segment, by distribution channel and make differentiated managerial decisions to allocate capital where we're being properly rewarded, where we have long term competitive advantage and pulling back and even exiting where we don't. And the information technology to be able to do that in ever more precise ways and the ability to not be overly swayed by the past but have better predictive analytics about the future, about loss trends and customer demand is what we're talking about.","We clearly recognize the need to illustrate that through more transparency and I hope you find what we're doing to show modularity in action within the Commercial book helpful in anticipating where else we're applying the same managerial discipline. And as we've promised in January, we'll be talking about modular results at the sort of high level of nine sub-segments of AIG by the end of this year with full capital allocation and ROEs of those segments.","But that is really still at a very high altitude compared to what in our day jobs, to use your language, we're doing, to make AIG and reshape it into our clients' most valued insurer, which is to focus it where we have the greatest relevance to our target client segments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Yes. Good morning. If we go back to slide 15 and kind of the product sets that you've laid out, I was just wondering if you can kind of talk to, if there were any kind of favorable or unfavorable impacts within any of the product sets that might impact sequential loss ratios as we think about the balance of 2016?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Elyse, I guess the best way for me to think about that is what you're really seeing here on page 15 is simply change in mix. I want to highlight for you that we've only just begun to earn in what is this change of mix that you're seeing on page 15. So the future impact is that this net written premium earns in much more in Q3 and in Q4, so this mix of business you should feel coming through the loss ratio as we go through the year in even greater way. As it relates to loss picks et cetera, I can only tell you that every quarter we review the loss picks with the actuaries and for sure we had increased the loss picks in places where we believed that the market headwinds indicate that the loss experience has been greater then we initially expected at the beginning of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I just had a question on expenses, just on the sustainability of the expense ratio, you mentioned the ratio could increase because of lower premiums. I'm wondering if you expect expenses to continue to decline over the next year-and-a-half? And then related to that, just wondering what your ultimate expectation is for restructuring costs. I think expected restructuring costs have been going up. In your most recent Q it was $1 billion, at the end of the previous quarter, it was $900 million; at the end of the year it was $700 million. So what's your expectation of how much the restructuring costs that you're passing below the line will end up being ultimately?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Jimmy, it's Rob Schimek. I'm going to just answer the first part of that and let Sid have the second half. As it relates again to the expense ratio just go back to what I said in my opening comments. In my opening comments I made it clear expenses have come down and we expect them to continue to come down in the remainder of 2016 and into 2017 consistent with the actions that Peter outlined and what our strategic actions were that were described in January. With that said, the lower level of earned premiums, earns in over the course of the remainder of 2016 and 2017 and because of that, you'll see a slight upward movement in the expense ratio but again the most important point, we would expect to reduce our loss ratio by four points this year and we do not expect to give that up in the combined ratio by having an offsetting increase in the expense ratio. We expect to be able to hold our ground on the expense ratio.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Jimmy, it's Sid. On the second question, we obviously don't project out our forecast future restructuring costs but you should expect as we take management actions you could see additional restructuring costs and you'll see that updated each quarter in our disclosure.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I just want to make another point here about expense control and how we're looking at it. A lot of people when they talk about expenses quickly jump to ratios or certain sub-segments of expenses like the corporate section or whatever. We feel that the only way to make sure we have sustainable expense discipline is to look holistically at the entire fixed cost base of the company regardless of how it's classified in LAE or in corporate or whatever and keep that number coming down in a sustainable way. And that will then feed all of the ratios that we care about over time but importantly ROE and give us a sustainable ROE above our cost of capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks, and good morning. Just very quickly going back to the discussion on commercial, AOI ex-cat LR of 62.4% now, that was roughly 400 basis point improvement over 2015. Your prior goal was 400 basis points by Q4, 2016 and 600 by Q4, 2017. Do you think it would be fair that there could be a possibility that you could hit your targets sooner than anticipated if you continue on this trajectory?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Amit, as I mentioned in my opening comments, there is volatility in the results associated in particular with unexpected losses we can get at any time in property or any of our other shorter tail lines. We stand by our initial expectation that we've communicated with no change.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg with Janney.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning and thank you. I'm not sure if this is for Sid or Kevin but I think you guys do your actuarial review for Life in the third quarter and I just am wondering if you could give us any visibility on that. And how sensitive your profit assumptions are to investment returns and the sensitivity of those embedded returns to the alternative portfolio? So just wondering if there's any thoughts on that?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Larry. It's Sid here. Yeah, we do, do our actuarial assumption review in the third quarter. It's too early to tell. The one area, which we've highlighted for you, is in the legacy structured settlements where we've done some historical gains harvesting, but the work is still not complete. So we look to the third quarter call where we'll update you a little bit further on that","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. As far as share buyback capital return, you're definitely reducing P&C, but particularly property, which is capital-intensive. And then I think you mentioned that you're looking at ways to reinsure redundant Life reserves. Longer term does that open the door for greater than expected share buyback or greater than forecast share buyback?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Adam. It's Sid. Why don't I try and tackle some of the items you mentioned a little more holistically, if it's helpful there. We regularly review our forecasts and we remain confident in our commitments on capital return. As I look at where we are today and a little more color on the funding walk that we previously shared with you. First legacy asset monetizations have been ahead of where we initially projected. So we feel positive about that. And then secondly, I think going forward I would expect us to exceed the $5 billion to $7 billion funding target from dispositions given where we are today at this particular point in time.","That said, given how closely we monitor this there are always some period to period changes in our funding projections. So on dividends and tax sharing payments we remain roughly in line with our projections and they'll have some variability with market conditions and statutory capital. Our leverage remains in line, so it remains a very healthy under 20%. Hedge fund redemptions are on schedule and there the proceeds are market-dependent, of course.","And then finally with respect to both Life reinsurance and UGC, on UGC, there's an S-1 out there so I'm limited in what I can say other than I believe we're on track towards our separation.","And on Life reinsurance, we continue to make progress and we'll comment further once we have something that we believe is disclosable. So the punchline to that is, still on track and we're looking forward greatly, to updating you further next quarter.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","As we get to the top of the hour, I'd just like to end with some closing comments. I'm very pleased with this quarter. I'm very proud of the hard work of all of the employees that have made such a great job of the improvements that we have evidenced in this quarter and shown progress in achieving our longer-term goals. But I want to remind everybody, both our employees, our shareholders, our customers, that we're very much on a journey here.","We're in the second quarter of an eight quarter journey to return the company to a level of profitability, which we feel is compelling. And we want to do so while investing in talent and technology so that we \u2013 for the long term, so that we remain relevant to our clients as the world around us changes rapidly. And so this is a measured progress. I'm pleased with the results. I'm pleased with the progress, but we still have a long way to go and I think we got to stay very, very focused on execution and I'm just thrilled at the hard work of our employees, all of them, for their focus on executing this very important plan. Thank you very much, everybody.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"1974":["American International Group, Inc.

And so, we will all be available during Q&A.","And at this time, I'd like to lead off the prepared remarks with Peter.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to report the tangible progress we're making as we deliver on our strategic plan. Across AIG, we're working hard to execute on a transformation that will lead to improved profitability and will best serve all our stakeholders. As we've been repositioning the company, the support of our brokers, clients and employees has been greatly appreciated and is essential to our success.","In the first quarter, we reported $0.65 of operating earnings per share, including market-related losses of $0.48 largely due to hedge funds. Our market-sensitive assets continue to decline, and Sid will speak to our progress to further reduce these asset exposures.","We're off to a solid start to the year and in the quarter, we reduced expenses by 5% and returned $4 billion of capital to shareholders. As you can see on slide three and later in the presentation, our organizational improvements are proceeding on plan, and we're on target to reach our $1.6 billion in gross expense reduction by 2017. The steady pace of capital return continued throughout the quarter. Our strong capital and leverage ratios, attractive free cash flows, and risk management discipline allow us to execute on our plan to return $25 billion of capital to shareholders through 2017.","We have also provided details on the key drivers of our normalized ROE improvement including unusual items. It's important to note that normalized ROE may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to discrete tax items, as was the case this quarter. Additionally, the seasonality of anticipated catastrophe losses may result in quarterly ROE volatility. These fluctuations should not meaningfully impact full-year ROE, and we expect our full-year normalized ROE to be within our 8.4% to 8.9% targeted range. While we've seen market volatility impact our investments this quarter, the broader macro environment has not altered our focus or the direction of our strategic plans, as was evident in our continued pace of capital return.","Today, Rob will speak to the successful execution of our Commercial strategy in a competitive property casualty market. Kevin will elaborate on the value of the diversity of our Consumer business, and in particular, the strong earnings growth in Personal Insurance. The accomplishments that I'm seeing across the organization are what make me most excited about our future. In my meetings with clients, I've found that we are viewed as trusted partners who provide solutions to their most complex risk management needs.","We were recently recognized at the Annual RIMS Conference as the industry's number one carrier in National Underwriter's Risk Management Choice Awards, a recognition of our industry leadership by our clients. We also improved our competitive position within the group retirement market given our investments in technology, which resulted in greater retention and positive net flows for the first time in two years. Internally, our organizational realignment has eliminated 95% of matrix reporting which is energizing employees and resulting in faster decision-making.","Finally, I'd like to mention the news last week of our planned joint venture with Hamilton Re and Two Sigma is consistent with our ability to take advantage of AIG's scale for new initiatives. The joint venture reinforces AIG's commitment to data science and target the small- to medium-sized enterprise market by combining AIG's expertise in data with Two Sigma's technology platform.","Before Sid addresses the financials, I'd like to add that we are actively managing our operating and legacy portfolios that we presented on our strategy update call. Our success in managing these two portfolios is measured by the ROE improvement of the operating portfolio and a reduction in capital retained in our legacy portfolio.","Under Charlie Shamieh's leadership, the team has focused on execution and off to a brisk start. We look forward to updating you on his progress in future quarters. We're confident that we're building on the first quarter's accomplishments and moving towards our strategic objectives.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Sid.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress on our expense initiatives and our active capital management.","Turning to slide four, our core operating earnings showed good progress this quarter with solid underwriting results in both Commercial and Consumer, as well as strong expense management. We also reported net favorable reserve development this quarter of approximately $60 million across Commercial and Personal Insurance.","Looking ahead, while we're only one month into the second quarter, our early estimates of losses from earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador, along with the Texas floods, are in a range of $200 million to $300 million, roughly split between our Commercial and Consumer portfolios. Also of note, UGC delivered another strong quarter driven by improved loss experience and lower expenses.","Our reported operating tax rate was lower in the first quarter at just over 19%, benefiting from the favorable resolution of certain tax audit items in the quarter. We continue to expect our 2016 accrued operating tax rate to be approximately 32%. As a reminder, our valuable deferred tax asset allows us to maximize free cash flow to our parent.","Slide five depicts the net investment income trends for interest and dividends and other market-sensitive assets. Interest and dividends on our core investment portfolio has remained very steady at over $3 billion per quarter. Investments that are effectively marked-to-market through earnings contributed to significant volatility in recent quarters and include hedge funds, PICC and ABS\/CDOs which were driven by credit spreads. These investments accounted for roughly $870 million of pre-tax operating losses in the first quarter.","On our January strategy update call, we announced plans to reduce our hedge fund allocation by about half, freeing up $2 billion of capital towards our $25 billion capital return goal by the end of 2017. We kicked off our hedge fund strategy in 2015. As of quarter end, we have submitted notices of redemption for $4.1 billion of our hedge fund portfolio and as of today, we have received $1.2 billion of proceeds from those redemptions.","Yesterday, we announced the sale of PICC Property Casualty shares for gross proceeds of approximately $1.25 billion that will result in a non-operating, pre-tax realized gain of nearly $900 million. This transaction will have a positive impact on dividends and tax-sharing payments from subsidiaries, as well as book value per share ex-AOCI and DTA.","In addition, we monetized $1.7 billion of legacy assets during the first quarter and $3.8 billion over the last two quarters. We continue to make progress toward divestiture of UGC with the filing of our S-1, and we are on track to close Advisor Group this quarter. With actions taken to date, we are already at the low end of the $5 billion to $7 billion of divestitures that are funding part of our $25 billion capital return target.","Over the past four years, we have reduced our exposure to assets and derivatives that are effectively marked-to-market in earnings by approximately 40%. Future volatility will be reduced by the strategic actions with respect to the hedge funds and legacy portfolio that I spoke to.","Turning to slide six, we're making good progress on our expense reduction efforts with total general operating expenses down 5% from the same period last year on a constant-dollar basis, reflecting the restructuring actions that we took in the latter part of 2015. In addition, we recognized another $188 million of pre-tax non-operating restructuring charges in the quarter which is largely related to the items announced in the second half of 2015.","As a result of these actions, we expect our annual GOE run rate to decline by approximately $700 million to $800 million on an annualized basis with the larger impact in the second half of 2016. We remain confident in our $1.4 billion net GOE reduction goal by 2017.","Slide seven shows the improvement in our normalized ROE from a year ago, which excluding this quarter's tax benefit, was 8.4%. ROE increased by over a point from a year ago due to the nearly $12 billion of capital returned to shareholders in 2015, our focus on expense efficiency and improvements in Personal Insurance underwriting.","Book value per share ex-AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth was essentially flat this quarter at $59.05 per share as shown on slide eight and was negatively impacted by capital markets volatility, including net realized capital losses which totaled about $700 million after tax in the first quarter. Approximately half of those net realized losses were related to non-economic accounting volatility, resulting from differences in where we report the impact of FX on intercompany liabilities versus the matching available-for-sale investments. The offsetting FX gain on the AFS investments is recorded in AOCI.","We also realized losses upon the sale of energy positions which at the end of the quarter represented roughly 5% of our total AFS portfolio. These Q1 items may result in a shortfall to our 2016 book value per share growth target. However, we still expect to achieve double-digit book value per share growth this year. Our ability to reach a three-year compounded 10% growth in book value per share will in part depend on capital markets and macroeconomic conditions.","Slide nine shows our continued execution against our capital management targets. During the quarter, we deployed about $3.5 billion towards the purchase of approximately 63 million common shares, and we also repurchased 10 million of our outstanding warrants for $173 million. Since quarter-end and through May 2, we repurchased an additional $870 million of common shares which leaves about $3.7 billion unused under the $5 billion authorization that we announced in February.","During the quarter, we issued $1.5 billion of 5-year senior debt and $1.5 billion of 10-year senior debt. We created incremental economic value for shareholders through the completion of tender offers for approximately $800 million of purchase price of debt, which had a positive NPV.","This leaves our financial leverage ratio at the end of the quarter at just shy of 20%, at the low-end of our 20% to 25% targeted range that we spoke to on our strategy update call. Our RBC and rating agency capital ratios continue to remain within our targets. In addition, at quarter-end, we had $7.1 billion of parent liquidity. Our balance sheet remains very strong.","As Peter stated, we look forward to delivering on our strategic plan that we outlined in January and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress throughout 2016.","Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Sid. Today, I'll begin my remarks on page 12, which highlights our first quarter and the progress we're making towards our targets. Net premiums written declined 12% after adjusting for foreign exchange. The single largest driver of the decrease was the greater use of reinsurance representing approximately half of the 12% decline. Casualty product exits in North America and our remediation efforts also contributed to the decline in the quarter.","Overall, we expect the decrease of approximately $2.5 billion in net premiums written in 2016, reflecting an increase in our use of reinsurance along with exits from unprofitable lines. This is an increase from our previous $1.5 billion estimate and is consistent with our 4 points of expected accident year loss ratio improvement and an anticipated flat expense ratio.","We continue to experience new business growth and strong retention in profitable sub-segments, and will absolutely continue to grow in these areas. Consistent with our vision to be our client's most valued insurer, we are investing in lines where we offer a compelling value proposition such as D&O, cyber, M&A, multinational, and our large limit and middle market Property offerings.","Overall, U.S. rates improved almost 1 point in the quarter despite continued rate pressure in the excess and surplus lines Property business. U.S. casualty rates increased 3%, which is consistent with what we have seen in the past few quarters, and we expect that trend to continue. Rates were modestly positive for Financial lines in our Specialty businesses in the U.S. I would like to stress that we are thoroughly reviewing granular client retention metrics to differentiate our pricing strategy based on account by account profitability.","Slide 13 shows the continued improvement in Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio between 2011 and the first quarter of 2016, including the effect of prior period development for each accident year, which we previously presented on our strategy call. While the first quarter result of 64.5% included higher than expected attritional losses in Property, it represents a 1.7 point improvement over the full year of 2015, and we are on track to reach our 62% exit run rate for 2016.","In March, we announced a two-year agreement under which a share of our new and renewal U.S. Casualty business will be ceded to Swiss Re. We do not disclose the details of individual reinsurance agreements and the Swiss Re deal represents just one of a number of programs we have in place. We extend our thanks to all of our reinsurance partners, with whom we are highly aligned, for the confidence they have expressed in the continuing improving trend in our portfolio and in our leadership team. Upon expiration of the existing agreements, we expect to have a more profitable book of business and to be well positioned to retain more business or renew our reinsurance agreements under terms at least as favorable as they are today.","Collectively, we expect to cede approximately $1.5 billion in additional premiums related to quota share reinsurance in 2016, compared to the level ceded in 2015. The expected 2016 average ceded loss ratio will be at least 5 points higher than 2015 and ceding commissions will continue to cover fully-loaded costs for each deal, both individually and in the aggregate. The first quarter accident year loss ratio does not reflect the full impact of reinsurance as the benefit will grow each quarter over the next year. We expect that reinsurance will account for close to 2 points of our adjusted accident year loss ratio improvement by the end of 2017.","On February 2, we formally communicated to our distribution partners that we will no longer offer coverage in four specific underperforming portions of our North American Casualty and Environmental books. By exiting these few highly-targeted areas, we have the ability to significantly improve profitability as well as refocus our energy and technical expertise towards industry segments and client partnerships that are mutually beneficial.","Moving to our risk selection strategy, we achieved improvements in U.S. Casualty and U.S. Property as we continue to optimize our mix of business and accelerate the use of underwriting, pricing and analytic tools. With respect to our strategy of sharpening our focus on valued clients, you will recall that in 2015, approximately 83% of our U.S. Casualty clients purchased only one or two products and that some of those relationships were unprofitable. This represents approximately 15% of total U.S. Casualty premiums and we successfully remediated the majority of this business as it came up for renewal in the first quarter.","The top of slide 14 shows the adjusted accident year loss ratio for each sub-segment that made up our $20 billion of net premiums earned in 2015, which falls into three product sets \u2013 growth, maintain or improve and remediate. The bottom of the page shows the change in size and the accident year loss ratio for each portion of the portfolio for the full-year 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.","For the first quarter of 2016, we measured size based on net premiums written, which is a leading indicator of our progress, since the benefits of our recent actions will emerge in net premiums earned as the year continues. I will highlight four key observations for you on this page. First, I'm extremely pleased with the portfolio's change in mix of business. The grow and maintain portion of the business has increased from 50% of total premiums in 2015 to 59% of premiums in the first quarter, while the business we are remediating in Product Set 3 decreased from 15% of the portfolio to 9% over the same time period.","The second observation is that in addition to reducing the size of Product Set 3, the accident year loss ratio for this worst performing portion of the business improved significantly from 91% for the full-year 2015 to 86% on an earned basis in the first quarter driven mostly by the North American Casualty and Environmental exits.","My third observation is that the improved portion of Product Set 2 declined from 35% of total premiums in 2015 to 32% of premiums in the first quarter, while we improved the accident year loss ratio on an earned basis by 5 points from 73% to 68% over that same time period. These changes were primarily the result of our clients and risks selection strategy and the expansion of the reinsurance.","Finally, my fourth observation is that our progress will not always be linear due to market conditions, short sale losses and other issues outside of our control. Product Set 1 declined in size from 15% of total premiums in 2015 to 13% of premiums in the first quarter and the accident year loss ratio increased from 41% to 48% during that time, driven mostly by international Property.","The accident year loss ratio for Product Set 1 still remains very strong and as I mentioned earlier, investing in growth areas is a fundamental part of our strategy. We are deploying a disproportionate amount of our resources to teams focused on Product Set 1 to anticipate product needs and foster innovation to create value for our clients.","Our strategy is best characterized as one of focus and pace. We've moved quickly to concentrate our efforts on growing our strongest performing business and our most valued relationships while continuing to invest in data analytics, innovation and engineering to help our clients better mitigate risk.","In closing, we took a number of significant actions to improve Commercial's performance for the year. Although there's a lot more work to do, I'm confident that we're headed in the right direction and we're on target with the goals we've communicated.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin T. Hogan - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Consumer","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide an update on the Department of Labor's final rule and discuss the operating performance of our Consumer businesses.","Beginning with the final Department of Labor fiduciary rule published on April 8, the initial compliance date is April 10, 2017 with full compliance required by January 1, 2018. We are currently reviewing this final rule to evaluate its full impact on our customers, distribution partners, financial advisors and our business while continuing to prepare for compliance with the rule. We remain in active discussions with our distribution partners to be in the best position possible to meet the evolving needs of retirement savers. We plan to continue to offer a broad product portfolio through our diverse distribution network to meet the growing needs of consumers for guaranteed lifetime income and other saving solutions.","Turning to retirement results on slide 16, it was a strong quarter for retirement sales with 24% growth from a year ago led by fixed annuities and retail mutual funds. Sales continue to benefit from our multiple product and distribution channel strategy as reflected in our well-diversified base of assets under management. Market volatility during the quarter resulted in a flight to quality and increased investor appetite for fixed annuities. While risk-free rates declined, credit spreads were robust, allowing us to provide attractive overall rates while still maintaining our pricing and asset quality disciplines.","Net flows for retirement this quarter improved both sequentially and year-over-year, and notably, were positive for each one of our product lines, reflecting the strength of our distribution platform. The positive net flows in group retirement reflect our ongoing investments to enhance both our planned sponsor service and participant experience.","As you can see on slide 17, we continue to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Looking forward, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our base yields will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter.","In Life, as shown on slide 18, we saw growth in premiums and deposits of 4% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Mortality trends to continue to be in line with our expectations. We saw good growth in U.S. life sales from the same period last year reflecting the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of our independent distribution channels. We are also making progress in executing in our plans to finance our remaining redundant reserves with a series of reinsurance transactions that will improve the returns of that portfolio and allow for increase distributions to parent. We will provide you with updates on these transactions as they are completed.","Turning to slide 19, the first quarter was very strong for Personal Insurance with $222 million of pre-tax operating income. We saw significant improvement in the accident year loss ratio in the U.S. which primarily related to U.S. Personal Property, which experienced fewer large claims and generated increase in premiums.","We also continued to strong premium growth in our private client group in the U.S. Net premiums written for PCG were up 13% from the same period last year with nine consecutive months of double-digit growth. We also continue to make progress on the expense front in Personal Insurance and we are seeing benefits from our strategy to narrow our focus to 15 countries for individual Personal Insurance products while continuing to serve our multinational partners.","In addition, we are seeing the results of our overall organizational expense initiatives. Japan delivered a meaningful part of the acquisition costs and GOE savings this quarter and acquisition costs benefited from our efforts to reposition direct marketing in Japan. While we continue to expect that expenses will be the key lever to future margin expansion in Personal Insurance, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments. With respect to Japan, we remain focused on a successful execution of the merger as we have previously reported.","To close, while we have already experienced some catastrophe and severe loss events, as Sid highlighted, that will impact Personal Insurance operating results in the second quarter, we remain focused on continued execution of our strategic priorities across all of our Consumer businesses.","Now, I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you. Operator, before you open the line, I just want to remind everybody that similar to the past quarters, we'll take one question and one follow-up. And then we'd ask that you please get back in queue so that we can answer as many questions as possible.","With that, I will begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go first to Jay Cohen with Bank of America.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Just one question on the Personal Insurance. You talked about the A&H [Accident and Health] business being, I guess, restructured. What's going on in that business? What kind of premium declines you would be expecting going forward?","Kevin T. Hogan - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Consumer","The A&H restructuring has been undertaken for the last couple of years, Jay. And I think what we're seeing in A&H is a combination of foreign exchange effects, particularly in the international business which is the bulk of that business, and it is the faster growing part of that business. So, in particular, in the United States in the travel business, we have focused on a sustainable and competitive position there. And we believe that recent market developments are likely to ensure that our position is the one that our distribution partners will be choosing.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. That's helpful, and then, just a follow-question for Rob. Rob, obviously, you've got ambitious goals this year in the Commercial side. As you look at the first quarter, can you talk about \u2013 and I know this is not going to happen in a linear fashion \u2013 but can you talk about the progress you made in the first quarter relative to what you had expected and where you are at this point?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Okay. Sure, Jay. I'll say that overall, I'm quite pleased with where we were in the first quarter. I would say that our progress with respect to reinsurance was better than we had anticipated. Our progress with respect to the longer tail lines, Casualty in particular, was better than we had expected. But our progress with respect to shorter tail lines \u2013 Property was the area that I think that we didn't live up to my expectations. And in particular, that was with respect to attritional losses in the U.S. I'm very confident that the team has some good strategies and a great plan for what we'll do to address that in 2016, but overall, I'm quite pleased with the progress.","Operator","We'll go next to Randy Binner with FBR Investment.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thanks. Just a couple on Commercial lines. Just to get the numbers right on the Swiss Re. I think you said that there be $1.5 billion ceded relative to 2015 and the decreased in this quarter's top-line in Commercial lines was attributed to the Swiss Re deal. So, is the Swiss Re deal something like $1 billion ceded off of gross? And is it mean \u2013 is that the right way to think of it so that would be two-thirds of it and the remaining third would be something that you try to negotiate over the balance of 2016?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","I want to make sure I \u2013 that I say this for you as clearly as possible. First of all, I don't want to comment about Swiss Re specifically. Let's just talk about reinsurance transactions overall. So, what I said in my prepared remarks is that we have \u2013 we expect to see $1.5 billion of additional premiums related to quota share in 2016 compared to the 2015 levels. So, we already were using quota share in 2015. The increase from all reinsurance transactions, Swiss Re and other during 2016, we expect to increase the amount that we see by $1.5 billion.","So, as we write business throughout the course of 2016, a piece of the business that we write in 2016 will attach to this quota share reinsurance agreement. And you should think of it as that premium volume, on a net-written-premium basis, will decline but it won't affect earned premium until those premiums earn in over the course of the next year after the date they've been written.","So for example, premiums written on December 31 of 2016 will be covered by a reinsurance agreement that was covering the year 2016 on a quota share basis. But those premiums won't be fully earned until December 31 of 2017, so you'll feel the full effect of that in our income statement across the \u2013 really, across the \u2013 a year after the premiums have been written. I hope that's helpful.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","It is. And then, on \u2013 just a follow-up on \u2013 in Commercial and Sid, you mentioned there were reserve redundancies in the quarter. Can you give any color on what line and accident years that was related to? Just curious how that might have related to some of the adverse development we saw in the fourth quarter.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I point you to the 10-Q. The main item that I'd probably call out is we're favorable in both Commercial and Consumer. Commercial, mostly driven by Specialty and in North America there was a slight negative but that negative was related to reinsurance adjustments in Property, so it's not related to any long tail lines.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thank you for taking my question. Sid, in his prepared remarks said that there were about $4 billion in hedge fund redemptions set and $1-point-something billion so far had been received. How does that compare to the $2 billion plan to \u2013 capital plan \u2013 what are the relationship between those two numbers exactly?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think the main thing you need to look at is with respect to what we put in notice for redemption, that typically the capital charge for those assets is roughly 50% or even slightly north of that. So, take the $4 billion and apply the capital charge and that gives you a sense of what you think the capital impact should be.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And the second question is given the reinsurance transaction in the quarter, what were the impacts that they had on first quarter loss ratio and expense ratio given where you would have been if those transactions had not been put in place?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Yes, they are minimal. They're minimal because we've not earned much of that premium in the first quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Couple questions here. First one, Rob, just curious, the growth coming from Property lines and if you look at kind of broker service and stuff, that's been the most competitive line of business out there. Can you kind of describe your Property book, where you're growing, and why we shouldn't be concerned that you're growing in what the brokers are saying is the most competitive line?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Yes. Well, first thing I'll do is I'll acknowledge and reaffirm that that is the most competitive line. You'll notice when I commented about rates, I said that Property rates in the U.S. were down in the first quarter, and that's actually been a continuing theme over the course of the last two years at least. Our growth in Property has been focused on the highly engineered space. As we mentioned previously, we've increased the number of engineers on our team today to be approximately 700 engineers worldwide. Most of those engineers support our Property business but not solely our Property business. And actually, today, we have more engineers than underwriters in the U.S. property market.","So, when we're growing in Property, what we're doing is transforming our book from being one where we were a capital provider amongst many to instead being a risk management partner with our clients where we're using our engineering capability to reduce the likelihood of a loss in the first place.","And so, our growth in that area is in the large limit Property space and in the middle market Property space where engineering is the backbone of the business that we're writing. We're shrinking in the traditional excess and surplus lines shared and layered Property business.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. And then, just a follow-up then on the Property. Would that carry lower attritional loss ratios, those engineered lines, and maybe more volatility to them?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","We expect those engineered loss to carry \u2013 lines to carry \u2013 lower attritional loss ratios, yes.","Operator","And we'll go next to...","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","I'll just add that we also use reinsurance as a tool in the Property space and we'll continue to look in opportunities for reinsurance in the Property space, to manage severe losses as well as, of course, to manage our natural catastrophe exposures.","Operator","And we'll go next to Larry Greenberg with Janney.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning. So Rob, the increase in the reduction of premium in Commercial, the $2.5 billion from $1.5 billion for this year, I assume a big part of that increase is coming from reinsurance. But just any color on the breakdown of that?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Yes. That is really completely from the increasing use of reinsurance. I think, just say that the reinsurance market has been more robust than we had initially anticipated. And as you know, we're viewing our reinsurers as partners. We have excellent relationships and opportunities to succeed together.","But ultimately, the business that we're ceding to those reinsurers is improving our mix of business and ultimately not passing business that is poor business from AIG to our reinsurers. But instead, the reinsurers, I think, find the business that we're ceding attractive for a number of reasons including the fact that many \u2013 in many cases \u2013 they're holding less capital against the business than we are. And many of our reinsurers also have a lower targeted return level than AIG has.","And then, of course, I think that the reinsurers really believe in the underwriting actions that we've taken. So, those are the things that I think have created the increase in use of reinsurance and that's the primary driver of the increase.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great. And then just one follow-up for Sid. Since you are reporting the DIB and GCM in the other asset line, we're getting less disclosure on that. And I'm just wondering if you could give us what the equity is today in the DIB and GCM, and perhaps some numbers on how much in ABS CDOs are held there?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think that I would point you to \u2013 we don't give that disclosure on the DIB and GCM anymore \u2013 but the large bulk, as we've said, of the equity in DIB and GCM is in the ABS Holdings. And that number typically, although it changes in terms of mark-to-market, is in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion.","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Clayton Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Peter, thank you for taking the question. I appreciate all the color and update on the operating initiatives. Obviously, it's great to hear about all the progress. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to speak to sort of \u2013 to a higher level question. If you think strategically, it's been a couple of months since you folks announced a new strategy and announced that you'd accept some activists joining your board.","I'm wondering if you can update us a bit on your conversations sort of within the group as well as just your general thinking on some of the big strategic questions, like remaining at SIFI in light of the MetLife court victory, or how you're thinking on divestitures as evolving as your businesses become more modular. And I ask both of these, in particular I think, because you've said you'd very much like to beat your $25 billion capital return goals over the next two years and I kind of imagine that you're probably going to have to consider additional divestitures or maybe pursue a path to de-SIFI to achieve that.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think that as we've indicated, the $25 billion goal is achievable with all of the actions that we've laid out. So, I would say that there is contingency against adverse market environment baked into our plan. So, I do not think that being a SIFI in any way inhibits that $25 billion goal. It's not a binding constraint at all.","But I think that the MetLife decision certainly raises the opportunity, should it be favorable, to consider that down the road. But I repeat that our current designation as a non-bank SIFI does not constrain our objectives as laid out in our strategic update. So, we are watching very carefully the appeal process and we point to the efforts that we've made as a company to delever the company, to derisk the company since the crisis.","So, I think that any designation by FSOC around non-bank SIFI status should look at the metrics relative to others to show what we've done to delever the company. And so, I think that we have great confidence that our plan to improve operating margins, to return capital to shareholders will deliver expansion in ROE in our operating portfolio, and the thoughtful divestiture of the legacy assets in an orderly way will realize the optimal balance between book value growth and ROE expansion.","Josh Clayton Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's helpful, Peter. I'm wondering, Rob, if just tactically one of \u2013 we've had a lot of conversation about reinsurance and I really love your guys' slide on page 14. I'm wondering if we could sort of set reinsurance aside though for a second and just think about sort of gross or sort of primary \u2013 sort of an ex-reinsurance view of the business. Can you give us some \u2013 any kind of metrics we can sort of hang or had on around, like, the amount of pricing you're taking in the worst businesses or the ultimate, the amount of size that you expect, like the remediate or the improved bucket to be as you look at over the next year or two?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","So, one thing I think I would say to you, Josh, is we will likely show you a version of slide 14 at the end of the year that's recalibrated to what did 2016 look like, right? We'll show you the best 15%, the worst 15%, and then the middle part of the portfolio. I clearly believe that what you should expect is that for the business that we hold on our books in 2015 that we've been working on remediating, you should continue to see Product Set 3 significantly reduce in size. And as we've said we would, we've taking clear action to exit specific underperforming products and client relationships, but remember, we can only do that as those policies come up for renewal with proper notification in accordance with the state laws and regulations.","We've also given our underwriters better tools to help them make good judgments in their underwriting decisions. And I think all of those things should continue to show that Product Set 3 will decline in size and the loss ratio will improve. Product Set 2, the middle part. I think you'll continue to see growth in the maintained side of Product Set 2. And you'll see us continue to improve both the loss ratio and reduce the size of the improved size of Product Set 2. But we do expect to grow in Product Set 1. I think that reinsurance is really serving to help us in Product Set 2 more than anything. And that's the place \u2013 what you should understand is, really, our actions to exit and our actions to remediate that are driving down the volume of Product Set 3. And you should also expect that we'll continue to disproportionately put our resources toward the growth in Product Set 1. But I think we'll continue to try to find ways to help you to have better transparency into the performance of the portfolio using a slide like slide 14 going forward.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much. Rob, you guys talked about Commercial overall, but you didn't really drill down into North America specifically. There, we did see nice margin improvement, a couple of hundred basis points and premiums were down there, 25%. I guess, one question I have is, over the 400 to 600 basis points of margin improvement that you're targeting, what proportion do you expect to come from North America versus international? And is the North America piece where the reinsurance and non-renewal has a more disproportionate impact?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","You were correct on pretty much everything you said. The reinsurance is focused much more around North America. The remediation efforts are focused much more around North America, and to be specific, focus much more around the United States. We continue to see great opportunities for growth. And we see that the profitability in Canada, in North America feels good.","I will say with respect to international, really, our bigger challenge in international is around expenses. The loss ratios in our international business I feel good about. We need to continue to make sure that we can deliver those loss ratios with an efficient structure that will keep our expense ratios at a manageable level.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I see. So, in terms of the loss ratio \u2013 that the severe losses ticked up year-over-year \u2013 was that for you an unusual level of severe losses or is that something you expect should continue in that sort of range?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, we really expect \u2013 first of all, severe losses overall were pretty much in line with our expectations. We do expect that severe losses will be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and we do think that they'll be lumpy from geography to geography. With that said, we continue to be keenly focused on severe losses in the international portfolio to make sure that we're managing that effectively. But quite frankly, I think \u2013 we think about it on an overall basis and we were satisfied with severe losses during the quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","With regard to the share buyback, if I was looking at what a ratable level of share buybacks would have been over each quarter for two years, I was looking at around $2.75 billion; in the first quarter, that came in at $3.5 billion. So, does that mean that AIG is just kind of pulling forward the pace of the buyback or, I mean, based on my math, it looks like return of capital at that current pace could be slightly over $30 billion over the two years?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Look, Jay, we don't really comment on our timing of capital return. I would just point you to, obviously, in the first quarter, we had very strong share repurchase. But in addition, two items of note, we did also generate incremental net present value via our debt tender and that obviously impacted our use of capital, as well as the warrants.","So, we expect that we're not likely to follow any form of metronome in terms of the timing of share repurchase. It'll vary based on what we see as relative value quarter to quarter as we return capital and hit our $25 billion target.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","In the past, you've said at least $25 billion. I just want to make sure that's still the case.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","At least $25 billion. That's correct.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. And then, Sid, are there any signs of a recovery in the alternative asset income in 2Q? I mean, that was a $900 million drag on results in the last quarter. Are you seeing any signs of recovery so far in 2Q?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a little too early to tell right now, Jay. I mean, obviously, we'll have a better sense as the different indices provide their results to us shortly.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the important thing to remember is that our strategy is to reduce our reliance on those alternative earnings over the course of the next 18 months. And so, as you look at the exit run rate of ROE of the operating portfolio at the end of 2017, you don't need to factor in any over-reliance on alternative assets as a source of net investment income.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Nadel with Piper Jaffray.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning. A question for Rob, I just wanted to follow up on a couple of quick data points here. The accident year loss ratio in Commercial, I believe you indicated that the reinsurance deals to-date really had no significant impact on that. But you expect, over the course of the next year, it has about a 2-point positive swing. Is that right?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","That's correct. By the end of 2017, John, it'll have about a 2-points improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio. And remember, the reason that's the case is because the business that we write late this year won't be fully earned until late next year.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Understood. And then, so if we look at under the hood at the other pieces, you mentioned that attritional losses in the Property side were higher than you would have otherwise expected. When you look at the rest of the Commercial business, were there areas where you feel like you just outperformed relative to your expectations?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Yes. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our Financial lines book of business. Continue \u2013 really, was quite happy with what we did in the Casualty space. That team has been working very hard over a long period of time. I'm quite proud of what our results are that we've achieved there. And so, I think that the combination of tools that we've developed, the discipline of the underwriters and the use of reinsurance all bode very well for what the outcome will be for us, for the longer-tail Casualty business. We're really focused, at this point in time, on improving the attritional losses in the Property book.","Operator","And we'll go next to Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Let's start with a question for Sid. Is there any way of getting a handle of how much the capital charge is likely to go down for P&C assuming that the year-over-year improvements in both reserves and accident year results continue?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think \u2013 we don't disclose that, but I think you're really likely to see, based on the shift in mix in Rob's business, that the other liability line in the Property Casualty companies which have, obviously, the highest RBC charge, that shift in business is going to drive that component of our RBC charge down.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And, Rob, can you talk a little bit about the, I guess, the decline in the proportion of net written premiums from Product Set 1. Is that seasonality or is that the disappointment you were alluding to?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, I guess the way I want you to think about Product Set 1 is just remember that as you would likely expect, we're using internal tools and metrics to inform the underwriting actions in each of these product sets. And while in general we want to grow Product Set 1, we're guided by our return on equity and our RAP [risk-adjusted profitability] spread for each of these products in any given product set. So, during the first quarter, we did grow well in businesses such as cyber and M&A that are parts of Product Set 1, but we were disciplined in the highly competitive international Property market where we were guided by our ROE and our RAP metrics.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Newman (sic) [Paul Newsome] with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I guess my name changed but he was better looking. I have a couple questions. One relates to the hedge funds. As I think through next quarter's results from my expectation, I assume it looks like \u2013 because there's a lag in how you and everybody else reports hedge funds and alternatives \u2013 that essentially the first quarter hedge fund results will be your second quarter result. So, the piece that I'm not so certain about is the impact of the redemptions that have happened so far and whether or not the redemptions themselves will change how much of the results in the second quarter, given that you report the hedge funds and the alternatives on a lag?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean, I would just make two quick points. The lag impact obviously is a short lag, so we wouldn't anticipate a very material impact, and it's on a portion that's obviously on the equity method.","The second point is we gave you our estimate of about $1.2 billion of proceeds. So, you can think of that as a reduction in our overall hedge fund exposure and assume that that's reinvested as we told you before in high grade \u2013 high investment grade bonds \u2013 and some real estate.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","And more than half of the $1.2 billion came in April.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Of the redemption proceeds, so, well in excess of half of that $1.2 billion was received from redemptions that took place in April.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. So, it should have an impact. And then, I have an unrelated question about the Property Casualty business. Obviously, the mix is going more towards Property, less towards liability. As I think of it \u2013 my model \u2013 does that also mean that we should think about a higher cat load as a percent of premium prospectively as the mix changes towards more Property?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Well, I guess I would say that our overall cat load I expect to come down. Obviously, as the mix of business changes, it'll just be proportionate to the total book of business. But I want to emphasize that we're actually bringing our cat load down for the entire portfolio. At the same, remember that some of our lines, for example, Financial lines and Specialty are continuing to demonstrate growth, so you should expect to see growth in Financial lines, growth in Specialty, and you'll continue to see us decline the total amount of cat load across the portfolio.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","And I think that this is a continuation of a rebalancing of our Property portfolio that was \u2013 been going on for five years \u2013 which is to de-emphasize the overconcentration in Gulf cat-exposed Property and take advantage of the diversity of our geographic global reach as well as the investments we've made in highly engineered Property and middle market, where it's really avoided the concentrated risk that is prevalent in the shared and layered market that was in the Property book five years ago. So, I think this is a continued diversification of the Property book just to reduce the PML and AAL in a steady way. And obviously, the soft reinsurance market helps even more to iron out any concentrations.","Operator","We'll go next to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. A couple of questions. First, Rob, you spoke in detail about your expectations on the loss ratio. Can you talk about the expense ratio in the Commercial business over the next couple of years?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'm really pleased with the progress we're making on the expense ratio. We participate as a part of the broader AIG expense initiative, which really has been underway for quite some time. And so, as you can see here, even in the first quarter, what's happening is the expense reductions that began previously are actually happening in front of the reduction of premiums that we're experiencing on a net earned basis. And so, it is our intention to continue to maintain a flat expense ratio as we continue to manage the overall book in the Commercial space.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. So basically, as premiums are coming down, you shouldn't really expect an improvement in expense ratio, but maybe overall expenses stay somewhat flat?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","That's right. I think what happens is \u2013 I think expenses will decline, to be clear. I think that the expense ratio will be relatively flat. And again, just to be clear, when we are doing reinsurance on a quota share basis, we're receiving a ceding commission that is covering our fully-allocated costs on both a deal by deal, as well as on an overall basis across all of these quota share reinsurance agreements. So, as the premium volume comes down, we're also reducing the expenses proportionately.","Operator","We'll go next to Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I guess just taking a step back looking at slide 14, I mean, clearly there's a lot of moving parts here thinking about what we're run-rating at versus what's kind of earning in this quarter. I mean, the reported accident loss ratio in Commercial is 64.5%, but if you look at it on the written basis, it looks like it's closer to 63%, which would be about 75% of the way there to the 4 points you said you think you can get, when we're only a quarter into this. Is that the right way to think about it or would you caution us against that in any way?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Well, I guess I want to caution you against, is I think we're \u2013 we just state that I think that we're on target \u2013 and I don't want there to be any expectation beyond that at this point. What I think is important to understand on page 14, and I said this in my prepared remarks, the premium that we're showing for 2016 is on a net-premiums-written basis. But the accident year loss ratios that you're seeing are on an earned basis. And so, the earned accident year loss ratio, for example, that you're seeing in Product Set 3 of 86%, includes any of the premium that was earned in the first quarter for that Product Set regardless of when it was written. And so, I just would caution, it's very difficult for you to make any \u2013 particularly assumptions \u2013 that were anything other than on target at this point in time.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, understood. And then just on Product Set 1, 7 points of accident year loss ratio deterioration there. Just curious how much of that would you attribute to pricing pressure, rate headwinds versus just elevated attritional losses? Thanks.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","No, it's really all international Property. And the international Property book actually, last year, had particularly low loss ratios. And so, I am not so sure that \u2013 the combination, I think, of increased rate, rate pressure for Property on a global basis \u2013 but also, just that we performed particularly well in 2015 in the international Property space.","So, I'm not concerned about the increase in the loss ratio that you're seeing there for Product Set 1. With that said, we focus on both the size of Product Set 1 and maintaining a strong performance from an underwriting perspective, in that, as well as all the other Product Set.","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator, I'm afraid that we're going to have to follow up with whoever's left in the queue because we're over our allotted hour.

Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our 2016 accomplishments and provide an updated outlook for 2017. But first, I'll speak to our recent announcement of an adverse development cover with Berkshire Hathaway and our Q4 reserve strengthening.","Let me begin by providing some historical perspective on the adverse development cover. We've evaluated ADCs from time to time and followed our 2015 reserve addition. We felt it was a strategic imperative to radically reduce reserve risk and improve earnings sustainability. At that time, Doug, Rob and Sid were new to their roles, and I'd asked them to carefully evaluate our business in force, new business underwriting and sources of alternative capital. As we've stated, reinsurance is a key component of our strategy, and one outcome of their work was the agreement with Berkshire, which reinsures the vast majority of our U.S. Casualty reserves, and more importantly, exposures going back more than 40 years.","While adverse development covers are not new to the industry, an agreement of this scope and scale is redefining. Berkshire is a knowledgeable partner with investment expertise and balance sheet strength, which are well-matched with AIG's claims capabilities. The economics and the reduction in risk associated with this agreement will provide benefits for many years to come and pivot us towards the future AIG, with lower risk of impairments to book value, higher-quality earnings, and ultimately, a lower cost of capital.","In the fourth quarter, we also announced a $5.6 billion prior-year reserve addition, as we reacted to emerging severity trends across lines and accident years. We chose to make more prudent reserve assumptions, which Sid will speak to. The trends we witnessed and reacted to this quarter were broad, and we believe are materially impacting the overall U.S. Casualty market, which we see generally as rate inadequate.","With new information we gain insights. And for our Excess business, claims emergence can take several years to become apparent. In this case, what we have learned recently confirms our existing strategy to adjust volumes, limit and increase rate in our U.S. Casualty book, while maintaining our focus on our most-valued clients, many of whom have been with us for decades. We're confident that our actions will improve our underwriting consistency and profitability. And Rob will comment further on this in his remarks.","Looking back on 2016, as shown on slide 4, there were significant accomplishments to improve profitability, return capital to shareholders and further sculpt the company. We surpassed our expense reduction target and decreased 2016 expenses by over $1 billion or 10%. These cost reductions were based on a number of disciplined actions to provide sustainable operating efficiencies.","Capital return remains a commitment to this management team, and 2016 was no exception to our long track record. We returned over $13 billion in capital, again, exceeding our original target. We maintain our commitment to the $25 billion capital return target and are focused on doing so in a manner that ensures the continued confidence of our clients in our claims-paying ability. We recognize the great efforts and engagement of our rating agencies and regulators, who have been so critical for the successful transformation of AIG. And we'll continue to work closely with them to serve all our stakeholders.","Our capital flexibility has been driven by our divestitures, and legacy asset sales, and the strength of our diverse insurance subsidiaries. Divesting businesses that are not part of our core insurance operations and selling legacy assets is consistent with our strategy to increase focus. Over the course of the year, we completed or announced 10 transactions that are expected to result in over $10 billion of liquidity.","Most importantly, I'd like to highlight the 2016 accomplishments of our Consumer and Commercial businesses. Consumer profitability grew, and pre-tax operating earnings increased over 30% to over $3.8 billion. Profitability was driven by stable Individual and Group Retirement earnings and strong growth in Personal Insurance. The Personal Insurance geographic strategy and underwriting margin expansion should continue to benefit future earnings, which Kevin will expand upon.","In our Commercial businesses, you've heard from Rob this year that we've increased our focus on our most profitable product lines and clients. At the same time, we've maintained our leadership position in Financial Lines and expanded our multinational capabilities.","As you consider our future progress, we would refer you to our new business modules, which are an important lens through which to view our future business strategies. Our modules provide greater transparency into how we measure our business, assign greater control and accountability to our managers, and improve efficiency and profitability. We recognize that we had provided a significant amount of information this quarter, and we will be providing greater insight into our module strategies in the near future. The trends in our module ROEs as they stabilize will become a key measure for our businesses' performance internally and externally.","Turning to slide 5, our actions this quarter increased the visibility in reaching our 2017 goals of a 9.5% core insurance normalized ROE. While we have lowered our normalized ROE target by 50 basis points due to lost investment income, I believe this reduction has exceeded by the decline in our cost of capital, resulting from the ADC, legacy dispositions, a reduction in U.S. housing market exposure through our UGC sale, reduced cap volatility, and lower fixed costs. Beyond 2017, we would expect to see further ROE improvements.","We expect to reach or exceed our expectations for expense reduction and capital return, subject to regulatory and rating agency considerations. You will continue to see improvements in our core businesses and further investments in people and technology. We believe the actions we took this quarter and the continuing steps to execute our strategy, best position AIG for more stable and profitable long-term results.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Sid.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide further details on our adverse development cover, the fourth quarter reserve strengthening, our quarterly financial results, and our outlook for 2017.","As we discussed with you at our Investor Day, our objective has been to be vigilant about managing reserve risk. As Peter mentioned, in Q2 of 2016, we initiated a process to evaluate an adverse development cover, utilizing a third-party reinsurance broker and evaluating multiple markets and structures.","Slide 6 illustrates how we have transformed our reserve risk profile as a result of the ADC. Under the agreement, AIG will pay the first $25 billion of liabilities, and then split the next $25 billion of payments 80\/20 up to a $50 billion limit. At the end of 2016, we held $16 billion of nominal reserves above the $25 billion attachment point, including the 4Q reserve addition. 80% of these reserves, or $12.8 billion, are ceded. The difference between the $12.8 billion of ceded reserves and the consideration paid, including interest, will result in an estimated $2.6 billion pre-tax deferred gain before discount in Q1 2017. This gain will be amortized over the estimated reinsurance recovery period.","In terms of our GAAP results, we are required to recognize 100% of any future favorable or adverse reserve development on the covered liabilities in our GAAP net income. The deferred gain on the ADC will be then adjusted for 80% of the impact, as well as the amortization of this gain. Only 20% of any future potential reserve development will impact our operating income.","Turning to page 7, you'll see that the agreement covers U.S. Casualty and Financial Lines, which accounts for 80% of the adverse development we have realized over the past two years. Excluded from the cover is our international Commercial business, certain retrospectively rated loss-sensitive policies, short-tail commercial lines, personal lines and legacy reserves, which contributed approximately $700 million to the fourth-quarter reserve addition. We expect this transaction will dramatically reduce operating earnings volatility and improve ROE in the long term.","As you know, we also review our reserves over the course of the fourth quarter. On page 8, the fourth quarter actions we took were based on emerging trends and new claims data, supporting a more cautious view in our assumptions. The adverse reserve development on covered reserves was $4.9 billion, the vast majority of which is U.S. Casualty. Of this amount, $2.5 billion was related to incurred loss development methodology and tail factor strengthening for the line subject to the ADC.","The bottom chart illustrates the accident years impacted by the reserve strengthening. While we did see some large claims activity in Financial Lines, our performance in this business well exceeds our hurdle rates even after factoring in this development. So, I'll focus my comments on the U.S. Casualty business.","Turning to slide 9, there were three things we learned during the course of our reviews. First, in general, for U.S. Casualty, we saw an increase in frequency and severity of claims, which became more material in the third quarter and accelerated in the fourth quarter that caused us to increase our trend and loss development factors across those lines.","Second, in Excess Casualty, we saw an increase in both paid and incurred claims for recent accident years, particularly 2015. And while recent accident years remain very green, we felt it prudent to strengthen reserves for this new claims data.","Third, in certain lines, where we have taken dramatic actions to reduce writings, such as commercial auto and health care, loss cost continued to worsen, and we decided to book reserves hire in the range of estimated losses. In summary, we believe in light of the reserve data. We've appropriately revised our assumptions to weigh more recent trend in setting a best-estimate reserve.","Another important point is the setting of our loss picks in light of the recent trends. For the year, we added approximately $700 million to the 2016 accident year and included an additional $500 million in our outlook for the 2017 accident year, almost entirely in U.S. Casualty. We revised our methodology and philosophy to include a margin for the reasonable uncertainty around casualty loss trends, a shift from our historical approach.","This refinement was further validated by Berkshire Hathaway's pricing of the ADC. Rob will speak to the underwriting actions the Commercial team has implemented in his remarks. The ADC transaction, reserve strengthening, adjustments to loss picks and underwriting actions are important steps to position AIG for future profitability and improve earnings quality. Going forward, you can expect our future earnings to better reflect the profitability of new business underwritten.","Moving on to the quarter, we reported an operating loss per share of $2.72, which was largely driven by the prior-year adverse development charge of $3.56 per share. As you will hear later today, Consumer had a strong fourth quarter and delivered nearly $1 billion in pre-tax profits. Commercial results included not only the reserve development but my previously referenced increase in our 2016 loss picks. We also recorded $233 million in catastrophe losses from Hurricane Matthew, which was in line with our expectations.","Turning to page 11, you can see our progress versus 2016 targets. While we exceeded our expense reduction targets for the year and our planned pace on capital return, the reserve strengthening charge and increased loss picks set us back against our accident year loss ratio, book value growth, and ROE targets. As we look forward, we have a higher degree of confidence in achieving sustainable improvement in each of these metrics and expect less volatility going forward.","Turning to slide 12, as Peter stated, we reduced operating expenses by over $1 billion or 10% for the year. Including our actions taken to-date, our annual run rate savings total $1.3 billion, thus we've effectively reached our two-year targeted expense reduction a year ahead of plan. And we expect further reductions that will improve our ROE going forward.","Our balance sheet and free cash flow remains very strong. And as you can see on slide 13, parent liquidity at quarter end was $8.4 billion. We are ahead of plan and our projections continue to support our target to return $25 billion of capital to shareholders. We will continue to return capital to shareholders prudently and with appropriate quarterly consultation with rating agencies and regulators.","During the quarter, we continued to execute against our capital return target and returned $3.3 billion of capital to shareholders, the year-to-date total to $13.1 billion. Since quarter end and through February 14th, we repurchased an additional $1.2 billion of common shares, leaving about $1.2 billion unused under the remaining authorization prior to yesterday's additional $3.5 billion authorization.","Notable items in the quarter include the $2.2 billion of cash proceeds received on closing the UGC sale, as well as a pre-closing dividend of $250 million received from UGC. We also received $1.1 billion of newly issued Arch convertible non-voting common equivalent preferred shares. Importantly, we completed the second of our planned life reinsurance transactions associated with XXX\/AXXX in the fourth quarter. This is expected to result in additional parent liquidity, principally in the fourth form of tax sharing payments of $2.3 billion expected in 2017.","With respect to the plan to reduce hedge funds by about half by the end of 2017, our hedge fund reductions totaled $3.2 billion in 2016. This has freed up capital of approximately $1.1 billion in 2016 and an additional $500 million in 2017, which resulted in additional dividend payments to the holding company. Finally, we expect the ADC transaction will receive approval from regulators to be recognized at our year-end 2016 statutory financials, providing favorable risk-based capital treatment.","Turning to Legacy on slide 14, we are very pleased with the progress we made in shrinking Legacy this quarter and improving intrinsic value, while carefully managing the impact of book value. In particular, the fourth quarter included the sale of our Korea IFC real estate complex and a portion of our life settlements portfolio.","Turning to slide 15, at year-end, we had tax attribute DTAs totaling approximately $14.8 billion, of which approximately one-quarter related to foreign tax credits and three-quarters related to net operating loss carry forwards. In addition, we had a net DTA for temporary differences in the amount of $5.9 billion. We are pleased with the progress we've made with respect to utilizing our foreign tax credits.","Slide 16 shows the changes in book value year-over-year. The chart illustrates that book value growth, including dividend growth was 3% for the year. However, book value growth in core for the year was 7%, even after the impact of the reserve strengthening charge. We continue to expect strong book value growth and a more stable book value due to the ADC as we move forward. But as I have said before, we are making trade-offs with respect to legacy in terms of recognizing immediate book value charges for future ROE improvements.","Slide 17 details our core normalized ROE for the year and our target for 2017. When you evaluate our new modules, you will see our view of return on economic capital. Some of our modules are meeting their cost of capital, while others have more work to do. And Rob and Kevin will comment on that further in their remarks.","I also wanted to highlight that as part of our recast of modular results, we moved to a simpler method of normalizing our annual average loss expectation, also known as our AAL for tax. We'd historically incorporated a seasonality adjustment to estimate the quarterly allocations, but now, we're allocating the AAL evenly across the four quarters. All of the historical periods reflect this change. Note that with the actions we have announced this quarter, including the ADC, we would expect the future impact of normalizations to be moderated going forward.","Moving to 2017, we show the impact of the quarter's actions on our ROE target. Our 2017 target for core normalized ROE of 9.5% is driven by the lost investment income associated with our adverse development cover. Considering the net impact of the adverse development cover and the fourth quarter reserve strengthening, we would expect to free up approximately $2 billion of capital over time, subject to rating agency and regulatory considerations.","We have not reflected this benefit in our current projections for 2017, as we do not anticipate revising our PC dividend forecast upward at this point in time. We expect to achieve a 10% normalized ROE in the not-too-distant future as we deliver on underwriting improvements, capital return, and expense management.","To sum up, I'm confident that our actions taken put us on a path to better quality earnings, growth in earnings as we move forward. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity position, and a free cash flow profile like no other in our industry leaves us very well-positioned for the future.","Now, with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on slide 19, the fourth quarter marked the culmination of a truly transformational year for Commercial, with the completion of an extraordinary amount of change as part of the strategy we outlined at the beginning of 2016. Today, I'll discuss three topics: the actions we've taken to significantly reduce future volatility, progress of our strategy to improve underwriting performance, and the outlook for Commercial's business modules.","The adverse development cover is a comprehensive transaction that was one of several strategic reinsurance agreements we entered into over the past year. A key part of the agreement is that we retain full claims authority to honor our commitments with consistency of decision-making and service that our clients expect of AIG.","As Sid mentioned, during 2016, we also increased current accident year loss estimates by approximately $700 million in response to the emerging trends reflected in our prior-year reserve strengthenings, bringing total loss picks for the 2016 accident year to a more conservative level that includes a margin of error, reflecting the long-tail nature of the U.S. Casualty business. Looking toward the future, we're confident that the steps we took in 2016 to prioritize value-creation and utilize more rigorous data and pricing tools will significantly enhance the quality of our portfolio.","Turning to slide 20, the top line shows Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio, including the effect of prior-year development for each accident year. The bottom line shows the adjusted accident year loss ratio at the end of 2015 before reflecting the results of the 2016 reserve studies. You can see that our fourth quarter 2016 reserve strengthening positions us at a 2015 starting point that is 6.1 points higher than we reported this time last year.","On that basis, we achieved 4.1 points of improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio in 2016 as a result of the changes in our mix of business and increasing improvements in our underwriting tools. We are targeting a 62% adjusted accident year loss ratio on a fourth quarter 2017 exit run rate basis, representing an 8.8 point improvement over the two-year period.","Today, U.S. Casualty represents just 21% of the Commercial business, down from 40% of the portfolio in 2011. We drove the most significant amount of that change in 2016, reducing U.S. Casualty's net premiums written by 39% compared to the prior year, with a corresponding improvement in U.S. Casualty's adjusted accident year loss ratio of 5.5 points. As a result of our actions, Commercial's full year 2016 adjusted accident year loss ratio for all business, excluding U.S. Casualty, was strong at 60.2%.","As Sid mentioned, we continue to experience significantly higher severity trends in commercial auto, medical malpractice and Excess Casualty in the United States. These businesses are parts of the lines we've been remediating and improving, and we've been shrinking our position in these underperforming areas for several years. While we acknowledge we have more work to do, we've managed the portfolio thoughtfully and with pace over the past year, while balancing the need for improved rate and our objective of preserving our valued client relationships.","Moving to slide 21. We've illustrated the significant improvement in our mix of business, a key driver of the 4.1 point adjusted accident year loss ratio decline. We reduced to remediate and improve business by 34%, while also realizing a significant improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio in those sub-segments. 93% of the fourth quarter commercial reserve strengthening was attributable to products in the Remediate or Improve product lines, making us confident that our underwriters are armed with better tools and taking actions in the right parts of the portfolio.","The attractive Grow and Maintain business increased from 50% of the portfolio in 2015 to 60% of the business at the end of 2016. And we continued to see strong performance in our focused growth segments and multinational business. We are pleased that full year retention of our major clients, which represent our largest multi-line relationships, remained relatively consistent with the prior year at 94%.","The chart at the bottom of the page demonstrates the interconnected nature of our Commercial business. As the vast majority of our large clients purchase multiple products that vary in profitability, we've been carefully resculpting the portfolio to make holistic decisions that prioritize our most valuable client relationships. In 2017, we'll continue to focus on growing these profitable relationships that create intrinsic value for AIG.","Turning to slide 22, Commercial's 2016 normalized ROE of 6% includes the increase in current accident year loss picks. We're targeting a more normalized ROE of 9% in 2017, reflecting lower capital due to the adverse development cover and improved business mix and underwriting results partly offset by lower net investment income.","Commercial's full year adjusted accident year combined ratio of 95.8% was a 5 point improvement over 2015, which includes an increase of 3.9 points in the current accident year loss picks. The expense ratio declined 0.9 points, demonstrating that we continued to manage expenses despite a lower premium base.","Turning to slide 23, notwithstanding the increase in current accident year loss picks, the 2016 normalized ROE for Liability and Financial Lines was 8.8%, reflecting profitability in Financial Lines and the positive contribution net investment income has on long-tail business. The Liabilities and Financial Lines full year adjusted accident year combined ratio of 99.7% increased 0.8 points over 2015, driven by a 5.7 point increase in current accident loss picks, partially offset by a 2.3 point improvement in the expense ratio. The expense ratio benefited from improvements in general operating expenses and higher ceding commissions from reinsurers.","Fourth quarter net premiums written declined 22%, excluding FX, with approximately 9 points driven by reinsurance and the remainder by risk selection. In the U.S. Casualty rates are inadequate, and we've continued to stand firm in the competitive environment. Fourth quarter rates increased over 5.5 points, representing the fifth consecutive quarter, with rate increases in excess of three points.","For the full year, we reduced Liabilities and Financial Lines net premiums written by $3.2 billion as part of our portfolio optimization efforts. The bar charts at the bottom left-hand side of the page clearly reflect our shift from U.S. Casualty toward the more valuable Financial Lines in International Casualty businesses. We continue to view Financial Lines in particular as highly attractive and remain focused on building upon our strength as a market leader. With that said, we've demonstrated a healthy discipline to balance our growth ambitions in certain poorer performing sub-segments of Financial Lines business, where the rates are challenged.","Turning to slide 24, as we noted during our Investor Day in November, we faced profitability challenges in Property and Special Risks. The 2016 normalized ROE of negative 0.2% was the result of four primary drivers we discussed throughout the year: continued price erosion in parts of the property market, poorer-than-expected performance in programs, elevated attritional losses in Europe and the size of our average annual loss expectation for natural catastrophes.","We've taken a number of actions that will lead to ROE improvements in 2017. First, we've been more rigorous in our risk selection beginning in the second quarter of 2016 and extending through the January 1 renewal season, which is particularly important in Europe. We'll continue to shift to highly engineered large limit and middle market risks, while we aggressively reduce exposures in commoditized excess and surplus lines, where we simply don't agree with market behavior.","Second, we've substantially completed our remediation of our Programs business, which we discussed during last quarter's call. Third, we completed the sale of our stake in Ascot, a business that generated approximately $500 million in premiums, but earned a normalized ROE of zero in 2016 on an AIG economic capital basis.","Finally, we've significantly reduced CAT risk. While 2016 was a relatively-active CAT year, our experience was still better than our average annual loss expectation. We've continued to aggressively manage our CAT exposures and expanded our CAT reinsurance program, effective January 1, 2017, to further reduce our average annual loss expectation.","Turning to the top line, fourth quarter net premiums written declined 15% excluding FX, reflecting the improved risk selection and property rate declines of over five points, driven primarily by the U.S. excess and surplus lines business. We have the conviction to continue to opportunistically manage our property book as market conditions warrant.","The final observation I'd like to make is that as you can see on the bottom-right side of the page, we've experienced a more-stabilized level of severe losses, with the severe losses improving from 8.9 points in 2015 to 5.4 points in 2016. We continue to expect reduced loss volatility as a result of our engineering capabilities, risk selection efforts, and reinsurance purchased during the second quarter 2016. While we acknowledge we have work to do, we expect meaningful ROE improvement as a result of our plan in 2017.","In closing, our actions to reduce commercial volatility, increased use of data and tools and improvements in our business mix, will result in a stronger, more valuable portfolio. We're focused on execution, and I'm confident that we'll achieve our goals following a truly transformational 2016.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Consumer produced strong results for the quarter and for the year. For the year, we expanded normalized ROE by 190 basis points to 10.3%. We expect to maintain or exceed this level of normalized ROE in 2017.","During 2016, we took actions in each of our modules and key geographic areas to create value. In addition, I am delighted to report that in Japan, the intensive preparation for our legal entity merger is progressing well. Early this week, we announced adoption of FSA-approved premerger status as of April 1 of this year and our target merger date of January 1, 2018. This is a major milestone in our transformation effort.","Slide 26 summarizes our progress in 2016. In Individual Retirement, we were proactive in taking pricing and product feature actions to navigate the low interest rate environment. We focused on value over volume and were not dependent on any one product line. Due to our broad product portfolio and deep distribution relationships, we achieved top five sales rankings across annuity lines, fixed index and variable, a position we believe is unique in the industry. Individual retirements earnings for the year were strong with PTOI increasing by over 25%.","For our Group Retirement business, VALIC, our investments to transform the plan sponsor and participant experience began to pay off. We significantly improved our results in winning new group plans and in retaining existing plans. Our net flows improved substantially, and we achieved the highest level of premiums and deposits since AIG's acquisition of VALIC.","Our Life Insurance business continued to make progress, executing our plan to enhance ROE. During the year, we completed the introduction of our new state-of-the-art administrative platform and new digital capabilities, revamped our product suite, and substantially exited our U.S. life premier distribution and service agent channels and Group Benefits business.","Despite these exits, we maintained our sales levels by focusing on independent distribution and our direct-to-consumer platform. We achieved a top five ranking in term life sales, the first time we have held this position since 2007 and now lead the industry and term life sales in the direct channel. Our growth and term life sales, strong underwriting discipline, and increased focus on products without long-duration interest rate guarantees created value in the lower interest rate environment.","Additionally, working with Charlie Shamieh and the Legacy team, we closed two large reinsurance transactions during the year to address significant redundant reserves and are on track to meet our targets for the remaining transactions.","Our greatest improvement for the year was in our Personal Insurance business. Our focused strategy, which includes our geographic footprint reduction, has resulted in significant expense savings and improved combined ratio, and an increase in PTOI of over $600 million. As we've reduced our footprint, we've increased our investments in markets and customer segments, where we have a competitive advantage and favorable future prospects. This includes our high net worth business, the Private Client Group in the U.S., where we've had healthy growth in new business for the last few years and have recently expanded our offerings overseas.","We also made investments to deliver a digital experience to our customers in a number of our fastest-growing markets, including Korea, China for outbound travel business, and South Africa, where we have introduced innovative offerings in partnership with the Virgin Group. We believe that the actions we took in 2016 will position our Personal Insurance business for future growth in our select markets and customer segments.","We also continued to make progress transforming our business in Japan, while producing solid operating results for the year. Japan's overall underwriting results were strong, and its normalized ROE for the year, based on our internal capital lens, was 10.8%. We continue to take actions during the year to streamline processes, focus marketing, increase productivity and reduce head count and expenses.","As I mentioned earlier, we secured crucial regulatory approval of a targeted merger date of January 1, 2018. We also announced in November that we had entered into an agreement to sell Fuji Life, allowing us to focus on our strong P&C position. We have taken actions across our balanced portfolio of consumer businesses to create value and position us as industry leaders in our target markets.","Now, I will briefly discuss the results of the quarter. Turning to Individual Retirement on slide 27. In the quarter we saw lower sales and net flows from a year ago. This reflected the ongoing industry-wide slowdown in variable annuity sales from the uncertainty caused by the DOL fiduciary rule and lower fixed annuity sales due to the sustained low interest rate environment. In the face of these challenges, we continued our disciplined approach with respect to product pricing, product features and asset quality. We maintained our base net investment spread for fixed annuities, as well as for variable and indexed annuities.","Turning to group retirement on page 28. Deposits increased in the quarter were offset by higher surrenders that resulted in overall declining net flows. Despite disciplined rate management, base net investment spread for Group Retirement declined primarily due to low reinvestment rates. Further, as we mentioned on the third quarter call, we did expect to see higher planned conversions in the fourth quarter, including large case group surrenders as is standard for the defined contribution market at year-end.","Before moving to our Life Insurance business, I'll speak briefly as to recent developments with respect to the DOL fiduciary rule. On February 3, President Trump issued a memo requiring the DOL to review the rule and determine whether it will adversely impact the ability of retirement savers to access information and financial advice. Accordingly, the DOL announced that it would consider legal options for postponing the applicability date of the rule, while it considers the issues raised in the memo. We are closely following further developments.","For our Individual Retirement business, we remain actively engaged with our distribution partners to ensure that we will continue to meet their needs as they respond to the evolving status of implementation.","Let's now move to Life Insurance on slide 29. Premiums and deposits grew, primarily driven by our international business. In our U.S. business, overall sales remained largely in line with the prior-year period despite our narrow distribution focus. Life insurance PTOI was negatively impacted in the quarter by reserve increases in our individual group and international business lines, totaling approximately $45 million, over half of which was driven by administration system conversions in the U.S.","Turning to slide 30. Personal Insurance reported another strong quarter of operating performance. The operating improvement reflected our strategic actions to reduce expenses and focus marketing activities, as well as continued operating benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets. Results reflect a favorable prior-year loss reserve development and lower-than-expected attritional losses in key markets partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. We believe we have additional opportunities to improve underwriting results, although we do not expect progress to be linear quarter to quarter.","To close, I'm pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic priorities across all of our modules, and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan.","Now, I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up for Q&A.","Elizabeth A. Werner - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you. Operator, we'd like to open it up to Q&A.","And as a brief reminder, we will extend beyond the hour to get to the questions. But please ask one question and one follow-up, and don't hesitate to get back in the queue, so we can handle as many of your questions as possible.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Ryan Tunis with JPMorgan (sic) [Credit Suisse].","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Tunis of Credit Suisse. I had one question, and John Nadel had a follow-up. But I guess just trying to understand why the 60% is untenable in 2017, if 93% of the charges on premium that you already plan to improve or remediate, why is it that we can't just push a little bit harder on that premium in 2017 and get to the 60%, if that was always an important part of getting there? Thanks.","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Hey, Ryan. It's Rob Schimek. So, I'll point a couple of things. First of all, I want to point you to page 20 and just remind you that the 66.7% that you're seeing on that page includes 3.9 points of higher accident year loss ratio that we've booked particularly relating to the long-tail line. So, as I said in my comments and Sid had said in his comments, there is a margin for error that we booked into the long-tail Commercial lines that we had not previously recorded.","The second observation I'd make for you is that, and as shown on slide 21, the nature of our business is a very interconnected nature when we think about it from a perspective of our client. So, I've shown you a table at the bottom of page 21 that shows that 90% of our major account clients are clients that have revenues of over $500 million.","They're long-term clients, 18-year relationships, but that our relationships cross across not just one line of business, but multiple lines of business with varying degrees of profitability. And our main objective is to protect the valued client relationships and make sure that we can think of them holistically, not as an individual product, but instead, as an individual client.","And then, I guess, the third point I'd make for you is don't lose track of the fact that in our improvement that we've committed to, we did not make any expectation for you on expense ratio other than we would be able to maintain it flat. And in 2016, you can see that we did improve the overall Commercial expense ratio by almost 1 point. So, the 66.7% you are seeing is loss ratio only. If you thought about it in the context of combined ratio, it's about a 5-point improvement over the prior year, and it includes about 4 points of higher accident year loss ratio.","If you drilled that down and put it into the U.S. Casualty business, that actually translates to about an 11 point increase in our accident year loss ratio for U.S. Casualty business. And what we're really doing there is recognizing that we don't want to leave you three years from now, seeing us book an increase in prior-year development for the actions we took in 2016.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And this is John Nadel with a follow-up. I guess my question's for Peter. And I'm focused on slide 17. It looks like the impact of the reserve charge is driving nearly 100 basis point increase from the ROE all else equal. And that appears to be simply, because you've taken the equity down.","If I look at the ROE impacts excluding that, you're dropping your ROE target by about 150 basis points. Is that how you and the board and your incentive plans will capture the impact, meaning the growth, 150 basis point reduction in ROE, will be the more prevalent measure? And then, secondly, around that, are the areas within the total portfolio of businesses where you can find incremental earnings to help offset that pressure, whether it be incremental expenses, capital return, or is it just a function of investors need to believe in and discount a lower cost of capital?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","So, I think that the 90 basis points that you see on page 17 is just a mechanical effect of the impact on gas equity. But from a point of view, how we steer the ship and how the board thinks about value creation, we look at the much bigger reduction in required economic capital that comes from the ADC. So, the ADC reduces the reserve uncertainty so much more than the book equity reflects, but there's actually a bigger than 90% improvement in the return on economic equity. But that will take time to come through, because we need to work closely with our regulators before we dividend up from the subsidiaries.","So, there's no doubt in my mind that this transaction and the net of the ADC and the reserve charge is accretive to value, but I think that the timing of how it comes through GAAP ROE is another matter. It takes a little bit longer. So, we've obviously got a component of it that reflects the reduced investment income. That's another piece that needs to be understood. But I think that taken as a whole, between the two actions of the prior development and the ADC, it's significantly accretive to value.","And I think if you work your way through the capital framework that we use, in the new module of disclosures you'll see with much greater transparency how we manage the difference between economic capital and statutory capital, the so-called difference in the frictional capital. You can see how this will work its way through, especially as you try and forecast ROE in 2018, by which many of these timing mismatches will sort of come out in the wash.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kai Pan.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. First question on the reserve charge. I just wonder how much the increase of accident year loss, which you'll take is coming from this so-called emerging trend in third quarter and fourth quarter versus \u2013 so you're adding another layers for margin of safety, because you mentioned the trend actually impacting overall U.S. cash in the market, but we haven't seen large reserve charges at the industry level. Just wondering, if this is AIG-specific issue or is it more industry concern?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Well, Kai, it's Sid. I'll open, and then I'll hand it over to Rob. First of all, I would say, we don't explicitly break it out that way. And it differs dramatically by line of business when you look at U.S. Casualty. I will say, the general effect of our reserve strengthening is to, as I said in my remarks, more heavily weight the trend towards recent accident years. And in lines like commercial auto, where you're seeing dramatically higher trend for the industry, we would be strengthening both reserves and loss picks to reflect that new data.","Rob, maybe you want to comment a little bit about how you think about the overall portfolio and loss picks, in general?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Kai, let me suggest to you this way of thinking about it. I want to make sure I get this point across for everyone anyway. Success for the management of our Commercial portfolio begins with getting the proper segment selection. We've got to get the right mix of business here, and the mix of business is going to drive our view of overall profitability for the Commercial portfolio.","We've identified the U.S. Excess and Surplus Lines Property business, as well as the U.S. Casualty business as the segments of our portfolio that are the most challenged. And we were absolutely correct in that assessment. 86% of our fourth quarter reserve charge was attributable back to US Casualty. Today, U.S. Casualty is 21% of the Commercial portfolio, and we feel confident about the remaining 79% of the portfolio which is running at an adjusted accident year loss ratio of 60.2%.","So, to give you a better sense of sort of the situation we face is I want to take you back to 2004, where effectively we were a Commercial Casualty portfolio that wrote some other business. And what I mean by that is we wrote $15 billion of U.S. Casualty business, representing 58% of our total portfolio. In 2016, we wrote $3.3 billion of net written premiums, representing just 21% of our Commercial portfolio. And by the way, in 2017, we anticipate writing about $2.5 billion of net written premium in Commercial Casualty.","So I think we've accomplished four really important things. I'll bring us back to that margin question here in a moment, but four important things in 2016. First, we reduced the U.S. Casualty book by 39% in a single year compared to our annual decline of about 8% per year from 2004 through 2015.","Second, we achieved more rate in U.S. Casualty than any other part of the portfolio, about 5.5% in the fourth quarter as I said my prepared remarks. And third, in January, we began working with Swiss Re, as part of the reinsurance agreement that we announced, who not only share in the risks but work with us as a partner to bring data, tools, and additional expertise to design kind of a long-term path for sustainable progress in U.S. Casualty. So we're absolutely committed to serving our valued clients with a U.S. Casualty solution, but it's got to create value for them and for us at the same time.","Finally, I'd say, and very importantly, the increase in loss picks for the remaining book that we've talked about here. Our U.S. Casualty is about 11 points \u2013 and it's about 11 points on the U.S. Casualty portfolio, so we describe it as 3.9 points across our overall portfolio. So walking into the year, we were booking U.S. Casualty at a level that was about 11 points less. Now some of that increase is, really, just responding to what it is we learned in our reserve studies that we conducted that increased the 2015 \u2013 2014 loss picks.","Another piece of what we've recorded recognizes the fact that we just don't want to repeat having prior year development come out of 2016, when we look back at this year, several years into the future. So I don't have a precise breakout for you of how to think about the additional $700 million in terms of how much of it is margin for error, but I will tell you we've captured everything we've learned for 2015 and prior, and established what we think is a prudent margin for error given the long tail nature of the U.S. Casualty risks.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for that. My follow-up question on the capital management front. You reaffirmed your $25 billion capital management goal. In the \u2013 if you remember in your Investor Day in November, you pointed to you have sort of potentially $2 billion to $7 billion additional funding sources that's above this capital management goal. So I just wonder given these reserve charge and some rating agency or regulatory considerations, is the $25 billion a more of a floor or a ceiling now?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I'll give you an initial answer and then I'll hand it over to Sid. The adverse development cover, as I said earlier, dramatically reduces the amount of economic capital at risk. The timing of regulatory capital relief is not immediate, and so while we continue to reaffirm our confidence around the $25 billion, we want to work very closely with both regulators and rating agencies on any further capital actions and make sure that we have a demonstrable track record of repeatable earnings before we would consider adding to that in 2018. So I think that we still feel very confident about the free cash flow of the company and the ability to free up capital through divestitures on the legacy side as well as improved operating earnings.","But the most important thing to remember is the net of the adverse development cover and the prior development is accretive to capital, both on an economic capital basis today and what we think ultimately will be true of statutory capital come 2018. So I think that we feel very good about the long-term capital position of the company.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","And, Kai, I'd just add what gives us confidence in our 2017 projections as we highlighted at Investor Day and you heard in many of my remarks today. When you sum up the accomplishments we've had in terms of non-core and legacy asset sales, life reinsurance transactions, our asset allocation shift, and then, of course, operating subsidiary dividends and tax-sharing payments, the aggregate of those have us squarely on track with regards to funding our capital return.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. The biggest topic on the mind of investors that I've received is what will A.M. Best's reaction be to the 4Q set of announcements. The A.M. Best's rating for AIG is currently on \u2013 at A with a negative outlook. What's your sense on timing in terms of when we'll hear from A.M. Best in terms of whether they affirm at A or downgrade to A minus?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I will take that. I've tried to be very clear for several years that our concern about claims-paying ability is paramount to the trust that our clients have in us and that the rating agencies, including A.M. Best, are important arbiters of that. We have revealed to you and them a lot of new information in the space over the last few days. And so we expect it to take some time to digest this and see the balancing ins and outs in terms of radical reduction in reserve risk while amendment to current profitability levels to see how that nets out in terms of impact on rating.","But we've made it very clear to all the rating agencies that with the extremely strong holding company liquidity position, we put the financial strength of the subsidiaries at the top of the hierarchy of goals in the immediate term to maintain utter confidence in our claims paying ability. So I'm very hopeful that we'll achieve a good outcome with all the rating agencies, including A.M. Best. But they should probably comment on timing as opposed to us.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I appreciate that. My follow-up question is regarding Street estimates for 2017, 2018. Street's at $5.34 for 2017 and $6.45 for 2018. I appreciate your perspective on core ROE, but my own perspective is that Street estimates are just way too high for the next two years. Do you have any perspective on that? I mean, can we help level set this a little?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I don't want to comment on Street estimates. They are often based on different methodologies. What I do think is that we've given the Street a lot more granularity of modular information to do a bottom-up analysis of earnings quality and review those estimates in the light of all the new information we've disclosed. So I think probably best to defer that after the Street had a chance to digest the significant additional information that they've received.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Good morning. Thanks. I had a question about the $10.2 billion consideration to National Indemnity. How is that funded and what is the timing for funding that consideration to National Indemnity?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I'm not sure that we'd want to comment on that, but it's funded by divestitures of general account assets. We have a very liquid general account asset base, and it's just part of our normal course of asset liability management; this is something which is accomplished. But I think that the important thing from point of view of \u2013 toward earnings estimates is that we have given you, I think, a clear indication of how much forgone net investment income will occur in 2017 as a result of the sale of those assets and transfer of those funds.","So, Sid, if you want to comment on that, that's fine.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. The only other thing I'd add is we expect to finish that financing very shortly. So that's all I'd add, Peter.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So the assets go and the investment income goes with it. And then the \u2013 I guess the follow-up I have just on this topic is on page six, description of the arrangement with NICO. The $12.8 billion ceded, is that actually ceded now or is that kind of continually ceded when losses come through?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Now \u2013 Sorry, Randy. Do you want to clarify your question there just to make sure we understand?","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So the $12.8 of ceded nominal reserves. I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding this correct, that you're your ceding those assets and liabilities now and that's where we should think about the consideration \u2013 part of the consideration coming from.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'll just point you back to my prepared remarks, Randy. Remember, I noted that we have $41 billion of nominal reserves at year end, so that's where you get the ceded amount. You take the $41 billion, you subtract the $25 billion which is $16 billion, and then you apply the 80% to get the ceded reserve number. Obviously, as you know from our filing of the contract, that obviously ultimately gets paid out via Berkshire Hathaway on a paid basis. So \u2013 but, yes, they are ceded immediately.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. I'm wondering if you can help walk us through the line items that changed the disclosure. At the end of last year you said that you closed out 2015 with a 66.2% loss ratio accident year, and that's been revised down to 64.7%. I'm wondering, on an apples to apples basis, what the 2016 numbers are? And can you define the difference between the exit run rate loss ratio you're closing out 2016 with versus the reported number?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","Rob, why don't you go through that?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Yes. So, Josh, let me begin. Just following on page 20, think about the green line; that's what you're asking me about, and we're going to focus on the line that says 2015, 64.7%. When you saw that line item in 2015, it was 66.2%. The primary adjustments that have been made to that line item are, first, as you know we sold UGC; we had a reinsurance agreement that now works with UGC, and that benefits the Commercial business moving forward.","But in order to not make me look good on a year-over-year basis, we pushed that back to all periods, so that you'll see \u2013 so we've actually adjusted down what was the 2015 loss ratio reflecting the benefit of UGC into 2015. We've shown that on page 20, in footnote number two, and you can actually see that the benefit is 0.4 points in 2016 \u2013 in 2015. It was actually, and just for comparison purposes, it's 0.8 points in 2016. So apples to apples basis, we get a 0.8 point benefit in 2016, and we didn't want 0.8 point benefit to compare against the old 66.2%, so we brought the old 66.2% down by 0.4 points which is what the effect would've been in the prior year.","The second big item is that, as you know, we exited some businesses in 2016. I announced those exits in February that included primarily our buffer trucking business and our pollution legal liability business in the United States and Canada. Those businesses were exited in 2016 and they've nailed and transferred over to Legacy. Many people worry that I would actually flatter my current loss ratio by simply moving things over to Legacy. In the spirit of very transparent presentation here to you, we've actually also restated 2015 to remove the losses that were in 2015 associated with those same lines that have been exited. So, actually, I get no benefit in the comparison year-over-year 2016 versus 2015 for the fact that I exited businesses that have now been transferred over to Legacy into Charlie Shamieh's team.","So overall, the 66.4% pulls out the losses associated with businesses that I exited in 2016 that we didn't want to leave in 2015 so that I would look flatter. And then the second thing it pulls out is the benefit of UGC which should be shown on an apples to apples basis. I think those two things actually show you that overall, we're trying to make sure that I don't flatter myself at all in the year-over-year comparison because net-net, even though the exits should have benefited me in 2016 in the comparison, we basically pulled it out of both periods. Does that make sense?","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Year-over-year, does that mean it benefits you on an absolute number but not on a year-over-year comparison?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Exactly, Josh. So we did the right thing, and we don't worry about trying to look good on a year-over-year basis by flattering ourselves by leaving the old loss ratio high and bringing the current loss ratio down. Sid can comment further.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, Josh. I think in page 33 of the financial supplement, we've actually split out, specifically, the UGC impact, so that there's very clear transparency.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I did see that. Thank you. And then on the difference between an exit run rate and an accident year closeout number. Are we going to close out 2017 at a 65% but, say, the exit run rate is a 62%? And I guess the answer would be, well, what are we in 2016, the difference between the exit run rate and the closeout number?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, Josh, what I'm saying to you there is that the fourth quarter we believe will be at 62%. Obviously, for the full year 2016 we were at a 66%, 67%, so you can imagine that I'm not going to be able to bring Q1 down to the 62%. And in order to have it full year of 62%, it's going to be the average of the four quarters. So we're just recognizing that the fourth quarter we expect to be at 62%, and that we expect that move to 62% to occur throughout the course of 2017.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Thomas Gallagher with Evercore ISI.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning. Rob, just following-up on that conversation. So if the exit run rate on the Commercial loss ratio is really around 67% and the goal is to get to 62%, that's five points of improvement from an exit rate standpoint. I think, from what you were guiding previously, the 2016 to 2017 delta was more like two points. How are you going to get that extra three points? Can you reconcile that?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, Tom, the first thing I want to point people to is that when I committed we would deliver in 2016 in general, there were a lot of doubters about it. They said actually you won't be able to deliver 4 points, you're starting flat-footed. We delivered 4.1 points of improvement in the loss ratio and, for good measure, another nine-tenths of a point in the expense ratio for five points of underwriting improvement. Coming into 2017, we've got a lot of momentum. So the Swiss Reinsurance deal is already in place; that will benefit 2017. We made a lot of changes from an underwriting perspective in 2016 which have not yet been recognized as earned premium until 2017.","In one of the research reports that I read from last night, there was a good comment about that. If you look at our reduction in net written premium, you can actually see that we significantly reduced our net written premium in the remediate and in the improved parts of our portfolio, but that doesn't yet reflect in earned premium until largely 2017. So I've got a lot of momentum moving from 2016 into 2017 from those two items and the remainder of the actions that we've got planned for the year, we feel confident we'll deliver the 62% loss ratio. I think overall, what people would've doubted we could've achieved with a 6 point improvement in the loss ratio between 2015 and 2017, I'd say I want you to have confidence; we've already delivered 4 points of it, and we believe we're geared up to deliver well over 4 points of it again in 2017 from the actions we've already taken.","So I think we'll over deliver on a relative basis, apples to apples basis.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then if I could shift to capital return, the caveat of subject to future profit improvement in terms of getting to your $25 billion two-year plan. Can you comment on \u2013 can you provide some perspective on what this means? Are we talking about no significant adverse development in P&C? Would that constitute as future profit improvement? Or are we talking about you actually need to show accident year loss ratio improvement in P&C to be able to achieve your capital return plan? Anyway, that's my question there.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I think it's fair to say that if you look at the underwriting actions that Rob's team has executed in 2016, it's a radical reshaping of the mix of business that makes projections more challenging, and I'm quite empathetic to all of you but also to the rating agencies as they try and project our 2017, 2018, 2019 earnings. But I am confident that once they analyze the additional disclosures we've met \u2013 if we meet the expectations that we have just laid out then that will more than satisfy all stakeholders that we have a very solid earnings base, very solid liquidity position, very solid capital ratios both at a subsidiary level and at a holding company level that more than supports the current rating.","But we don't want to jump the gun on that, and we think it's really important to pace ourselves and bring all stakeholders along on that journey of underlying \u2013 understanding the underlying earnings power of this company as we've reshaped the earnings mix.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I just have a follow-up question kind of on getting to that 62% target in 2017. As we think about a higher kind of inflation level, just overall for the industry, can you just kind of express confidence that the picks that you're now using for 2017 kind of play out that scenario, and that if inflation levels do increase that you can get to this 62% level by the end of the year?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Elyse, I will just say, again, that if you think about the 4 points of increased loss picks we recorded in 2016 \u2013 I'm referring to the 3.9 points of increase \u2013 if you take that to the lines that are likely to have the inflation you're referring to, it will be the long tail U.S. Casualty risks in particular. Those lines, actually, we've increased the loss pick. If you sort of drill down through modularity, it's 3.9 points to total Commercial, it's 5.7 points to Liabilities and Financial lines, but it's 11 points if you drill all the way down to U.S Casualty. So the U.S. Casualty increase in loss picks of 11 points higher is intending to reflect the lessons learned from 2015 and prior, the reserve studies, and any of the expectations we would have regarding inflation. And that's really the message that we're trying to deliver.","To the point that I was just talking about achieving the improvement between 2016 and 2017, I pointed out two really important items: you've got the Swiss Re deal that's already in place, and you've got the underwriting improvements that we already took last year. But I'll just make one last observation: because we so significantly increased the loss picks in U.S. Casualty, to the extent that in our mix of business we further reduce our concentration in U.S. Casualty, the benefit that we get between 2016 loss reserves or 2016 loss pick and 2017, because of a lower level of concentration of these very high loss pick businesses, we benefit even more significantly.","Those are the three primary drivers that get you from the 66.7% to the 62% that you see on page 20 of our presentation.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. And then in terms of the capital return plan. The contract with Berkshire was retroactive, so you guys did \u2013 you guys are transferring over some reserves that were already sitting on your balance sheet in excess of $7 billion. How do you think about the amount of capital freed up there and how does that \u2013 it seems like today you've reaffirmed the $25 billion plan, but could something like that potentially be additive to the $25 billion?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. Elyse, it's Sid here. I'll point you to my earlier remarks. We've estimated that we've improved our overall capital position by approximately $2 billion when you combine the ADC netting with our reserve strengthening this quarter, but we anticipate that capital will be deployed over time as I said. So, again, it just reaffirms that we have strong confidence in our capital liquidity positions, as Peter mentioned, as we execute on our target.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you. Focusing in on the Commercial business. It looks like, and I'm looking at page 20 like most people are, that something happened from a business perspective in probably around 2013 that got you off on your projections as well as with your business. Could you talk about sort of what was happening there from a business perspective and how that's different today? Who was in charge back then? That kind of thing.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","So there's been a fair amount of change, frankly, in terms of who was in charge of the businesses that have reflected this and, as you can imagine, given the long-standing client relationships and long-standing presence in lines of business that were affected, you have a lot of inertia. So I think that, as Rob mentioned earlier on, we had a $15 billion Casualty book which was at the beginning of the period, and then that's now down prospectively in 2017 to about $2.5 billion. So that reduction didn't happen overnight.","And so during this period of time, we were shrinking a book of business which, frankly, looks a lot better with high interest rates where you can live with a higher combined ratio if you've got decent net investment income. And in that 2013 period, if you remember, you've got two things: continued quantitative easing and, therefore, very low interest rates, making that a much less attractive business; and a recovery in the economy, so you start to have a lot more miles driven and a lot more economic activity and, therefore, an uptick in frequency and severity of losses.","So you've got a sort of cyclical element hurting you on the loss cost trends, and a continued challenge on the net investment income. So I think there's an inflection point there which confirmed our initial instincts that the reduction in the Casualty lines was the right strategy, but the sense of urgency around that picked up as the continued low interest rate environment persisted in the subsequent years and as the loss cost trends accelerated even more with higher jury awards and so on in the most recent accident year. So I think that we've made a lot of change in terms of individuals and process, but we've also tried to learn what is external to AIG that we need to adapt to, lower interest rates and higher cost trends, and what is internal in terms of lessons learned in terms of improved linkage between claims, underwriting, and actuarial and getting the right alignment of those functions.","And so we believe that the team that we have today is the right one to continue to reshape the mix of business around our most profitable clients. And I think that's probably the most important change in mindset, is to really start to analyze client profitability not just business line profitability, and that is something we have much better tools, better governance, and better understanding of today.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","So I just want to make sure I understand the answer properly. It sounds like what you're saying is that you correctly identified the claims inflation, inflection, and other issues at that time but simply did not shrink the book fast enough to \u2013 as you would've liked in hindsight. Is that right?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I think that in hindsight it's something which I'd say you need more time to look back on this the right way. What we've done is retained over 92% of our best clients. If we had tried to shrink it faster, that number might've been a whole lot lower and that might've cost us a lot more in terms of profitable Financial lines and other lines of business. So we were shrinking the Commercial business at an annualized rate of about \u2013 I mean, the Casualty business at about an 11% annualized rate, and then we accelerated that to over 30% in the last 12 months.","I don't think if we'd done it that aggressively back then we would've done it as elegantly, and I do think that we've got much better tools, much better governance around managing those client relationships. And of course, if you remember back then, the recent history of AIG's challenges in the financial crisis were still fresh in people's minds, so I think abrupt changes in our underwriting appetite would've had more disruption then than it does today.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. So first, just a comment, you did change disclosure, and I think it makes it very difficult to compare results. So I hope, especially when you're not really boasting the updated results in advance, so if you are changing disclosure in the future, I think you should actually at least provide the historical numbers a few days or a week or two weeks in advance, and it obviously would reduce confusion a lot.","In terms of my question, I'm just trying to understand your comments on the Berkshire Hathaway contract which seemed pretty positive on it reducing your cost of equity. Obviously, it does reduce volatility in GAAP results but that's only because you're paying $10 billion upfront for about $20 billion of coverage, and you're doing it several years in advance of any contribution from Berkshire Hathaway, so \u2013 also you're still on the hook for the deal.","So if you can quantify how much the deal is releasing in terms of \u2013 or if it is releasing any GAAP or stat capital \u2013 whether you'll see any impact from this on your tax asset? And also what the duration is of the claims payment period on this book?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","So I think that the most important thing to see is that as of today's reserve number, you've got about $9 billion of additional risk capacity that is for Berkshire's account, which has an economic risk reduction to us, that will make sure that any subsequent adverse development is shared 80-20 between us and them, so there's substantial risk transfer to them. That is quite beyond any kind of accounting impact; in fact, if anything, the accounting is quite adverse compared to the economics because of the deferred nature of the recognizing of the gain on the ADC versus the immediate recognition of any subsequent PYD on the book.","So I think that this is anything but an accounting-driven exercise. This, as we always do, prioritizes improvement in intrinsic value and reduction in economic risk. And you've rightly point out that there is, of course, a tail risk as there is in all of our businesses, and I think that we need to evaluate that carefully, and we have the benefit of our own judgment as well as those of third parties to estimate the full range of outcomes for future claims. But I think that we feel that this is a very substantial reduction in the reserve risk which should give people more confidence around the book value of the firm and the earnings trajectory.","But I don't know. Sid, do you want to elaborate on the...","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. First of all, we're sympathetic, that this is obviously a complex transaction, and Liz and the team will be available to walk you guys through this in more detail. But on an economic basis, the way you need to think about this is think of us, Jimmy, as transferring the assets. We receive a reinsurance recoverable that has a very sizable present value, we release capital up until the limit, and that are the economics of the transaction.","Separate from that, of course, when I talk about netting this and freeing up capital, you have the prior year development and you have the tax affect of that prior year development, of course. So those are the ins and outs of both the reserve and the economics of the transaction. So don't think of the $10 billion without thinking of the reinsurance recoverable, and on a nominal basis, that $10 billion is granted and there's ceded nominal reserves of $12.8 billion plus the capital freedom. That's how you need to...","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No. I understand, and I actually think that the transaction is relatively simple in terms of how it works. I'm just trying to see if you can quantify some of these numbers. But what's the claim duration of the book? Do you have a sense? Or what's your best estimate of that?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. We're not going to provide an overall duration in terms of the detailed cash flows, but my rough approximation I would give you is about 10 years. And so you have some cash flows that are going to be several years out and then some that are going to be way out in the tail, of course. So that's how we think about it when we do the PV; but rough math, I would use 10 years.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning. I had a question on reserves. At the Investor Day, Peter, you expressed some animosity toward the idea of a reserve cookie jar, and now we're talking about a margin of error. And I would just observe that one actuary's margin of error is another actuary's cookie jar, am I to understand that adding this margin of error is a change in your reserve philosophy?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I would say that when you have an ADC of the scale and scope that we have which we did not have on Investor Day, we have downsized the strategic significance of reserve risk by 80%, and so the subjectivity that is inevitable in any kind of reserve estimation, that would lead you to sort of judge where you are on that spectrum of conservatism, just has a dramatically lower effect both on historical reserves. And then given the dramatic reduction in new business written that Rob has explained, over 30% year-on-year, it just is not a big issue going forward. And so I'd rather just leave it at that.","I don't know whether, Sid, you'd like to elaborate.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. First comment I'd make, Gary, is we've obviously commented before on some of that terminology, and we have the highest standards around our financial reporting process and our reserving process, so I'd leave that for you. Number one.","Secondly, the way that I would describe \u2013 ask you to think about this in totality is first, we understand some of the frustrations people have had around historical reserve strengthening; and secondly, we have not been happy with our historical reserve risk outcomes either. And the way to think about this is the combination of the adverse development cover, our reserve strengthening, the adjustment to our loss picks, and the dramatic shift in the underwriting that Rob referred to in terms of business mix, the total of that does more than change the reserve risk profile and eliminate that historical trend than anything from a risk perspective could, and that was how we thought about this when we think about reserve risk.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Just one other thing on the timing of the recognition of these adverse trends in the third and fourth quarter. Are we also to think that you did not see anything along those lines in, say, late 2015 or early 2016?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","So I would point out that we have \u2013 while we have been considering an adverse development cover for some time and we initiated our exploration of this at the beginning of the year, it was only once we concluded our reserve studies after Christmas that it became clear to us that this was a transaction that made excellent economic sense. So we do have a back-ended reserving process, and so it was really after Christmas that it became very clear that that was the right thing to do. And I think we made a lot of changes that I think positively improved our ability to identify trends in the re-segmentation of our reserving. We went to a smaller number of more coherent modular reserving segments that gave us a higher signal-to-noise ratio that gave us more confidence in our decisions.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. Gary, it's Sid. I'd only add a couple of points. First, in the areas where we did see adverse actual versus expected trends as we talked about it at Investor Day, which was particularly programs, we think we acted rapidly and transparently and you saw us, obviously, strengthen reserves and programs when we saw those actual versus expected trends.","For some of the lines that we discussed, we obviously saw trends accelerate into the fourth quarter, and some of those on very green lines. So like I said, in particular, Excess Casualty in 2015 is a green line, and you need a full year of seasoning. We are comfortable with the amount of work we did, as Peter alluded to, in the segmentation of our analysis, the granularity and the effort we put in, particularly given the work we initiated around in ADC in the second quarter and continuing through the year, that we've done a more thorough analysis of the reserve portfolio at this point in time. And we are very comfortable with where we are.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks, and good morning. Just, I guess, two quick follow-ups to prior questions. Number one, going back to the ratings agency discussion, and I'm still not clear. All else being equal, would a change by A.M. Best alter your plans to return to $25 billion or will it not?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I think that, first and foremost, I'd say that we have every hope and expectation there will not be a change and we will do everything we can to prevent a change. We see that as a critical element to our strategy.","Secondly, they would make their change based on, I'm sure, a multitude of criteria that would maybe include capital planning but also the geography of that capital. Where is it? It's between the holding company and the operating subsidiaries. And it's the rating of the operating subsidiaries that we care about most because that's what affects our claims paying ability to our clients, and that's the stakeholder base that we care about most. So I think that we would look at all actions, including amendments to the capital, to make sure that that rating is defended, but we have a lot of capital flexibility, as we've pointed out, that would allow us to continue to serve all of our stakeholders in a way that's balanced and sustainable.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. The second and final question is, Peter, this goes back probably to 2015 when there was a lot of discussion around too big to succeed, etcetera and at that time we had a \u2013 SIFI lends to this discussion. It's 2017, if you think about the tone and the content of conference calls, we rarely talk about the Consumer Insurance business, if at all. I was wondering how does the Board of Directors and you feel about revisiting the separation of business entity discussion, keeping the SIFI discussion apart. It seems we talk about the same issues in every call, and many other pieces of the business are not getting their sort of fair share of discussion or airtime. So how do you feel about revisiting the discussion to separate P&C from other pieces? Thanks.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I think that we've been very clear that there are strong tax reasons but also very strong diversification reasons why the current mix of business makes all the sense in the world. And this quarter, above all quarters, would remind people of the value and diversification as we look back at 2016's excellent results from the Consumer business, and the fact that the Personal insurance has had a major swing to profitability. So I think that my hope is that our dialogue with you becomes much more balanced as we reduce the uncertainties, and in particular around reserving that has plagued the discussion and allows the sort of skew to be so heavily focused around the U.S. Casualty business and to be a more balanced discussion about what I think is a mix of business across Consumer and Commercial that is focused on most profitable segments, geographies, and client segments that create sustainable earnings.","So I think that we are in a process of reshaping this company. We have done a lot to make it less complex, and so in direction we are all in favor of resculpting this company and making it smaller or more focused. We did not think a three-way split to avoid SIFI regulation was the optimal way to unlock value for shareholders. So I think we feel very strongly that that was the right decision, but we continue to resculpt this company to be more focused, easier to manage, and easier to explain. And I do think this ADC cover is a pivotal moment in taking one of the biggest question marks around the evaluation and the risk profile of the company off the table, so we can focus on the operating earnings engine of the core portfolio and how that's emerging as a leading franchise.","Operator","We'll take our next and final question from Larry Greenberg with Janney.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you. Peter, I think in the past you've given an ROE target for the operating segments and then a total company. And I know here you've given a 9.5% for the core operating. Maybe I missed it, but is there an ROE target? I know you gave what your freed up capital expectation is from Legacy. But is there an ROE target for Legacy?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","No. The target for Legacy is all around the release of capital. So they're trying to release capital and shrink as effectively as possible with a view to how much they impair book value and enhance intrinsic value. So their gating factor is the speed of which they can release capital at a price that is accretive to intrinsic, and I'm delighted to point out how much they've done this last year to do that and most recently in the last quarter. Life settlements was a major illiquid asset in the Legacy book which was sold at a level that was accretive to intrinsic value in our view, and they will continue to do that.","But I think that holding them accountable to ROE is the wrong metric because it really doesn't get what's really going on here which is shrinking that so that we can redeploy that capital in our core businesses to grow them and return any excess to shareholders. So that's the way we measure it. And if you think about the hierarchy of goals as I talked about at Investor Day, it helps you sort of map it into that to see how it all drives growth of intrinsic.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thanks. And then just a follow-up for Rob, and I'm looking at page 21. The first category, the grow category, saw a 10-point deterioration in the accident year loss ratio. And I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on that degree of deterioration.","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","So, Larry, the first thing is that while we present this in a way to try to keep it simple, I want you to really understand that Peter marches this team to the tune of intrinsic value. So we are here trying to look even beyond the loss ratio and even beyond the expense ratio, but we're looking at risk-adjusted profitability in the context of the way we really run the day-to-day decisions inside of the Commercial business. So while this is a simplistic presentation of what happens to loss ratio, I'd say within the attractive parts of the business, what I want you to know is that we're making trade-offs every day, recognizing that while the loss ratio might look attractive, the ROE or the intrinsic value might not.","So a classic example of that would be one of the primary drivers behind why our grow part of this portfolio on slide 21 declined in size; it's largely attributable to Property business. And while the loss ratio without natural catastrophes, so the adjusted accident year loss ratio for a property may look attractive, when we add on the acquisition costs and we add on the average annual loss expectation and then we think about the capital consumption, so I have to do all of the rest of this math behind the scenes, but we believe that we're making trade-offs that are even more sophisticated than what you see here on the simple view on page 21.","And so I absolutely believe that we've made the right decisions in every element of these product sets that are shown on this page and, to the extent that we shrunk or that the accident year loss ratio deteriorated, recognized that tends to be sort of attributable to shifts in business and generally with things where we're making behind the scenes decisions on intrinsic value.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Peter Hancock, at this time I will return the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","Well, I would like to thank everybody for their patience and good questions. We've had a lot of information to digest, and we take the feedback that we wish we have gotten this to you earlier to digest quicker. But I think that I'd like to end this with a comment about the team, the management team.","If you look back at the last 12 months, I think you'll see that this team has been extremely active in reshaping this company and making it a more focused and more sustainable source of earnings as well as serving our clients better, and I couldn't be prouder of how the team has worked together under a great deal of pressure to deliver these results. And so I have a great deal of confidence in their ability to deliver the 2017 prospective results that we've discussed today as well.","And I think that the additional disclosure that we have given you gives you a better sense of the multi-dimensional nature of their roles as they optimize our mix of business of both geographic, by product, by customer segment, and I think that as I speak to our shareholders that may be listening, I think that the leadership team that we have assembled is really very, very well-suited to completing this task. So I want to give them a shout out for the accomplishments they've made.","So thank you very much for your attention today, and I look forward to following-up with you individually in the weeks to come.","Operator","And this concludes today's call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Liz Werner","Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to introduce our speakers this morning. With us are Peter Hancock, our CEO; David Herzog, CFO; John Doyle, Head of Commercial; and Kevin Hogan, Head of Consumer. We also have other members of the management available to participate in our Q&A session.","Before we start our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. Actual performance and events may differ, possibly materially from such forward-looking statements.

The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are included in our financial supplement, which is available on our website, www.aig.com.","With that, I'd like to turn our call over to our CEO, Peter Hancock.","Peter Hancock","Good morning. Thank you, Liz, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Before we begin our discussion of the quarter, I'd like to say that I look forward to leading AIG and I'm confident in our team, the strength of our industry-leading balance sheet and the opportunities for our global businesses.","AIG is well positioned to meet the needs of its broad customer base across the markets we pursue and we'll continue our focus on balancing growth, profitability and risk to deliver exceptional returns to shareholders. I'm pleased with the quarter's operating results and the continued execution of our capital management objectives. Through the first nine months of the year, value per share growth has exceeded 15%, a trend we expect to continue.","This morning, my remarks will touch on three topics. The first is our new management structure and operating committee. The second is my immediate priorities, and I'll conclude with a brief update on Fed oversight.","First on management structure. Last quarter, I stated that you should not see abrupt changes in our strategies and objectives, and that's still the case. The recently announced new operating committee creates a structure that facilitates further collaboration and reinforces the value of One AIG. This committee reports directly to me and represents the team that will be leading our strategic initiatives across products and geographies.","AIG is a company where 20 different businesses account for 80% of our revenue. It's critical that we take an integrated approach to managing our operations in order to best serve our customers and pursue new growth opportunities. We're looking to improve operating efficiency and decision-making by eliminating layers in the organization. As an example, we're not filling my former position and we're incorporating the Life and Retirement businesses into our global operating framework.","I'm grateful for the strong team that Jay developed over his many years at AIG and I'm committed to the future growth of our Life and Retirement businesses. Jay's responsibilities will be largely assumed by Kevin Hogan, who as Head of Consumer, is focused on our global life opportunities and as you know has decades of experience in the life, personal lines and accident and health markets.","John Doyle continues to oversee our Commercial businesses and has assumed responsibility for UGC and our institutional markets business. The diverse experience that Kevin and John bring to their respective roles allows them to be spam breakers and encourage collaboration across all our disciplines on a global basis. Our three regional leaders are locally focused and have accountability for executing our strategies in conjunction with our local teams. Their local reach is designed to improve speed and effectiveness.","You'll see that technology and science are represented on the operating committee, which speaks to our commitment to their respective roles within AIG. Science continues to partner with all our functions to capitalize on data analytics, and other scientific breakthroughs. Our investments in technology are central to providing the solutions our customers demand with the greatest of efficiency and adaptability.","Now turning to my immediate priorities of culture, technology and value-based metrics. Starting with culture, to begin, I believe that a culture of collaboration is necessary to realize the true value of all that AIG has to offer. A few companies have the scope of businesses, customers and sheer data available to AIG. We believe our customer relationships are important and mutually beneficial. By working across the organization, we've tapped into opportunities that we may have overlooked under more siloed approach to running our businesses. The new management structure was another step to encourage collaboration and we believe a cultural collaboration will drive future opportunities.","Turning to technology, you've heard me discuss science and technology to drive problem-solving and to reduce claims costs. Science is already paying dividends to us and is working across our businesses to provide critical insight and further data segmentation. Our OneClaim technology provides more enriched and consistent data to science, actuarial and others to drive better decision making.","We've taken another step forward by elevating the role of technology with the announced hiring of Phil Fasano, our new Chief Information Officer, who also reports directly to me. Under Phil's leadership, we expect to achieve our vision of providing a truly seamless technology experience to our customers, distribution partners and employees. Phil's most recent experience is at Kaiser Permanente, and he brings an extensive track record of improving systems and data management while creating innovative solutions.","Turning now value-based metrics, I've talked about value over volume approach in our P&C companies and going forward you can expect a broader implementation of value-based metrics at AIG. The success of AIG PC has translated to improved results and effective capital allocation. A framework of assessing the economic value of all our products won't result in dramatic changes to our business mix, but it is an important discipline for us to continually access the highest return on our capital, taking into account risk and sustainable growth.","Now finally, Fed regulation. I'd like to speak about the ongoing importance of Fed regulation for AIG and how to consider the impact at this stage. We continue to work closely with the Fed and maintain a positive dialogue with the goal of providing the insights and information that are essential to operating as a well-regulated financial institution. It's too early to discuss [ph] SECAR requirements for a non-bank SIFI, and there are unique aspects of the insurance companies that are noteworthy.","As an example, in comparison to banks, insurance companies have significantly lower leverage and greater liquidity. Diversification of risk is the essence of insurance's existence, while banks' risk profiles tend to be highly correlated to the economic cycle. Furthermore, primary insurers are far less interconnected to each other than the banking industry is. Our policy holder focus and the requirements of our existing regulatory bodies also has a meaningful impact on how we operate. We mention these differences to highlight the complexity involved in non-bank SIFI regulation. We continue to work with all our regulators globally and we'll provide more insights as they are available.","With that, I'd like to turn our call over to David to discuss the numbers and the quarter.","David Herzog","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review the highlights of the quarter's results, our capital management activity and our liquidity and capital position.","Turning to Slide 4, our after-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.7 billion, up 23% from a year earlier or $1.21 per diluted share. Our operating return on equity was 7.2%. Since our earnings are tax affected and we are not paying taxes to the US government, given our NOLs, our operating ROE, excluding the DTA from equity, was about 8.6%.","Reported net income of $2.2 billion included a non-operating gain related to the previously announced settlement with Bank of America, which was about $570 million after-tax. The after-tax impact of this gain reflected the benefit of utilizing substantially all of our remaining capital loss carryforwards. Partially offsetting this non-operating gain was a loss on extinguishment of debt associated with our liability management actions during the third quarter.","Third quarter book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $69.28, up 11% from a year ago, largely driven by our earnings. The comparable book value metric on the same basis as the ROE, excluding DTA, is book value per share excluding AOCI and DTA, which was $58.11 per share at the end of the third quarter, up 15% from a year earlier. However, this assumes that the DTA has no value. There is significant economic value in the DTA, which results from the monetization of the tax attributes in the form of cash to our holding company from tax sharing payments from our operating companies. In our view, the present value of these cash flows can be projected at somewhere between $7 and $8 per share.","Operating income, which is shown on Slide 5, reflects a 14% growth in insurance operating income from a year-ago quarter. I will mention just a few noteworthy items and John and Kevin will provide more details on the operating results.","In the quarter, our P&C business incurred approximately $227 million of net adverse prior-year development, spanning principally from accident years 2006 and prior and concentrated in the primary casualty lines, primary general liability including construction defects and commercial auto. Overall experience for accident years 2007 and subsequent was favorable mainly due to the effects to reduced policy limits and re-underwriting of our excess casualty portfolio.","Our Life and Retirement results benefited from net favorable unlocking adjustments of about $120 million is part of our normal annual review. Collectively, the DIB and global capital markets or DIB GCM delivered another solid quarter with over $350 million of operating earnings that was driving by market appreciation on legacy assets whose values may fluctuate as they move towards the ultimate recovery values that we expect. We continue to reduce the DIB GCM.","In the third quarter, we redeemed about $2 billion of DIB debt due in 2016 and 2017. And in October, we redeemed another $2.4 billion of DIB debt due in 2018, in each case using cash and short-term investments allocated to the DIB. We continue to expect that the actions that we will take will result in the release of a capital to parent over time as the maturities of liabilities and the underlying assets and derivative positions are monetized and settled. Recent improvements in risk profile and leverage led to the release of NAV to the parent which will be taken into consideration in next year's capital planning.","With respect to our 46% equity pickup in AerCap's earnings, as I mentioned to you last quarter, we will have differences from time to time in our estimates in the actual results because of timing. Such differences will be trued up in the subsequent quarters as was the case this quarter with the positive true-up of about $30 million related to the second quarter results.","Corporate expenses were $280 million for the quarter and included a short-term incentive compensation accrual of just over $50 million. We will evaluate the level of our accrual in the fourth quarter based on the full year performance and trued up as necessary. Our reported operating effective tax rate for the quarter was roughly 34%, in line with the previous outlook of 33% to 34% operating tax rates.","Our strong capital position as of the end of the quarter is shown on Slide 6. During the quarter, we utilized the remaining amount under our existing share repurchase authorization, deploying roughly $1.5 billion towards repurchase of approximately 25 million shares of common stock. Following the end of the quarter, an additional 3.9 million shares were delivered to us in full completion of the ASR, which was initiated in September.","We also distributed about $180 million in dividends to our shareholders during the quarter. In addition, our Board of Directors authorized an additional share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion. With respect to capital management, we continue to manage the cost of debt and our debt maturities. During the quarter, we purchased in tender offers of certain high-cost hybrid debt and senior debt securities at the parent for an average purchase price of about $2.5 billion.","In unrelated transaction, we also issued $2.5 billion of debt comprised of $1 billion of 2.3% five-year notes and $1.5 billion of 4.5% 30-year notes. And we issued an additional $750 million in the 4.5% 30-year notes in October. Additionally in October, we repurchased $1.6 billion of principal amount of the 8.175 hybrid notes as part of our continued effort to reduce our high-cost legacy debt.","Year-to-date annual net interest savings from these actions are approximately $160 million. The run rate for 2015 interest expense now is roughly $1.1 billion. We ended the quarter with financial leverage ratios including the hybrids of about 16.4% or 15.8% when giving effect to the October activity. We continue to be opportunistic in our debt capital management and expect that our improving earnings profile, particularly from our core insurance businesses, will continue to positively impact our coverage ratios going forward.","Cash flows for the holding company remained strong, as you can see on Slide 7. We received cash dividends and loan repayments from our insurance subsidiaries of $2.1 billion during the quarter, bringing year-to-date cash distributions to $5.4 billion. Third quarter cash distributions included $400 million from the property-casualty companies and $1.7 from the Life and Retirement companies. Proper-casualty also distributed about $400 million of securities, which are included in the AIG parent liquidity under unencumbered fixed maturity securities.","The cash distributions from the Life and Retirement included $465 million associated with the litigation settlement that I mentioned earlier and a little over $480 million of proceeds from the sale of the PICC shares to parent. We also received additional distributions from Life and Retirement at a little over $600 million in October in the form of cash and securities. We ended 2013 with an RBC ratio of 568%. In the Life and Retirement, we look to distribute excess capital from the Life and Retirement to the holding company to operate those businesses with an RBC closer to 470%.","In addition to these distributions, we received tax sharing payments from our insurance businesses of a little over $300 million in the third, bringing the total to $1.1 billion year-to-date. We expect to make small tax payments to some of our insurance companies in the fourth quarter to true up the actual. Following the quarter, we paid $960 million associated with the previously announced 2008 class action settlement, which had previously been reserved.","We expect continued strong cash flows from our operating companies and we also expect 2015 tax sharing payments to be somewhere between $1.8 billion and $2 billion, and our current expectation is that our tax attribute DTA will be fully utilized by 2020 to 2021.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.","John Doyle","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. AIG's property-casualty results in the third quarter reflect execution against our strategic objectives and our continued focus on underwriting discipline and risk selection.","If you turn to Slide 8, you can see the third quarter property-casualty income of $1.1 billion, up from a year ago, benefited from earned premium growth, improvement in the accident year loss ratio in both commercial and consumer businesses and higher net investment income. Reported net premium written grew 3% from the same period last year, also reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer insurance. Similar to the year-ago quarter, this quarter was a relatively benign cat quarter with losses of $284 million from eight different events. Net investment income growth reflected improved returns from alternative investment, which were roughly 10% on an annualized basis better than our 8% expectation.","If you turn to Slide 9, commercial insurance reported net premium written growth of 5% versus the same period a year ago or 3% when adjusted for FX and additional premiums on our loss sensitive business, led by increases in our property and financial lines businesses.","Property net premiums written rose on increases in new business in the middle market and highly engineered risks. In addition, this growth benefited from improved retention on renewal business and changes to optimize our retention of more favorable risks. Financial lines growth reflected new business increases of targeted growth products such as multinational small business and M&A across all of our regions as well as favorable rate environment here in the United States.","Global commercial rates increased slightly in the quarter and were up 1.8% in the US. US financial lines led with a 3.9% increase, powered by our specialty lines of 2.4% here in the US, while casualty was up 2.2% in the United States. Property rates were down 2.3% and overall market conditions have been fairly stable and consistent with the second quarter.","With respect to rate trends, we believe it's our pricing strategy, our business mix and our focus on pricing each risk appropriately that gives us confidence in our accident year loss ratio trend and continued growth in risk-adjusted profitability.","The accident year loss ratio as adjusted in commercial improved by 1.4 points from the year-ago quarter primarily due to an improvement in financial lines as a result of our fine business mix and underwriting improvement as well as 0.6 tenths of 1 point decline in severe losses from the year-ago quarter. Our global property business continues to deliver positive risk-adjusted profitability even considering the recent elevated trends of severe losses.","Turning to Slide 10, mortgage guarantee reported another strong quarter of operating performance with operating income of $135 million. Mortgage guarantee continues to benefit from improvement in delinquency ratio and cure rates. UGC has become part of our commercial insurance business and remains an important core insurance operation for us, given its strong returns and strategic insights into the residential mortgage market.","To sum up, the commercial team continues to advance on its strategic initiatives where collaboratively across all AIG businesses and further build value for all of our stakeholders. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our consumer PC and Life and Retirement businesses.","Kevin Hogan","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As Peter mentioned, we are bringing together our consumer-oriented businesses in both the Life and Retirement and peroperty-casualty segments to create a global consumer platform with broad distribution reach under common management. Both of these businesses are well positioned with strong leadership, great management teams and a sustainable strategy.","The third quarter represented strong results across all our consumer businesses including our significant Life and Retirement businesses, which I will address later. In terms of PC consumer, at our Japan Investor Day, we highlighted the uniqueness of our franchise, our data-oriented decision making and our focused growth approach. Our progress this quarter was consistent with this message as we saw positive developments across our global businesses, underwriting improvements and lines where data growth pricing, and we achieved growth in a number of products.","I'll begin on Slide 11 where you can see net premiums written for consumer property-casualty grew 2% from the same quarter a year ago, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. There were a number of businesses driving this quarter's topline including attractive new business sales in Japan personal property, continued growth in AIG Fuji Life products and improved rates and retentions in our US private client group.","We note that some of this growth was offset in the quarter due to changes we made in our US warranty programs. We remain positive about the growth potential going forward for consumer PC and we'll continue to pursue opportunities across select geographies and product lines.","Importantly, we delivered better-than-expected underwriting results across our major products. The third quarter accident year loss ratio of 55 for consumer is the lowest we have reported since we began to separately present consumer PC results.","In Japan, where our largest personal auto book resides, we continue to see favorable claims experience and realize the benefit of positive rate actions. This quarter's underwriting improvement was also positively impacted by the coverage actions we took a year ago in our US warranty book. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we had historically experienced a sequential increase in our loss ratio compared to the third quarter.","That said, I believe the over 2 point improvement in our loss ratio year-to-date is based on sustainable underwriting and pricing actions that allows for continued underwriting profitability, which in turn supports our competitive position in the marketplace and allows for ongoing investments in our consumer franchise.","The investments we are making in our infrastructure are evident in our general operating expense ratio, which rose 2.4 points from the same period in the prior year. The Japan integration costs were the greatest contributor to this increase and are ongoing. Our acquisition ratio was flat with the year-ago quarter, largely reflecting the level of production growth.","Turning to Slide 13, the current Life and Retirement segment, I'm pleased to report continued strong financial performance generating $1.3 billion of operating earnings, 18% higher than the year-ago quarter. Growth in earnings was driven by an increase in fee income on higher assets under management and higher net investment income due primarily to strong returns on alternative investments.","Results also benefited from our continued focus on spread management and our disciplined approach to new business pricing across products. In addition to strong earnings, Life and Retirement declared nearly $2.4 million in insurance company dividends in the quarter. Our dividend activity is reflective of strong statutory capital generation by the underlying business as well as our ongoing efforts to distribute excess capital to parent.","Assets under management increased for the fifth consecutive quarter, reaching a record of $334 billion, 10% higher than a year ago. Growth in assets under management was driven by an 18% increase in separate account assets and reflected positive net flows in individual variable annuities, growth in our stable value wrap business and equity market appreciation.","In the third quarter, we achieved new records in our retirement income solutions business, generating $2.9 billion in premiums and deposits and nearly $2 billion in net flows. Approximately half of the growth in retirement income solution sales came from index annuities, which have become an important offering in our suite of retirement products.","Also reflected in third quarter earnings is the impact of our annual review of gross profit assumptions, which resulted in $120 million net positive adjustments to earnings, approximately equivalent to the level of adjustment made in the prior-year period.","Our net adjustment this quarter was impacted by changes to investment spread assumptions. Although spreads have recently been under pressure, our actual experience has been more favorable than what we had assumed in our models, resulting in a positive adjustment in our fixed annuity and group retirement businesses this quarter. This was partially offset by adjustments in our individual life business due to higher than previously assumed mortality, although still within our pricing assumptions, as well as a loss recognition charge for discontinued long-term care business.","Slide 14 illustrates the diversified contribution to earnings from our Life and Retirement businesses. Excluding the adjustments made in both the third quarter of 2013 and 2014 for updated assumptions, retirement income solutions earnings increased 23%, driven by higher fee and spread income. Also excluding the adjustments, fixed annuity earnings increased 25% benefiting from a reduction in our cost of funds and higher alternative investment income.","Sales of fixed annuities will remain challenged in the low interest rate environment as we continue to maintain our new business pricing discipline.. Also excluding the adjustments for assumptions, life and AMH earnings were also dampened by increase expenses related to initiatives to enhance distribution and improve operational efficiencies.","Institutional pre-tax operating income increased 31%, excluding the adjustments to assumptions and benefited from higher fee income and higher alternative investment returns. Group retirement continues to produce strong earnings based on higher fee income generated on increased assets under management, which were up 5% from a year ago. However we did experience a large group surrender as a result of normal competitive pressures in this business.","Overall, we remain comfortable with our risk appetite across our retail and institutional business. We have maintained our disciplined approach to pricing and product design, which enables us to generate attractive returns on new business.","Slide 15 illustrates the performance of our spread businesses. The decline in base yields across product areas reflects the reinvestment of cash flows at rates that are lower than the overall portfolio rate. We remain focused on actions to control the cost of funds, including disciplined pricing of new business and active management of crediting rates on in-force business.","We are also benefiting from outflows of older policies which carry higher crediting rates than current rates offered. These efforts have paid off. In both fixed annuities and group retirement, we have consistently reduced our cost of funds over the last 12 months.","Slide 16 shows our Life and Retirement investment portfolio composition, which remained stable and continues to be highly rated and managed with discipline. Total net investment income fluctuates from period-to-period as can be seen in the alternatives line an other enhancements, reflecting the mark-to-market nature of certain investments. The increase in net investment income from a year-ago quarter is primarily the result of higher returns on alternative investments. Performance of this asset class in the third quarter slightly exceeded our expectations of 10% annualized return.","To close, it was another strong quarter for our consumer businesses and we remain focused on executing our strategy, maintaining a prudent risk profile and capitalizing on growth opportunities going forward.","Now I'd like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.","Liz Werner","Thank you, Kevin. Operator, can we open up the lines of questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","First question on the buyback, it looks like you added another $1.5 billion to the regional authorization back in August 13, 2013. So just wonder is there any difference between addition to the existing authorization versus a new one. Just wonder why you are taking these piecemeal approach like adding $1 billion to $2 billion each time, and you're quickly running out and have to add to it.","Peter Hancock","I think that we feel that each quarter is a good cadence to reevaluate the capital adequacy of the company, the progress that we're making. And so we feel that $1.5 billion is a sizeable commitment that we want to make sure that we deliver on. So I think if we change our view on the frequency with which we should that, then we'll certainly signal that to the Street.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Then switch gear to the underwriting improvements, quite big improvements year-over-year, the core underwriting P&C margin. But if you look underneath, actually the US commercial line as well as international consumer line, the underlying combined ratio have been pretty stable year-over-year. Given the pricing outlook in the US as well as the ongoing restructuring like programs in Japan, do you expect like at least in the near term that we will continue to see some improvements in these two segments?","Peter Hancock","I think that you picked up the right trends. We continue to see good steady improvement in the loss ratio in the commercial sector in particular. I think that the pace of that improvement may abate some headwinds, especially in the US, but I think that the successful diversification to international markets offsets some of that headway. In the consumer space, we've, as Kevin mentioned, made some significant progress to lower action year loss ratios. But the challenge there is investment in infrastructure and in particular the integration of the Fuji Fire and Marine and AIU entities in Japan, which will be ongoing for several quarters to come. So I think that while we feel confident in our long-term goal of combined ratios south of 95, the timing on that is not something that we are guidance on, because we want to maintain flexibility as we execute on these major initiatives.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take a question from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","Congratulations on the quarter and we were very glad to see the progress you're making on the accident year and obviously love the buybacks. I was hoping though to dig in a bit, maybe with John or Charlie, to talk about your reserves. For context, I mean obviously we are all happy that you're releasing reserves in more recent years, but the charge you took for the older years really held back your headline combined ratio this quarter. And after releasing reserves last quarter, I was personally surprised. And so you mentioned in the Q, I think, a few things, the New York Labor Law charge and New York labor Law claims, large construction defects, some changes to how you reserve for mass tort for legacy years as well as some more recent commercial auto. And I'm wondering if you can help us unpack this a bit. We'd love to understand how material each of these are, what's driving each and sort of fundamentally, should we look at these as idiosyncratic challenges where you're sort of seeing case reserve development from maybe some of the larger claims. Or is this a sign of weaker IBNR that you guys are still addressing? And more broadly on this point, is this a result of new facts or is this a function of new processes for the actuaries? I guess the question is when should we expect your actuarial processes to be stable, since you're not necessarily having changes except for when you see deterioration or improvements in the underlying business?","John Doyle","Just quickly on a favorable side, we did see some favorable development in financial lines also in Canada in more recent years in Canada and had favorable development in cats as well on the quarter. Some of the older issues, more legacy issues that you refer to construction defect, New York Labor Law. On the CD side, we saw emergence in some new states that were consistent with the review we had done in the prior year in the third quarter.","And then commercial auto is more recent with the uptick in the economy, I think consistent with what some others have reported. We saw both an increase in frequency and severity in the 2010 and 2013 accident years. We have updated our risk selection models and pricing models in commercial auto to reflect the changes and have gotten some price of late. Maybe I'll ask Charlie to talk a little bit about some of the older development in particular.","Charlie Shamieh","Josh, I'd only add to what John said that of course in the CD space, over 50% of reported claims come in, in development use 7 to 10. And so that's why you're seeing most of it in the earlier accident years. In the excess casualty line, to give you a sense of the mass tort claims are very slow to develop. We see about 40% to 50% developing after 10 years. But the most substantive favorable thing that we can point to is that we're in a material reduction in policy limits on an occurrence basis, which is really the risk that we would be most concerned about in reserving. And that for example exceeded $50 million in the years '97 to '01 and has since been reduced to the low-$30 million since 2011. And that's something that's very substantive that we can point to, which gives us a lot more confidence in the stability of the excess casualty reserve.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","I guess if I just ask one other question, maybe more for Peter or David, Peter in particular. I loved your characterization of the goals of the firm to deliver exceptional returns. And as you know, we think that's possible. But to do that, AIG clearly needs to finally put its legacy reserves issues to bed. And if you look at peers typically, folks intentionally book conservative reserves and then consistently release reserves over time to be able to manage these issues and sort of keep investors from overly focusing on historic challenges and making sure that you have a certain amount of conservatism in the business fronts for surprises. And I guess the big question for you and then I'll let you guys go; do you agree that ought to be your goal? And if you believe that and you would like to look like your peers, where are we in the financial and actuarial process of getting the reserves strength up and getting the balance sheet to be in a position where you're sufficiently paid up for all of legacy issues and you can finally put the legacy of under-reserving behind you?","Peter Hancock","Well, I respect our peers' practices, but we view our own practices as very much committed to a true note of giving our best estimates of reserves with the information that we have at hand. We don't try and squirrel away reserves for a rainy day. So what you see is what you get. They may lead to a little bit more quarterly EPS volatility than everybody would like from the outside, but we think the long-term sustainability of our strategy is what's most important. And that comes from facing the truth on a timely basis, good news and bad news. And I think that that's a philosophical that I'd like to underpin the way we match our business throughout. We want to create sustainable long-term growth and that requires us to face the truth on a timely basis, good news or bad.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Two questions. The first is on the DIB, you had said that you were able to extract some capital out of the DIB. I think it was about $1 billion. I'm going to double check that. But more importantly, going forward, should we expect to see, given the actions you are taking, continued extraction of capital from the DIB?","David Herzog","You're correct. We released about $1 billion in the quarter. And as I said in my remarks, we do expect to release DIB capital. It may be in the form of cash. It may be in the form of securities or other assets over time, which the key is to release the net assets from the DIB, get them to the parent for monetization. We would expect that over the period of time between now and 2018, roughly 80% to 90% of the NAV to be released. That's largely in line with the run-off of the liabilities, the debt that's there. We have assets and liquidity and short-term investments to cover those maturities at par even under stress. So that's sort of the glide path. That is more heavily weighted towards 2018, which is reflective of the concentration of maturities in that year. So that's consistent with what we have seen from the past. So hopefully that's helpful.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","If you continue to take the actions you are taking, though, I assume it would be a little quicker than what you've just laid out.","David Herzog","It may be, but I'm giving what is our best estimate at the time. But again, we continue to be very opportunistic in looking at the wind-down activities and run-off activities of the DIB.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","The second question, on the consumer business, the expense ratio as advertised is elevated this year. When do you expect to see that expense ratio level off and then begin to come down, if you can give us a bit of a forecast for that?","David Herzog","As Peter mentions, an important part of the elevation in expenses is due to the integration of Fuji Fire and Marine in Japan. And we explained at our Tokyo Investor Day, a merger process in Japan is quite a bit different than other places around the world, where a great deal of activity has to go into preparing for the actual legal merger including allocating a single set of products across the companies for day one, having all of the systems investments in [ph] UAT is done, et cetera. And so I think that we really need to look at this as a continuation of the successful acquisition and introduction of Fuji Fire and Marine. And as we've previously indicated, we are anticipating a little bit less than half of the $250 million than we had previously announced. This year with the remaining going forward and as Peter pointed out, we need to look at the long-term opportunities for the efficiencies in this business.","At the same time, also driving up some of the expenses are accruals for profit shares on the warranty business in US, which has a dramatically improved profile after the program restructuring that we undertook last year.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","So it elevated a little bit because of that this quarter?","David Herzog","The different from year-over-year last year versus this year is because of the profit share accruals, but primarily the Japan integration is really the largest number driving the expenses. We would expect to see a continued elevated expense as we integrate the businesses in Japan due to the unique process that exists in Japan.","Operator","We'll go to Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse next.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","First question is related to a comment in your Q, which says AIG property-casualty will seek approval from authorities to update the discount rate to reflect the then current level of interest rates. I just wanted to get some clarification on that. I know last year in 4Q, you took an interest rate related charge related to workers' comp, but it was offset by some other adjustments. But should we take that comment to expect that you're going to take another low-interest rate related charge related to workers' comp in 4Q?","Charlie Shamieh","I would just say that last year on excess workers' comp and primary workers' comp business where we committed to use a (inaudible). We disclosed that we changed the basis to basically follow a use of the forward treasury curve with a liquidity premium. And if you just compare the rights as of year-end '13 with the rights as of September 30th, that reduction alone would get you to a number that may be is $250 million to $350 million lower if rights stay at their levels by the end of the year. So we're just really disclosing the mechanical application of that basis for discounting.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","So, Charlie, if rates are at year end where they are now, it would be a $250 million to $350 million charge that you would take related to that where rates are relative to the original forward curve assumption?","Charlie Shamieh","That's correct. That's purely the effect of the drop in treasuries.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","The other question I had was related to the expense ratio on the commercial side, both in North American and international, was lower this quarter. That actually looked pretty good and it was in contrast to the consumer business. Is that a trendable number? I know there was some reference in the Q to bad debt expense improving. So I didn't know if there was any noise there. Or is that a trendable expense rate on the commercial side?","David Herzog","I think the noise, Tom, was from last year. We have taken some steps, as Peter indicated, in his opening comments to operate a bit more efficiently and gone through a program of work during the course of this year to reflect some of the organizational changes that we're anticipating. And so we do have fewer folks on the team than we did at the beginning of the year and we're focused and better aligned with the opportunities we have around the world. I don't expect meaningful expense improvement in commercial next year, but we have made some efforts to improve the results this year.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Kevin, just in terms of the spreads in the Life and Retirement business, those have held up pretty well. Can you comment on the level of flexibility that you have on the crediting rate side? Obviously core yields will go down if rates remain where they are today. So just can you give us some color as to spread visibility just given flexibility you have on the crediting rate side?","Kevin Hogan","In the fixed portfolios, I think we still have flexibility on about 28% of the reserves and we remain disciplined in that respect, Tom.","Operator","Our next question today is from Mike Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Just a couple questions. Peter, you mentioned the authorization and the quarterly frequency of revisiting it. Should we take that to mean this is kind of a perceived run rate for sort of quarterly authorizations?","Peter Hancock","I think that there are some exceptional items that were driven by our internal capital optimization, in particular the over-capitalization of the Life and Retirement subsidiaries. So there is some rather elevated dividends up from those entities to the holding company. But on the other hand, there are other items that free up capital as well in future quarters. So I don't think we've stabilized to the point where the capital actions in any given quarter are a good predictor of the next quarter. We want to maintain flexibility ending approval of upstreaming dividends and frankly the market environment. So in contrast to dividend policy, I think we want to maintain flexibility on our capital management and maintain an excellent upward trend in credit perception with all of the stakeholders, regulators as well as rating agencies.","And as we think about the opportunities for capital, to have a hierarchy of priorities, first fueling organic growth and we see some excellent opportunities for organic growth in our core businesses; second, inorganic, and we made a modest acquisition this summer, which added capabilities to our international life business; and finally, obviously returning it to shareholders in the form of buyback. But I think that as we evaluate those choices, we're weighing up the accretive nature of all three before we decide how much to do in any given quarter.","Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Should we be looking at the authorizations as a quarterly true up for what you expect over the next few months?","John Doyle","I think that for the most part, we like to deliver on what we promise. And I think barring unusual circumstances during that quarter, we want to maintain a cadence that we do what we say and we say what we do. I think a lot of the companies make larger buyback authorizations and then take a long time to execute them. And I think we'd rather be more immediate responser.","Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","And then just on international commercial, it looked like that was an area that performed pretty well in the quarter, certainly on the expense side as well as the loss side. Anything unusual there this quarter or is that sort of an average quarter, a quarter without incident that we should think about?","John Doyle","I think, Mike, it's mostly around short-tail loss improvement in the quarter. The prior year, we had a pretty sizeable severe loss in Asia last year in the third quarter and that didn't recur. It's not necessarily a straight line, but we see good momentum on our international commercial business. We saw a pretty good growth in Asia in the third quarter, pretty good growth across most of Europe and the Middle East. So we're pleased with the progress there.","Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","And last one just on, David, the subsidiary dividends. You mentioned the tax sharing payments. Any update on what to expect for sub-dividends in '15?","David Herzog","We have not yet updated that guidance or that outlook, so to speak. But again, they remain strong and I think the important aspect here of what I commented on with respect to the Life and Retirement and migrating the RBC from its prior year at 568 to a normalized operating range around 470. And so some of that excess capital may come out in the near term, which could influence the run rate for next year. But the key is to get it up to the holding company where it is the most fungible and flexible. So we will be updating that in the course of discussions in the year as part of our fourth quarter.","Peter Hancock","And I would just add on the comment that John made on international commercial that we're seeing the benefits of the leadership that John has exercised over the last three years to take a holistic approach globally to risk appetite and using our best expertise in a collaborative manner across borders. Our international operations had historically had much different risk appetite than our US domestic. And so I think our customers are really seeing One AIG around the world and rewarding us, I think, with a better mix of business internationally as a result. So we're really punching out our weight in all countries as opposed to just in the US.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","If I look at the operating results for the quarter, you had a 34% tax rate in 3Q. When I look at your competitors, a lot of them have tried just certain arrangements to bring down their tax rates as much as possible, but there is not a lot of incentive at this point for AIG to do so. With tax laws changing worldwide, if we fast forward five years into the future when the DTA is less valuable to you than it is today, will AIG be at a disadvantage to its competitors in terms of their tax rates versus yours?","David Herzog","I think we'll evaluate our tax planning strategies over the course of the next several years. At this point, we've been very mindful of the expiry dates on the various deferred tax assets that we have the NOLs, the foreign tax credits. I think you've seen us be very proactive and effective at realizing the benefits of our capital loss carryforwards. So I think from that, you could infer that we will be prudent in trying to optimize the total cost of operations. And so I don't want to comment any further than that. So we're mindful of it and we understand the value of the DTAs, and we'll manage the tax rate appropriately.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","And following up on Josh Stirling's questions on reserves, is this a business as usual quarter for the actuaries, and is that $0.5 billion in reserve subsidization for reserves more than 10 years old? Is that a risk that AIG shareholders should be willing to bear on an every few quarters basis? Or should we think of this is an exceptional quarter? And are the actuaries compensated to get the numbers right?","Peter Hancock","As I said earlier, I think we compensate and incentivize our actuaries to do the very best they can to come up with their best estimate. We are investing heavily in giving them better and better tools to do so. And I'm pleased with the progress they've made in what is a very challenging job to estimate long-tail businesses that we inherit from fairly old accident years. And so over time, I think that we will see the noise narrow as long as the tort environment and macroeconomic factors that also drive trends and updated estimates, they're relatively stable. But we are committed to updating on a timely basis and using our best judgment to come up with best estimate and delivering that news to you as it happens. So we're in this together.","Liz Werner","Operator, could we end the call now since we've reached the top of the hour. And I'd like to reach out to everybody still in the queue and invite you to follow up with us after this call, so we can get back to you on all your questions. And thank you, everyone, for dialing in this morning.","Operator","And that does conclude our conference today.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Liz Werner, head of investor relations. Please go ahead.","Liz Werner"," ","Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to AIG\u2019s discussion of their fourth quarter 2012 results. Speaking today will be Bob Benmosche, President and CEO; David Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; Peter Hancock, CEO of AIG Property & Casualty; and Jay Wintrob, CEO of AIG Life and Retirement. Other members of senior management are also in the room and available for the question and answer period.","Before we get started this morning, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain certain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. ","Actual performance and events may differ possibly materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause this include the factors described in our 2011 Form 10-K under management\u2019s discussion and analysis and under risk factors. AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. ","Today\u2019s presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures, to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement, which is available on AIG\u2019s website, www.aig.com.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn our call over to Bob Benmosche. Bob?","Bob Benmosche","Thanks very much, Liz, and good morning everybody. As I shared in May of \u201911 with all of you, that I said the AIG crisis was over as we re-IPO the company. As we look at the fourth quarter of 2012, we\u2019re just about to close the door completely on all of the issues that AIG faced during this period of time.","You saw during the quarter, on our strategic activities - and I\u2019m on page three of the presentation - we sold the remaining shares of AIA for $6.5 billion. We entered into an agreement to sell approximately 90% of ILFC. That sale, by the way, is continuing. We\u2019re now just starting down the regulatory review process, so that\u2019s on its way. We would hope that we could close this in the second quarter of 2012, and at that time we can say the door is completely closed and everything is behind us.","We also are building towards the future, and so we made a strategic investment in PICC. That investment, as you saw, is performing well as an investment, but it\u2019s more important than that. It\u2019s strategic. It is allowing us to work with PICC to build a very big and strong life business in China.","And of course the Department of the Treasury has now sold all of their shares and they are completely gone. As you look at our liquidity, we\u2019re sitting here with about $16.1 billion as a result of the AIA sale. And this is on top of very, very strong capital in all of our insurance companies. We\u2019re continuing to get strong dividend flows from our insurance companies, which is helping us deal with our strength, especially in this measure of liquidity. ","So when we talk about capital management, some of you keep asking, what we said last time is still in place today. Our highest priority is to make sure that we focused on getting high costs out, reducing our expenses for interest, and improving our coverage ratio. As the year progresses, we will then begin to look at things like could we add a dividend to the stock, and also could we have some kind of a modest stock buyback. ","But we\u2019re going to wait until we\u2019re very, very sure we\u2019re in great shape, because of what I\u2019ve said, it\u2019s important we retain our ratings, and improve those ratings. You saw some upticks here. We want those upticks to continue.","On the AIG Property Casualty business, Peter is going to talk to you this morning, but we see continued, gradual progress in the loss ratio. The mix of business, you can see, is changing, so if you look at the major businesses on the commercial front, we continue to do well on the consumer front.","And we\u2019re able to overcome the fact on direct business, we can no longer amortize that over the life of the policies. We\u2019re also getting rate in the commercial arena.","So while Sandy took a big hit of $2 billion, which I believe actually reflects the size of AIG and how we do business, and the kind of business we do, but with that kind of a hit in the quarter, you saw we actually made an operating profit in the fourth quarter for the company.","Life and Retirement, again, continues to do well. Our variable annuity sales, which are very well-designed, continue to grow at a time when many of our competitors feel the need to contract because of more aggressive features on their products versus what we\u2019re doing now. We continue to see less sales in fixed annuities, which you would expect in the lower interest rate environment.","And in our Mortgage Guarantee business, we did have to take a reserve charge to deal with the fact that as some of the legacy book is now aging, we see less precision, so we made an adjustment on some of the future expected claims, but other than that, the underlying business continues to do extremely well.","So we\u2019re continuing to work hard to make sure that 2013 is a year where you see clearly that all the fundamental investment and hard work in this company is coming to fruition, and you\u2019ll see us continually work towards our aspirational goals in 2015.","What I\u2019d like to do now is turn it over to David, who will take you through a little bit more detail on the financials. David? ","David Herzog","Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned, there was quite a bit of activity on the capital management and the operating fronts this quarter. We remain committed to our aspirational goals including our $25-30 billion in capital management and a 10% ROE by 2015. Debt-to-capital management is a priority, as you have seen from our recent tender. ","If you turning to slide four, our fourth quarter net income included a $4.4 billion loss related to the agreement to sell ILFC, which reduced book value per share by $2.97. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $57.87, up 15.5% from 2011. ","Operating results begin on slide five, and as you can see, Storm Sandy meaningfully affected property casualty results. Sandy losses are coming in as expected at about $2 billion. ","Life and retirement delivered another strong quarter, with operating income of $1.1 billion, and strong investment returns. Both Peter and Jay will comment on these results in more detail.","The direct investment book and global capital markets benefited from positive marks in the quarter, driven largely by tightening credit spreads. At the direct investment book, NAV came down by about $1.7 billion to $4.8 billion, which is primarily attributable to our ability to extract value and deploy it towards generating incremental parent liquidity.","Subject to our stress testing framework to ensure that the direct investment book can meet its liabilities, even under stress scenarios, we will regularly evaluate the DIV for further opportunities to extract value for our company and our shareholders. ","As a reminder, the bulk of the hedges associated with the assets and liabilities of the direct investment book reside within global capital markets. Over time, we expect to realize additional value from the DIV and it hedges in excess of what is required to service the liabilities, even under stress.","However, it\u2019s important to note that approximately 60% of the direct investment book\u2019s debt is maturing in the next five years. So it\u2019s safe to assume that for the near term, a significant portion of the DIV\u2019s maturing assets and their corresponding hedges will go towards satisfying these upcoming liability maturities.","Interest expense came in as expected. Corporate expenses, which were slightly elevated in the quarter, included the impact of costs incurred from continuing infrastructure buildout, our branding and advertising expenditures, and some modest restructuring related costs.","The effective operating tax rate decreased during the quarter to just under 23%, due to an impact from discrete items as well as some permanent items for the quarter. Looking to 2013, we continue to expect our operating tax rate to be roughly in the 30% range. As you may recall, we will not be paying any U.S. corporate income taxes for some time, given our net operating losses.","Slide six shows the current status of our deferred tax assets. Despite losses from Storm Sandy, we will, on a tax return basis, utilize about $4.4 billion of the gross net operating losses in 2012, aided by the non-core asset monetizations. We also utilized a little over $4 billion of our gross capital loss carry forwards. Additional capital loss carry forwards may be realized in the future, if and when other prudent and feasible tax planning strategies are identified.","Our capital position remains solid, and on slide seven you can see our debt levels reflect $1.8 billion of senior debt issuances earlier in the year, and our shareholder\u2019s equity reflects the $13 billion in share repurchases. As we mentioned last quarter, our targeted improvement in the fixed charge coverage ratio is 1-2 turns over the next year or so, through both capital management an earnings growth. Towards that end, we recently announced a tender offer targeting a number of our hybrids and legacy SunAmerica securities. ","We\u2019ve been very clear about our intention to streamline our balance sheet, and intend to execute on that plan in a very disciplined manner. Between this tender offer, scheduled maturities, and the hybrid calls that are available to us, we believe that we will have made substantial progress towards our liability management goals in 2013. ","Anything else beyond this for the remainder of the year is likely to be opportunistic. We continue to optimize our capital structure across the enterprise on an ongoing basis. During the fourth quarter, we invested $500 million in our life and retirement companies and a strategic cornerstone investment in PICC Group that Bob earlier referenced.","Our life and retirement companies and our property casualty companies are teaming up to further develop our distribution and sales capabilities in China. Our insurance subsidiaries remain well-capitalized, and above their CMA thresholds, and they are well-positioned to deliver dividends to the holding company going forward.","The new CMA levels are effective in 2013, and reset based on our annual refresh of rating agency and regulatory capital models. The property casualty CMA level declined due to the exclusion of the deferred tax asset from the computation. The life and retirement CMA level declined due to the reduction in rating agency minimum requirements and greater capital efficiency from the consolidation of several life and retirement legal entities.","Cash flow remains strong, despite that of the effects of Storm Sandy. Slide eight illustrates the pace of the quarterly distributions from the insurance subsidiaries, which was over $5 billion in 2012. In the fourth quarter, post-Sandy, we chose to make a billion-dollar capital contribution to the property casualty companies. ","We continue to expect $4-5 billion in annual dividends and distributions from our insurance subsidiaries. Parent company available liquidity is over $16 billion, reflecting the recent AIA sale proceeds. As we stated last quarter, the AIA sale generated about $2.5 billion in deployable capital.","And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Peter, for greater detail of the property casualty results. Peter?  ","Peter Hancock ","Thank you, David. Good morning everyone. The fourth quarter marked continued progress toward achieving our goals, increasing risk-adjusted profitability, and implementing our main strategic initiatives. This morning, I\u2019ll comment on our quarterly performance while discussing our underwriting improvements, efforts to reduce risk and maximize capital efficiency, as well as several profitable growth opportunities.","Turning to slide nine, operating earnings exceeded a billion dollars, excluding the $2 billion net Storm Sandy loss. This reflects healthier underlying underwriting results and strong investment performance, partially offset by higher expenses. ","The fourth quarter accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, improved to 63.3%, reflecting the steps we\u2019ve taken to refine business mix and enhance risk selection through predictive modeling, technical price, and account management tools. ","The accident year loss ratio has improved approximately 3 points per annum over the last 8 quarters, and we expect that trend to continue in 2013.","Fourth quarter net premiums written were flat, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We experienced growth in high-value products and geographies, offset by non-renewals on underperforming businesses, primarily in U.S. casualty.","The steps we\u2019re taking to improve business mix are producing more favorable underwriting results. We expect modest real net premium growth in 2013, as we pursue new, profitable business and corrective underwriting actions begin to stabilize.","In the fourth quarter, net prior year adverse development was a modest $116 million, or 0.2% of total reserves. This was primarily driven by adverse development in casualty, partially offset by favorable development in financial lines and property. ","During the quarter, we completed our annual reserve study of worker\u2019s compensation and other long tail lines, which supported current reserve levels. Despite the long tail nature of worker\u2019s compensation, the work we\u2019ve done to identify the structural drivers of losses has increased our confidence in our reserve adequacy. ","We continue to actively manage our runoff lines of business. In the fourth quarter, certain pre-2004 environmental business was moved from the commercial segment to other, to improve regulatory capital efficiency and claims handling. We\u2019ve revised prior period results to reflect the transfer of this business.","This exposure is part of the same portfolio that was subjected to a claim-by-claim review, which we discussed in previous quarters. Although Storm Sandy was most unusual in its nature and path, we do not consider it an outsized event for AIG. Total Sandy losses were 2.7% of AIG property casualties shareholders equity, which is in line with our risk appetite and peer comparisons.","Over the past three years, we took deliberate steps to reduce U.S. cash exposure generally. We\u2019ve also implemented flood supplements on renewals, instituted changes to deductibles and terms and conditions, and have pushed for rate increases, in particular following Hurricane Irene, which mitigated the extent of Sandy\u2019s impact.","Our primarily responsibility is to our customers, and I\u2019m pleased to say that our claims service was recently recognized as best-in-class in response to Sandy by a major global broker. ","This quarter we provided additional disclosures on acquisition and general operating expenses to offer more transparency on their main drivers. Acquisition costs grew, as expected, as high-value business including the direct marketing channel accounted for a greater proportion of our overall portfolio. ","We\u2019re comfortable with higher acquisition expenses as we target business that will increase risk-adjusted profitability. Our investments in technology, talent, and infrastructure impacted the general operating expense ratio, but we believe these initiatives will reduce losses through better claims handling and analytics. In addition, they will drive shared service efficiencies in mature markets and will also help us build scalable platforms to support our growth ambitions in emerging markets. ","In the fourth quarter, we recorded approximately $100 million in severance charges. In 2013, we expect the GOE will approximate full year 2012 levels. We continue to expect a decline in GOE beginning in 2014.","Turning to slide 10, commercial insurance net premiums written were flat, excluding foreign exchange, a result of growth in high-value business, offset by improved risk selection and rate discipline, particularly in U.S. casualty.","In the fourth quarter, we entered into a new reinsurance program in U.S. excess casualty that reduced commercial net premiums written by about 1%, but the agreement is expected to improve overall risk-adjusted profitability.","We reported positive rate change in many of the areas where it was most needed in the fourth quarter. U.S. commercial insurance rates increased 8.6%, and property and workers compensation rates in the U.S. increased by 14.6% and 12.4% respectively. However, we continue to observe more competitive positions in Europe and some specialty lines.","Commercial\u2019s accident year loss ratio improved over 5 points on a full year basis, and we believe it should continue to improve compared to full year 2012 results. However, I would not expect its progression to be linear given quarterly fluctuations, as evidenced in the fourth quarter comparisons.","Moving on to the consumer business, as most of you are aware, Jeff Hayman recently resigned as the leader of the business. I am working more closely with our experienced consumer management team to advance their business goals as I assume his role on an interim basis. Our broad product set and multiple distribution networks provide significant opportunities for expansion, and we remain very bullish on this business.","Turning to slide 11, consumer\u2019s premium growth, excluding foreign exchange, was approximately 1%, and we are pursuing growth strategies across two major lines of business. Direct marketing remains a focus for us, and it represents 15% of the consumer business. In total, we wrote $1 billion in premiums, in growth economies in the fourth quarter. ","We experienced strong growth in Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan, where premiums increased 15%, and Latin America, which had 13% growth over the prior year. We\u2019ve pursued investments and joint venture agreements as part of our international expansion plans.","A good example is AIG\u2019s investment in the PICC group, which strengthens our partnership with the PICC property casualty company. We have also achieved profitable growth through our long term accident and health relationship with PICC and we\u2019re excited about additional consumer opportunities in China.  ","We recently announced a bank assurance agreement with HSBC. AIG will act as the exclusive provider of non-life insurance products to customers in Turkey and France through this agreement. We anticipate it will significantly enhance our ability to market A&H products in Turkey, one of our strategic business expansion countries. In Israel, we purchased our partner\u2019s 50% share in AIG Israel, a successful direct marketing business with strong in-country brand recognition. ","Slide 12 demonstrates our investment portfolio mix. Fourth quarter net investment income increased 21%, reflecting strong alternative investment returns. We achieved greater diversification by further reducing our concentration in municipal bonds and investing in higher yield securities while remaining aligned with AIG\u2019s overall risk appetite.","We made $902 million in dividend payments to AIG parent in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year 2012 total to $2.5 billion, before the $1 billion capital contribution that David referred to. Our capital efficiency efforts, which include legal entity simplification and restructuring of reinsurance arrangements, helped make 2012 our largest dividend paying year in recent history.","2012 included a series of achievements that contributed to advancing AIG property casualty\u2019s intrinsic value. Our shift to high-value business and underwriting improvements produced better margins. We maintained our focus on capital efficiency and optimizing our risk profile. Finally, investments in our business, people, and profitable growth opportunities provided us with a strong, competitive advantage.","In closing, I\u2019m satisfied with the progress we\u2019ve made, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll build on our success in 2013.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jay. ","Jay Wintrob ","Thank you, Peter, and good morning everybody. I\u2019ll begin on page 13.","AIG life and retirement delivered another strong quarter, with operating income growth of 20% for the quarter and 27% for the full year. Our results continue to benefit from actions on both the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet to manage spread income and the current interest rate environment from growth in assets under management and related fee income growth, aided by strong fixed income and equity markets and from continued expense management.","The fourth quarter also benefited from strong alternative investment returns, a $57 million gain on our investment in PICC Group, and a net favorable [back and] reserve unlocking of $41 million. ","These items were partially offset by less-favorable individual life mortality results, though still in line with pricing assumptions, and a loss recognition reserve strengthening of $61 million on legacy long term care business written between 1997 and 2001. We no longer write long term care insurance, and have total runoff reserves of $245 million. ","For the full year, operating income was $4.2 billion, up from $3.3 billion last year, due in large part to improved net investment spreads. While reported earnings growth will be challenging this year due to continued low interest rates and certain one-time positives this year, in 2012, we will continue to proactively address the low rate environment and actively manage net investment spreads.","As David mentioned, in the fourth quarter AIG life and retirement was a significant contributor to capital management, providing $440 million of liquidity to the holding company through dividends and distributions from our operating life companies, thus bringing our full year 2012 total to $2.9 billion.","Our year end RBC ratio is estimated at approximately 510%, well above our capital maintenance agreement threshold of 385%. ","In the fourth quarter, sales results once again reflect the value of our diversified business model. Variable annuity sales were strong at $1.2 billion in the quarter, just short of our high water mark in the second quarter of 2012.","For the full year, VA sales were at an all-time record $4.6 billion, up 42% versus 2011. As Bob mentioned, we benefited from some dislocation in the VA market this year, although we remain a relatively small percentage of industry sales. More importantly, our competitive product offerings, designed and priced with risk control as a primary goal, were embraced by the market.","Longer term, we would expect product innovation and broadening distribution to continue to drive sales, and looking ahead to this year, VA sales growth should continue, although not at the same growth rate as in 2012.","Fixed annuity sales did improve sequentially in the quarter, but do remain low relative to historical levels. Lower fixed annuity sales and an increase in large group surrenders at VALIC contributed to negative net flows for the fourth quarter. ","We also voluntarily waived certain surrender restrictions on VALIC contracts with high guaranteed minimum rates, which contributed to the higher surrender activity. While we\u2019re taking actions to improve our deposit growth in 2013 through expanded distribution and growth initiatives in all of our business lines, low interest rates, should they continue, are expected to restrain fixed annuity sales growth in particular.","We completed the merger of six life insurance operating legal entities into American General Life Insurance Company at year end 2012. Besides improving the capital efficiency of our remaining three life operating companies, and providing expense savings, this merger, along with our reorganized and united distribution organization, will make it easier for distribution firms and producers to do business with us and better position us to sell multiple products across all of our distribution channels. We plan to modify our presentation of results to reflect our new organizational structure in the first quarter of this year.","We mentioned our investment in the PICC group earlier. And in close collaboration with our colleagues at AIG property casualty, we are currently negotiating a definitive agreement with PICC Life Insurance Company to establish a joint venture to distribute life insurance and other insurance products through a specialized agency force. With a focus on major cities in China such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.","We\u2019re also negotiating reinsurance and other economic sharing agreements with PICC Life for jointly developed products. We\u2019ll be providing more information on these activities once the final agreements are executed with PICC Life.","Moving on to slide 14, we\u2019ve provided additional information on our asset allocation and investment portfolio yields. While portfolio-based yield for the full year increased the 5.43%, we continue to see modest pressure as we reinvest currently at lower rates. The fourth quarter base yield of 5.33% is down from the third quarter base yield of 5.38% and of course down from the 5.44% a year ago.","As we mentioned in our press release, our total yield in the quarter benefited from strong alternative investment returns and the gain on our PICC stock investment. Our total fourth quarter yield, as reported, of 6.09%, is up from 5.86% in the third quarter and 5.33% a year ago.","This quarter, alternative investment returns were higher than our expected trend, while the fourth quarter a year ago was below expected trend. And full year total yield, again, was 6.04% versus 5.63% a year ago.","Turning to slide 15, we continue to proactively manage net investment spreads. Western national crediting rates declined both sequentially and year over year, contributing to the improvement in net investment spreads. ","VALIC\u2019s crediting rates have been relatively stable since the second quarter, and spreads have consequently declined due to slightly lower portfolio yields, both due to lower reinvestment yields and the fact that we have been repositioning the VALIC portfolio to improve credit quality. Close to two-thirds of our fixed annuity and universal life account values are currently at guaranteed minimum crediting rates, up from 45% at the end of 2011.","In closing, with a very solid 2012 behind us, we remain focused on our strategic initiatives for 2013. Increasing sales of profitable products, proactively managing interest spreads, growing our assets under management, increasing our life insurance and force, and of course improving our return on equity.","And at this time, I\u2019ll turn it back to David. ","David Herzog ","Thank you, Jay. On slide 16, you\u2019ll see the growth and improving operating trends of our mortgage guarantee business. The loss in the quarter was due to a reserve strengthening, which was tied to more conservative assumptions for the cure rates, which I think Bob referenced earlier.","So with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Liz for Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Liz Werner","Thank you, David. Operator, can we open it up for questions now?","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.  ","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs ","Peter, you commented on the 3 point loss ratio improvement. Is that in just U.S. commercial? Is that overall commercial? Or across the entire book? And can you help us understand what is driving that? Is it mix? Or in the future do you expect it to be less mix and kind of a more rate driven margin?","Peter Hancock ","To be precise, if you draw a trend line through the total P&C accident year loss ratio over eight quarters, it\u2019s an annualized decline of about 2.6% per annum. It\u2019s a bit more of a rapid improvement in the fourth quarter, but that\u2019s slightly out of line of trend, because you had an elevated number in Q4 11 versus a depressed level in Q4 12. ","So as you normalize that out, you can think about an improving trend of about 2.6 per annum. It\u2019s the result of a number of initiatives that we have signaled very clearly: business mix shift, as we re-underwrite out of business lines where we had clear unattractive economics and managing the account relationships in multiline relationships in an intelligent way to shift to a better mix of business by customer, by geography. But also through greater use of analytics and technical pricing models, and segmentation at a more granular level. ","And then finally, through a number of initiatives to reduce claims leakage, where we are seeing significant benefits from applying analytics to fraud management, management of legal expense, and other factors. So we continue to see progress, no let up in that trend, and we\u2019re making a conscious tradeoff between expense and loss ratio as we improved the quality and repeatability of our business.  ","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","So when you look ahead, you expect to see continued improvement on the loss ratio. The expense ratio is higher as you make these investments, but that should begin to recede in \u201914. So the net should be the overall combined continuing to fall once you get to \u201914 and beyond. Is that kind of how I should read that comment?","Peter Hancock  ","Correct. So we stand by our aspirational goals that we laid out 18 months ago, which have an ROE of the business north of 10%, a combined ratio between 90% and 95%. And the interplay between that combined ratio target and the ROE target is a function of interest rate environment. And so we feel that we\u2019re on the path, and continuing to implement the initiatives I mentioned.","Operator","For our next question, we go to Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. ","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein ","I\u2019d love to start with Peter, and first of all, say thank you from all the investors who you guys must have spent a year working on the improvements to the disclosures in the K and sort of crystalizing the story. So normally I ask a more detailed question. I\u2019m not sure that I have to this time. ","I\u2019d love to ask a higher-level thing, though, which is sort of a follow up on Mike\u2019s commentary. When you add up a couple of points, it sounds like three is a reasonable target of loss ratio improvement next year. And you assume that continues for perhaps into \u201914. And then you assume that expenses start to improve as well when you get to 2014. Is it right to say that sort of implicitly you guys think you\u2019ll be running at a low 90s accident year ex-cat combined ratio by 2014? ","Peter Hancock ","I think we haven\u2019t provided a specific guidance on ex-cat, so I wouldn\u2019t want to go beyond what we\u2019ve indicated is our goal, which is 90-95 combined, which includes a normalized cat number in it. I would also reemphasize what I\u2019ve said many times before, that I prefer to view the combined ratio and ROEs as outcomes of what we\u2019re really trying to optimize which is growth in risk-adjusted profitability, which may give rise to a slightly higher or lower combined than the numbers I mentioned for ROE, because we\u2019re looking at the quantity and quality of earnings to really get that balance right between profitability, growth, and risk. But we believe that doing so is completely consistent with guidance that we\u2019ve given to date on those aspirational goals.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein ","David, I want to switch over and just talk about capital briefly. Thank you for the clarification on the debt tender. And generally, I think I understood you to say that you guys are looking to only do opportunistic things once you sort of cover the two debt deleveraging initiatives you\u2019ve targeted. ","The question I\u2019d love to talk a little bit more about is not the rating agencies, but rather the Fed. Your chairman had a bunch of interesting comments in your letter around how closely the board has been working with the Fed. I\u2019d love it if you guys could sort of bring us up to date broadly on all the things you did to get Fed-ready, and where you are now in terms of conversations with the Fed. And ultimately, when you will, or perhaps you already have had, the conversations around just establishing what the level of capital from AIG needs in the world it now exists in. ","David Herzog ","I\u2019ll start off, and welcome others to join in. I would characterize the conversations with the Fed really as constructive, open, and frequent, I think is the clearest way I can describe that for you. So with that as a backdrop, we\u2019re not going to comment on specifics, but again, we continue to work with the Fed to prepare ourselves for what we believe will ultimately be designated as a SIFI. ","And we\u2019ve taken great steps to prepare ourselves through mock exams, through enhanced documentation of procedures and the like, and processes and risk limits and the like, working hand in hand with Sid Sankaran, our chief risk officer, and then our Treasury group in terms of providing reporting and controls around liquidity and stress tests and forecasts. ","So as we prepare ourselves for eventual SIFI designation, we\u2019ll put ourselves as best we can to carry on with the capital management objectives that we\u2019ve laid out. But again, I would go back to my first characterization, constructive, open, and frequent. So with that, Bob, do you want to add anything to that?  ","Bob Benmosche ","You know, I think David covered it well. They\u2019re here. There\u2019s a lot to be looked at. You know, some days you wish you could have a simple company, but then we wouldn\u2019t be AIG. So they\u2019re working through it, and they\u2019re doing it very effectively, and we have a good partnership and I\u2019m sure that they will be able to get a better sense of us in the months to come. But it\u2019s a long road, because there\u2019s a lot to learn.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein ","That\u2019s helpful. Very briefly, David, the debt tender that you guys have just announced? Those are for hybrids that at least in the old days would have been thought of as sort of capital for the purposes of the Fed. Did you have to satisfy to them that you guys would be sufficiently well-capitalized after you reduced your capital for the tender that\u2019s on track to be completed?","David Herzog ","Again, we\u2019re in the tender. We\u2019re not going to comment on any specific conversations we\u2019ve had with our colleagues at the Fed. Again, I think we\u2019re targeting those securities that are most efficiency, effective for us in terms of our capital structure, the cost of them, and the like. So I think as we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019ve targeted our capital management activities to those securities that are most beneficial to our many stakeholders. Brian, you want to add anything to that? ","[Brian Schreiber]","","No, I think that sums it up. And again, these are securities that are generally viewed as having sort of low capital content, and certainly looking forward into what we anticipate will be the regime in which the securities will be evaluated, they\u2019ll have even less capital credit in the future.","Operator","We now move to Randy Binner with FBR. ","Randy Binner - FBR","I wanted to ask a question about the reserves, in particular with the 10-K data, there was kind of continued drag from excess and primarily casualty. So a couple of questions there. One is was that drag mostly legacy? It kind of looks like it, meaning \u201902 and prior. How should we think about the \u201902 and prior years? Because they obviously had significant drag before the last two years, but now it seems like it\u2019s a deficiency of maybe a half a billion a year. Can we get some color on kind of where that stuff is coming from from an adverse perspective? And if we can kind of plan on half a billion of drag there from the \u201902 and prior going forward? ","Peter Hancock ","I\u2019m going to ask Charlie Shamieh, our chief actuary, to comment on that. But I would not in any way annualize any number that you just did in terms of deficiency. We look at our reserves on a quarterly basis with a clean slate every time to make sure that we are adequate at any given time. So any kind of correlation of adjustments up or down from quarter to quarter is entirely coincidental. So why don\u2019t we turn it over to Charlie?","Charlie Shamieh","I\u2019ll just respond to your question about the excess casualty line and in terms of legacy versus current business. The vast majority of that was actually related to our runoff portfolio and our public entity business, general liability. And the number in the 10-K represents the latest quarter, and also prior quarters, where we saw a deteriorating experience. That portfolio has been in runoff since 2008. ","On the primary casualty side, the main driver of that was more general liability and especially on property damage, and it was much more of a severity issue, as we disclosed in the 10-K. And coming from more recent years. And we don\u2019t see any of that as an indicator of future adverse development. We believe the reserves are very adequately set to our best estimate today. ","Randy Binner - FBR ","There\u2019s an above-average amount of legacy reserve drag from AIG versus other insurers, so the color is helpful. The other question I had is, you know, D&O had a favorable result in \u201912, and so just kind of some color on what accident years that came from how that\u2019s trending.","Charlie Shamieh","Well, the main year in D&O, which was favorable in financial services, was the 2010 year, and as we\u2019re emerging from what we had referred to earlier as the credit crisis years, we have a lot more data and actual reported claims and paids on those claims, and they are coming in more favorably than we had anticipated. And that was the major driver of the $307 million favorable result in 2012.","David Herzog ","John Doyle, do you want to elaborate on that?","John Doyle","You know, I think there\u2019s been a lot of commentary on the financial lines business overall. I\u2019ve heard from other markets, and we have a terrific book, a well-diversified book, around the world. That continues to perform well. And we saw growth in the portfolio. We saw improved rate in the portfolio during the course of the year as well. So financial lines is a mix of product, so there are certain segments in the U.S. market primarily, that do need some improvement, and we\u2019re focused on that. But we continue to be very pleased with our business there overall.","Randy Binner - FBR ","So, in layman\u2019s terms, though, the concerns a lot of people had about D&O exposure from the financial crisis, it seems that those are fading at the same time you\u2019re getting rate going forward. And so that\u2019s the dynamic right now in D&O, broadly speaking?  ","John Doyle ","Yeah, I think that\u2019s right. I think we probably have a better balanced book than some as well. But yeah, we continue to get improved pricing and terms in the book, although most of that\u2019s in the U.S. It\u2019s a bit more competitive from a price point of view outside of the U.S. But yeah, we continue to be pleased with that business overall.","Operator","And now we move to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. ","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ","Just quickly following up on Randy\u2019s question, I noticed there were some deficiencies in \u201905 and \u201907, which is somewhat irregular given what we\u2019ve seen elsewhere. Can you talk about those years in particular?","Peter Hancock ","I think you\u2019ll have to elaborate on your question, Josh.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ","If I break out the development for 2012 by accident year, I get very favorable results in \u201908, \u201909, \u201910, \u201911, deficiencies prior to \u201902, and then I get a mixed bag in the hard market years. Some were redundant, but some were deficient. I don\u2019t see too many companies out there reporting any deficiencies from the hard market years.","Charlie Shamieh ","A lot of the movements that you\u2019re observing, which as a percentage of reserves are very trivial, less than 1%, are really attributable to some large losses that we have reported in the 10-K that go back to those accident years, especially on our occurrence based casualty lines of business, where that is not an unusual occurrence. So it\u2019s very hard to extract a trend from the numbers that you\u2019re looking at, as that\u2019s not at all the way we look at it. I draw your attention, for example, to the disclosure on page 94 for the healthcare business, which gives an indication of just that occurrence.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ","Okay. I\u2019ll pay close attention there. And on the debt repurchase, can you contrast what you\u2019ve currently reported to your thoughts about debt refinancing some of the hybrids as opposed to repurchasing them? And if you\u2019re going to repurchase, why not start with the callable bonds that are trading at par rather than ones trading at premiums?","David Herzog ","I think the simple way to think about that is we maintain financial flexibility to the largest extent possible, and the calls are available to us, and it gives us the flexibility that we desire. Brian, you want to comment further? ","[Brian Schreiber]","No, I think you summed it up well. We believe by doing the tender first, and having the calls available, we\u2019ll be able to most effectively meet our liability management goals for the year.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ","And [unintelligible] about issuing some debt to give yourself greater flexibility for repurchasing some of the hybrids?","David Herzog ","We haven\u2019t made any of those decisions yet, and we\u2019ll do so if and when appropriate. ","Operator","And for our next question we move to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A couple of questions. Maybe the first one for Peter. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing from a pricing standpoint in 2013 in January? You must have some data already.","Peter Hancock ","I\u2019ll have John elaborate on this, but I think that for the most part we continue to see continued improvement in rate in U.S. commercial lines. And that\u2019s good news, because it was needed there. So we\u2019re getting closer to rate adequacy, but we\u2019re still not at rate adequacy in the longer tail casualty line. So it\u2019s got a ways to go. ","Europe is softer, but we\u2019re starting from a much more rate adequate environment there, and in a couple of specialty lines, we\u2019re actually seeing a softer market in particular in aviation. But John, if you want to elaborate on that, perhaps you want to add to that? ","John Doyle ","I think Peter hit the theme. Casualty pricing in the fourth quarter in the U.S. for us was up just about 10%. Property pricing was up 14%. We expect continued casualty pricing improvements in 2013, and so far it\u2019s met expectations. So there\u2019s a lot of capacity out there, so I do think the larger players in the market are being disciplined. ","And the reality is the entire industry needs to drive a better underwriting result given the current interest rate environment. So pricing is moving in the right direction there, and we\u2019re not just relying on pricing. ","We\u2019re focused, obviously, on a lot of other levers that Peter mentioned in terms of mix that are better terms, better engineering, better underwriting tools, etc., claims tools, that will drive further improvement. But price continues to move in the right direction there. One, the big Continental Europe renewal date, a little bit better than the fourth quarter, but again, lagging the U.S. as Peter indicated. ","So we\u2019re optimistic about the environment. Other geographies, where property pricing\u2019s been improving, which is important to us, and so we don\u2019t see much to get in the way in the near term of some decent pricing improvements in the early part of 2013. ","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","The second question, if I look at the proceeds from AIA and the eventual proceeds from ILFC, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ll be using them either for buybacks, and you certainly won\u2019t be using all of that for debt repayment. What should we assume in the near term happens to those proceeds? I guess they\u2019ll generate some investment income. Where will that show up in your numbers?","David Herzog ","We\u2019ve not given a projection about future capital actions, capital management actions, that we will take. As we\u2019ve said, we remain committed to the $25-30 billion over the period through 2015. And I think a safe assumption would be that we\u2019ll put the money to work at the parent company level for a period of time until we assess our financial flexibility and our capital position, our liquidity position, and then carry on with the capital management. Bill? ","[William Dooley]","We\u2019re in the process, because cash now is building up at the parent level. And we\u2019ve already sat down, between the risk group and the investment group, and the capital management group, to look at exactly what free cash will emerge over this period of time, and into the future, for the parent. The parent over the last few years has not had excess cash to any great degree to invest in longer term securities. So we\u2019re in the process right now of putting together investment plans. We\u2019ve already started to invest some of the money in very conservative investments at the moment to get additional yield on additional investment. ","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And does that show up in capital markets earnings? Where would it show up in your actual presentation?","David Herzog ","It will show up in the parent. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll move now to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","I had a couple of questions. First, for Peter, you mentioned you expect the loss ratio to improve over time, and if I look at the loss ratio ex-cat and development in the fourth quarter, the 63.6%, it was one of the best levels you\u2019ve had in a long, long time. So do you expect an improvement off of these levels as well? Or was this partly because of just unusually low non-cat claims?","And then maybe for Bob, on capital management, you mentioned several actions, debt reduction buybacks, dividends, do you expect to do these simultaneously, or should we expect that you\u2019d reduce the debt and improve your coverage by the one to two turns you mentioned before paying dividends or resuming buybacks?","Peter Hancock ","I would take you back to an earlier question, where I tried to give as much guidance as to how to think about the trend in [action year] loss ratio. Look at the last 8 quarters, do a regression line through them, and see that the fourth quarter of last year is below that trend line. That trend line is declining at a rate of about 2.6 pointe per year. That\u2019s not a bad estimate for what we think will happen going forward. So yes, there\u2019s a little bit of a fair wind in the fourth quarter, but I think that continued improvement is embedded in our expectations and our strategies. So I think that\u2019s a fair assumption to make.","Bob Benmosche  ","On the capital management side, what we\u2019ve said is some of it\u2019s geography, and some of it is reducing interest expense, which would be our debt reduction and improving profits. All of that gives you a better coverage ratio, covered by the operating companies. And so that\u2019s our highest priority. Continues to be our highest priority. ","We are working very closely with the rating agencies to make sure they are comfortable. Keep in mind that we came out of this crisis much more rapidly than anybody - I won\u2019t say anybody, but I\u2019m not sure there aren\u2019t more than two or three of you on the phone that was with us three years ago realized when we\u2019d get to where we are today. And so the speed that this has occurred in, they just want more time to see us continue to evolve with the good, solid earnings that you\u2019ve seen so far. ","Having said that, as they continue to be comfortable, as we continue to perform through the year, we continue to make progress on our coverage ratio. What I\u2019ve said was I would love to be able to put a dividend on the stock. I think that makes sense, because it increases the number of potential shareholders for this company. ","And as we continue to progress through the year, to the extent we could do a share buyback, we\u2019d like to be able to do that as well. But we\u2019re going at a pace so that clearly we\u2019re looking for, as you saw, with two ratings [unintelligible] already, with [unintelligible] pieces of our company starting to turn positive and potential upgrade. ","So an upgrade to AIG over the next couple years, I think, would be the important statement that says we have accomplished a strong comeback as an investment-grade company. And that\u2019s the goal we have, and 2015 is our aspirational date, and we\u2019re still marching pretty quickly towards that date and the things we need to achieve for it.  ","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","And then on the ILFC proceeds, lastly, if we think about the sales price, you\u2019re getting 90% of that, assuming that you end up selling 90%, you\u2019re putting back $1.1 billion into ILFC. If you were to get out completely from ILFC, would you get that billion back? Or is that sort of a permanent contribution back to ILFC?","David Herzog ","Think of it as just a settlement of an intercompany pooling, pooling cash. So it\u2019s going to go back to them when we close. Liz? ","Liz Werner"," ","Operator, we\u2019d like to end the call at nine, but we do have a number of follow up questions, so to anyone who\u2019s still in the queue, we will certainly be getting back to you as soon as we get back to our desks. And thank you everyone for dialing in this morning.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, head of investor relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. ","Liz Werner"," ","Thank you, and good morning. Before we get started this morning, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. ","Actual performance and events may differ, possibly materially, from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause this include the factors described in AIG\u2019s third and second quarter Form 10-Q and our 2012 Form 10-K, under management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under risk factors, as well as in the same sections within AIG\u2019s 2013 Form 10-K when it is filed with the SEC. ","AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. ","Today\u2019s presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement, which is available on AIG\u2019s website, www.aig.com.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn over our earnings call to our CEO, Bob Benmosche. Bob? ","Bob Benmosche ","Thank you, Liz, and good morning to everybody. If you turn to page three, let me start off with capital management, which is very important. As you saw, we announced a dividend increase, and we\u2019ve added to our share repurchase another $1 billion, so [unintelligible] we\u2019ve got $1.4 billion available for share repurchase at this time.","And this reflects the strength, not of the fourth quarter, but of the entire year, and actually the last 70 years as you look at being able to stress our company to see what would happen under adverse situations and making sure we have to capital and liquidity to meet a stress event and continue to maintain our strong ratings and improve those ratings, in fact, over time.","So this was in line with that. In addition, we continue our debt management, as you\u2019ve seen. And most importantly in the quarter, we were able to sell ILFC and close that doubt about that transaction. So we expect that to close in the second quarter of this year. That will, as you know, be the last major noncore asset that AIG is selling.","Peter will talk to you about our property and casualty business. The underlying results continue to be very strong, in my opinion. This has been a dramatic turnaround from the company and how it was designed in the past to where we are today, and he\u2019ll take you through the details. But it\u2019s a strong top line, [unintelligible] and loss ratios continue to accrue, but remember, it\u2019s not a year-to-year business, it\u2019s a zig zag. I know that\u2019s a technical term for some of you, but there\u2019s up and down, and it doesn\u2019t go straight. And so we\u2019ve seen that, but the trends, I feel, are very strong.","Our mortgage guarantee business continues to do well, a dramatic turnaround from where we were five years ago, but that\u2019s part of the strong risk selection model that was put in place, as well as recovery in the market. And Jay will talk about our life and retirement business. That barely swung sales. That business is really doing extremely well, and continues to do well across all of its product sets. Jay will bring you up to date on the details there.","So let me turn it over to David, who will give you the highlights of the financials, and then we\u2019ll take you through the other key businesses. David?","David Herzog","Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned, we saw strong performance in our insurance operations, with operating earnings for the quarter in excess of $2.5 billion. For the full year, our insurance businesses collectively generated in excess of $10 billion pretax operating earnings.","Looking ahead to 2014, we would expect continued progress in expanding our risk-adjusted returns through growth and capital efficiency. The sale of ILFC, as Bob mentioned, to AerCap, is on track for closing in the second quarter. ","The transaction was valued at $5.4 billion upon announcement, using a $24.93 share price for AerCap and any adjustment in that value on closing will reflect the change in the AerCap share price and will be recorded as a non-operating gain or loss on sale.","Upon closing, AIG will receive net cash of about $2.4 billion, which will be held at the parent company available for general corporate purposes. Our retained 46% interest in AerCap will be held at the holding company and will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with the equity earnings from AerCap included in our other segment operating results.","The lock up expiration on AerCap shares begins to phase out nine months following the closing date. We will be prudent in maximizing our value, as you have seen in our past dispositions of invested assets. ","As part of the ongoing focus on capital management, as Bob mentioned, our board approved the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.125 a share, and authorized the repurchase of additional shares with an aggregate purchase price of up to $1 billion. This gives us $1.4 billion of capacity.","Turning to our financials on slide four, net income for the quarter was $2 billion and included several largely offsetting nonoperating items detailed on page six of our financial supplement. One such item, footnoted on page 6 of the financial supplement, relates to an impairment charge on our investment in life settlements totaling about $832 million before tax. ","This charge was prompted by the continued underperformance relative to our mortality assumptions. Accordingly, we revised our future mortality assumptions and discount rates for valuation purposes. Overall, we expect this $3.6 billion portfolio to have a mid-single digits return.","Our operating ROE for the quarter was 7.3%, in line with our full year of about 7.5%. Since our earnings are tax affected for purposes here, and we are not paying taxes to the U.S. government given our NOLs, our ROE, excluding the DTA, is about 190 points higher than that.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI of $64.28, grew 11% from year-end 2012. Our operating results begin on slide five, and you can see solid growth in our insurance operating income from a year ago, and Peter and Jay will speak to their respective businesses. ","The direct investment book and global capital markets earnings collectively were strong and a little over $600 million for the quarter and reflect market pricing due to their mark-to-market accounting treatment that can create some volatility from period to period. We expect these earnings to moderate over time as the portfolio winds down and the investments approach their expected recovery values.","In addition, we continue to proactively and opportunistically reduce the direct investment book\u2019s footprint. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we repurchased about $466 million worth of DIB-related debt, and during the first quarter of 2014 we reduced the direct investment book debt by a little over $2 billion through both the make whole call that we announced in December and open market purchase transactions. ","All of this, using cash, would have been in the direct investment book specifically allocated for this purpose. At year-end, we had roughly $7.9 million of net asset value in the direct investment book in global capital markets. ","Corporate expenses totaled about $213 million for the quarter, down from a year ago due to lower data center restructuring costs and other related expenses on restructuring costs. We expect corporate expenses would run at about $225 million to $250 million quarterly run rate in 2014. ","Other expenses included a severance charge of about $265 million related primarily to the property casualty business and relates to our migration towards shared service centers, which Peter will speak to in his remarks. Also reported in other were $170 million of gains related to AIG real estate sales transactions. ","Reported operating effective tax rate for the quarter was about 32%. Our current outlook for 2014 is an annual operating effective tax rate of somewhere between 31% and 32%. Slide six presents a summary of our DTA, which totals a little over $21 billion at year-end, up from just shy of $17 billion a year ago. ","While our tax attribute related DTAs, i.e. the net operating loss carry-forwards and the foreign tax credits, have declined by about $1.4 billion through the utilization of the net operating losses, our net other DTLs and DTAs increased by almost $6 billion. The increase relates to the sale of securities with gains, transactions that resulted in tax basis step up, and a reduction in the unrealized appreciation of our AFS securities.","In the fourth quarter, we recognized another $540 million of income related to the release of the valuation allowance on the capital loss carry-forwards. In aggregate, we have utilized roughly 86% of the capital loss carry-forwards. For the ROE calculation that normalizes for the tax attribute DTA, we subtract about $17 billion from stockholders\u2019 equity.","Turning to slide seven, you can see the impact of our capital management activity in 2013. During the quarter, we issued $1 billion of 10-year notes at a little over 4% interest and we repurchased some debt at the parent company in DIB totaling a little over $1 billion that had an average coupon of about 7.5%. ","Including the DIB, when you take into account all the things we\u2019ve done in 2013 with respect to our liability management and maturities, we\u2019ve reduced our leverage by over $7 billion and reduced our annualized interest expense by roughly $350 million.","On the equity side, during the quarter we distributed about $147 million in dividends to our shareholders and deployed just over $400 million towards the repurchase of 8.3 million shares. While the IFLC transaction impacted how active we were during the quarter, we remain focused on continued execution of our repurchase authorization. We will continue to be opportunistic in the future going forward towards our debt capital management as well. ","As you can see on slide eight, our insurance operations remained a source of parental liquidity in that they sent $4.3 billion in dividends and distributions to the parent in the quarter, including $90 million of dividends from mortgage guarantee, its first dividend since 2010. For the full year, dividends and distributions totaled $8.9 billion, well above our expectation of the $4 billion to $5 billion we\u2019ve talked about in the past.","I would point out that the full year dividends from life and retirement included about $800 million related to litigation settlement proceeds received by life and retirement that were remitted up to the parent company. Additionally, $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter dividends from property casualty resulted largely from some restructuring activity we\u2019ve been working on for quite some time.","Our expectation for 2014 is to have dividends and distributions from the operating companies somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion. In addition to these dividends, we expect tax sharing payments from the insurance companies, the parent, of approximately $1 billion in 2014 and roughly $2 billion in 2015, as the local insurance companies\u2019 statutory NOL DTAs are utilized. ","These dividends, combined with our capital management activities I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, resulted in parent cash short term investments and unencumbered securities of just over $13 billion as of the end of the quarter. ","Included in parental liquidity is $5.9 billion related to the direct investment book in global capital markets, which is allocated for its future debt maturities and contingent liquidity stress needs. As we\u2019ve indicated in the past, nearly 80% of the direct investment book\u2019s liability will mature between now and the end of 2018. ","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Peter for comments on property casualty.","Peter Hancock ","Thank you, David, and good morning everybody. Today I\u2019d like to discuss the highlights for the quarter and the year as well as our outlook for 2014. Let me begin by saying the year marked significant accomplishments that we believe are indicative of future direction.","Our balanced approach to growth, risk, and profitability drove our business mix shift, our underwriting actions, and our capital management achievements. We\u2019re pleased with our progress, and look forward to continuing on our path towards increasing returns.","Turning to slide nine, in the fourth quarter net premiums written grew 6% from a year ago, on a normalized basis, with growth coming from each of our major business lines. For the full year, net premiums written were over $34 billion, or up 4% on a normalized basis.","In the quarter, commercial lines delivered net premiums written growth of 7%, with improvement in each product line. This is the first quarter in 2013 with a comparable top line comparison to casualty as there\u2019s no longer an impact from the global excess casualty quota share entered into in 2012.","Specialty delivered the strongest top line improvement on a normalized basis from a year ago, with noteworthy growth in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Property also developed strong growth, both in the fourth quarter and full year. Our global property business is benefitting from significant international growth as we leverage our recently expanded in-house engineering capabilities and execute on our global approach to capital allocation. ","Looking ahead to 2014, we expect continued growth across our businesses, including casualty, where the reunderwriting of our book is largely complete. We remain focused on retaining our highest quality business and see positive rate increase in the United States.","Pricing continued to be positive, and largely exceeded loss cost trends. Global commercial rates increased 2.6% in the quarter, and the U.S. market continued to lead rate improvements with a 5% increase in the quarter. U.S. casualty led with a 6.5% increase, followed by U.S. financial lines, which were up 4.2% and U.S. property, at 3.7%. ","Continued favorable underwriting trends were offset by increased severe losses in the fourth quarter. Improved underwriting results [in the last quarter of] the year were the result of our pricing actions, selection, technical underwriting, and investment in claims handling.","Severe losses in the third and fourth quarters reflected higher frequency and severity and exposure growth following the low level of severe losses in the first half. Our full year severe losses were somewhat in excess of our expectations, but we expect a modest amount of volatility for the increased returns. ","We expect to continue to see a decline in the actual [unintelligible] loss ratio, as a result of our underwriting improvements. Over the last three years, we\u2019ve continued to manage down our gross exposure to catastrophes and refined our global approach to reinsurance, which has led to consolidation of our reinsurance purchases and a reduction in the number of counterparties and contracts.","While we don\u2019t disclose all of our reinsurance programs, we\u2019d like to provide a few highlights that illustrate the role reinsurance plays in our business strategy. In our corporate cat program, which we renewed in the fourth quarter, the attachment point is $3 billion, and provides significant protection up to $5.5 billion for individual losses in the U.S. and Canada, and up to $4 billion for accumulation of losses worldwide.","In 2013, we also continued our strategy of accessing the capital markets. During the year, as part of our cat program, we entered into two separate multiyear cat bond transactions providing combined reinsurance protection of $525 million.","Our consumer business, which is presented on slide 11, underwent a transition in 2013, as we increased rates in Japan A&H and personal lines and engaged in further portfolio management in the United States. We continued selected growth in key markets. We experienced a higher level of travel and accident losses in the quarter, which we don\u2019t expect to be sustained given the short term nature of this business.","Consumer remains on track for modest improvements in both growth and profitability in 2014. Additionally, the investments we\u2019re making in Japan will help provide a more competitive operating platform and a lower cost structure in the long term. ","And with Kevin Hogan\u2019s new leadership, we look forward to executing on a strategy of targeted growth in markets where we can achieve meaningful scale and applying some of the principles that have worked well in commercial. We look forward to discussing more details of our consumer strategy over the coming months. ","Two items of note in the quarter are the severance charge that was recorded in AIG\u2019s other operations and our reserve actions. The expense savings associated with the $265 million severance charge largely pertain to property casualty, and will emerge beginning in 2014 and become more significant in 2015. ","However, for the full year 2014, the investments in the business will result in a relatively flat expense ratio compared to 2013. We began the final stage of the Fuji integration work in the second half of 2013, which will continue into the second half of 2015. ","The cost of this initiative, which estimated to be approximately $250 million, when combined with our purchase price, still represents a meaningful discount to the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities acquired. We believe the full integration of our Japanese business, which currently has an 8% market share, will position us well in the second-largest non-life insurance market in the world. ","Slide 13 presents prior year development for the fourth quarter and full year. We continue to review our reserves quarterly and take timely action to address changes in development trends. In the fourth quarter, we added $225 million to our pre-2004 runoff environmental reserves, based on our updated review.","Our analysis of pollution products looked into individual cases which indicated large increases in the value of certain previously reported cases due to new developments such as the discovery of additional contamination in certain sites, legislative changes, court rulings, expansion of plaintiff damages, and increased cost of remediation technologies. In addition, there was a 1 point adverse impact to our current accident year loss ratio related to these multiyear runoff lines of the business. ","In the fourth quarter, we obtained approval from our Pennsylvania regulator to better align payout pattern and mortality assumptions for our excess worker\u2019s compensation reserves, using our own experience and to utilize a more economic discount rate assumption for our primary worker\u2019s compensation reserves. ","These actions reflect our work with regulators over the course of the year and the significant analysis we completed to better model our runoff excess worker\u2019s compensation book. For the quarter, the total net discount benefit was $325 million, which included a benefit of $647 million on excess worker\u2019s compensation reserves and a charge of $322 million on primary worker\u2019s compensation reserves.","We also expect to record an additional worker\u2019s compensation loss reserve discount benefit of approximately $100 million in the first quarter of 2014, associated with the merger of internal pooling arrangements effected January 1, 2014.","In the fourth quarter, we made $2.6 billion of cash dividend payments to the parent company and $4.1 billion for the full year. During 2013, we worked with our regulators to simplify our legal entity structure. We consolidated our U.S. and Bermuda insurance exposures into one U.S. pool, yet increased our diversification benefits. These restructuring transactions resulted in $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of dividend payments to the parent company and $1.8 billion for the full year.","Turning to slide 14, mortgage guarantee\u2019s operating performance continues to improve, with operating income for the quarter of $48 million. Mortgage guarantee continues to benefit from its proprietary risk selection model and an improving housing market, with 59% of earned premiums generated by high quality business written after 2008.","Mortgage guarantee closed the year at a record level of domestic [first lien] new insurance written of $49.4 billion. The delinquency ratio fell to 5.9% at the end of the quarter, representing the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2007. ","UGC continues to be strongly capitalized and holds an investment portfolio that\u2019s highly liquid, with 81% of the investments rated A or better. As the leading U.S. mortgage insurer, UGC currently insures 800,000 mortgages across the United States.","Now I\u2019d like to return the call over to Jay to discuss life and retirement results.","Jay Wintrob ","Thanks a lot, Peter, and good morning everyone. 2013 was a record year for AIG Life and Retirement, and we had our best year in top line results, generating nearly $29 billion in premiums and deposits and in delivering on the bottom line with $5.1 billion of pretax operating income.","Turning to slide 15, operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion, up 29% from a year ago, due primarily to fee income growth, active spread management throughout the year, and higher net investment income. Returns on alternative investments were approximately $200 million above expectations and 52% higher than the prior year period, driving much of the increase in our net investment income.","These results and our solid capital position enabled AIG Life and Retirement to distribute over $1.3 billion to the holding company this quarter and deliver full year dividends and loan repayments to AIG of more than $4.4 billion. Giving effect to these dividends, we still grew shareholders\u2019 equity, ex-AOCI, by 11% to nearly $35 billion. ","The success of our retail investment product strategy was a key driver of the significant increase in our sales volumes. Our all products, all channels distribution platform continues to generate outstanding results. Retail premiums and deposits grew 88% from the year ago quarter, reflecting growth across all of our investment products.","Individual variable annuity sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter and $8.2 billion for the full year. We remain comfortable with this run rate of sales, particularly given the actions we\u2019ve taken over the years to derisk this product.","Fixed annuity sales increased over 90% in 2013, and sales in the fourth quarter were nearly four times what they were in the year ago period. Consumer demand for fixed annuities has improved from the year ago quarter, though sales have moderated somewhat from the third quarter, due to interest rates declining from peak levels reached last quarter and our related disciplined pricing actions. We also saw increased premiums and deposits in our institutional businesses, with growth in both group retirement and institutional markets on a year over year basis. ","As of year-end, our assets under management were $318 billion, up 10% from year-end 2012. Over the course of the year, we saw improved net flows across all of our retail investment products, higher separate account balances, and an increase in institutional assets under management.","Net flows in 2013 were nearly $4.6 billion, driven by the substantial sales improvement in our retail products that I just discussed. We continue to grow our stable value wrap business in the quarter, and saw a year over year increase of $14 billion in stable value wrap assets under management. ","These sources of AUM growth more than offset the impact of rising rates on our invested asset portfolio and for the first time in four quarters, we experienced sequential growth in our general account asset balance. So overall, we\u2019re pleased with the growth in assets under management we\u2019re seeing across our portfolio of businesses.","Slide 16 highlights the strong operating income results of our businesses. Retail operating income increased 37% versus the year ago quarter, as a result of enhanced spreads, growth in fee income on separate accounts, and higher net investment income. Institutional operating income increased 19% versus the year ago period and similarly benefited from crediting rate actions, higher fee income on separate accounts, and the higher net investment income. ","The increases in net interest income were largely attributable to greater partnership returns and appreciation in hybrid securities, nonagency RMBS, and other invested assets accounted for using the fair value method. We also experienced better than expected mortality in our life insurance business, which contributed to the favorable year over year performance in the quarter.","Our retirement income solutions business continued to grow profitably, with operating income up over 70% from the year ago quarter. We\u2019re seeing strong demand for our products, which we believe are differentiated in the market based on the income options we offer and our award winning customer service.","Over the past almost four years, we\u2019ve redesigned our products to reduce risk to AIG, and I think the strategy is paying off. In our retirement income solutions business, of our $24 billion of variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, 71% include benefits with strong derisking features such as the fixed indexing of our rider fees, volatility control funds, and required minimum allocations to the fixed account.","Given its relative size, we view our variable annuity business as an opportunity to generate attractive returns, especially as competitors reduce their appetite for additional exposure while consumer demand for income solutions remains robust.","Slide 17 shows our investment portfolio, composition returns, and yields. Net interest income benefited from the strong alternative investment returns in the quarter, as I mentioned earlier. Overall, the total portfolio base yield declined 4 basis points from the year ago period as we continued to invest premiums, deposits, and cash flow from the portfolio at new money yields below the overall base portfolio yield.","Over the course of 2013, portfolio cash flow included proceeds from asset sales which generated significant tax gains in our fixed investment portfolio designed to utilize our capital loss carry-forwards. Since inception of our gains realization program to utilize those capital loss carry-forwards in 2012, our overall portfolio base yield has been negatively impacted by 13 basis points on an annualized basis as a result of the action","It\u2019s worth noting, however, that our base yield increased 3 basis points sequentially, mainly attributable to increased income recorded on residential mortgage backed securities related to appreciation in the home price index as well as an increase in estimated future cash flows when compared to the prior quarter.","Moving to slide 18, we continue to actively manage crediting rates, which is reflected in the decline in cost of funds for both our fixed annuities and group retirement businesses on both a year over year and sequential basis.","Net spreads expanded for both fixed annuities and group retirement from the year ago period and the prior quarter. And at year-end, 73% of our fixed annuity and universal account values were at minimum guaranteed crediting rates.","So in closing, 2013 was a strong year for AIG Life and Retirement, with record sales and profits. This year, we remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives, which include growing our distribution organization and increasing the productivity of our wholesalers, affiliated agents, and financial advisors; leveraging our strong relationship with distribution partners to increase penetration of our broad retail product portfolio within firms; maintaining a leadership position and offering competitive and profitable retirement income solutions; and continuing to look for opportunities to grow our institutional businesses, where we can achieve the most attractive risk-adjusted returns.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A. ","Liz Werner","Thank you, Jay. Operator, can we open up the line for questions this morning? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] We\u2019ll go first to Brian Meredith with UBS. ","Brian Meredith - UBS ","Peter, I\u2019m just curious, with 2.5% or 2.3% kind of rate increases globally, do you think we can continue to see the magnitude of improvement in your loss ratios going forward?","Peter Hancock ","Yes, we have a fair degree of confidence that the three-year trend of actually loss ratio improvement will continue. As you know, a lot of the improvement is baked into this year through renewals, so we have a high degree of confidence on that.","Brian Meredith - UBS ","And is it coming maybe just mix instead of absolute rate, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re still getting the big improvement?","Peter Hancock ","It\u2019s a combination of all the initiatives we\u2019ve made to make sure that we have reunderwritten the books that were causing problems. So the U.S. casualty book has been substantially reunderwritten. Getting rate where we needed rate, investment in much, much tighter claims to reduce claims leakage. So it\u2019s a whole combination of factors which have been underway for two years and are now starting to come through as we actually start to believe in the trends that have been established. ","John Doyle","I can add that we expect to see continued good growth in our commercial business in Latin America, in Asia ex-Japan, and as well as the Middle East and Africa. And that business continues to perform quite well from a loss ratio point of view. We\u2019ve also rolled up some new products around the world, that continue to contribute to an improved mix of business. So we expect the underwriting results on a normalized basis to continue to improve next year.","Brian Meredith - UBS ","And then just quickly, on capital management, for David, as I look at your common equity this year, it was up a lot of $2.5 billion and then if you ex AOCI, it was up close to $8 billion. So I\u2019m just kind of curious, why aren\u2019t we seeing more capital management, more share buyback? Or is that something we may be able to expect on the horizon [unintelligible] faster pace that we\u2019ve seen?","David Herzog ","As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ve remained, and do remain, committed to the $25 billion to $30 billion of overall capital management. To date, we\u2019ve done about $20 billion. $16 billion or so of that is in common equity buybacks. We\u2019ve done some debt. We\u2019re increasing the dividend.","I think the overall approach is to be prudent, to be deliberate and orderly about the pace at which we go. We want to, in the long term scheme of things, do this in an orderly way. And so we\u2019re balancing the perspectives of many different stakeholders at the table, so the fact that we\u2019re increasing our dividend, increasing or getting an additional share repurchase authorization, I think you should take as a sign of our confidence, our board\u2019s confidence, in the underlying financial underpinning of the company. ","And as I\u2019ve said, we remain committed to the $25 billion to $30 billion of capital management between 2011 and 2015. So we\u2019re going at a pace we think is appropriate. Bob, if you want to add any commentary to that, I\u2019d welcome that at this time.","Bob Benmosche ","No, you said it exactly right. Keep in mind that, considering where we\u2019ve been, and we\u2019ve had the clear direction, we want to make sure we do this in a very thoughtful, routine, and prudent way.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Mark Finkelstein with Evercore. ","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners ","Peter, can you elaborate on the A&H losses and private client group losses in consumer please?","Peter Hancock ","I think I\u2019ll ask Kevin Hogan to handle that one. So Kevin, why don\u2019t you discuss that?","","Kevin Hogan","Sure. Mark, these are primarily related to some wholesale travel business in the fourth quarter. There were some severe losses in travel delays. And then in the private client group also, there were a handful of losses associated with the severe weather. We\u2019ve taken appropriate underwriting actions across the portfolio in the U.S., throughout 2013, and we anticipate this to be a short term impact on the results. ","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners ","And then I guess, also staying there, just thinking about the expense ratio. You\u2019ve kind of had the severance charges, but the outlook for the expense ratio in \u201914 is relatively flat, I think, if I heard those comments correctly. And I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about expense ratio staying high through \u201914 into \u201915. What is the current thinking on when we\u2019ll start to see some of the infrastructure and the IT spend moderate and start to see the actual expense ratio coming down?","Peter Hancock ","Well, the big expenditure in 2014 relates to Japan. As I mentioned, we\u2019re spending about $250 million in fully integrating the Fuji acquisition into our AIU operation. And that\u2019s a spend that really started in July of last year, and will last through July 2015. So it really peaks this year as we make some very major investments in infrastructure and branch rationalization in Japan. So that\u2019s the big item. ","And then offsetting that is a continuation of a process we started in 2011 of integrating the property casualty business into one seamless AIG as opposed to a number of separate profit centers with duplicative infrastructure. And so this year we will be really streamlining, removing excess layers of management in areas where they\u2019re duplicative so that we can be as responsive to customers and grow and redeploy people and capital where the opportunities are greatest. ","But I think that the expense ratio has been affected by a combination of these investments, as well as the reduced denominator of the shrinkage in the U.S. casualty business. So a bit of negative operating leverage occurring, which, as I mentioned, we\u2019re getting top line growth again as we have reunderwritten the casualty book. ","So I think we feel good about the outlook on the expense front, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a dramatic change until 2015.","Bob Benmosche ","Can I just add to that? I know we\u2019re all focused on the expense ratio, but we need to focus on the accident year loss ratio and the growth of this business. And another thing, as Peter has talked about over the last year or two, is that we\u2019ve invested heavily in an [engineering] center that will improve our ability to assess risk, investing huge amounts of money and time to get better data around underwriting intuition, and doing a better job there. That\u2019s adding to the expense ratio. ","When you look at money we\u2019re spending to put in the fraud unit, subrogation units, in our claims area, all of this is adding expense and the benefit really of that is an improved and reliable and consistent accident year loss ratio. So you really have to think about the strategic work that he\u2019s talked about over the last two years and how you\u2019re seeing that benefit across the entire combined ratio. ","And also, it takes a while into earn into the benefits of what we\u2019re targeting. We just mentioned earlier today that the actual rates have to exceed the trends, and it takes a long time for trends to emerge. And I think you\u2019ll see this continuing to progress over the next several years. ","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners ","All very fair points. And just one very, very quick one, if I may, which is the increase in the statutory dividend that you\u2019re assuming for \u201914 over \u201913. Is that all from improvement in earnings, or is there more capital efficiency improvements at P&C, or any other items that are helping to improve that number?","David Herzog ","","It\u2019s a combination of continued strength in earnings, so we\u2019re continuing the generate the deployable capital, but there is some amount - I haven\u2019t quantified it publicly - that we\u2019re moving some higher than needed capital in some of the operating companies up to the holding company. ","So we\u2019re continuing to evaluate the amount of capital that we\u2019re holding in the operating companies. We want to make sure we\u2019ve got plenty of capital for our ratings, plenty of capital to maintain our competitive positioning and to fund growth, but the businesses are continuing to generate very substantial capital and we will migrate some of the capital ratios down a bit over time as we said we would do. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","You mentioned the accident year loss ratio being negatively impacted by some multiple year contracts. I didn\u2019t quite get that. That was one point. And then secondly, with your stock trading below book value, the capital that you\u2019ll generate from the ILFC sale, should we assume that share repurchase will be a primary use of that capital?","Peter Hancock ","I\u2019ll start on the first point and then I\u2019m going to probably enlist James Bracken to help if I flub the GAAP accounting treatment. Basically, these are contracts and policies written pre-2004. They were multiyear in nature, where because they\u2019re multiyear and we\u2019re receiving premiums still, it means that as claims get made, they appear in the current accident year. These are the discontinued business from pre-2004 that appears in the current accident year. It\u2019s an anomaly.","James Bracken","Just one clarification. That being earned, then, would [unintelligible] the premium, and think of them as multiyear claims made [follow through]. So they run for a number of years. We\u2019ve still got a bit through [unintelligible] and we still see some revenue recorded in the [MPE] line of the other segment, and some loss activity attaches to them, but it relates to the runoff business.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And was that one point?","James Bracken","Yeah, one point to the total company [unintelligible].","Peter Hancock ","Yeah, one point of actual year loss ratio, including the entire company.","Bob Benmosche ","And as far as capital management is concerned, what we\u2019ve seen all along is that our first priority is our credit ratings, because that speaks to our ability to live up to the promises that we make. So we\u2019re worried about coverage ratio, debt management, and so on. We then said that we want to have some dividends to [unintelligible] back to our shareholders. But the primary goal, after those two have been achieved, is share buybacks. ","So when ILFC closes, we will make a determination at that time, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate our capital management program around our stress testing of the company, which is right now we do one starting in November and we do another one around May, and then we take a look at where the company is, where we think the issues are in the marketplace, and then it goes into the board, what we think is appropriate capital actions based on what we see at that time. ","So as we get to the point, as David point out, the $25 billion to $30 billion, we can see the dividends coming up to the holding company, you can see the DTA beginning to get monetized. Our priority is to continue to maintain a strong company, while at the same time, given what makes sense to the shareholders, as quickly as we can. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. ","Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill","I want to talk a little bit more about the expense in property casualty. I think maybe I\u2019d like to ask it in a big picture perspective. If you go back to AIG before its problems, this was a company that had a relatively low expense ratio and a pretty average loss ratio, and that was kind of how they made their money, by having a lower expense ratio than their peers.","Today, we\u2019re looking at a loss ratio which is much improved. It actually kind of looks a lot like peers, broadly speaking. But it\u2019s an expense ratio that\u2019s higher. Is the goal here to have a business that is heavy on loss control and heavy on expenses, lower loss ratio over time? Or ultimately are we talking about a company that wants to make its competitive advantage once again in expenses?","Bob Benmosche ","I think you should [unintelligible] us having a very competitive combined ratio, both loss ratio and expense ratio. I think that\u2019s what Peter is working towards. But you need to look at the loss ratio and look at it on an accident year basis, historically. If I go back to our releases, and the information we provided you, I don\u2019t know that the accident year loss ratio for those prior years looked at from this year would be what you saw. ","So I think there\u2019s a difference. And if you back them in, which is what you need to do, prior year development, and you look at the prior year development over the last several years, and look at what we\u2019ve had to do, you can see that the accident years were pretty high. ","So what you\u2019re going to see is continued improvement in the loss ratio, continued improvement in underwriting and systems around underwriting, continued investment in technology so we have a very strong, bullet proof processing capability here at AIG that\u2019s state of the art, and then you\u2019ll see your expense ratio start to come down and still see improvements in loss ratio. ","But we need to continue to invest in a lot of tools to make sure that that loss ratio, five years from now, is what we said was in the [unintelligible] or slightly better. And so we\u2019re building this company not only for 2014, but for 2018 and 2020. We really have to have a strong foundation for the future, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re building here. ","Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill ","So to try to interpret, it sounds to me like your competitive advantage, if you achieve your goals, will ultimately be a better loss ratio than most, and an expense ratio that\u2019s maybe in line with your peers. Is that kind of the idea, big picture, long term?","Peter Hancock ","I don\u2019t view either of these ratios as a source of competitive advantage. They are outcomes of what we do for our customers. So our competitive advantage comes by the expertise that we have and the risks that we take ourselves or help our customers to manage if they choose to retain them. ","And so the investments that we\u2019re making are to become true experts in the risk that we\u2019ve chosen to specialize in around the world and to use the relationships that we\u2019ve developed over decades with customers, both large, medium, and small, in the consumer and commercial space.  ","And so as a result of that, we\u2019re investing in what it takes to be experts, and that will lead to a higher expense ratio than was the case historically, but those historical expense ratios were also somewhat flattered by reinsurance strategies at large [seating] commissions, which we don\u2019t do on the same scale anymore.","The other thing is, as Bob says, when you restated accident year loss ratios, 1980 to 2003, which were way above industry averages, and we never want to return to those sorts of underwriting standards. So we\u2019re really sharpening up how we manage our risks so that we have a competitive combined ratio, as Bob says, and in a sustainable way, through the cycle. ","And so the other thing we\u2019re really focused on is a better tradeoff between profitability, growth, and risk, and we don\u2019t feel we are forced to grow top line in a soft market. So we want to get our fixed costs down, we\u2019re focused on the mix between fixed costs and variable costs, so that we have the ability to scale back volume in a soft market, so we manage the cycle better in the future.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein ","Question I think for Peter and John perhaps, one of the two. When I look at commercial business, and I do some adjustments for severe losses and I think normalizing for the higher expenses in the quarter from incentives and stuff, I get to something like an underlying accident year ex-cat combined in commercial of maybe as low as a 92, which looks like a very nice improvement from last year and a lot of progress in total.","And I\u2019m kind of curious, where are we going to get to on this number? When I look at peers, you can often see sort of high 80s ex-cat accident year combined ratio underlying numbers. And I think that\u2019s what you would need to get to your low 90s all in calendar year target. Is that a realistic end goal for this story?","John Doyle","We expect to continue to see, in 2014, accident year loss ratio improvement again normalize. Peter talked a bit about the severe losses in the quarter. They were slightly elevated relative to our expectations for the full year, a bit better than expected in the first half of the year and higher than expected, so that contributed to a slightly higher 2013 accident year result than we expected. ","We talked about expenses. We do expect to see an improvement in the expense ratio over time, as Peter pointed out. We didn\u2019t mention shared service centers. We have some [unintelligible] work going on as we build out our shared services abilities in different parts of the world and in Europe and Asia and Colombia as well. So yes, we do expect to continue to see an improvement in the combined ratio results for commercial. ","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein ","If I can ask sort of a different question for Kevin. Welcome back to the company, I think we\u2019re all happy to have you hear. I want to talk about the consumer business. I know there\u2019s a lot of things going on, and we\u2019ve talked about Japan, but in aggregate, results have been flat and the past couple of quarters on the loss ratio side have been a bit of a disappointment. ","You referenced some things that you\u2019re doing more tactically, reunderwriting some of your pricing. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some color on some specifics and the magnitude of actions that you\u2019re taking to [drag] margins over the next year or two. ","Kevin Hogan","The reality is that AIG has done a terrific job in the commercial underwriting area in the last couple of years and are a little bit ahead of some of the disciplines that we\u2019re adopting in the consumer area, and the focus is on the large portfolios. ","So in Japan we have been taking rate on some of the large auto portfolios as well as the core A&H businesses. And in the United States as well, we\u2019re taking a hard look at the private [unintelligible] business state by state and have filed a number of rate adjustments in the homeowners and automobile businesses there.","We\u2019re also in the process of introducing similar tools [that reps can use in] commercial in terms of the global raters and focusing on rate adequacies in the various portfolios, including those that are the strategic business expansion areas, where we\u2019re introducing the appropriate technical skills from the get go in our [unintelligible] operations. ","So growth is an important aspect of the consumer business as we try to generate a customer insight driven business, but we are doing it with the appropriate underwriting discipline and that is a very important part of our [unintelligible] focus. ","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein ","A couple of times now we\u2019ve heard from management suggesting the actuaries are lagging in recognizing the underwriting results improvement from underwriting in claims. I\u2019m wondering, Charlie, if you could give us some color on how you\u2019re doing the analysis, and are you using the faster report methods? Or are you kind of looking at lagging methods like the [unintelligible] and expected loss ratio? How much more would you characterize of margin improvement has yet to actually work through [unintelligible]?","Charlie Shamieh ","I think Peter\u2019s comments earlier really relate to a lot of the investments, especially in the claims area. And we\u2019ve talked about, in worker\u2019s compensation. So one of the key difficulties that actuaries have is that settlement patterns are changing, paids and incurreds are changing. And we\u2019re getting much better case reserve information. And what Peter\u2019s talking about is it\u2019s very difficult sometimes to distinguish between that case reserve strengthening and what\u2019s really going on in the business. ","But we\u2019re certainly using a whole wide range of techniques that look forward and try to give appropriate credit for all the investments that the claims team is making in those initiatives. And I think with more track record on the page in incurreds, the confidence in that increases, and really that\u2019s what Peter\u2019s talking about, the statistical credibility that we give. One or two years of emergence would be better. ","And the only other statistic I\u2019d give you is that we\u2019ve reached today an inflection point where over the last two years, if you consider the reunderwriting of the casualty book, we now have just over 50% of our reserves are coming from the better underwriting that Peter and John talked about earlier. And so as that increases, I think you\u2019ll also see an actual improvement in future periods as the quality of the underwriting comes through and becomes a higher percentage of over reserves.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan ","First, a question for David. Maybe if you could just talk about where you are on your interest coverage ratio now, and what your aspiration is? And then second, for Peter, on the accident year loss ratio, maybe if you could discuss the reasons for the deterioration in the loss ratio this quarter. You mentioned 1 point because of the 2004 and pre-04 business, but even with that, it would have been worse than previously.","And then I\u2019m not sure if you quantified the benefit of the cost savings plan and the severance plan that you just announced, but if you could maybe just talk about how much you expect to save on that once it starts to fully reflect in your results this year or next year.","David Herzog","There are three things I\u2019d want to sort of leave you with respect to our debt capital management as it ties into our focus on coverage ratios. One is we did achieve the goals we had set out for 2013 vis-\u00e0-vis the coverage ratio and interest expense run rate savings. So again, we did it opportunistically and struck a balance of being able to allocate capital to share buyback, dividends, as well as share repurchase. So, again, point one, 2013 goals met. ","Secondly, with respect to the direct investment book and the liability management that Brian Schreiber and the team are overseeing, we funded that with cash that was allocated in the DIB very specifically for that purpose. So those proceeds, or the funds we used for that, had no effect, essentially, on cash or capital we have available for share buyback or other forms of equity capital management. ","And again, we\u2019ll continue to look to optimize the value of the direct investment book over time. And as I said, 80% of it\u2019s gone at the end of 2018. If we can accelerate that without sacrificing guidance, we certainly will. ","And thirdly, then, the point being we continue to generate deployable capital, again 5 to 6, plus the tax sharing payments. I would look for us to continue to, very opportunistically, focus on debt capital management as it presents itself. I think I would expect we would continue to make progress on our coverage ratio, primarily through earnings improvements, but also from time to time we will look at capital management, debt buybacks, etc., as they present themselves.","So really, as Bob said, we\u2019re focused on our ratings, and we\u2019ll strike an appropriate balance. We haven\u2019t set any specific targets for 2014. I think, again, we\u2019re in a pretty solid place based on what we did in 2013.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan ","But it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re done reducing your debt, maybe not as much as before, but you still expect to reduce debt a little bit?","David Herzog ","I think we\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic in how we think about it. So I wouldn\u2019t give you any specific targets of what we will do or won\u2019t do, but again, we\u2019ll be opportunistic. We want to focus on continued improvement in the coverage ratio. And I think we can do that primarily through earnings, but we\u2019ll look at other ways to approach that. ","Peter Hancock ","I will just give you a quick answer on the timing of expense saves related to the severance, which is we really have not disclosed the precise savings that we expect in the calendar year 2014, because we want to be extremely thoughtful about the way we execute what is effectively around an organizational streamlining to better serve our customers, where we\u2019re not approaching this with a finite sort of deadline during the course of the year. We want to make absolutely sure that we execute this in a way that makes us better serve our customers. And so we\u2019re being quite thoughtful about the execution. ","So we have a broad range of ideas. I think it\u2019s sufficient to say that we think we will maintain an expense ratio that\u2019s fairly stable this year, but we\u2019re not disclosing precise numbers nor quarterly schedule of savings.","On the accident year loss ratio, as Bob says, this is a business that zigs and zags, and to understand which of those zigs and zags are noise and which ones are signal, you need to dig a little bit under the surface to normalize severe storms and so one quarter to quarter, and I think that\u2019s probably best done offline in a follow up discussion with James.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan ","Sure. And maybe if I could just ask one more quick question. On the AerCap stock, obviously it\u2019s gone up a lot in value. Have you thought about hedging your position, and are there any limitations on you doing that if you wanted to?","Bob Benmosche ","We\u2019re not going to talk about ILFC. Once it closes, we\u2019ll be glad to talk about what the options are, but let\u2019s get to closing, and then we\u2019ll know what we can talk about. ","Operator","Our last question today will come from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse ","Just a quick one for David. The $5 billion to $6 billion of annual dividends that you\u2019re expecting out of the insurance companies now, I guess the run rate had been $4 billion to $5 billion. So we should expect that for the next two years, from a visibility standpoint? Is that the goal? And then you would add on the DTA utilization on top of that? And so if those numbers are correct, the high end of that would be $8 billion by 2015? Is that the right math?","David Herzog ","I think I\u2019ll limit my remarks to 2014. That\u2019s the commentary that I want to share with you and the investment community, because that\u2019s the line of sight that we want to provide. As I said before, if we continue to generate deployable capital, we want to maintain first and foremost strong capital positions in our operating companies, and as they continue to generate capital, we\u2019ll give you as much insight into that as possible.","Again, I think the DTA payments, as I\u2019ve said, are roughly $1 billion in 2014 and $2 billion in 2015, and it will go from there. And so there will be a very substantial cash flow to the holding company. Again, the $4 billion to $5 billion is what we said back in 2011 when we reintroduced the company, and that\u2019s a very solid foundation, but again, we see opportunities to redeploy some capital that\u2019s above and beyond the levels we need to hold at those operating companies. And that\u2019s what we want to do, get it up to the holding company, so that it\u2019s most fungible at that level.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse ","And I was just a little confused about the $4 billion or so of dividends that were taken up in Q4 from the insurance companies. Can you just reconcile where the $4 billion went? Because if I look at holdco cash and investments, they were up by a small fraction of that. Where did the full $4 billion go?","David Herzog","Very fair question. One of the things we did was we improved the diversification of the capital in a couple of operating companies through some internal restructurings we did with the life settlement portfolio. So we accelerated some cash out of the opcos as we used that cash to improve the diversification of some of the capital. The punch line is it had no effect on the level of capital or cash we had available at the holding company for capital management or other general corporate purposes. So that\u2019s really where it went. So almost $2 billion of it went for that, so it was some internal improvements we made. ","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse ","And then one last one from me, for Kevin. Just on the comments on increasing rates in Japan A&H and auto, can you just comment on what\u2019s happening there? Because I just want to know, is this keeping pace with loss cost trends, because you obviously had cited travel and accident. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s specifically related to it, or should we expect the rate you\u2019re getting to actually improve margin?","Kevin Hogan ","","The actions that we\u2019re taking in Japan are really related to an overall portfolio review [unintelligible] fire and marine, relatively reducing acquisition. We\u2019ve taken an extensive review, and this is really a primary area where we have improved our selection parameters and rate. And we have seen an improvement in the overall profile of the results as a result. ","In terms of the A&H business, it\u2019s more of a reflection of responding to some changing trends in the underlying results in the marketplace, and I believe what we will see is an improved underwriting result as we go forward.","Liz Werner","Thank you, everyone for joining us this morning, and we\u2019ll certainly be happy to take all of your other follow up questions, and we\u2019re all here, so please feel free to reach out. Thank you. "," "],"2138":["American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) Q1 2017 Earnings Call May  4, 2017  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Elizabeth A.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over Ms. Liz Werner. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Elizabeth A.

Today's call, however, will not be addressing any questions related to that search process. The format for today's Q&A will be consistent with past calls, with one question and one follow-up.","At this time I'd like to introduce our speakers, who are also joined by other members of management in the room. Peter Hancock, our CEO, will begin today's remarks, followed by Sid Sankaran, CFO; Rob Schimek, CEO of Commercial; and Kevin Hogan, CEO of Consumer. With that, I'll turn it over to Peter.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. Today I will speak to our strong financial results and key accomplishments from the quarter, and our continued progress on the two-year strategy outlined in January 2016. The transformative actions we took over the last year were guided by our focus on building a sustainable business model and prioritizing intrinsic value by maintaining a disciplined balance between long-term growth, current profitability, and enterprise risk. This quarter shows that our actions are delivering results, and we see momentum across all our core businesses.","Let me begin by first recognizing a few notable accomplishments in the quarter. Our Japan team completed significant preparation for our legal entity merger. And on April 1, we began operating our P&C business on a consolidated basis under an FSA-approved pre-merger structure. We also closed on the sales of Fuji Life and certain insurance operations we sold to Fairfax. Our investments team efficiently monetized $10 billion of general account assets to fund the premium associated with our ADC transaction with Berkshire Hathaway, and I'm pleased that we received the permitted practice to record the ADC agreement in 2016 for statutory reporting purposes. Our London team completed its thorough Brexit analysis, and we announced our strategy to position us for a seamless transition in serving the European market. In each instance, execution was exceptional.","I'd also like to note that we achieved our two-year expense-reduction target of $1.4 billion three quarters ahead of schedule. While discipline around expense management remains a priority, we continue to invest in our infrastructure and our talent, with a focus on AIG's long-term future. AIG's talent base remains strong. Our employee retention rate is the same or better than it's been in the last four years, including for our top-performing employees and for those in key roles. We continue to attract top talent from other organizations, as we select from almost 800 applicants every day. We're also pleased that our client retention remains at its historical highs for major accounts.","In the first quarter, our core adjusted return on equity was 10.2%. Even after normalizing our results for strong investment returns and lower-than-expected catastrophes, our core normalized return on equity was 8.7%. We're on track to reach our full-year 9.5% target. We remain committed to improving the profitability and intrinsic value of our core insurance businesses, which we now present in much greater detail in our modular reporting, reflecting our focus on transparency and accountability.","We remain confident in our $25 billion capital return target, which implies an additional $7 billion in share repurchases and dividends for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we stated last quarter that the engagement of our rating agencies and regulators is critical to the successful transformation of AIG, and we will continue to work closely with them to serve all our stakeholders. Importantly, we believe the sustainability of our future earnings has improved meaningfully as a result of our previously announced agreement with Berkshire and the continued execution of our strategy. Sid will provide more insight on the economics and accounting associated with the ADC agreement, which will provide benefits for many years to come through a lower risk of impairments to book value, higher earnings quality, and ultimately, a lower cost of capital.","The first quarter highlighted progress towards our financial targets while maintaining focus on delivering value to our clients. Rob will speak to the important feedback we received from our Commercial clients at RIMS, and Kevin will provide an update on our diverse Consumer businesses that are a source of valuable earnings stability for AIG. I'm very proud of the work accomplished by our talented team of AIG colleagues. And with that, I'll now hand the call over to Sid Sankaran to discuss the financials.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll comment on our first quarter financial results, the impact of our adverse development cover, and capital return.","Turning to slide 4, we reported operating earning of $1.36 per share, driven by strong operating performance, favorable alternative investment return, and lower-than-expected CAT losses. The quarter included a previously disclosed $102 million charge for the Ogden discount rate, which was reported as prior-year adverse reserve development. This charge was partially offset by the $41 million amortization of our ADC net gain, and $35 million in favorable reserve development for our Property and Special Risks segment. Excluding Ogden and the amortization, there was no net reserve development of note in our long-tail Liability and Financial Lines. Strong alternative investment performance and favorable equity markets benefited our headline Commercial and Consumer result. Even taking into account these excess investment returns, prior-year development, and lower CATs, our normalized earnings were $1.15 per share.","Slide 5 presents the changes in our core normalized ROE year over year, which improved 120 basis points on an apples-to-apples basis. This comparison reflects the impact of the increase in Commercial insurance loss pick in the second half of 2016 that would've resulted in a 100 basis point ROE reduction had they been pushed back to January 1 of last year. There was also a 50 basis point benefit in the year-ago quarter from a favorable tax audit settlement. Our continued active capital management and operating improvements drove over 250 basis points of core ROE improvement year over year. Partially offsetting this improvement was the earnings impact of a decline in the size of our alternative investments portfolio and the sale of UGC, which reduced ROE by 110 basis points. These actions reduced our overall risk exposure, contributing to a lower cost of capital. Going forward, we believe the continued benefits of our capital return, expense reductions, and improved underwriting provide a path towards achieving our 9.5% core ROE target.","Slide 6 illustrates our continued discipline around operating expenses, which we have reduced 10% year over year in constant dollars and excluding divestitures. We also recorded an additional nonoperating pre-tax restructuring charge of $181 million in the quarter, which was primarily comprised of employee severance charges. While we have achieved our targeted $1.4 billion in expense reduction well ahead of schedule, we remain committed to further efficiency. Moving on to reserves, actual versus expected claim activity was favorable this quarter, and we are comfortable with current trend. In particular, we are encouraged by the quarter's better-than-expected claims trends for primary workers' comp and excess casualty. I'd also note that reserves covered by the ADC remain stable from year-end.","On slide 7 we provided the accounting for the ADC in the quarter and in the future. The amortization of the previously disclosed $2.6 billion gain will be part of our operating earning and will amount to approximately $60 million of quarterly favorable development. In the event of additional prior-year development, either favorable or adverse, on the covered reserves, 20% will be reported in operated earnings and 80% is reported below the line as an adjustment to the deferred gain, which is consistent with the economics of the ADC. The ADC provides an approximately $5 billion reduction in Commercial's economic capital. After considering last quarter's after-tax reserve charge, we anticipate capital of approximately $2 billion will be freed up over time. Later in the call, you'll hear from Rob as to how the ADC affected the ROE at the Liability and Financial Lines segment.","Our balance sheet and free cash flow remain very strong. And, as you can see on slide 8, current liquidity at quarter-end was $7.3 billion. During the quarter, we received $2.8 billion of distributions from our insurance company, which were largely related to $2.6 billion of tax payments from the life companies associated with the XXX\/AXXX life reinsurance agreement entered into at the end of the year. In April, we also received approximately $390 million of dividends from our Life Insurance company that had been declared during the first quarter.","In our legacy segment, we sold 460 life settlements contracts, representing approximately 14% of the remaining death benefit. These sales did not have a net impact on parent liquidity, as the proceeds were used to pay down the related intercompany loan. We ended the quarter with a carrying value on the remaining life settlements portfolio of $2.1 billion and a remaining loan balance of approximately $850 million following the completion of these sales.","Cumulative capital release and cash flow from legacy have exceeded our expectation. We are well on track to release an additional $1.9 billion of legacy capital to reach our two-year $9 billion target. We continued to execute against our capital return target and returned $3.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. From quarter-end through May 3, we repurchased an additional $1.1 billion of common shares, leaving about $3.8 billion unused under our remaining authorization. Note, this figure includes yesterday's additional $2.5 billion authorization. Through May 3 we have returned $18.1 billion to shareholders, towards our $25 billion target. We will continue to return capital to shareholders prudently and with appropriate quarterly consultation with rating agencies and regulators.","Looking to the full year, we expect dividends from our insurance subsidiaries to total $4.5 billion, inclusive of the dividends received thus far. We also expect tax sharing payments of approximately $3 billion, including the tax payments received during the first quarter. Tax payments are slightly below our original projections, reflecting a tax payment reconciliation to be made to the property casualty company related to the fourth quarter 2016 reserve strengthening. This shortfall has been offset by higher cash from dispositions and legacy.","Capital ratios in our insurance subsidiaries continued to be strong. The year-end 2016 RBC ratio for the fleet of U.S. life companies was 509%. Following the completion of the life reinsurance transaction, the ratio of the parent company, AGC Life, is a good representation of the regulatory capitalization of its life subsidiary. The year-end 2016 RBC ratio for domestic P&C companies was 411% after giving effect to the permitted practice of recording ADC at year-end.","Turning to slide 9, book value per share ex AOCI grew 2% during the quarter and was up 1% on an adjusted basis. We continue to expect improving core book value per share growth and greater book value stability given the ADC. But, as I've said before, we made trade-offs with respect to legacy in terms of recognizing immediate book value charges for future improvement in intrinsic value.","To sum up, we continue to execute on our strategy and expect to reach our 2017 financial targets. The modular reporting provides our businesses with transparency, and our business leaders are focused on managing for value and sustainable earnings growth, as evidenced by the ROE improvement across our modules. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity position, improving core earnings, and free cash flow profile distinguish us from others in our industry and leave us extremely well-positioned for the future.","Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter we continued to take significant actions to improve Commercial's underwriting performance. Today I will discuss our decisions to prioritize intrinsic value, our confidence in achieving our goals, and areas of focus for the remainder of the year.","Turning to slide 11, Commercial's normalized ROE increased from 6% for the full-year 2016 to 6.3% for the first quarter of 2017, reflecting improving performance in many of our businesses, expense management, and better investment returns. The improvement was partially offset by discrete tax items in Liability and Financial Lines, which increased Commercial's first quarter effective tax rate to 36%, compared to the 31% effective tax rate that we still expect for the full year. Commercial's ROE improvement does not yet include the full $5.1 billion capital benefit derived from the adverse development cover, which closed during the quarter. We are confident that second quarter normalized ROE will continue to improve, reflecting the reversal of the tax item over the remainder of the year and the capital benefit of the ADC for the entire quarter.","We've taken actions to reduce volatility in capital consumption in line with our emphasis on improving overall economic value for our stakeholders. Some examples of where we've prioritized value creation over improving the adjusted accident year loss ratio include the sale of Ascot, reduction of the attachment point for our property CAT program, and a more conservative loss pick for U.S. casualty. While value creation is our primary objective, we remain focused on delivering our adjusted accident year loss ratio target.","During the quarter, Commercial's adjusted accident-year combined ratio of 95.8% improved 1.8 points after adjusting the first quarter of 2016 for the increase in loss picks recorded in the second half of last year. We reduced net premiums written by 14% excluding foreign exchange and divestitures. 4% of the decline was related to the increased use of reinsurance and property. The remaining 10% of the decline was driven by the growing momentum of our underwriting strategy, particularly in Continental Europe, where approximately 45% of the business renews on January 1. Having completed a full year of our underwriting strategy, we expect our rate of change in premiums to moderate for the remainder of the year.","Moving to expenses, we delivered $283 million in savings over the prior-year quarter. The acquisition ratio benefited from the sale of Ascot, a high-commission business, and feed-in (18:38) commissions from reinsurers. Effective expense management has provided us with the confidence that our expense ratio will remain competitive, even as net premiums earned declined following our underwriting actions. While we've been disciplined in our spending, we have also prioritized the development of key infrastructure. Investment in our attractive and growing multinational business has delivered a comprehensive technology platform, improved client service levels in over 10,000 multinational programs, and the issuance of over 2,000 underlying policies at or prior to the inception date in 90 countries during this quarter alone.","Turning to slide 12, we focused on mix of business to improve our underwriting results, having reduced U.S. casualty net premiums from a peak of approximately $15 billion in 2004 to approximately $3 billion at year-end 2016. More recently, we've focused on improving risk selection at the policy level using increasingly sophisticated pricing tools. Our sector and risk selection strategies, coupled with more conservative U.S. casualty loss picks, have laid the foundation for sustainable future earnings.","Commercial's first quarter adjusted accident year loss ratio of 65.5% improved 1.2 points from the full-year 2016 and 2.2 points from the prior-year quarter after adjusting the first quarter of 2016 for the increase in loss picks. We continue to be focused on our 4.7 point adjusted accident year loss ratio improvement target on a fourth quarter 2017 exit run rate basis and expect approximately 3 of those points to be driven by business mix changes that have already been executed.","On slide 13, we've presented the dispersion chart that we established to provide a view of improvements in business mix over the course of our two-year strategy. I'll make three observations for you. First, the quality of our premiums written has continued to improve, which we saw for the full year in 2016 and now in the first quarter of 2017. Today, Grow and Maintain business represents 62% of the Commercial portfolio, with an adjusted accident year loss ratio of 55%. Second, the premiums we earned in 2016 were heavily influenced by the business we wrote in 2015, which preceded the inception of our two-year plan. For those lines where we actively reduced our 2016 volumes, such as U.S. casualty, 2015 premiums had an even more disproportionate effect on earnings. Third, over time, our higher quality 2016 and 2017 business will earn into our results, which we're confident will yield an improved adjusted accident year loss ratio.","Shifting to the bottom of the slide, in addition to improving the quality of the business we're writing, we've also reduced the CAT risk within the portfolio. Our average annual loss expectation for CAT declined by $200 million between 2015 and 2017, and we expect capital consumed related to CAT risk to decline by $600 million in 2017. That improvement is part of an ongoing effort to focus, not just on the adjusted accident year loss ratio, which excludes CAT, but on the overall economic result for AIG.","Notwithstanding the significant amount of change that we've implemented, we continue to be regarded as a leading underwriter and business partner for our clients. During the recent RIMS conference, we were recognized by our clients as the number one carrier in 12 out of 20 product lines in the 2017 National Underwriter Risk Manager Choice Awards, a strong recognition of our commitment to the market, partnership with our clients, and the underwriting talent of this organization.","Turning to slide 14, the Liability and Financial Lines normalized ROE of 7.7% includes 100 basis points of adverse impact from the discrete tax items that are expected to reverse over the remainder of the year, and does not yet include the full $5.1 billion capital benefit of the ADC. We're confident that second quarter normalized ROE will improve as a result of the reversal of the tax item and the full benefit of the ADC, providing a clearer view of the profitable Financial Lines business and the significant contribution of investment income to long-tail lines. The adjusted accident year loss ratio of 72.5% improved 0.8 points versus the full-year 2016, and 2.4 points versus the prior-year quarter, after adjusting the first quarter of 2016 for the increase in loss pick.","As just mentioned, quarterly claims trends were favorable in contrast to last year's adverse trends, particularly in primary workers' compensation and excess casualty. We experienced growth in profitable Financial Lines segments, including cyber, offset by targeted risk selection in U.S. casualty. We continued practicing pricing discipline in U.S. casualty, with the first quarter representing the sixth consecutive quarter of rate increases in excess of 3 points. Financial Lines rates were relatively flat in both the U.S. and globally.","Moving to slide 15, during our fourth quarter call, we outlined the actions to address the profitability challenges in Property and Special Risks. The first quarter normalized ROE of 3.5% continues to be below our target, but shows a meaningful improvement in performance that we expect will continue. First quarter CAT losses were better than our average annual loss expectation and prior year, reflecting our efforts to de-emphasize our U.S. excess and surplus lines business, as we've shifted toward less CAT prone international property and more highly engineered large-limit and middle-market risks","First quarter severe losses were at the lowest level in the past 15 quarters, reflecting the proactive decisions we've made to expand reinsurance, investments in engineering, and underwriting actions to address accounts with disproportionate amount of risk. We are pleased that the severe loss ratio declined from 5.7 points in the prior-year quarter to 2.5 points this quarter. While we do not expect severe loss activity to be consistent on a quarterly basis, we do believe loss experience will improve versus trends in recent years as a result of our efforts to mitigate volatility.","Turning to top line, Property and Special Risks net premium written declined 20% excluding foreign exchange and divestitures. Property reinsurance and underwriting discipline were the two primary drivers of the change, accounting for 9% and 11% of the decline, respectively. While U.S. property rate declines of approximately 2% moderated somewhat during the quarter, competition continued to be driven by the excess and surplus lines business. Our business mix strategy remains heavily focused on growth in our engineered large-limit and middle-market segments, and in our profitable specialty businesses, such as credit lines.","In closing, I'm pleased with the progress we've demonstrated improving the mix and underlying performance of the Commercial business during the first quarter. Our team is executing well, and I'm confident that we've taken significant actions that will continue to be reflected in our results over the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone.","As you can see on slide 17, Consumer produced strong results for the quarter. We earned over $1 billion in pre-tax operating income, and expanded normalized ROE to 10.9%. We continued to take actions in each of our modules and key geographic areas to create value.","In Individual Retirement, we faced a challenging sales environment due to DOL uncertainty and aggressive competition in certain product lines. We maintained our discipline and focused on value over volume. We are not dependent on any one product type, due to our top-tier market position across annuity lines.","For our Group Retirement business, VALIC, our investments to transform the plan sponsor and participant experience continued to pay off. We significantly improved our results in winning new group plans, increasing our premiums and deposits.","Our Life Insurance business continued to make progress executing our plan to enhance ROE. During 2016, we completed the introduction of a new administrative platform and digital capabilities, revamped our product suite, and substantially exited our U.S. life career distribution channel, service agent channel, and subscale group benefits business. Despite these exits and lower general operating expenses, we increased our quarter-over-quarter life sales.","In our Personal Insurance business, our results reflect sustained execution of strategic and portfolio actions to enhance returns and reduce total expenses. As we've narrowed our focus, we've increased our investments in markets and customer segments where we have a competitive advantage and favorable future prospects.","We further expanded our portfolio of unique partnership arrangements, and have continued to leverage Commercial's multinational platform and AIG's broad client relationships. For example, during the quarter we were selected by leading ride-share provider who was an existing Commercial client to provide coverage for their fleet in a major Asian country, over 11,000 vehicles and growing. In addition, we secured the global travel insurance and assistance program for one of the world's largest airlines, affirmation of our growing position as a market leader in this sector. We also continued to make progress transforming our business in Japan while producing strong operating results. We introduced pre-merger operations status on April 3, and we are preparing for the legal entity merger, which continues on track for January 1, 2018. On April 30, we also completed the sale of AIG Fuji Life modestly ahead of schedule, allowing us to focus on our strong P&C position.","Now I will briefly discuss the results for the quarter. Before covering the individual businesses, I would note that pre-tax operating income for each of the Consumer modules benefited from higher income from alternative investments.","Turning to Individual Retirement on slide 18, we saw lower sales and net flows from a year ago. In the face of industry sales challenges, we continued our disciplined approach with respect to product pricing, product features, and asset quality. Our policy fee income and spreads remain solid.","Turning to Group Retirement on page 19, deposits increased in the quarter but were offset by higher surrenders that resulted in overall declining net flows, including one March surrender related to healthcare consolidation. Despite disciplined rate management, base net investment spread declined year over year, primarily due to lower one-time prepayments on commercial mortgage loans. Looking forward, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we expect our net spreads across retirement will decline by approximately 1 to 3 basis points per quarter.","Let's now move to Life Insurance on slide 20. Premiums and deposits grew, and we increased sales in our U.S. \u2013 mortality experienced (30:21) was also well within pricing expectations.","Turning to slide 21, Personal Insurance's results highlight the actions taken to reduce expenses and refocus direct marketing activities. We are also seeing the benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets.","Relative to Japan, I would like to make two comments. First, ahead of our legal merger, the expense levels quarter to quarter will have some incremental variability. And, second, the profile of our book of business in Japan results in a relatively small equity base, which can lead to quarter-to-quarter volatility in ROE. We do not expect current ROE levels to continue. The increase in the Personal Insurance accident year loss ratio as adjusted includes a single severe loss this quarter versus no severe losses last year. We had slightly lower catastrophe losses this quarter, including in Japan, which notably had no catastrophe events, while the first quarter of 2016 reflected a favorable prior-year development. In Personal Insurance, we believe we have additional opportunities to improve underwriting results, although we do not expect progress to be linear quarter to quarter.","To close, I'm pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic priorities across all of our modules, and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan. Now, I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up to Q&A.","Elizabeth A. Werner - American International Group, Inc.","Trish, we'd like to open the line now to Q&A. Again, just one question and one follow-up, but please feel free to get back in queue so we can get as many questions as possible.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Thank you. We'll now take our first question, which comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead; your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. So first question I guess for Peter or Sid. Just considering you're reiterating your capital plan, can you give a little perspective on whether you think this is a point of negotiation or contention as it relates to ratings? In particular, A.M. Best. I assume by reiteration of the target that you don't think that's necessarily the big issue as it relates to maintaining that rating. Can you provide some perspective on that?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Well, I think the first point I would make, Tom, is that we've been very clear with respect to ratings that protecting the rating of the subsidiaries is the most important objective in protecting value. And as we disclosed in my prepared remarks, both our capital levels and holding company liquidity remain extremely strong when you look at us and look across to competitors. So our main message is we're going to continue to be prudent and return capital in consultation with regulators and rating agencies. But given the current balance sheet strength, we remain optimistic on resolving those rating outcomes over the course of the quarter.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, there was pretty favorable earnings in other operations, despite losing UGC. And the same question on legacy or the same issue on legacy; earnings came in fairly favorable. Can you just comment on the drivers of the earnings strength in those segments?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. So let's take them separately. When you think of the Other line item, you've got to think about a few different things. First, institutional markets. Secondly, you're going to think about our liquidity portfolio and our debt that remains unallocated in parent. (34:42) Third, general operating expenses. And then, fourth, dispositions from the core portfolio. So when you look at Other, you're always going to have a little bit of volatility from some of the items in the fourth bucket, which is the dispositions that, in some cases, may be in stock or other form. And of course also in the Other line item you see I think a trend from first quarter last year to first quarter this year on the expense reduction line.","Speaking of legacy, obviously there you have mark-to-market volatility that occurs every quarter. We had strong performance in fair value assets. We give you both the as-reported and normalized so that you can get a longer-term expectation on that one.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move to our next question, which comes from Larry Greenberg of Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you. And good morning. I guess this is for Rob. Rob, when you think about your underlying loss ratio objective for the year, where you are today perhaps relative to the beginning of the year, it seems like the Property and Special line \u2013 specialty line \u2013 made a bit more progress in the first quarter, at least than I would've thought. And maybe the Liability line a little bit less progress. Can you just comment on where we are today individually for those lines relative to where you might've been thinking a few months ago?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Larry, with respect to Liability and Financial Lines, following our fourth quarter reserve strengthening, we strengthened our loss pick significantly for U.S. casualty. And so I think we're making a trade-off all the time. While I want to improve my adjusted accident year loss ratio and achieve my target, my number one priority is to make sure that we're creating a sustainable and long-term view of the right place to book our U.S. casualty reserves. And so ultimately we've increased the loss pick in U.S. casualty significantly above and beyond where we would've been in 2015 and even more for 2016.","And so I think that's the primary message there. I will say we've made huge changes to mix of business there, and I continue to feel that we will continue to see the results out of Liability and Financial Lines that we expected. Ultimately, I think as a takeaway for you, you can expect that we've booked our U.S. casualty lost picks at a level approximately 15 points higher in 2017 than they were being booked in 2015, to give you an idea of the change that we've made.","With respect to Property and Special Risks, remember that in the Special Risks side of the equation, we have made some changes with respect to our programs business, and have made the decision late last year to exit a number of those programs. Those exits happened across the latter part of last year, and they'll benefit us throughout the course of 2017. But those exits did not happen until late in the year in 2016 and early in 2017.","On Property, we continue to think about all elements of our Property risk. We think about managing the attritional loss ratio, the severe loss ratio, and the level of property CAT that we're absorbing. And so I've tried to provide you on slide 13 a view of the improvements that we've made, not just in what we call our dispersion of our business across our portfolio, but also the improvements that we've made in our CAT losses, too.","And I think a lot of times people forget that I'm making trade-offs every day. I give up premium that would have benefit my attritional loss ratio in order to reduce the level of catastrophe losses. And my overall objective here, if we're simply trying to maximize the intrinsic value of the organization without making adjusted accident year loss ratios a singular focus of the team. With that said, I think we're still on track for our targeted improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great, thanks. And then just any more color you can provide on \u2013 you made some comments that primary comp and excess casualty loss trends were a little bit better. Any more color you could provide on that?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Well, as you would expect, we're very active in managing our view of reserves, looking at our actual versus expected. When you look at that in a lot of granularity, line of business by line of business, as much as possible, geography by geography. The challenge with it is we're really three months into the year, and so it's too early to make any assessment about what we think this means. But the main takeaway that I would give is that it gives us confidence that the level of reserves that we booked in 2016 appears to be resulting in a claims experience for 2017 that's absolutely within our expectations.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. So the only thing I'd add to Rob's comment is, as you know, when we concluded our DVR in the fourth quarter last year, we took strengthening in both those lines. And so from the data that's emerged both in this quarter and in the second half of the year, we feel they're coming in more favorable then, say, for excess casualty, a cautious view that we took in the fourth quarter on loss trends in very green (41:19) years. But as Rob said, we're reassured. We don't react to this. We monitor it very carefully. And we'll continue to provide you guys with transparency going forward each quarter.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move to our next question which comes from Meyer Shields of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Please go ahead, sir. Your line's open.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. A question for Rob, I guess. I'm looking at slide 13, and obviously I think the overall improvement is clear, but we are not seeing much improvement in set 2B and 3. And I was wondering if you could talk to that a little bit?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Meyer. The first thing I'd say is, we will never take the amount of premium, for example, in product set 3 down to zero. Just to give you an example, that's where a lot of our U.S. casualty business sits, and as you know, we've managed that mix of business down significantly, but we continue to be, and will continue to be, a strong provider of those types of products to our clients, when we think about a client relationship holistically. With that said, I think the real important part for you about what we'll do in product set 2B and 3, is really around individual risk selection here.","So that's where the improving sophistication of our pricing tools enable us to make differentiated decisions about which risks we're keeping in products sets 2B and 3. My overall objective would be, I would love to improve the loss ratio there, even if I'm not making significant change in how much business is there. I kind of like my mix of business today pretty much, but I'd love to continue to see improvement in the loss ratio. But we prudently book those loss ratios in those product set 2B and 3 accounts so that we're not creating an adverse development for future periods.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And Sid, can you talk about the timeline for recognizing the capital relief from the ADC?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Meyer. We haven't provided any guidance. I would expect it \u2013 as a base case assumption, I would expect it to emerge over time, over a long period of time. And obviously, as circumstances evolve and our conversations get farther, we'll update you further.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move to our next question, which comes from Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Gary K. Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning. This question is for Rob. I appreciate all the actions you're taking to improve the loss ratio, but I don't look at the 62% target as the final destination. At a CAT load expense ratio, maybe it's high 90%s. And you can correct me if I'm wrong on that, but it seems like there's more to be done, and given the lags in the actions you took in 2016 to improve 2017, my question is this: What are you doing now that can help perpetuate the loss ratio improvement beyond 2017?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, Gary, the first thing I'd say is that we're investing heavily, and have been investing heavily, in improving the underwriting tools for the organization. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks the increasing sophistication of our underwriting tools, and I'm quite proud of the progress that we're making in that space. I agree with you that our adjusted accident year loss ratio target is not our end destination. But I will tell you that we are really trying to think about this in the context of overall intrinsic value, and so we're making the trade-off of attritional loss ratio, year loss ratio, CAT loss ratio, but also managing how much capital we consume. And so I think all of those elements are really important for us.","I'll also mention to you that, under Peter's leadership, as you would expect, we've undertaken a lot of effort to continue to be focused on our strategy for what happens beyond 2017. And so in our 2018 through 2022 strategy, we have been working with an outside partner to help us continue to refine smarter, more effective, kind of more attractive ways to both serve our clients, but deliver a result that is a superior result for our stakeholders.","Gary K. Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Just a quick follow-up. Is there anything in the process so far that you've learned that has been more effective in generating improvement, or something that stands out as a bigger factor?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","You know, I would tell you that we absolutely have gained the confidence that we're able to make decisions on multi-line clients without jeopardizing the overall client relationship. We've found that our clients have been very loyal, that our brokers have provided us with excellent support, and that the relationship that we have is particularly effective. I will also say that one really important take-away for us is, we've been spending a lot of time on reinforcing the capabilities and the power of the link between underwriting claims and our actuarial function to make sure that we're getting the feedback loop to work as effectively as possible, as quickly as possible, that we're feeding those insights back into our underwriting actions, and hopefully making smarter decisions in the forefront, rather than having to deal with them later on, years later.","Gary K. Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Thank you, Rob. I appreciate the insights.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move to our next question, which comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Rob, you gave some details about severe loss and how you're mitigating that over time, but I still think $40 million is probably exceptionally low. Back maybe four years ago, you gave a little guidance that $150 million per quarter was probably, possibly normal. Could you expand upon that right now? Where are we? I'm sure you have a budget when you think about severe losses in the quarter.","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Josh, as I said in my prepared remarks, our level of severe losses is not going to be consistent quarter over quarter, so I agree that there will be variability in that number.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Like catastrophe. (48:24)","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","We've taken material steps, however, to reduce that severe loss volatility, including the fact that we buy reinsurance that's expressly targeting this level of volatility. And understand that when we buy that reinsurance, we're giving up premium that is actually causing our attritional loss ratio to go higher, because we're trading off. We're testing against the volatility of severe losses and accepting a somewhat higher level of attritional losses. So you have to make sure you include that in your equation. But the severe loss volatility is being improved through our use of reinsurance. We absolutely expect the trend in severe losses to continue to improve from the levels that we'd experienced prior to 2016.","Just to give you perspective, our four-quarter average in severe losses is now $84 million. And I think there's also another quick point to recognize, which is we define severe losses in a nonscientific way. We define them at a $10 million threshold, and so something could trip into severe losses or be in an attritional losses just by being a little bit higher or a little bit lower. So I don't want to overly draw a distinction to the difference between what we're doing in severe losses and attritional, but I really want to put an exclamation point on the observation that we're actively managing all levels of property risk, whether it's our attritional losses, our severe losses, the CAT losses, and ultimately our objective is to cover our cost of capital. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect to reduce our level of capital consumption in property by approximately $600 million in 2017, because we're also actively managing the level of catastrophe risk. And, again, we're paying premiums that would otherwise help our attritional loss ratio to improve that catastrophic loss result that we're getting.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, if you do decide to give a budget number, it would be helpful. And my second question is a quick follow-up. I guess the $450 million of 2016 charges you took in the fourth quarter, $200 million of it related to 1Q 2016. Can you tell us how much 4Q 2016 prior-period losses related to 2Q 2016 and 3Q 2016?","Elizabeth A. Werner - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, Josh, I think we're going to get back to you on that, but I appreciate the question. I think we have actually pretty long queue right now, and I kind of want to get through as many as possible, but we will call you right back after the call.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question, which comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead; your line is open.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Given the pending employment of a new CEO, I was hoping the executives on the call could give us a sense if there's any change in the way you're going about approaching your targets for this year and beyond?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Well, thanks for the question, Jay. As you can imagine, we don't comment on hypotheticals, and our team is focused on executing against our plan. I think what I can tell you is our management team and our board are aligned on the strategic objectives that we're outlining and executing on this quarter. If you just look at the progress and the metrics you see this quarter and through the call, $5 billion of capital return, exceeding our $1.4 billion expense reduction target three quarters early, module PTOI going up across the board, and a path towards our 9.5% core ROE target. So I would say collectively we're pleased, and we're looking forward to updating you further in the next quarter on this.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. And then on a separate issue for Rob, based on the new disclosures, it looks like Europe is a pretty significant profitability challenge. Any sense of when that \u2013 or if \u2013 it could improve?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Jay, as I mentioned, one thing about Europe is the January 1 renewal date is a particularly important renewal date in Europe. So obviously we made significant improvements there, but you won't see those in the first quarter; you'll see them throughout the rest of the year. The second point I'll make is that Europe is where we recorded the Ogden change in the discount rate, and so there was a $100 million, approximately, number coming out of the Ogden discount rate. I think those two items.","And then I guess I'll also observe this is a big part of the way Peter has instilled our way of thinking about intrinsic value, is that we surely operate in a different interest rate environment in Europe than we do in the United States, in some places with negative interest rates. And so therefore our view on cost of capital in Europe is also somewhat different than our view of cost of capital in the U.S.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I appreciate that. And, Peter, just wanted to mention, we really appreciate all your hard work and wish you well in your future endeavors.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question, which comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning. First question (54:17) for Rob is you mentioned that 3 points of the loss prevention improvement have already been implemented in 2016. Why they haven't (54:24) shown up in the other 2.2 [point] improvement in the first quarter? And what additional work have you done to complete the 4.7 [points] by year-end, the point improvements?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Kai, remember that we've described our 4.7 point improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio as a exit run rate. That's because we acknowledge that we may have been able to take the action in 2016, for example, but the only thing we can't do is hurry up and earn those actions. And so therefore there are actions that we took at the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017 for which, as the year goes on, the degree of improvement that's reflected in our earnings will continue to increase. So we continue to have confidence that the changes that we've made in particular in mix of business will drive the 3 points, as I described in my prepared remarks.","With respect to the remaining 1.7 points of improvement, it's a variety of factors. It includes our underwriting actions that we do, we're using our improved underwriting risk selection tools for. It includes growth in some of the parts of the business where we're continuing to have excellent success, including for example our multinational businesses, our highly engineered property business, or our Financial Lines business. And it also includes the fact that there are simply underwriting actions that need to be taken across the portfolio, that as we go through the remainder of 2017 we'll have the opportunity to revisit anything that we were not able to get to in 2016, simply because of the timing of our announcement of our two-year plan.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. The follow-up is on the expense side. You already achieved your $1.4 billion run rate, and in the first quarter you took another $180 million service charge. Will that provide sort of additional upside to the expense that you've targeted? Or, from a different angle, do you need more expense savings to just offset the declining in the Commercial premiums to keep the expense ratio flat?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, Kai. It's Sid. Just two responses. Yes, of course, that restructuring charge, which is AIG-wide, will provide future offset in our run rate expense. And I think you can go back and look at our total restructuring charges and look at our run rate and see that we have a pretty good track record of getting the expense out. Secondly, with respect to Commercial, certainly a portion of that restructuring charge applies to Commercial. And, yes, we are focused on further efficiencies in Commercial to ensure that that expense ratio stays roughly flat while we've reduced the top line in alignment with our strategy.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Elizabeth A. Werner - American International Group, Inc.","Trish, we're going to take just one more question. There's a number of earnings calls today, and we want to be mindful of those other calls. So we'll take our last question, and hopefully quick follow-up so we can wrap up today's call.","Operator","(57:45) That's no problem. We will take our final question now, which comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Saving the best for last. Thank you. Just a math question probably for Sid. Sid, can you talk about maybe the timing of the buybacks in the first quarter? It just felt as if the average share count should've been lower if the buybacks had been done over the course of the quarter.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. Jay, I appreciate the question. We obviously don't comment on the details of our share repurchase program or timing. But I think I would always encourage you \u2013 we obviously have a long track record of capital return \u2013 look at it over a long time period, many years. And I think you'll always see there's going to be volatility quarter to quarter. But we won't comment beyond that.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks.","Elizabeth A. Werner - American International Group, Inc.","Great. Thank you, everyone. We appreciate you joining this morning, and please reach out, and we will follow up with you to finish all these outstanding questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Liz Werner","Good morning. And before we get started this morning, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes and circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. Actual performance and events may differ possibly materially from such forward-looking statements.","Factors that could cause this include the factors described in our first quarter 2019 Form 10-Q to be filed in our 2018 Form 10-K under Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations, and under Risk Factors. AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Today\u2019s presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in the slides for today\u2019s presentation and in our financial supplement, which are available on our website.","This morning, we ask again that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We're joined in a room today by members of senior management, including Brian Duperreault; President and CEO; Mark Lyons, CFO; Peter Zaffino, COO and CEO of General Insurance; and Kevin Hogan, CEO of Life and Retirement.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter results reflect the significant foundational work we've been undertaking since late 2017 and that described to you in detail on our last earnings call in February. I\u2019m pleased with our progress to date and remain confident, and will continue through the remainder of the year.","Today we will provide additional detail on our financial results as well as progress we're making on a number of fronts in our General Insurance, Life and Retirement and Legacy segments. We're changing our usual line. So after my opening marks, I will be followed by Peter Zaffino, then Kevin Hogan. And Mark Lyons will close our prepared comments before we move to Q&A.","In the first quarter, we achieved an adjusted after-tax EPS was $1 58 compared to $1.4 in the first quarter of last year. This reflects significant improvement in the core operations of General Insurance in addition to increase investment income due to the rebound and equity markets. Mark will provide more detail regarding the positive impact investment income had across our businesses, which represent $0.32 of our EPS improvement year-over-year.","In the first quarter, General Insurance achieved an underwriting profit of $179 million in a calendar year combined ratio of 97.4. First quarter accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 96.1. This quarter's underwriting profit represents a significant milestone for AIG, and reflects the tremendous work undertaken by Peter and his leadership team over the last 18 months to radically improve underwriting fundamentals. Overall our approach to reinsurance dramatically reduce risk and volatility, onboard acquisitions and then still continuous expense discipline across General Insurance. We remain confident that GI will continue to improve its financial performance and deliver and underwriting profit for the full year 2019 as already evidenced by our first quarter results.","I'd like to comment briefly on AAL. As you know, over the last few quarters, as I have been reluctant to talk about AAL because of the significant changes taking place in General Insurance and because our historical disclosure was not in line with our peers. I did say it previously that you should assume AAL will be going down, indeed, it has. Our estimated 2019 AAL was 3.5. The number I'm not too focused on as it will continue to change as our General Insurance strategy evolves and matures and because we view catastrophe management as a balance sheet topic as opposed to P&L.","As a result of the strategic actions we are taking, AIG is again recognized as a leader in the insurance market. Many of us attended RIMS [ph] last week, and we're gratified to the level of engagement and support we've received from our clients and distribution partners.","The marketplace has taken note of our delivery broad based actions to recalibrate our book and aggressively reduce limits, risk and volatility. It is noteworthy that we are seeing corresponding improvements in almost every area, including retail, E&S, reinsurance. And these improvements are not just occurring in the United States, but also in a number of other countries. Peter will discuss this in more detail in his remarks.","I also want to briefly comment on the recent news about changes at Lloyd's. In my view Lloyd's is taking actions that are necessary for us to regain its preeminent position in the industry. Our acquisition of VALIDUS was driven in part by because of Talbot, a Lloyd's platform. So we are pleased to see Lloyd's embarking on plan to restore its position in the marketplace.","Turning to Life and Retirement. This segment delivered another solid quarter with adjusted pre-tax income of $924 million and an adjusted ROE of 15%. We are reconfirming our guidance for L&R for the full year and continue to expect the low to mid-teens adjusted ROE. Kevin will provide more detail on L&R's first quarter in his remarks, including the impacts of the rebound in the equity markets.","With respect to our Legacy segment, we continue to make progress on our plan to deconsolidate and fully separate this business, while ensuring to meet our commitments to our policyholders and regulators.","As you saw in our press release for consolidated AIG, we continue to expect to achieve a double-digit adjusted return on equity within three years. Our first quarter results demonstrate that our world-class team continues to make progress and our journey to restore AIG as a leading insurance company in the world.","With that, I will turn it over to Peter to expand on General Insurance.","Peter Zaffino","Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Today I will share high level financial information for General Insurance. I will explain on Brian comments and highlight some of our accomplishments in the quarter, including notable financial progress that\u2019s being realized its result for our underwriting strategy and the overall repositioning of our business. I will provide insight on our revolving reinsurance program, which had substantially reduced and accelerated volatility containment.","And lastly, I will provide market observations based on our experience in the first quarter and make some brief comments as we look ahead to the rest of 2019.","As Brian noted since the beginning of 2018, we've been undertaking significant foundational work in General Insurance around organizational structure, talent recruitment and improving underwriting capabilities, while at the same time rapidly evolving or reinsurance program and exercising expense discipline. As a result, in the first quarter of 2019, we achieved an accident year combine ratio; including actual CATs of 98.8% or 96.1% as adjusted. The calendar year combined ratio was 97.4%. The accident year loss ratio, excluding cash for the quarter, was 61.8%, a 130 basis point improvement year-over-year, and a 210 basis points sequential improvement from fourth quarter 2018. In the first quarter, we experienced CAT losses of $175 million, which were lower than a year ago.","The first quarter expense ratio of 34.3% represents a 230-basis-point improvement year-over-year and a 60-basis-point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2018. The general operating expense ratio was 12.5% for the first quarter in line with the fourth quarter of 2018 and 240 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2018. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating expense is declined by approximately 18% year-over-year. These reductions were achieved while we remain committed to making investment in talent, business process and infrastructure to support our long-term profitable growth objectives. The acquisition ratio of 21.8% in the first quarter was in line with the prior year quarter and the fourth quarter of 2018, and in line with our expectations given our current mix of business.","In addition to improved underwriting results, net investment income was favorable this quarter coming in at $1.1 billion, bringing General Insurance's pre-tax operating income to $1.3 billion. Mark will provide more details on the General Insurance financial results in his prepared remarks. As we stated over the last few quarters, we delivered improvement, particularly in our commercial businesses, our primary area of focus was to create a framework that clearly defines the segments of business that we wanted to underwrite, while leveraging the sustained value believe AIG delivers in the insurance market. This framework enabled us to develop cohesive risk appetite and the pivot to becoming a valued added partner to our brokers and clients based on our expertise not just our capacity. While it may sounds simple and perhaps even repetitive, this was our major initiative in 2018, and when coupled with the strengthening of our core underwriting fundamentals, the changing mix of our business, the addition of Validus and Glatfelter, and the improvement we have driven in race, we were able to craft and dramatically improve comprehensive and strategic reinsurance program for 2019.","We remain committed to our journey of continuous improvement across General Insurance and are executing on changes to core businesses to shift our overall portfolio composition. Some highlights of actions we are taking that are driving improved operating and financial results include the following. In Lexington, for both property and casualty, we've narrowed our risk appetite and are focused on smaller and mid-market insurers and are committed to the wholesale distribution channel. We're also taking an aggressive action on our renewal portfolio to align with our new risk appetite, while exiting underperforming risks. As a result, we see momentum in both property and cash. Property submissions are up over 20% year-over-year, and we are achieving low to mid-teens rate improvement on the portfolio.","In our casualty business, our submission account is up over 20% year-over-year, as the marketplace has responded positively to our more tailored distribution strategy enabling us to identify opportunities for profitable new business growth. In our casualty portfolio, we're achieving low teens rate improvement. Overall, we're very seasoned to pace of the repositioning of our Lexington portfolio.","In financial line, as I mentioned on last quarter's call, we've been focused on reducing growth primary limits, and we remained very committed to the point capacity for lead layers, while obtaining better balance by participating in excess layers.","We also have been discipline on rate. For example, we've achieved in the primary corporate DNO over 20% rate and primary private DNO over 15% and an excess DNO over 10%.","In our North American book across primary U.S. DNO segments, aggregate limits were reduced by approximately 20% in the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. And we also significantly reduced our policies above $10 million in lead layers by almost 35%. The impact of our disciplined approach to risk selection pricing is also reflected in our UK financial lines book where our total limits across all layers for public DNO decreased nearly 35% year-over-year. Yet our repeat premium was only down slightly despite our underwriting actions.","In North American property, we continue to take aggressive actions to improve our portfolio. Our total gross limits in the first quarter declined 49% compared with the first quarter 2018. Our average gross limit for risk management accounts declined 14%, our average deductible increased 25%; and we've been able to achieve high single-digit rate increases on our enforced portfolio.","In addition to these portfolio actions, the acquisitions of Validus & Glatfelter directly aligned with our objective to improve our core business and diversify our portfolio. Both companies have delivered on their strong reputation for underwriting excellence in track record of generating underwriting process.","On our year-end 2018 earnings call, we provided considerable detail on the substantial enhancement we're making to our reinsurance program. I do not intend to repeat that information today. However, I do want to stress that reinsurance continues to play a critical role in our overall strategy I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished.","Together with the substantial improvement for making sure our underwriting approach and capabilities, our reinsurance program is contributing to our reduced risk profile and helping us to reshape the better balance of our portfolio. The relationship we're building with reinsurers and the support we have received as we overhaul our reinsurance program is clear and strong industry endorsement of the work we're undertaking to improve our core business. We'll continue to refine and enhance our reinsurance program as our portfolio improves.","Let me briefly comment on rate. As I mention when I highlighted our progress in some businesses, we're seeing broad based market support for premium rate increases across multiple lines at\/or better than our lost cost trends, which mark will discuss in more detail. At a high level, we obtained rate increases of around 4% in our commercial portfolio, including over 4% in North American commercial lines, excluding Validus & Glatfelter and almost 6% in UK and 3% in Europe. While rates remains an important area focus for us, we continue to believe that discipline methodical risk selection coupled with the focus on terms and conditions will be the primary drivers of sustained improved financial performance and profitability.","Turning to our reinsurance business, Validus Re had a very strong start to the year. In the first quarter, we did see market loss increases for piping Jebi and other 2018 events. Despite these increases, Validus Re did not have any net adverse development in the quarter due to reinsurance treaty that absorb these loses. Instead Validus Re produced a $16 million favorable loss development in the first quarter. Year-over-year net premiums earned increased approximately 20% as we successfully executed on growth initiatives and diversified non-CAT classes.","We're also seeing increased evidence of prices discipline. Ceded commissions are broadly flat to slightly down, and on excess of loss placements, pricing is generally flat to modestly up. While not part of our first quarter results, I do want to briefly comment on the April 1 Japanese renewals and the Florida's June 1 results. For Japan, rate increases range from 15% to 25% on loss impacted CAT layers, layers that were not impacted by catastrophes were priced flat of 6%. We chose not to increase our Japan exposure during this renewal season.","Shifting to Florida the property reinsurance had meaningfully underperformed over the last two years, and we believe that we will undergo a meaningful price pressure at June 1. This is driven by loss activity in 2017 and 18, and the need to modify lost cost to account for both increased frequency and severity.","Before closing, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the efforts of the General Increase leadership team and all of our colleagues around the world. I\u2019m extremely proud of their hard work and accomplishments to date. Our improved results are in due and large parts achieved tireless efforts coupled with their incredible focus, dedication and courage to make material changes and difficult choices all which have positioned us well for the remainder of 2019.","Looking ahead, we will continue to evolve our underwriting capabilities, streamline our operations, maintain expense control and invest in people and strategy that will enable us to further strengthen relationships with our clients and distribution partners. While there is still much work ahead of us, we remain laser-focused on our longer-term goal of achieving underwriting excellence and sustained profitability. Our momentum is profitable and we will continue our disciplined approach to decision making as we work to restore AIG as an industry leader.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Hogan","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Life and Retirement recorded adjusted pretax income of $924 million for the quarter and adjusted return on equity of 15%. Adjusted pretax income increased by $32 million from the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of this increase were capital market-driven impacting acquisition costs through lower deferred acquisition cost amortization of $46 million due to rising equity markets in the quarter resulting in increased expected future fee income, and net investment income reflecting both higher returns on fair value option securities of $46 million, driven by tightening credit spreads and higher efficient income of $26 million reflecting interest rate declining in the quarter.","Our earnings also benefited from non recurring expense items and reserve refinements in our international life business of approximately $25 million. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower returns from alternative investments, and lower fee and advisory income due to lower asset levels during the quarter, driven by the market downturn at the end of last year. Prior year comparison also reflects a onetime bond payment recovery in the first quarter of 2018.","Our full year expectations for adjusted pre-tax income as well as our market assumptions have not changed. There could be some upside to our full year outlook should market conditions hold or improve. Keep in mind the declining equity markets and widening of credit spreads would accelerate deferred acquisition cost amortization and lower net investment income on fair value option securities, respectively.","In addition, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, our current expectation is that base net spreads will define by approximately zero to two basis points per quarter at least through the end of this year.","From a statutory perspective, we expect to generate solid earnings and for our strong year risk based capital levels to improve over year end 2018. Our team continues to do an outstanding job leveraging our broad product expertise and diversified distribution network to meet the evolving needs of our customers. In fact, LIMRA recently published 2018 results and we were ranked as the number one provider in total annuity sales reflecting our capabilities and balance across annuity lines. This is the first time we have held this position since 2007. Although we are pleased with the results, I want to stress that our strategy is not about market share, but instead to be in a position to compete at scale in each of our businesses.","Our strong top line growth in the first quarter reflects the execution of our ongoing strategy. With favorable pricing conditions during the quarter, we significantly grew fix and index annuity sales. We also increased group retirement deposits through international life sales and close to large pension risk transfer transaction in the quarter.","The pension risk transfer deal, which we recently announced, represented approximately $750 million of pension obligations. As with all such transactions, earnings will emerge over time, and the earnings impact during the first quarter was immaterial. We remain well positioned across our businesses to serve a growing market, enabling us to continue to deploy capital at or above our targeted economic returns, while recognizing we will incur some additional new business expenses associated with such growth.","I will now talk briefly about the results for each of the businesses. For individual retirement, premiums and deposits grew by 30%. With these strong sales levels, we achieved positive net flows for the first time since the third quarter of 2016. Net flows for retail mutual funds continued to be challenged. Retail mutual funds, which is a comparatively small part of our earnings, is a defensively position portfolio that is countercyclical to our individual annuities and may continue to face headwinds in the current environment.","Assets under management and related fee income decreased, driven by lower asset levels following the equity markets decline in the fourth quarter. Net investment income increased, primarily due to the market driven factors mentioned earlier.","For group retirement, premiums and deposits grew by approximately 11% for the quarter with higher group acquisitions, in plan annuity contributions and individual product sales. Surrenders and other withdrawals increased, primarily driven by the loss of one large group due to the planned sponsor reducing the number of providers offered in its plan and higher individual surrenders and other withdrawals. We expect higher surrenders and other withdrawals to continue to negatively impact net flows, but it is important to note that the financial impact of outflows will vary based on product characteristics. For example, the impact will be lower if the outflow is from a higher guaranteed minimum interest rate annuity policy or from a lower-margin group mutual fund offering. Despite facing negative net flows for a period of time, we've continued to produce solid earnings for this business and assets under administration were at the same level as the first quarter of 2018.","After adjusting for accretion income and unusual items new money rates are still below portfolio yields across our retirement portfolios resulting in reduced, but still attract spreads in many products. Also on a rising rate environment, it may be appropriate to us to increase crediting rates for certain of our in-force business. For our Life Insurance business, total premiums and deposits and sales increased for the quarter, driven by strong sales growth in our UK individual protection product line as well as the addition of group protection sales with the acquisition of Ellipse.","Our U.S life sales declined as we deemphasize guaranteed universal life sales in the current interest rate environment. For our U.S. life business, we continued to make progress or making the necessary infrastructure changes to completely separate our operating model from Fortitude Re and to pursue possible transactions that will lead to deconsolidation in the future. Adjusted pretax income increased due to overall mortality experience, which was within pricing expectations, positive reserve and insurance requirements and lower operating expenses and commissions.","Lastly, the Institutional Markets, as I mentioned earlier, we executed a large pension risk transfers transaction in the quarter at attractive economics, statutory and accounting returns. The market pipeline for pension risk transfer transactions over the next 12 to18 months continues to be robust. We also executed a GIC issuance of $250 million in the quarter. Overall, our Institutional Markets business continues to be well positioned to capitalize on available growth across its product lines, while remaining focused on achieving targeted returns.","To close, we remain committed to our ongoing strategy to leverage our broad product expertise and distribution footprint and deploy capital to the most attractive opportunities, which we believe positions us well to help meet growing needs for protection, retirement savings and lifetime income solutions.","Now, I will turn it over to Mark.","Mark Lyons","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning all. So getting right into it, AIG's adjusted after-tax earnings per share was $1.58 for the quarter compared to $1.4 for per share in the corresponding quarter of 2018. In dollar terms, AIG has $1.85 billion of adjusted pretax income and $1.39 billion of adjusted after-tax income. Book value per share, excluding AOCI and DTA, increased $0.52 per share or nearly 1% as compared to fourth quarter of 2018. As respect to adjusted return on common equity, or ROCE, which also exclude AOCI and DTA, AIG returned an annualized 11.6% for the quarter and the segments achieved the following returns and attributed equity. General Insurance achieved a 14%, Life and Retirement a 15% return, Legacy had 4.4% annualized return.","AIG is now using the term return on common equity, because this quarter we introduced some preferred into our capital structure. As respect net investment income or NII, it should be noted that due to the markets rebounding from fourth quarter 2018 performance, this quarter had outside gains, the likes of which should not be viewed as recurrent across the next three quarters in 2019. As a result, I will begin my comments about NII across the company, so I don't need to do so with any segment.","Net investment income for the first quarter was $3.72 billion on an adjusted pre-tax income basis, and $3.88 billion on a GAAP basis compared to $2.81 million and $2.75 billion respectively in the sequential fourth quarter of 2018. This material improvement was predominantly due the improving equity markets; tighter credit spreads and improved alternative investment performance, but was also partially due to changes in accounting presentation by AIG, affected in the quarter in two ways.","Firstly, AIG now recognizes changes in the fair value of equity securities below the line, which is much more consistent with the vast majority of our peers. The impact of this geography change for the quarter was a reduction in net investment income of $79 million. Secondly, we re-class NII that has heretofore been recorded in the other income line of non insurance subsidiary into the official net investment income line. The impact of this change was $116 million increase to the NII line this quarter. And it is hope that this reclassification and now removes a consistent source of confusion amongst the investor and analyst communities. It's important to note that this reclassification did not alter adjusted pre-tax earnings at all, simply geography. And I also want to point you to the Pages 12 and 13 in the financial supplement to see the historical quarterly impact of these two reclassifications.","When assessing AIG's investment portfolio volatility and result and NII, we believe it's helpful to provide a summarized view somewhat again to the way our Chief Investment Officer thinks about the portfolio. If you look at the portfolio as two broad asset classes, assets that are inherently fairly predictable, and those that are inherently fairly volatile. The fairly predictable class is comprised and available for sales fixed maturity securities, mortgages and other loans, and short-term investments, which totaled about $293 billion carrying value of assets or approximately 91% of the portfolio. The other $29 billion of carrying value assets are fairly volatile and are comprised the fair value option securities, hedge funds, private equity, real estate, and miscellaneous other investments. The fairly predictable assets provide about $12.5 billion of gross NII on an annual basis or about a 4.25% yield, whereas the fairly volatile assets have yielded NII of approximately 5.8% over the last five quarters or what you can see in this financial supplement ranging from about 2% to over 9%. Therefore, just using the last five quarters as a simple volatility measure, the NII from the fairly volatile assets could range from nearly $600 million to $2.6 billion annually.","One must also reflect that there are annual investment expenses of roughly $450 million that must be netted against that. The volatility shown in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 implies that an overreaction to the fourth quarter's lower net investment income wasn't warranted and neither is overreaction to the higher net investment income this quarter. It's nearly impossible to accurately forecast market performance over the balance of the year, and the simple framework we just provided shows the difficulty in predicting short-term market performance. It's also important to recall that in the fourth quarter, due to materiality, we recorded an $86 million pretax hedge to income associated with hedge funds and Japanese equity mark usually recorded on a one month lag. For the first quarter of 2019 forward we are now recognizing hedge funds without any lag at all. So the first quarter did indeed reflect a full three months of results and therefore all current and future hedge fund commentary will center on that quarter's activities rather than containing one month of the prior quarter.","The only remaining lags investment recognition is for private equity holdings, which has a full one quarter lag. Nevertheless the fourth quarter lag results book entirely in AIG's first quarter contributed positive net investment income, highlighting AIG's positive selection benefit versus any broad applicable market index.","Turning to General Insurance and as previously noted, the segment produced both the calendar quarter and accident quarter underwriting profit with an actual CAT ratio of 2.7% this first quarter versus 5.7% in the first quarter of 2018. The North America segment of general insurance produced a 98% accident quarter, excluding CATs combined ratio within North America commercial lines component producing a 96.4% accident quarter ex-CATs, which represents a 10.7 combined ratio point improvement over the first quarter of 2018. Although 1.8 points of this was due to expense ratio improvement, the 8.9 point of accident total loss ratio improvement can be largely attributed with the gross underwriting changes beginning to earn in along with the material reinsurance protection that Peter highlighted. The North American personalized operation worsened this quarter, primarily due to increased frequency in attritional loss ratio. The international segment of General Insurance produced a 94.5% accident quarter combine ratio ex-CATs versus 96.8 comparable ratios in the first quarter of 2018, both the commercial and the personalized segments contributed improvement predominantly on the expense ratio side.","Looking at the quarter from an AAL prospective, the 2019 full year AAL is estimated to be 3.5%. And as Brian noted in his remarks, the combination of gross underwriting changes, most notably, the reduction in gross fire and associated parallel limits, along with purposeful reductions in exposures, was complimented while radically alter reinsurance program that provides critical and non critical CAT protection within many of the part restructures along with the CAT program that provides material vertical and horizontal, regional and global protection, which is also further enhance the specific carve out CAT programs for applying private client within United States.","The combination of this front and backend actions has provided material volatility containment at all upper return period levels leading to a reduced AAL. My view of the first quarter's action year results is therefore a 99.6% combined ratio inclusive of AAL, and the 98.8% actual combined ratio inclusive of actual CATs. As a result, we will be speaking of CATs in the future only in terms of risk tolerance along with our measurement against that tolerance by various return periods and not focusing on AAL.","Now shifting to the business mix in General Insurance. The overall quarter-over-quarter net written premium reduced by 2.3%, but some areas have large swings goes up and down that can be seen in the financial supplement. However at a high level and excluding the impact of Validus and Glatfelter and adjusting for the Fuji two month lag elimination in the first quarter of 2018, net written premiums decreased approximately 78% after additionally adjusting for foreign exchange. Approximately one third of this 17% reduction is associated with direct under writing action and about two thirds could be attributed to increase reinsurance premiums. We respect the general operating expenses for GOE, the reduction was $237 million quarter-over-quarter but adjusting for Validus and Glatfelter since neither was part of AIG in the first quarter of 2018. This represents, as Peter noted, a 240-basis-point improvement in the GOE ratio quarter-over-quarter. As we stated on previous calls, in General Insurance and across the company more broadly, we continued to undertake a comprehensive review of workflows and process improvement opportunities as well as overall expense levels.","Turning to prior year development, the quarter saw $74 million of net favorable development, the 72 of this favorable development stemming from General Insurance, and $2 million favorable from the Legacy operations. There were no reserve deep dives into any specific lines of business this quarter, but the actual risk expected review was done comprehensively across all global operations. The result was that most areas had lost emergence either better or in lines of expectation. So no material reserve changes would be necessary. The $74 million in net favorable development is mostly driven by the amortization associated with the deferred gain of the adverse development cover, namely $58 million, and the remaining $68 million of General Insurance net favorable development was scattered across many lines and regions. Additionally, with the revised underwriting and low per risk attachment reinsurance strategy, our historical reporting on net severe loss is no longer makes sense. So from now on, we will be commenting on attritional and CAT losses only.","Peter commented on General Insurance has achieved rate increases for the quarter. And I'd like to additionally point out that for North American commercial, in particular, the rate increases have been accelerating, and the March increase alone averaged over 7%, which is clearly an excess of loss trend, and thereby providing additional margin expansion.","Similarly, our monitoring of portfolio composition clearly shows the superior rate advocacy of new business relative to that of lost business as well as improvements to the renewal books adequacy. These shifts and overall portfolio rate adequacies provide additional lift for continued improved performance.","Turning to the Life and Retirement segment, adjusted pretax income of $924 million represents a $32 million increase over the first quarter of 2018 and a $301 million increase sequentially over the fourth quarter of 2018. These results, as Kevin mentioned, translates to a 15% annualized return on average attributed common equity for the quarter. All units reported increases in adjusted pretax income sequentially relative to the fourth quarter of last year. And this retirement has stronger investment income and positive net flows for the quarter, but with base net investment spreads that are expected to experience a downward breath as Kevin highlighted.","Group Retirement's net flows were negative due to the slightly lower sequential premiums and deposits and sequentially higher surrenders and withdrawals. Group retirement business like others in the industry is exposed to client consolidation via mergers or by the reduction of providers offered implants. The quarter saw favorable results from life international operations and institutional markets for the second quarter in a row with successful in the pension risk transfer space.","Turning to Legacy, adjusted pre-tax income was up $262 million sequentially to the fourth quarter of last year. But such comparisons are not overly meaningful given the nonrecurring loss recognition charge taken on certain cancer and disability A&H last quarter. However, the quarter's $89 million have adjusted after-tax income translates into a 4.4% annualized return on attributed common equity. But given that the quarter experienced the already discussed investment rebound as well, our view of a 2% to 3% return for the full 2019 year remains valid.","As respect tax, the effective tax rate is 22.5% for the quarter, excluding discreet items, applicable to adjusted pretax income. Including discrete items, the tax rate was 22.9%. As you know the effective tax rate is updated each quarter using actual results to then supplement by reforecast to the remaining quarters, and as always the tax rate is heavily influenced this quarter by the geographic distribution of combine tax jurisdictions. ","Moving on to capital actions, we issued $1.1 billion of securities in the first quarter split between $600 million of tenure debt with a 4.25% coupon and $500 million of non cumulative proffered stock with a 5.85% dividend. We do not repurchase any shares in the quarter, so our afford authorization remains at $2 billion.","With that I will turn it back over to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Thank you, Mark. I think we can go to questions and answers. So first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question now comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question going back to some of your comments on this call and prior calls, made reference of all these underwriting changes and how they're beginning to earn in, I guess I would like to get a better sense of the forward momentum. I know on last quarter's call you guys had mentioned that the prior management teams go big strategy at AIG resulted in multi-year policies that are still on your books in 2019. So could you just give us a sense of the running of those policies and how that could benefit to incremental underlying margin improvement as we go through the balance of 2019 and into 2020.","Brian Duperreault","Okay, Elyse. Well, Peter, I think you should take this.","Peter Zaffino","Hey Elyse, thanks for the question. So we're a meaningful amount of long-term deals done in the core property book historically. And we had announced that we're changing underwriting guidelines that was something we do not want to do going forward. But as you mention, it takes little bit of time to earn out. So we should see a meaningful reduction in long-term deals by the back half of 2019. So I think as we -- back half of '19, as we enter 2020, we will have cut our long-term deals in half and will start to see the majority of the portfolio increasing in terms of just annual 12 month deals.","Elyse Greenspan","And then my second question, you guys referenced strong prices. It seems like you guys saw in March, really improving from the trend, I guess. Could you just give us a sense your forward view on pricing? And then as we think about pricing versus trend, can you give us -- help give us a sense of when that could really start to earn and be beneficial to the margins you saw in the first quarter?","Brian Duperreault","Yes, I\u2019m going to talk about a little bit about this, and let Peter about the pricing. So I just want to point out that this pricing is wanted, needed. The whole industry is recognizing that. In our own case, we had other things we had to do too. So there are more things going on and just getting price on the portfolio. And that is Peter said, the selection process getting the right risk on board positioning ourselves properly in their program at attachment point putting the right limit out et cetera. So a lot of that is causing the improvement around portfolio. Pricing is a component of it, an important component, but a component. Peter, do you want to go a little bit more into the pricing?","Peter Zaffino","Sure. I think we outline a lot of this in the prepared remarks. I think what's happening, which is a little bit different is that we're seeing it across the board. There is a multiple lines. I mean certainly property has underperformed the most. And so whether it's CAT capacity, attritional losses on how capacity has been deployed, we're seeing rate within the E&S as well as the admitted market. So that's, I think, it would be consistent throughout the rest of the year. We've seen it in financial lines. I think, as we can participate in many lines of business, and then in many parts of the program, we're seeing that momentum, as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, take up and margin and we would expect that to continue throughout the year. So it's a very orderly meeting. This is one that is not just spiking at one line. It's across multiple lines and in a lot of parts of the world. So I think this is something that hard to predict how long it lasts, but we're going to lead with, again, risk selection, but also making sure we're getting paid appropriately for the limits that we put out and the risk that we're underwriting.","Brian Duperreault","Yes. This pricing isn't just the first quarter phenomenon. It's been building through '18. And so it'll bleed in as earn these premiums. And as Mark pointed out, there seems to be some acceleration.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Brian Duperreault","Okay. You're welcome. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Yaron Kinar","So two questions. First, I think in the press release, Brian, you talked about an expectation that this year will be profitable on both from the calendar year and accident year basis? I was just curious is that with catastrophes your commentaries on?","Brian Duperreault","Well, with catastrophes, I can't tell you whether we're going to have a large catastrophe or a small catastrophe or, I mean, we have this thing called AAL, which I did insert into the number. And as we said, it's 3, 3.5. I don't really want to talk about it after that. So I mean, look, I think over a long period of time, there will be years where we have catastrophe years we don't, but on the average, we expect to make an underpinning profit. And I expect to make an underwriting profit this year. But I can't predict whether it's going to be a big CAT year or not. But I mean, on some kind of an average basis, certainly that is our belief, a very strong belief.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. So basically, this comment is without using AAL still seems some normalized catastrophe load?","Peter Zaffino","We already put AAL in. I mean, I said we put an AAL in the first quarter. And it was -- there were some tickets under 100.","Yaron Kinar","Right.","Peter Zaffino","You put an AAL and for the whole year, I'm saying, we believe it'll be under 100, but I can't tell you the actual CATs. That's that's my point.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Appreciated. And then, my second question is on NII. So Mark, if I do the math or the sum of the price that you laid out, I guess about $13.7 billion of NII for the year. And I think that's a little bit above the $13 billion guidance that measure previously offered. So how should we think of NII on a normalized basis from here?","Mark Lyons","Well, first off, some features would give you partial credit, and some features just a binary and say yes or no. So I'll give you partial credit on that. So you've reflected the $450 million of investment expenses and take gross to that, but you have to recognize that the original","guidance of $13 billion did not include the re-class. And depending on whether you look at the last quarter whether re-class $116 million or you look at a longer period of time where it's closer to $150 million, which will be $600 million, I would get closer 13.2, 13.3, if that\u2019s helpful.","Yaron Kinar","Yes. But you also had a re-class of the equity per value adjustment rate. So \u2026","Mark Lyons","That's right. $39 million in the quarter.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. So you got the 13.2, 13.3 with both re-classes.","Mark Lyons","Yes. If you reflect that, you will be approximately there. Next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Paul Newsome","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about capital volatility just on a normalized basis. There has been so much change with your business mix and reinsurance in the light. And I guess I seriously think of insurance companies having their toughest CAT quarter in the third and second -- sort of the second worst may be first and second are about the same. You think that AIG is going to follow through the traditional pattern? Or with all these changes, do you think there will be a difference in your normal capital volatility quarter-to-quarter?","Brian Duperreault","I would love to give this to somebody else. So we will try to start with. And so I think, yes, there is an inherent seasonality to CATs because of the storm seasons, which are third and fourth quarter, equates can happen anytime. I mean, we've had weather in the first quarter was storm losses, winter storm losses et cetera. But yes, by enlarge, so we have the first half would be a little lighter than the second half that\u2019s just traditional. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changing now, but I don\u2019t -- first lot of all, I don't know they want to talk about ALL than it were. But anyway, we think about it as an annual number because you really have to think about it at least on an annual basis. Peter, do you want to say something?","Peter Zaffino","There is one thing I would add Brian because the question was also around volatility and we use that word a lot in our scripts, but in addition to putting together much more comprehensive program and in addition to making it an aggregate, our standard deviation and expected volatility around our different return periods has decreased by 50%. So while it's not certain, the expected value around whether its ALLs or PMLs has reduced significantly in terms of what we think is going to happen. So that is something that through the entire reinsurance design had been very beneficial and gives us more confidence.","Brian Duperreault","And one thing I would add into that, because it's a good question, Paul, is in my prepared remarks I tried to show that the risk is also helpful in that regard. And the CAT programs that were put in place let alone the carveouts of DCG gives materially better vertical and horizontal protection regionally and globally. So I think that helps with the containment. And I would ask it to not forget one thing we talked about last quarter, which was the way the gross underwriting changes are in is because they started earlier, it gives one view, but the reinsurance mostly attached the latter half of 2018. So that was risk-attaching, some of that inures to the benefit of the CAT program, which is also occurring. But the point is we will get increasing protection in volatility reduction as we go from quarter to quarter to quarter in 2019.","Paul Newsome","And then any updates on the capital management thoughts. They weren't any buybacks this quarter, but you did raise some capital. I just want to see if there's any additional thoughts you got there?","Brian Duperreault","Look, we were largely blacked out first quarter. So at the end, because of those offerings you mentioned. So I think we continue to look at it. My philosophy hasn't changed. I think it's an appropriate capital management tool. And as we go through the year, we'll look at how we want to use that capital. And so no changes there. Next question please.","Operator","Certainly sir. This question is from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker","I was interesting in understanding about the timing of the reinsurance purchasing for the remainder of the year. You have said about two-thirds of the reduction, I guess, was sum of AIG's and Validus' 1Q '18 premium year-over-year was related to reinsurance buying. Are you buying more reinsurance, which will have a similar effect in the quarters to come? Or the first quarter the big by quarter? And then how does that affect expense ratio as we go forward?","Brian Duperreault","Peter?","Peter Zaffino","We have the only probably material impact that we foresee as of now is how the sort of casualty quarter share will earn through the year for the U.S. That's a big session. And then one that just commenced on a risk attaching base from the first quarter. So that was the most material. I don't believe that we will see any other material purchases on property. So we've done a lot on the -- per risk, as Mark mentioned, on the aggregate. We have done some facultative purchasing to make sure that we take out the volatility of our long-term deals on property. And I don't think that as we look to the remaining part of the year, we have thought about the impact of reinsurance and do not believe it will impact our expense ratio as we get into the second and third quarters.","Brian Duperreault","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Question for Peter and maybe Mark can help. But some of your reps, I know you're not disclosing those anymore. But could you give us some idea of how those ran here verses I think $125 million as expected level last year? And also, in terms of the GOE run rate, it was $839 this quarter in General Insurance which is down about $50 million from 4Q levels. Is that $839 million number a pretty good one to use over the remainder of the year, do you think?","Brian Duperreault","So let me comment on severes, and I will turn it over to Mark. But in the quarter, we had less gross activity than if you look that our multiple quarter average. But I think the bigger issue was just in terms of how we address the property for risk and buying down and taking out volatility in addition to one of the areas of our business, which had a little bit more frequency on severity. We ended up working through a quarter share to mitigate a lot in the volatility. So I think it was, one was the growth, but more importantly is what we've done to protect volatility through reinsurance. Mark, anything you want to add?","Mark Lyons","Yes, I would just say on this severes without getting into any specifics. It was a very late view of it, so it's, which is another reason. But with the front end underwriting changes, Peter talked about the reinsurance stages again, but there was nothing adverse and severes.","Brian Duperreault","Do you want to comment on the GOE?","Mark Lyons","The GOE, because the $839 million you are quoting incorporates Validus, so we intent to do quarter-over-quarter that excellent to that to get apples to apples. So it's probably a more realistic way, but I think you should be thinking more in terms of ratio rather than on the dollar sense. We have had two consecutive quarters of GOE being 12.5% around premium. And that can move a little bit as a function of miscellaneous items and accounting that could affect our premium and things like that. But that's probably the preferred way to look at.","Ryan Tunis","And I just had a follow-up on, I mean, we should on CAT volatility. But curious on how you guys are thinking about volatility within the attritional loss ratio. So if you have a view of what the central tendency is, let's say 631 you think is a good run rate. How many points away from that is you think one synergy could easily be explained by adverse luck. Is it one point now? Is it two points, because companies like Travelers were used to being less than a point for quarter can be just explained by adverse activity. Are we at that point yet or could we still see two to three points swing is also what you think really running at?","Brian Duperreault","I think it's Mark.","Mark Lyons","So couple of thoughts come to mind. One is that, one, I don't want to look at it that way. I can go back. But we have a massively diverse global geographic presence and different characteristics. As a company you mentioned is much more of a frequency driven company, and therefore more predicted. We have a lot of -- we're changing that mix next to be much more mid and smaller, but in-force book still has a lot of severity characteristics both frequency and high severity characteristics. So I would say there is the fair amount. The reinsurance is going to contain that because you asked a net loss ratio question. So it's going to contain that more, but I would expect it to be wider than Travelers.","Brian Duperreault","Okay. Next question?","Operator","Next question is from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman","Just want to follow-up on Paul's question about the buybacks and understand you're in blackout period. But given your debt to capital is pretty close to 30%. Is it fair to assume that you probably don't want to do much by way of buybacks for the balance of the year?","Brian Duperreault","I don\u2019t want to predict anything here. Do I want to, don't I want to. I mean, I think we have both do it quarter-by-quarter and really understand uses of that capital? So we have a buyback authorization in place continues to be there to be used. I don\u2019t want to commenting more than that.","Andrew Kligerman ","All right. And then just with regard to the personal line. So I know Mark earlier was talking about two third of the normal -- when you take out the acquisitions et cetera, net written premium was down 17%, two thirds due to the reinsurance. And now just looking at the personal line, North America down 6%, international down 12%, could you give us a sense of what the reinsurance component of that decline was? And also you mentioned in the release A&H premiums were lower. Is there some competitive situation going on with that that's putting pressure on A&H?","Brian Duperreault","Peter?","Peter Zaffino","So on the Personal Insurance in the United States, our travel book, our warranty book came in exactly where we had thought it would in terms of a combined ratio for the quarter. So we're really talking more about the high net worth book. And looking at the composition of that book, we not only had that contribute from the sort of global aggregate where we lowered our attachment point, we also bought more per risk. We also bought Asia-Pacific CAT program that has different attachment points depending on peak zones for our high network book that we think will dampen volatility, and also allow us as we want to reposition in certain peak zones. The portfolio and accelerate our underwriting, we just hired a terrific individual in capital Kathleen Zortman who has decades of experience in driving high net worth portfolios, who is really excited. She's joining us. And that will happen in the second quarter. And we'll begin to accelerate like we have on other portions of the portfolio, and an improvement in terms of its footprint. And the reinsurance is, I think, very responsible. And it will respond well throughout the year depending on what will happen in terms of CATs.","Andrew Kligerman","And so the question was \u2026","Peter Zaffino","And then something on the A&H, it's not -- we should not bring anything on A&H. It's a terrific portfolio, performs very well in terms of its combined ratio. And it's an area where Brian and I very much want to grow our book, and we should take a longer term view, but it's an area where we think will have growth over the long term.","Brian Duperreault","And we've been so far. And we just \u2026","Peter Zaffino","We just have named a global leader Ed Levin. And so he joined us. And we have the strategy in place and beginning to accelerate our growth. It'll take some time. But, we really excited about that portfolio. I wanted to come in for us long term.","Brian Duperreault","Sort of one last question, and then we'll wrap it up. So operator, the last question, please.","Operator","Certainly. And this comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher","Thanks. First question on P&C. You had big growth in specialty risk in terms of net premium written just curious what kind of combined ratio that's being booked at? Is that going to add meaningfully to underwriting improvement as that earns in? And can you just provide a little color what -- kind of what drove that significant growth?","Brian Duperreault","It was mostly the acquisition. We had Talbot and CRS, which is the crop. And so that's in the specialty classes. Now look at Talbot is a terrific syndicate and has very balanced portfolio with marine, specialty classes, including energy, political risk and political violence. And we've been working very hard to determine what's going to fit within AIG, what's going to fit within the syndicate. And do believe that that business will perform well over the short, medium and long term and will contribute like Validus to our overall improvement in combined ratio. But it's very good, and on a calendar year basis performed on quite well in the quarter.","Tom Gallagher","And then just a follow-up on net investment income, Mark, I was following the stable asset class returns versus the more volatile ones. And just looking at the $29 billion that you characterized as more volatile, if I'm looking at your guide for full year NII, I think that only would imply something like a 3% return on that $29 billion carrying value portfolio. And you have, I think plenty of higher returning asset classes in their like private equity in the like. First off is that right? And secondly does that imply your $13.2 billion NII guidance just conservatively assuming returns on that portfolio. Can you provide some color on that? Thanks.","Brian Duperreault","First off the Tom, the first question would be what period of time should you assess volatility. I purposely look this something that work for this since up, which was current in four prior quarters or five quarters. That particular one average 5.8% over that period of the swing of 2% to 9% that shows you some of that volatility. So that\u2019s implying like another $1.7 billion on 5.8% basis, which to the $12.5 billion takes you $14.2 billion. You have to take out to $450 million annually for investment expenses, and then the re-class impact that wouldn\u2019t have been in there in the original guidance for $13 billion even. And that composite gets you down to the $13.2 billion to $13.3 billion. But I think what question you have to answer for yourself is what's the proper volatility measurement I just gave you an example of what.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you everybody.","Brian Duperreault","So before we end the call I want to thank everyone who is dialed in, to your remarks. I\u2019m approaching my two year anniversary at AIG, and I couldn\u2019t be proud of what we're accomplishing at this great company. And I\u2019m grateful for the tremendous support we're receiving across the industry. And I want to thank all our colleagues at AIG for their hard work, dedication and resiliency. We still have a lot of work ahead of this. But our first quarter results demonstrate that we're on the right path. So thank you very much. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that's now concluded today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Elizabeth A. Werner - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Derik, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events.","Actual performance and events may differ possibly materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause this include the factors described in our 2017 Form 10-K under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and under Risk Factors.","AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in the slides for today's presentation and our financial supplement, which are available on our website.","This morning, you'll have the opportunity to hear from members of our senior management team including our CEO, Brian Duperreault; our CFO, Sid Sankaran; our CEO of General Insurance, Peter Zaffino; and our CEO of Life and Retirement, Kevin Hogan.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to reflect on the past 11 months, our first quarter results, and our future outlook. It's nearly a year since my return to AIG and over that time we've driven a meaningful change and have accomplished a great deal.","During last year, we successfully reorganized our businesses into General Insurance and Life and Retirement and have attracted world class talent and that momentum is picking up augmenting an already strong talent base. We benefited from the change in federal regulatory status and are no longer a nonbank SIFI.","We showed incredible strength and resiliency, both financially and as an organization in the wake of unprecedented catastrophes over the last three quarters and entered the year with an extremely strong balance sheet. We created DSA Re, a more focused, single entity capital efficient structure for managing our runoff and we announced the strategic acquisition of Validus, which is on track to close in mid-2018.","Our strategy to grow AIG and position it for long term profitable growth is taking hold. The first quarter demonstrated solid progress and another period of earnings stability. For the quarter, we reported $1.2 billion of pre-tax operating income, including $376 million in catastrophe losses as well as high severe and winter weather losses. The actions we've been taking to reduce volatility should continue to be evident in our future results. Peter will provide more detail on the execution of our reinsurance strategy across products and geographies.","General Insurance first quarter underwriting results were in line with 2017 full year results despite higher severe and winter storm losses. Our reserves were stable and we had positive net development of over $100 million, including the ongoing $62 million in amortization of our ADC gain. Sid will speak to reserves and our ADC, where claims came in as expected.","Stability was also evident in our first quarter Life and Retirement results. Returns were solid despite continuing spread compression and we remain disciplined in writing new business, focusing this quarter on Life and Index Annuities, while maintaining steady Group Retirement deposits and engaging in opportunistic Institutional Markets transactions. Kevin will speak to the outlook for these businesses.","Last quarter, I said 2017 was a starting point from which we would improve upon and we remain confident in our positive trajectory. I've mentioned on past calls we don't provide guidance. That said, I have declared 2018 as the year of the underwriter and we do expect to deliver an underwriting profit by the end of this year as we enter 2019, reaching a combined ratio of below 100% will come through a combination of actions to improve loss and expense ratios.","We also expect to reach top quartile book value growth and return on equity performance over time as a result of our decisive actions and the investments we're making to position the company for long-term profitable growth.","In addition to working towards certain financial goals, we will also measure our success in attracting and retaining top talent, focusing on increasing diversity and inclusion across AIG, modernizing and updating our systems and technology and managing risk. My entire leadership team is committed to the goals I've outlined and our sense of urgency will continue.","Now I will turn it over to Sid to give you more insight into the financial results.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll comment on our first quarter financial results, our capital and liquidity position, and provide an update on the status of the Validus acquisition and DSA Re.","Turning to slide 4, we reported adjusted after-tax earnings per share of $1.04 and an adjusted core ROE of 8.6%, which reflected $376 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses, which were over $100 million higher than our quarterly AAL.","For financial reporting purposes, we assume that our AAL is spread evenly throughout the year. Cat losses included $171 million from the California mudslides in early January, $122 million from U.S. winter storms and approximately $80 million in losses from the Papua New Guinea earthquake. The majority of our cat losses were in our North American Personal Insurance business.","The General Insurance accident year loss ratio as adjusted was 63.1% for the quarter, which was in line with full year 2017. This reflected improvements in our International Commercial loss ratios as well as the portfolio mix in North American Casualty and Financial Lines. However, this improvement was offset by the net earned premium impact of changes to our reinsurance structure, higher severe losses and attritional losses related to non-cat winter weather that impacted both North American Commercial and Personal Insurance. We estimate that the above average impact of the U.S. winter storms increased GI's overall accident year loss ratio by about one point.","As you can see from our financial supplement, changes to our reinsurance structure improve our AAL by over one point against full year 2017. Additionally, as we mentioned at year end, we completed our Japan merger. As a result of the merger, Fuji's fiscal period was conformed to that of AIU Japan, which resulted in recognition of an additional two months of pre-tax earnings of approximately $15 million. Peter will comment further on underwriting trends and the impact of reinsurance in his remarks.","Our Life and Retirement businesses delivered another solid quarter of results with an adjusted ROE of 14.3% for the quarter, benefiting from better than expected alternative investment returns and $54 million in nonrecurring payments on structured securities. Kevin will speak to results and business trends further in his remarks.","Book value per share ex AOCI and DTA was $56.10 at quarter end, up 2.5% for the quarter, or up 1.3% excluding the impact of changes in accounting principles. We continue to provide you with book value per share excluding both AOCI and our tax attribute DTA to align with how we report adjusted ROE. We continue to see the value of the tax attribute DTA as the present value of our future cash tax savings. Book value per share ex AOCI was $67.48 at quarter end.","Additionally, net investment income from our Insurance operations including the legacy insurance portfolios, totaled $3.3 billion in the quarter or 9% lower than the $3.7 billion reported a year ago. While alternative investment returns exceeded our 8% expectation, the total was largely in line with the annual run rate we provided last quarter.","For our Life and Retirement operations, we invested new money at an average yield of about 4% in the quarter, which is roughly 70 basis points lower than our portfolio yield, reflecting the duration of the portfolio. For General Insurance, our new money yield was 3.4% in the quarter, which is coming in line with portfolio yields. As we have stated, we view a steady rise in interest rates as an incremental positive for our businesses.","As Brian mentioned, there was net favorable reserve development of $110 million this quarter, including the $62 million benefit related to the amortization of the deferred gain on the ADC. Across our portfolios, actual versus expected claims trends came in better than expected this quarter. However, we have not made any material changes to loss picks and long-tail lines and chosen to remain cautious.","With respect to our adverse development cover shown on page 43 of the financial supplement, cumulative payments on ADC subject business to the end of the first quarter 2018 were $15.8 billion. This was in line with our original payout and held ultimate loss projections at inception.","We continue to project that inception to-date payments will pierce the $25 billion attachment point around mid-year 2020, at which point claims will be paid 80% by Berkshire Hathaway and 20% by AIG. We anticipate normal quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in paid claims given the mix of business subject to the ADC.","Discrete items brought our adjusted effective tax rate to 20% for the quarter. However, we continue to expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22% before discrete items.","Our balance sheet and free cash flow remains strong. As shown on slide 6, current liquidity at quarter end was $8.5 billion, reflecting debt issuances we completed in March. We view the target level of liquidity at the holding company to be between $3 billion to $4 billion, representing our annual interest payments, dividend payments and holding company costs.","Cash proceeds in the quarter included $2.5 billion from the March debt issuances I just referred to, which replaced the $1.1 billion of debt maturities in January and will be used to partially fund the Validus acquisition.","With respect to our acquisition of Validus, we remain on track for an expected closing in mid-2018. Following the closing, we'll report Talbot, our Lloyd's business, in the General Insurance International Commercial segment and the remaining Validus operations in the General Insurance North America Commercial segment.","As part of aligning Validus to AIG business segments, we are also looking at the efficiency of the Validus legal entity and capital structure, once it is part of the larger AIG enterprise. We anticipate taking actions to better manage risk, capital, liquidity and leverage, after consulting with the appropriate regulators and receiving the necessary regulatory approvals.","In the first quarter, we received $700 million of dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and tax sharing payments of $400 million including DSA Re. Our base case for annual dividends and tax payments from our insurance subsidiaries remains $6 billion, although we see potential upside from non-recurring flows.","Our capital ratios at our P&C companies are at target levels. Our capital ratios for our Life and Retirement companies are above target levels, following the reinsurance and legacy life reserves through the DSA Re transaction. DSA Re is also above its target capital level.","Our strong balance sheet should continue to provide us ongoing financial flexibility.","We repurchased $300 million of common shares and warrants during the first quarter, leaving approximately $2 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We continue to consider share repurchase as a tool in delivering long-term value to shareholders.","To sum up, we had a solid quarter where we continued to execute on our strategy of delivering long-term profitable growth, reducing volatility and maintaining a strong balance sheet and cash flow profile.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter.","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Today, I will provide an update on the progress of General Insurance's strategic initiatives, discuss our first quarter results, and outline our view on current market conditions.","Having recently returned from RIMS, where senior members of our underwriting and distribution teams held hundreds of meetings over a four-day period, I was very pleased with the meaningful support and interaction from our clients and broker partners who are taking note of General Insurance's new strategic direction and our high level of engagement to assist in solving risk issues.","Turning to our initiatives, I would like to underscore my comments on previous calls that we are progressing toward a profitable business with less volatility as Brian described earlier. Our other main priorities include addressing underperforming segments, while growing profitable lines of business, reorganizing our end-to-end business units and attracting strong talent to transition our business to be more effective in the market.","We are also continuing to reshape our reinsurance strategy to reduce net exposures in many areas of our business. During last quarter's call, I mentioned that we reduced our net exposures in North America Property Cat, reduced our net limits on our property per risk in Marine and purchased an international cat treaty.","We took actions to further reduce volatility over the past quarter as we secured a new European Casualty excess of loss program. And we intend to expand it across the International business by the end of the second quarter.","We entered into a new workers' compensation catastrophe treaty that includes terrorism and expanded our aerospace program by increasing our aggregate limit and reducing our net retention.","While our reinsurance strategy will impact net premium written levels in the short-term, going forward our results should be less volatile.","Turning to General Insurance's organizational structure, our leaders are making progress building their businesses and collaborating to instill a culture of accountability and excellence that empowers underwriters and delivers value to our clients and brokers.","Tom Bolt joined us in January as Chief Underwriting Officer. And one of his first priorities has been to balance our gross and net per risk limits in select lines to further stabilize performance. Tom is working with our business leaders to align on risk appetite, improve our pricing capabilities and utilize data to make better informed decisions.","Chris Townsend joined General Insurance's leadership team in March as the CEO of International. His early focus has been on finalizing the international structure, appointing leaders in our major geographies and better positioning AIG in the market by reviewing performance and risk appetite in certain countries.","Most recently, we appointed Anthony Vidovich as our new Chief Claims Officer, along with other appointments for North America Casualty and U.S. Field operations.","Further, a bit more on the Validus transaction, which Sid referred to in his remarks. Our transition planning process is proceeding well with the milestones for our various work streams on target. And we have retention agreements in place for the organization's top executives. We look forward to welcoming Validus and its talented group of colleagues to AIG.","Turning to General Insurance's first quarter results on slide 8, we provided details on total premiums and profitability. I will focus my comments on underlying business performance excluding the impact of Fuji lag that Sid mentioned.","First quarter net premiums written declined 10% year-over-year excluding foreign exchange and the Fuji merger lag elimination, driven by our 2018 North America property catastrophe reinsurance program and strategic actions within U.S. Casualty and Property. We continue to expect that 2018 net premiums written will be relatively flat to 2017.","Moving to profitability, the first quarter included $376 million in cat losses, largely driven by Personal Insurance which Sid discussed. The adjusted accident year loss ratio of 63.1% was generally in line with last year and we were pleased to achieve improvements in our North America Commercial Long-Tail Lines and International Commercial businesses.","These improvements were largely offset by the impact of reinsurance on net earned premiums, higher severe losses, non-cat winter weather and business mix changes. While our new cat reinsurance programs impacted the accident year loss ratio, they've driven a decline of approximately 20% in the total AAL.","Our management of both growth and net exposures has improved the stability of our portfolio and reduced PMLs by approximately 40%.","Shifting to expenses, overall expenses increased slightly excluding the Fuji catch-up, driven largely by higher acquisition expenses in Personal Insurance. On the same basis, the expense ratio increased 1.9 points, reflecting the decline in net earned premiums resulting from our strategic actions.","As I mentioned last quarter, we are executing on various actions to reduce expenses that do not impact core underwriting as part of our new operating model.","Slides 9 and 10 provide additional insight into North America and International first quarter results. North America's adjusted accident year loss ratio included the commercial long-tail improvements I referenced earlier and benefits from our business mix strategy in Personal Insurance, but increased acquisition ratio was largely driven by business mix changes.","In International, the commercial adjusted accident year loss ratio improved compared to full year 2017 results and Personal Insurance continuing to perform profitably with slight deterioration due to winter weather.","In Japan with the merger of AIU and Fuji Fire and Marine now complete, we're managing through the integration. We have experienced some reduction in new business following the merger which we had anticipated, but we expect to see improvement as we progress through the year.","As Brian mentioned, we believe that our accident year combined ratio will improve under 100% on an exit run rate basis by the end of the year as our underwriting actions and efforts to manage expenses earn into our financial results.","Regarding market conditions, we continue to see the strongest signs of improvement in U.S. Property. Largely in line with my commentary in the fourth quarter, rates improved in the high single-digits on average across the portfolio with the most significant increases being driven by E&S property.","In U.S. Casualty, overall rate increases were similar to last quarter remaining in the low to mid-single-digits but with wide variations depending on line of business, attachment point and experience. We review loss cost trends and other variables regularly and adjust underwriting and pricing decisions accordingly.","To recap the quarter, key initiatives are underway to improve General Insurance's core performance. We expect momentum will continue to build as the year progresses. While it takes some time for our underwriting actions to earn into the income statement, a combination of both loss ratio improvement and expense management will contribute to our 2018 exit run rate.","We've implemented the right structure, are assembling a strong and experienced leadership team and are executing against a set of clear priorities to deliver value to our clients and brokers and enhance the strength of this terrific organization.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on slide 12, Life and Retirement produced solid results for the quarter generating $892 million in adjusted pre-tax income and producing a strong 14.3% adjusted ROE.","As Sid mentioned, our results benefited from a $54 million transaction in non-recurring payments on structured securities, primarily in Group Retirement and Individual Retirement which is reflected in other yield enhancements. Asset growth over the last 12 months driven by strong equity markets has partially mitigated the impact of the low rate environment in our results.","Finally, with the significant market volatility experienced during the quarter, I'm pleased to report that our hedging program for living benefit guarantees performed as expected, resulting in a modest hedging gain supported by our unique de risking product features.","The breadth of our product portfolio and channel strategy remains our greatest strength, especially as industry sales continued to be challenged in the individual annuity market. In response to these conditions, we are emphasizing growth in Life Insurance and Index Annuities maintaining steady periodic deposits for Group Retirement and executing opportunistic transactions in Institutional Markets.","In terms of environment, regulatory uncertainties have continued to significantly affect many distributors negatively impacting sales, particularly of variable annuities. In March, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the DOL overreached its authority in promulgating its fiduciary rule and the Department announced that it was suspending enforcements of the rule.","The recently filed motions to intervene were denied. If no further action is taken, the Fifth Circuit's ruling has the effect of invalidating the DOL Fiduciary Rule in its entirety. However, the SEC lawmakers and state insurance regulators are separately engaged in reevaluating what is an appropriate standard of care for the sale of investment products and services with the SEC releasing a proposed package of new rule making in April.","We believe that the publication of the SEC's proposal will help accelerate necessary dialogue across impacted stakeholders. In the face of this ongoing uncertainty, our strategy is to continue to support our distribution partners as their needs evolve with innovative solutions across our broad product portfolio.","Now, I will briefly discuss results for each of our businesses. Turning to Individual Retirement on slide 13, fixed annuity and variable annuity sales declined in the quarter as we chose not to deploy capital at returns below our hurdle rates. We delivered strong Index Annuity growth for the quarter. However, overall Individual Retirement net flows remained negative and were worse than the prior year.","Individual Retirement's assets under administration were at historical highs at quarter end driven by equity market performance and positive Index Annuity net flows which result in increased fee income.","We also continued our practice of active spread management, but as expected we saw continued compression reflecting current reinvestment conditions. The year-over-year comparison of base net investment spread for Fixed Annuities also reflects higher unexpected accretion income for the first quarter of 2017.","Turning to Group Retirement on page 14, our periodic deposits remained steady, while our group plan acquisitions declined primarily due to the timing of funding new large plans. Our momentum on the new group acquisition front is strong with good growth and confirmed new plans we expect to be funded this year. Our net flows remained negative and were worse than the prior year, with surrenders impacted by the loss of a few large plans.","As we move forward, we expect to see certain natural attrition among larger groups due to planned sponsors reducing the number of providers in their plans and M&A activity in the health care market.","Despite these headwinds, we believe that the investments we continue to make in our digital capabilities and operating platform combined with our VALIC Financial Advisors position us well as an industry leader in the not-for-profit defined contribution market.","Similar to Individual Retirement, Group Retirement assets under administration were at historical highs at quarter end, but despite disciplined rate management experienced expected base yields and spread compression. While we have seen recent increases in risk free rates, as Sid mentioned, new money rates continue to be below portfolio yields and spreads continue to be at historically tight levels.","Looking forward across Individual and Group Retirement absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, our current expectation is that our base net spreads will decline by approximately 0 to 2 basis points per quarter.","Let's now move to Life Insurance on slide 15. Our Life Insurance business continued to make progress. In the U.S., our new modern administrative platform, distribution simplification efforts and narrowed product focus continue to support strong top-line growth.","Our premiums and deposits increased and we had strong growth in both term and universal life insurance sales. While competition is robust, we are confident in our opportunities to grow and deploy capital writing new business at attractive returns. Lastly, our overall mortality experience was within pricing expectations and consistent with prior year.","Turning to slide 16, in Institutional Markets, we continued to execute our opportunistic strategy. During the first quarter, we executed a large Federal Home Loan Bank Funding Agreement. Although we did not participate in any notable pension risk transfer transactions in the quarter, we continue to believe there is significant long-term opportunity in this market.","Overall, our Institutional Markets business is well positioned to capitalize on available growth, while remaining focused on achieving targeted economic returns.","To close, our results reflect our strong diversification of products and channels and our disciplined focus on writing profitable business, which we believe positions us well.","Now, I would like to turn it back to Brian to open up to Q&A.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. Questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll move to our first question. This question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. My first question, I appreciate the guidance given for the below 100% combined ratio by the end of the year. Can you just give some color as we think about the seasonality in the book? And how you see from getting from the Q1 combined ratio to sub 100% in the fourth quarter? How do you envision the second and the third quarter progressing along?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, Elyse, thanks. Look, it's difficult to say that it's going to be in a straight line, but when I'm referring to that I'm also including an AAL charge here. So if you take the volatility of catastrophes out, I think we should be making steady progress. But I can't tell you that it's going to be divided by three or four and you get the answer for the reduction.","And then remember, it's not just loss ratio. We've got a deal with our expense levels which clearly are too high. We know that. And that's an effort around the operating model in General Insurance which has to be both effective and efficient and both of those we're working on very diligently. But, just remember, it's got the AAL in it, so that's where the seasonality. I'm taking cat out and putting a charge-in. I hope that helps.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that helps. And then, in terms of North America Commercial, when we think about getting to that sub 100% combined ratio including the AAL by the end of the year, what kind of margin are you thinking that you will get to within North America Commercial? And I understand there's lots of moving parts in the quarter, but that underlying loss ratio in North America was higher than the full year level which was kind of what you pointed to as a starting point there. So can we get an updated kind of starting point for how you see that Commercial Lines underlying loss ratio progressing this year? And can you quantify the level of non cat weather losses that might have impacted that number this quarter?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Sure. Once you do that, and we'll talk about the non-cat after you finish.","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Yes, okay. So as you said, Elyse, there's quite a bit going on in the quarter. When you take the impact of reinsurance, certainly that reduces our overall property earned premium in the quarter. So we're moving with positive rate but also remediating property and then having the headwind of the reinsurance. We're also rebalancing our Casualty book and getting out of more of the sort of lead excess casualty, getting after \u2013 making sure we're not doing lead on primary IPO and professional liabilities, so those things that we're doing to reposition the book. But, the consequences of that in terms of what happens a little bit with the loss ratio was that property reduced more, reposition the Casualty book. Casualty is not growing, but as a percentage of grow, it grew a little bit in the quarter, and so therefore that's what really had a little bit of a difference in the overall loss ratio.","But our focus is, every day, what are we doing to stand up the businesses, laser focus on the accident year loss ratios within North America and doing everything we can to remediate that over the calendar year.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Winter storm losses. So that's Sid.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yes. Elyse, I'd point you to my comments in my script. It's about 1 point on the full year General Insurance ratio. That's a mix of both Commercial and Personal Insurance. We haven't broken it out further beyond that.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then so, can I just clarify one thing? When you assume a sub 100%, that with the AAL by the end of the year, does that assume that you're running at a sub 100% in North America Commercial?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","I think that may not have it, because the International runs at a better result. We're not going to have them stand still. We're expecting them to improve too. So I would say that the exit rate in North America probably will be above 100%. I'm not \u2013 it's the combined that I'm really talking about. And we need to get to an underwriting profit in this place, and we're going to do it.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning. First question on expense ratio. Deteriorated about 2 points year-over-year, a part of the \u2013 majority of that coming from the acquisition expense ratio. So could you talk a little bit more about how do you improve from here? Because is part of the reinsurance program is going to be more efficient because \u2013 and also on the G&A expense side?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Peter?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Sure. Kai, I think you have to start in North America and the Personal Insurance. And so we decided to strategically reposition the portfolio. And we had two significant wins in the travel in the end of last year that is starting to earn into 2018.","And what's going to happen is we're going to see the acquisition expenses increase as a result of that change of mix of business. We also divested a business in 2017 as well.","What you can't really see is that will improve the loss ratio in North America Personal Insurance. It's not obvious this quarter, because of what Sid pointed out on the non-cat winter storm. And there was a little bit more frequency in large losses within those winter storms. And so that masked the improvement we'll see in the loss ratio.","So you should expect that the acquisition expenses that have increased will maintain, but will improve the loss ratio in North America as you look out to the next three quarters for the full year.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. My follow-up question on buybacks. Brian, you mentioned before you would prefer profitable growth versus share buybacks. And this quarter you guys bought back $300 million at the $55.41 each. So could you talk about what's your framework in deciding like when or how much to buy back?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","That's an interesting question, Kai. Yes. So, yes, I did buy back stock and we did. I said to you I would prefer to use our capital \u2013 and we're generating great capital here \u2013 to reinvest in the company. And that is add to capabilities and put in new capabilities, diversify. And I'll continue to look for that.","But it is a capital management tool, and we'll continue to use it. And we'll evaluate the circumstances as they arise to decide whether or not this is the time to buy back stock. But it is a tool and we do use it and I have used it before, may use it again. Thanks, Kai.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Next question?","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. A question for Kevin. With the changes in the Fiduciary Rule, do you see this having an impact on sales in the near term for Annuities?","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Jay. I think that if the changes that the Fifth Circuit have come up with hold up, the big positive is the elimination of the overhang of litigation as a resolution mechanism for this best interest contract, which I think will be a generally positive thing.","But there's still a lot of moving parts. You have the SEC, which has weighed in with its proposal. We have certain of the states that are pursuing best interest standards, et cetera. And so we're focused on independent distribution. We're working closely with our distribution partners and working with them in terms of how they respond.","The reality is there's still uncertainty as to what the future environment is going to be. And I believe that as long as that uncertainty is there, there's going to be some overhang.","That being said, conditions are certainly improving with interest rates coming up a little bit. Products are becoming a little bit more attractive to investors and also some of the recent volatility in the equity markets has reminded people of the value of certain characteristics of our products and income benefits.","So we do see conditions improving. Index sales are doing very well. VA sales have essentially stabilized. And as you know, we're very responsive in fixed annuity to current conditions.","So I believe we're as well positioned or better positioned than anyone to respond where investor appetites go. But I don't think there's going to be an immediate change in the environment simply because of the Fifth Circuit ruling.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Well, moving in the right direction is good. Thanks, Kevin.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Jay. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Hi. Thank you. I have one big picture question, and then I think Ryan Tunis has a specific question on P&C.","Well, I guess one thing I hear from investors is confusion a little bit about the intermediate term financial targets for the company, and what AIG's profitability and returns can look like two years down the road when the actions you're taking now are really all reflected in results.","So I don't know if you have plans for an Investor Day to discuss this in detail. But just any perspective on the level of ROE you think AIG can deliver over time and the key levers to getting there would be helpful.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, thanks, Erik. I don't have plans for an Investor Day. I'll certainly think about that.","But to talk about this, let's take the combined ratio going under 100%. I think you can do the arithmetic and figure out what additional profits we would be making with that improvement. If you take that number alone and put it against what our capital is, the ROEs we would be generating would be high single-digit for sure. And I've given you that as, call it, an intermediate target.","And I also expressed that we want to be top quartile in terms of combined ratios and that includes expenses. Expense levels are too high. We want to be top quartile in our expense levels. We should be the most efficient. We're big enough to be taking advantage of our scale. So we should be much, much better in terms of our expense levels. We're going to get there, all right. But you can work out the arithmetic on the ROEs.","Book value growth is the other number. So I mentioned three things, right? Combined ratio is under 100%, ROEs and growth in book value. And I think if you just do the intermediate, you're going to get a pretty good idea of what that would imply and then if you get past that to top quartile, I think these are pretty good numbers as targets. I mean if we achieve them, they're world-class. But, in the meantime, just getting to a combined ratio of 100% is going to produce a pretty good ROE. I hope that helps Erik.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","It does. Thanks. And just one clarification. I mean how do you define top quartile ROE and kind of what's the peer set? Is it kind of a blend of P&C and life companies?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","No, well, I'm talking about \u2013 well on ROE, yes, I think it would have to be. I mean we are a composite company and so we have to consider ourselves in that way. It would have to be yes.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","And I was just curious, on the exit run rate, are you more confident from an accident year standpoint or a calendar year standpoint? That was my first one. And then just trying to understand, thinking about this whole exit run rate concept, I guess why that really represents progress in 2018, because I guess it looks like last year you did like a 102.4 accident year combined ratio and on the new AAL that seems like that would be closer to a 101. And now it feels like there's some reserve releases coming through. So it kind of feels like we're already at 100. So are we right to kind of think that the exit run rate guidance means they were kind of trading sideways through 2018 and then 2019 is the year where we really see meaningful improvement? Thanks.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","That's a good question. Well remember, there's two things. There's the expenses too which we've got to get down, so there's going to be meaningful improvement in the expense levels. I think there was a question about what the exit 2017 accident year was. I think it's a little higher than that. So we're looking at an improvement, in the accident year a meaningful improvement and the accident year ratio is not going sideways and an expense level improvement, that's what we're talking about. Okay. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much. Given the challenges we saw in Unum share price performance yesterday, does AIG have any legacy long-term care exposure?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","We have a very \u2013 hey, Jay, it's Sid. We have a very small portfolio in the Legacy. It's about $400 million. The sensitivity analysis that we've run is that if everybody lived to the end of the mortality table, our reserves would double. So you have $100 million in actives and then $300 million in the remainder. So it's a relatively small portfolio and we don't have those issues in long-term care.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","And we believe what we're carrying is correct.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Absolutely.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good to know. Thank you. And then switching gears on the adverse development cover with Berkshire, you mentioned that it could pierce the $25 billion level where Berkshire would start paying around mid-2020 which is consistent with our view. How long do you think it could take for Berkshire to exhaust its $25 billion cover beyond 2020?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Sid, you want to try that one?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Well, I mean we can't comment on Berkshire's projections. I think what we can tell you is and I made a comment about quarter-to-quarter they're going to be variance in paid claims because of the mix of business. So remember based on our projections you have some business that's shorter term in that ADC and some that's longer term. So some of the stuff like excess casualty and workers' comp, there'll be paid claims out 20, 30 years. So that's important for people to keep in mind as they look at what happens in the quarterly paid claims. That's why we assess this on how are we looking versus what we thought inception to date and we feel very good about that metric.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. I appreciate that. Thanks. And then a final one. Just want to circle back on the ROE. Is there any reason over time why AIG should not be able to deliver the 10% or better return on equity whether you're looking at that on book value ex AOCI, ex DTA or some other baseline?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, look, we have a very good ROE in Life, we believe that's maintainable. The General Insurance requires us to start making underwriting profit. Once we get into that area, we will start to generate numbers in that range. So what holds us back? Make an underwriting profit. There's no earthly reason why we can't make an underwriting profit and we will and so we'll get to those ROEs.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay, Jay.","Elizabeth A. Werner - American International Group, Inc.","Hey, everyone, as a gentlemen reminder, one question and one follow-up would be ideal. Thank you.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay. Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. We'll next move to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, good morning, everyone. In some ways I congratulate you on lowering your catastrophe exposure on an AAL basis, but AIG has a huge balance sheet and huge reserve position. Shouldn't AIG be willing to tolerate normal level catastrophes, the move from expecting $1 billion per year to $700 million per year, what's the reason behind that and why did that create shareholder value?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","That's a great question. Well, first of all, our catastrophe cover last year did not respond to the worst catastrophe event. Now, we have a good balance sheet, we withstood that. I don't think that's a good use of capital. And so we made the decision to use reinsurance to balance that portfolio so we take the extremes out. I think that's a good trade. I'd make that trade every day. Now, we do have a good balance sheet, there's no question about it. But I'm also in a business of protecting that, so that we can grow this book, use the capital for profitable growth and so that's why it's very good for the shareholder.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And if you change up your reinsurance at 1\/1 this year that means the cover is going to be earned through over time I guess? Does that mean we should see further reduction in the AAL over time as the net premiums written from 2017 go off and are greater with the net premiums written in 2018?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Peter, take that please?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Sure. No, it should be fairly steady throughout the remaining part of the calendar year. That will depend largely on, not from an AAL basis, but how the portfolio shifts. But based on what we see today where we're growing that, we expect that the earned portion of the property cat will be quarter-to-quarter, but offsetting that will be \u2013 we had a large session in our excess of loss casualty placement and that we discontinued last year. And so we'll be getting more earned premium back on the Casualty, so it'll largely offset it in terms of the overall financial results within North America for Commercial.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay. Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning. Peter, from your comments it sounded like Casualty was favorable. So just curious if you could comment on what really pressured results in North American Commercial and would you say the actions you've taken so far are enough? Or do we need to see more remediation efforts here in terms of \u2013 in response to the results you saw in the quarter?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Let me take that Brian?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, Peter I think \u2013 yes, go ahead.","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Okay. So, let me just talk about Casualty for a second and just give you some insight overall for the company. If you look at International when we saw the accident year loss ratio improve, that was from some of the reinsurance actions we took at 1\/1 because last year it was a little choppy in terms of the results, but we had some losses that pierced some higher levels that we hadn't seen in the past. So we put in excess of loss treaty together for our International Casualty and that's where you're seeing the improvement in the accident year loss ratios in 2018 and expect that to continue in the rest of the calendar year.","In terms of North America, we're not done. I mean I think we've made some very good improvements in how we're looking at gross lines, net lines, looking at businesses where we think we have a real leadership position and can really differentiate ourselves in the marketplace, that's just begun. So I expect us to be improving every quarter throughout this year and next year as we reposition the portfolio looking at excess casualty, looking at financial lines.","One of the businesses that Brian's mentioned in the past that we stood up first was Agram (49:40), which is our large account business that has really accelerated. We're seeing a lot more submission activity and expect to see opportunities for profitable growth there and so this will be \u2013 we've made progress. We're going to make more progress and this is going to be an iterative process throughout the calendar year.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Yes. If I could just add a little color. So if you look at our PEs, whatever, you're going to see a fairly high loss ratios in Casualty. We've had high loss ratios in Casualty. We have stability in the reserves. In fact we've seen some redundancies coming out of that. I think that's good, but the Casualty remains too high. There's no question about it.","A lot of it is excess and you don't fix excess by price. It's a high severity low frequency book. Now price matters don't get me wrong, but selection, attachment, terms and conditions, you fix the excess book by not having losses. You don't price it up. You cut the losses out and so much of our work is around that and so whether it's the risk management book or it's the excess casualty or even in the D&O. We're taking a lot of time and effort to fix that book, but we're not, as Peter said, we're not done with Casualty, but we're on our way.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","And just, Brian, in response to that, just as a follow-up, related to that process, is that a \u2013 a lot of it gets done by the end of 2018? Or you think this is like, takes a couple of years? In terms of the action, not the result?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Yes, exactly. That's the nuance of this thing. I think the actions we're taking now become effective, okay? Now, when it's excess of loss, one should be a little bit more cautious, because the best book in the world and the worst book in the world look exactly the same when they start out, because the losses take a little while to get reported. And so we know we're doing the right thing, but we'll take a little time to verify it.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, thanks.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","You're welcome, Tom. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. We'll next hear from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning. Maybe a little bit more on just the general competitive situation in the Property Casualty business. A lot of what I get in terms of pushback from investors is that, regardless of the actions, the market with less price increases than we expected simply will not let AIG implement what they want in the fashion that they want. What's your response to that kind of thought that maybe the \u2013 just the environment has changed? And that's just not going to help you where you need to go?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Let me start and then maybe Peter can correct me if I get it wrong. But anyway, so, look, and I think generally speaking, there's probably more tailwind than headwind. Now, it may not be as strong as one would like in certain lines of business, but it's actually more positive than I think I'm hearing there.","Now, I do think the industry needs to continue to improve and the rates are required, but it's not like we're going against the movement. So it helps. I think in Property, we are getting rate increases.","The fixing of this portfolio, whether it's Property or Casualty, short or long, right, has a lot more to do with who we write and how we write it and less to do with the price, believe it or not. In other words, I believe that we can have a profitable book in any weather condition, let's say, but it takes some discipline.","I talked about the Casualty just a second ago. You don't fix this excess book with price. You fix it because you write the right accounts and you write them the right way, so that it truly is an occasional event. That's an act that we're prepared to cover.","So I think we have the ability to look at our book and fix our book, and we're fixing our book. But I don't think that the conditions in the marketplace are holding us back. Peter, you want to add to that?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","The only thing I would add, Brian, is that we are not competing in the commoditized market, where I think that's where those comments resonate.","We are in a segmented market where leadership matters. AIG has the expertise and leadership. And when we go to our new organizational structure, we're going to really be focused on how we face off with clients and distribution and play to our strengths. So I think that they look to us to lead. They look for us to help with risk. And they look for us to structure deals. And I think that's what differentiates our ability to get rate.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay, Paul?","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yes, that's great. My second question has nothing to do with P&C. There seemed to be an enormous number of people looking to buy blocks of annuities. And it seemed to be growing every month. What's the situation in terms of what you'd be interested in in terms of divesting? At least in the life sides (55:06) or blocks at this point, given all the changes that have been made in the last year or two?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Kev?","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Yes. So, look, we worked hard on the portfolio the last couple of years and believe we have a market leading position with our distribution organization, our leading product positions in all three of the retail annuity spaces in Group Retirement and a very strong position in Institutional Markets. So we have no intention other than being disciplined in deploying capital into growth opportunities, which as I mentioned earlier, conditions are improving in the markets.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","And, Paul, it's Sid here. We've been pretty clear and consistent that the remaining portfolio that we're evaluating is Legacy and that's DSA Re. And we're going to continue to evaluate and we're pleased with the progress that we've made in standing up that entity.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Yes. Okay. Thanks, Paul. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody. So one question regarding the combined ratio target for \u2013 exit target for 2018. Is that predicated on growth in net premiums earned, or at the very least, stability there?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, we said we think \u2013 we believe that our premium levels will stabilize this year over last, okay. Now we're down about 10%, something like that in the first quarter. So we would expect an improvement in that. So there'll be some lift, some of it's because we're recapturing some of the Casualty business, some of it is natural growth. So we'll see some improvement. And that's embedded in what we're talking about.","But there isn't some massive increase in production that's going to get us to where we want to go. We're going to get it by evaluating our portfolio and doing the proper underwriting on it.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then maybe shifting gears a second to the Life and Retirement business. So I think I heard a comment about the ROE, the strong ROEs that that business is producing being sustainable. I'm just thinking about the very strong equity markets that we've seen the last few years. And they clearly were a positive for an AUM oriented fee business. If those equity markets maybe stabilize or go back to their more normalized appreciation rate, do you think that that ROE still is a reasonable run rate?","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Yes, Yaron. Thanks. First thing I'd point out is, is that we did have this quarter the $54 million in the non-recurring payments on structured securities as we pointed out. We would not necessarily expect that to continue, but otherwise the excess market performance and the fee income is a modest part of what's been contributing to that ROE. I think what's more important is the overall blend of where equity markets are, where interest rates are, where our investors believe they're going to go and what alternatives it is that they have.","And as I pointed out, we are in a somewhat unique position. We can deploy capital into Index Annuities right now because we have the distribution mechanism to do it. If the conditions for Fixed Annuities improve, we'll be able to deploy more capital into that than we are right now and we also have the Group Retirement business. Let's not forget about the strong growth in the Life Insurance business which is attractive new business conditions. And we've proven that with the discipline and the selection in the pension risk transfer and the Institutional Markets business we're able to find transactions that meet our economic expectations as well as STAT and GAAP requirements.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Okay.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you.

Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our progress this quarter and the continued execution of our strategic plan. We reported third quarter operating EPS of $1 a share, a solid result despite volatility from our review of our longevity assumptions and certain segments of our Commercial business. I'm pleased that we maintained our strong position in our Life and Retirement segments, and delivered another strong quarter in Personal Insurance. I remain highly focused on the continued improvement of our commercial underwriting, and believe we're taking appropriate actions. Sid and Rob will speak to the specifics of our reserves and underwriting strategy in their remarks.","Since the second quarter, we announced or completed five strategic and complex transactions. These actions are increasing the sustainability of AIG's earnings and are reshaping the company. During our January strategy update, we discussed our focus on targeting geographies and segments with critical mass and expertise, while improving our multinational capabilities. The Fairfax transaction is the most recent example of executing on this strategy.","The transaction required the extraordinary effort of our employees across two continents, 12 countries, and required the close and timely coordination with over 20 different regulators. The transaction is expected to consolidate our network partners, and reinforce our commitment to servicing our multinational clients in over 200 countries and jurisdictions without the need for bricks and mortars in every location. As we committed to you in January, we are narrowing our focus on those countries where we have opportunities to improve our ROE. We're also highly focused on disruption in the market and our future growth opportunities.","During the third quarter, we announced the launch of our technology-driven solution to serve the $80 billion U.S. small-to-middle-market. AIG, Hamilton Insurance and Two Sigma joined together to form Attune. Attune will partner with retail and wholesale intermediaries, and offer small businesses, a broader and more flexible range of products through a technology-enabled platform. Through the combination of Hamilton's small business expertise, AIG's scale, extensive data and long-standing distribution network, and Two Sigma's technology and data science capabilities, Attune can offer a powerful, disruptive solution to the small business market.","In addition to our actions to simplify AIG, our expense discipline continued this quarter. Through the nine months, we are ahead of our 6% planned reduction with a 10% decline in operating GOE, excluding any foreign exchange effect and the impact of the sale of the AIG Advisor Group. We expect expense reductions to extend into 2017 and remain ahead of plan as a result of actions taken across the company. The normalized return on equity was 7.1% for the quarter and 8.3% for the nine months. Third quarter normalized return on equity reflects our seasonally high expected third quarter cat losses.","Our operating improvements and return of capital will continue to positively impact ROE, and we're on track to deliver full-year normalized ROE in our targeted range of 8.4% to 8.9%. We will provide greater insight into our confidence in reaching our 2017 financial targets at our upcoming Investor Day. We continue to shape the company to deliver more sustainable, higher-quality earnings, and remain focused on meeting our two-year strategic objectives. Our results and the strength of our relationships with customers and partners in the industry are positive indications of our progress and the foundation we're building for the long-term success of AIG.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Sid.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results including noteworthy items, strategic transactions and capital management.","Turning to slide four, our core operating earnings improved from the same period last year as the decline in the Commercial accident year loss ratio has adjusted, expense discipline across AIG and improved alternative investment returns all meaningfully contributed to the improvement in performance. Looking ahead, while we're only one month into the fourth quarter, our early estimate of losses from Hurricane Matthew is about $250 million, roughly two-thirds of which relates to Commercial and one-third relates to Consumer.","Operating results also reflected two adverse impacts of note. First, we took a loss recognition charge of $622 million related to longevity experience studies, which indicated increased longevity, particularly on disabled lives on a legacy block of structured settlements underwritten pre-2010. This legacy block accounted for over 80% of the $622 million charge. As we told you on our January 26 strategy update, these assets and liabilities will be reported in the legacy portfolio when we release our fourth quarter recast of results.","Shifting to our operating portfolio actuarial updates, we recorded net charges totaling $24 million. We recorded a benefit of $238 million for our operating Consumer Life and Retirement businesses due largely to lower fixed annuity surrender assumptions, partially offset by an increase in reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees. Offsetting this, we recorded $262 million of total prior-year adverse reserve development net of premium adjustments, which largely related to our U.S. program business within specialty. Rob will comment further on this review and the underwriting actions that we've taken on our U.S. program book.","During the quarter, we announced the sale of UGC to Arch Capital Group, and have included an overview of the transaction on slide six. AIG will retain the attractive economics associated with our 50% quota share reinsurance agreement on business written by UGC, and are reporting the earnings in Commercial Insurance. This quota share covers business written during the 2014 to 2016 accident years and we expect the average annual pre-tax earnings from the quota share will be approximately $150 million for 2017 and 2018, and will decline thereafter.","The remaining operating results of UGC, which is held for sale on the balance sheet, are being reported in Corporate and Other up to the closing date. We anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter ideally, or early in the first quarter. We expect to receive $2.2 billion in cash proceeds at closing, an additional $250 million pre-closing dividend, as well as approximately 9% of Arch's common shares. In addition, as part of the transaction UGC's tax attribute deferred tax assets remain with AIG. Note, this quarter we also began reporting Institutional Markets' results in Corporate and Other, as the vast majority of this business will be reported in Legacy beginning in the fourth quarter.","Slide seven shows recent strategic transactions and their estimated impact on our 2017 results. While there's a modest earnings impact from these transactions, each transaction is accretive to our overall ROE. Rob and Kevin will speak to the strategic rationale for the Commercial and Consumer transactions. Consistent with our capital plan, we completed a Life Reinsurance transaction late in the quarter that resulted in the distribution of approximately $1 billion of excess statutory capital from our U.S. life companies to AIG Parent.","This is our first completed Life Reinsurance transaction towards our goal of freeing up $4 billion to $5 billion of capital by the end of 2017. We remain focused and confident on executing on the additional Life Reinsurance transactions. The earnings impact from this transaction will be reported in next quarter's new legacy module, as it largely related to Legacy Whole Life and universal life business.","Turning to slide eight. As Peter stated, we are ahead of plan on expenses and continue to expect to exceed the 6% targeted GOE decline for the full year. Our expense reduction targets are carefully aligned against our projections of new business volumes to meet our objective of improving operating leverage. We took additional pre-tax restructuring charges of $210 million during the quarter relating to our ongoing efficiency program, which we expect will generate an additional $400 million of run rate expense savings. We expect to exceed our two-year expense reduction target.","Slide nine details the 120-basis point expansion in normalized ROE for the quarter. This improvement reflected the active return of capital to shareholders as well as continued improvement in normalized operating results and reflects our seasonally high cat loss expectation in the third quarter, which was greater than reported 3Q cat losses. Our year-to-date normalized ROE is 8.3% and we continue to expect to achieve our full-year normalized ROE target of at least 8.4%.","Slide 10 shows the drivers of book value per share ex-AOCI and DTA, and including dividend growth, which grew 1% during the quarter and 5% year-to-date, reflecting operating earnings and accretive share repurchases.","Turning to capital on slide 11. We continue to execute against our capital return target and we are confident we are on track to meet our targets. We've returned $9.8 million of capital to shareholders for the first nine months of the year. During the quarter, we deployed about $2.3 billion towards the repurchase of almost 40 million common shares. Since quarter end and through November 2, we repurchased an additional $946 million of common shares, leaving about $1.4 billion unused under the current authorization plus an additional $3 billion from the new authorization that we just announced.","Our balance sheet and free cash flow remains very strong. And as you can see on slide 12, Parent liquidity at quarter end was $8.6 billion, above our targeted range of $6 billion to $8 billion, and reflects the timing of insurance company dividends received late in the quarter.","In addition to the Life Reinsurance transaction, we also monetized $900 million of legacy assets during the quarter, or $5.2 billion over the last four quarters. These proceeds have partially funded capital return to shareholders. And when considering announced but not closed transactions, we expect to well exceed the $5 billion to $7 billion funding target from divestitures that we outlined in our January 26 strategic update.","We also announced that we reduced our hedge fund allocation by about half, which we expect would free up $2 billion of capital towards our capital return target by the end of 2017. We've reduced our hedge fund portfolio by $2.7 billion for the first nine months of the year, which has freed up approximately $800 million in capital in our life companies, which has come up to the holding company in the form of dividend payments. As Peter stated, we're focused on the continued execution of our strategic plan and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress at our upcoming Investor Day.","Now, with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we remained focused on our strategy to improve underwriting results and create a stronger, more valuable Commercial Insurance business. Our strategy recognizes the importance of managing both the adjusted accident year loss ratio and expense ratio, and this quarter we saw improvement in both. We will have quarterly variability in each component of the adjusted accident year combined ratio, but we expect the net result will continue to improve.","Turning to slide 14. The adjusted accident year loss ratio declined 1.9 points during the third quarter, reflecting continued improvement in U.S. casualty. The UGC quota share agreement contributed to the improvement over prior year by 0.4 points in the third quarter or 0.3 points year-to-date.","Moving to expenses. The 1.9 point expense ratio improvement exceeded the prior-year quarter despite lower net premiums earned. We expect expenses to continue to decline, but similar to the loss ratio, the expense ratio will fluctuate around a downward trend line. Globally, rates were down less than a point with a marginal increase in the U.S. and more aggressive competition internationally. In the U.S., casualty rates increased 3.5 points, representing the fourth consecutive quarter with rate increases in excess of three points, and specialty rates increased 2.5 points. Partially offsetting those increases was continued pressure in property of approximately four points driven primarily by excess and surplus lines.","In certain segments, we're seeing fewer high-quality new business opportunities, and therefore, have maintained our discipline as we deploy our capital where we will meet or exceed our targeted rate of return. We're pleased that we continue to grow in our focus growth segments year-to-date despite competitive market conditions. In prioritizing our valued multiline client relationships, retention for major clients has remained consistent with prior levels at 94%. As an example, multinational global policies grew 8%, reflecting our multiyear investment to provide world-class solutions for clients across the globe.","As Peter mentioned, an important part of the Fairfax transaction is Fairfax will act as our strategic network partner to serve multinational clients in all 12 countries included in the deal.","This follows a similar transaction completed with Grupo ASSA in Central America last year, and signifies an enhanced strategy to better serve our multinational clients in over 200 countries and jurisdictions through what we consider to be the best combination of owned operations and strong strategic partners in the industry.","Turning to third quarter calendar year results, cat losses were better than our average annual loss expectation but higher than prior-year, and as Sid mentioned, the U.S. programs business resulted in a commercial net reserve strengthening of $306 million. Our U.S. programs business consists of $1.1 billion of annual net premiums written, spanning across 108 program segments and 41 program administrators.","This business is written via managing general agents for predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises, and third-party administrators handle over half of the claims activity. Prior-year development was driven by higher-than-expected loss emergence in the most recent calendar year from a subset of these programs.","We've now completed a detailed segmentation of the entire programs booked as part of a broader, more holistic assessment of the business we transact with managing general agents. Through the review, we identified the programs we're seeking to grow, improve, remediate or terminate based on our profitability criteria, and we terminated 16 program segments with net premiums written totaling approximately $200 million as a result. We estimate approximately 80% of the programs business reserve charge relates to programs where we've initiated termination or were in the process of remediating.","The purpose of evaluating our managing general agent relationships has been to determine where we wish to focus our resources, reposition relationships and better align incentives. The sale of our interest in Ascot and MSM, which we announced earlier this quarter, are examples of ROE-accretive repositioning, where we will opportunistically partner with these franchises that bring highly specialized expertise and diversification benefit to create a greater long-term value for AIG.","Now turning to slide 15. The year-to-date adjusted accident year loss ratio of 64.1% improved 2.1 points from the full-year 2015, excluding the UGC quota share benefit. The remainder of my comments will exclude the benefit to provide an apples-to-apples comparison of our performance to the strategic targets we set in January.","While the chart at the top right side of the page demonstrates the quarter-to-quarter variability of losses, I'm pleased with the overall improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio trendline. Our ability to manage expenses, combined with the loss ratio improvement, resulted in an adjusted accident year combined ratio improvement of 3.1 points. This quarter, we experienced more pronounced volatility in our short tail lines, which adversely impacted Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio by approximately 2 points.","One point was attributable to increasing the current accident year loss fix, following our view of the U.S. Programs business. And the other point was related to higher property attritional losses. Although third quarter severe losses were significantly lower than prior year, Property's attritional loss ratio was the second-highest result over the past 12 quarters due to the claims frequency that was greater than the norm.","During the past several years, we've made several significant changes to structurally improve the quality of our Property portfolio, including our shift from excess and surplus lines to highly engineered risks in the expansion of our use of reinsurance. However, as we've said in the past, we do not expect our path to be linear. We believe accepting a reasonable degree of variability in quarterly results is the right business decision, and we have the ability to course-correct as business and market conditions change.","Given our actions in the first nine months of the year, we're continuing to target a run rate adjusted accident year loss ratio reduction of 4 points, recognizing, as we saw this quarter, with respect to short tail property losses, our results are subject to volatility. We remain committed to our target of a 6-point run rate reduction in the adjusted accident year loss ratio by the end of 2017.","As shown on slide 16, we continue to make significant progress in optimizing our portfolio to reduce the adjusted accident year loss ratio. Overall, we're pleased with the pace of improvement in our mix of business written through the first nine months of the year, which will earn in over future periods. In closing, although we faced some headwinds this quarter, I'm proud of the progress our team has made, improving our portfolio, managing expenses and proactively seeking out value-enhancing opportunities. Reflecting on our work over the past 10 months, I am confident in this team's ability to execute our strategy.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, I'm pleased to report that each of our consumer insurance businesses performed well during the quarter, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance businesses. Importantly, each of our businesses is executing on our strategic priorities and are focused on value creation, as I will discuss.","First, let me make a few introductory comments. In Retirement, I am proud to say that our strong diversification has made AIG the largest provider of annuities in the U.S. in the first half of the year. While we hold a top five sales ranking in each of variable index and fixed annuities, and we are the only company to hold a top five sales ranking in more than any one of these lines, our focus is on value over volume, and we continue to maintain vigorous pricing discipline facilitated by our lack of dependence on any one product.","In Personal Insurance, we continue to execute on our focused strategy. We are on track to meet our target state of 15 individual and 35 group countries by the end of 2017, and the most recent announcement with Fairfax Financial is a further key step to achieving our goal. The benefits from these actions are beginning to emerge and will continue to evolve over the coming years. Most importantly, we are preserving our ability to serve our multinational customers and covered individuals through our strategic network partners.","In U.S. Personal Insurance, our private client group is implementing a market-competitive end-to-end platform to build on the double-digit growth that we've been generating, which will further improve the customer and distributor experience, and create operational efficiencies through automation and self-servicing. In Japan, we remain focused on transforming the business, delivering improved results, executing on our customer value proposition, all while we are preparing for the successful execution of the legal merger.","During the quarter, J.D. Power Auto Consumer Satisfaction survey awarded Fuji Fire and Marine with the number one ranking in shopping satisfaction and AIU with the number one ranking in relationship satisfaction in the market. We also now average over 20,000 independent Japanese agents using our new technology front-end platform on a daily basis.","Now, I will briefly discuss the results for the quarter. Turning to Retirement on slide 18, in the quarter we saw lower Retirement sales from a year ago, reflecting an industry-wide slowdown in variable annuity sales from the uncertainty caused by the DOL fiduciary rule and market volatility. These challenges validate our strategy of offering a broad portfolio of product solutions to meet our clients' needs.","We have been proactive in updating our variable annuity product features and taking pricing actions to maintain our returns in the continuing low interest rate environment. With respect to the DOL rule, we remain in active discussions with our distribution partners and are confident that we will be prepared to support them under a broad spectrum of chosen paths for implementation.","Fixed Annuity sales and net flows declined, reflecting our ongoing Fixed Annuity pricing discipline in the current investment rate and credit spread environment. Maintaining our Fixed Annuity pricing and asset quality focus remains a priority as we seek value over volume. Group Retirement benefited from strong deposits and lower surrenders, resulting in improved net flows.","While these results reflect the investments we've made in the business, including our client-focused technology platform, competition in this space remains robust. We do expect to see more planned conversions in the fourth quarter, which is standard for the defined contribution market, including both large plan acquisitions and large case group surrenders.","As you can see on slide 19, we continue to maintain our discipline in managing credit (24:48) rates and net spreads. Trends in the quarterly reported base yields and spreads are impacted by volatility associated with bond accretion and commercial loan prepayment income. Looking forward, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our net spreads will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter.","Turning to slide 20, growth in International Life sales drove an increase in premiums and deposits of 10% from the same period last year on a constant-dollar basis. Growth in U.S. Life sales reflects our focus on term life, where we are again a top five term writer and also number one in direct term sales in the first six months of the year. Change in our product mix demonstrates our commitment to the value of new business as we have increased our focus on products without long-duration interest rate guarantees. Our positive sales trends at Life also reflect the evolution of our distribution strategy and further developments of our independent distribution network.","Operating comparisons for Life benefited from continuing favorable mortality experience, expense management and improved investment returns. We also continue to make progress in the transactions supporting our previously announced plans to reinsure our remaining redundant reserves.","As Sid mentioned, we completed our first Life Reinsurance transaction during the quarter. This was an extremely large and complex transaction, and I would like to thank Charlie Shamieh and the whole legacy team for their discipline and focus throughout the transaction process. I am confident, that supported by this team, we will continue to meet our targets for the remaining Life Reinsurance transactions.","Turning to slide 21, Personal Insurance reported another strong quarter of operating performance. The operating improvement reflected our strategic actions to reduce expenses, including direct marketing costs as well as early emergence of operating benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets. We did see a higher number of large but not severe losses in the quarter than a year ago.","However, the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, was only slightly above our expectations. Expenses continued to be a key lever to future margin expansion and Personal Insurance, but as I have said, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments, including in Japan.","To close, I'm pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic priorities across all of our consumer businesses, and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan.","Now, I would like to turn it back to Liz, to open up to Q&A.","Elizabeth A. Werner - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you. And in this morning, we'd like to follow format of one question with one follow-up, please, and then just get back into queue. We would like to open our lines up at this time, operator, for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Arman Cohen - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","I just want to ask about the reserve charge in the Program business. You talked about doing sort of a deeper dive into that business this quarter. I guess the assumption that we had was that you had done a pretty deep dive into everything at year-end 2015. So, my question is, are there still other businesses that you need to dive in a little deeper to?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Jay, it's Rob. From an underwriting perspective, as you know \u2013 so I'll comment on underwriting and let Sid comment about reserves. But from an underwriting perspective, the way we'll drive our 6-point improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio is by digging deeper into all elements of the Commercial portfolio focused on the value of our volume exercises.","So, in 2016, this is one of the areas where we focused, and consistent within actions you've already seen us take this year, the fact that we terminated 16 programs is very consistent with the actions we took with respect to our Environmental Solution Legal Liability business in the U.S. and Canada earlier this year, and the buffer trucking where, what we believe that a business is not a business that will add value to AIG. We've proved that we're willing to step away from it. I'll let Sid comment about the reserves.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, Jay, I think as we've said before, we review all of our reserve segments annually so actually in 2015 programs was reviewed midway through the year. We did not observe any significant adverse claim activity, which is important to know. Now, during the first half of 2016, as Rob noted, and I think the team did an excellent job on a deep dive underwriting review, we noted calendar year loss emergence for the most recent accident years that indicated we need to strengthen the program reserves. So, that's really the backdrop on Programs.","Jay Arman Cohen - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. The other question was on the direct marketing expense which came down quite a bit. Did you see those reductions have any impact on revenue production?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, Jay, our change in strategy in direct marketing primarily focus on Japan, where you may recall we made an announcement about a year ago that we were teasing (30:34) direct marketing in the American Home business and focusing that activity in our Life Insurance platform, Fuji Life, in Japan. So we have seen a reduction in the production in the supplemental health business in American Home in Japan concomitant with that reduction in direct marketing expenses, and we are focusing on independent distribution channels in terms of new business in Japan.","Jay Arman Cohen - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","And the next question is from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, with those reserve points addressed, I guess, one question I had is on the underlying combined \u2013 as the underlying profitability in your four, sort of, subsegments. So 70% of your business, International consumer in North America, Commercial did okay this quarter, where the other 30%, which is International Commercial and North America consumer, did really poorly at these versus our estimates. And this isn't the first time those two areas have shown difficulty.","So, what is adequate profitability in those segments? What you doing to get there? And how long is it going to take? And would you consider selling pieces or all of those businesses if parts of them that remain challenged aren't able to remediate?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","Mike, I'll take that. I think that the way you're segmenting the business is not the way we run the business. And so we try to make very clear in our January strategy update our forward-looking segmentation to help you think about valuation and adequate profitability as you put it in two broad segments \u2013 Legacy and Operating. And within the Operating, that helps you estimate what our sustainable ROE will be, and hence, what kind of our multiple on earnings you think we might deserve.","And in the Legacy, I think it's very clear that sizable chunk of equity is \u2013 about a quarter of the company's equity at the beginning of this year had a very suboptimal return, about 3% return on equity. And therefore, as you get to understand the Legacy better, you figure out what kind of discount to the current book value you need as to anchor your valuation from.","So, I'm feeling really good right now about the returns on the aggregate of all of our operating businesses with a forward-looking basis, and I think the big question mark is how quickly and at how big a discount to book value we can divest or reinsure the legacy book? And I think getting into the subsegments as you have, I don't think it's a practical way.","When we're looking at divestitures, it's very focused on the Legacy and focused on the most efficient way to cleanse the earnings picture with those sub-standard returns so that we can focus our energy on a sustainable return on the operating business. So I think that's the way we look at it. And I don't know if there are any detailed comments on the segments that either Rob or Kevin would like to make.","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","So, Mike, it's Rob. I'll just make a couple quick thoughts. First of all, as it relates to the adjusted accident year loss ratio in Commercial, I'll just restate I'm absolutely confident that we're making the important changes that we've got to make to deliver on our commitment to improve the loss ratio by 6 points. And I probably would point to four quick observations.","First, we've absolutely demonstrated the willingness to reduce our premium ratings as we retain the business that we think is important for us to remain focused on our valued client segments. But we've been doing this very consistently throughout the year. You can see that our premium volume in the first nine months of the year is down 16%, including, of course, the effective reinsurance.","The second point that I'd make is that, as we show on page 16 of the presentation, the accident year loss ratio dispersion chart shows that we're driving improvements in the mix of business in a very material way. And to put this in context for you, the Remediate and Improve portions of our portfolio have declined by one-third on a dollar basis, from $7.5 billion of premiums in the first nine months of 2015 to $5.1 billion of premium in the first nine months of 2016, showing that where we're reducing premiums is in the Remediate and Improve portions of the portfolio. Actually, in the Grow and Maintain portions of the portfolio, Product Set 1 and Product Set 2A, our premium volume is approximately flat. It's down just about 2%.","I'm going to turn it to Kevin for anything further.","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I think across the board in Personal Insurance, we've actually enjoyed quite strong margin expansion, including in North America. And in fact, our adjusted combined ratio has improved from 95.9% last year to 92.4% this year, which may be seeming, however, in the loss ratio is that in the third quarter, whilst we have quite a bit of consistency quarter-to-quarter, there is a little bit of volatility. We did have a number of losses that were large, over 2 million, but not quite at the severe level in the third quarter, whereas in the first two quarters, there were really an absence of those. So year-to-date, frankly, we are pretty much where we had expected to be in terms of the loss ratio.","Consistent with what we've done in the rest of Personal Insurance, in the North American portfolio, we have worked hard on remediating certain areas of the business, including particularly the warranty, which process is now complete. And we're seeing quite a strong growth in our Private Client Group business, which is one of our leading businesses. So we're quite comfortable with the direction we're going in PI, including the very strong North American franchise.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then maybe, Sid, if I could follow up on your capital management comments. You said that we're seeing the disposition dollars are adding up, but you said, or at least the presentation implied, that you have further confidence in the $25 billion. Sort of adding up all the pieces, I would seem to get above that number. Can you help us reconcile those two points?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Well, I think if you go back to the funding page that we shared with you back in January, we see ourselves as on track on each of those buckets in the funding page. Clearly, from a divestiture standpoint, you can see what we've done both on legacy sales where I think the team, Charlie and the team, have done a great job. And then we have a slew of transactions that are in the process of closing. Once we get to our process of closing transactions, we'll redo our capital plan and proceed at that point. But right now, I think the best way we could put it is we remain confident in our targets.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","So we'll take the next question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you. The first question on the commercial loss ratio reduction on page 16. You see the mix shifting towards the grow and the maintain buckets, but if you'll look at underlying loss ratio for these two buckets you are trying maintain and grow, is actually increasing year over year. I just wonder what's the dynamics there? I just wonder would that basically will increase that, but the loss ratio increase offset some of the improvement you're making in the other two buckets.","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","So, Kai, a couple things. First of all, I think the main message on page 16 is that we're driving our improvement by improving the mix of business. So if you look at products that, 1 and 2, while I would love to retain my loss ratio as low as possible, overall the loss ratio is increased by 3 points overall for products at 1 and 2, from 54% in 2015 to 57% for the first nine months of 2016. So you've got actual market conditions which will be whatever the rate changes are in the market. So as you might imagine, it will be pretty competitive in that space.","And second, whenever we do an update to our reserves, we don't wait to make changes to our loss picks. And so to the extent that we have updated our reserve reviews, we've already reflected an increase in our loss pick for product set 1 and 2, where those reserve reviews have been completed. I would note that in product set 2B and 3, where the loss ratio has come down from 79% down to 73% over the first nine months of the year, the main observation I'd drive for you there is that's not because anybody gave me lower loss picks; that's being driven by the fact that we've really fundamentally changed the mix of business and been able to cut out some very poor performing parts of the portfolio.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. My follow-up question is on the divestiture of UGC. Looks like, given the current run rate of earnings for that book, you're probably going to lose more than $500 million pre-tax earnings next year. And how do you plan to offset that, including maybe increasing buybacks to offset the EPS impact?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Well, I think we've disclosed for you that one of the important elements of the transaction is in retaining the quota share, which we view as very valuable and has about $150 million of net income to us. So we view that as critical to looking at how we're managing the overall portfolio.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I would just frame this as, we've got the Legacy portfolio with very low ROE businesses, which we are focused on divesting going forward. This was a business with a very high ROE that we felt would be more valuable in somebody else's hands than ours and improved our risk profile, so we're very much focused on value.","The aggregate of the sale price and the reinsurance and the DTA makes this a very attractive net price to us based on any future outlook for that industry, and so the offsetting aspects of earnings dilution through buybacks and redeployment of that capital into other lines of business, is also, in our view, going to improve the quality of earnings to a less cyclical mix. There are many other ways we can obtain exposure to the U.S. housing market on the left-hand side of our balance sheet, which could more than make up for any kind of risk-adjusted earnings that we give up by the sale of UGC.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question is from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thank you for taking my question. I guess this is for David (sic) [Rob] (42:41). In the past commentary you said that you had 1.9% loss ratio improvement.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I'm sorry, Josh, who are you directing the question to?","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm sorry, to Rob. You saw 1.9% loss ratio improvement in the Commercial segment based on better underwriting although it seems a lot of that was due to lower severe losses. Although at the same time there were a lot of severe losses in 3Q. So my question is: A, if you think about all the losses that occurred in 3Q last year, would you have had exposure? And, B, do you feel that there's more of a run rate \u2013 that a severe loss exposure of AIG has gone down in this re-underwriting process?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Josh, thanks for your question. So let me maybe break this into two components for you. As I think about our longer tail lines, casualty and financial lines, absolutely the 2016 third quarter was better performing than the 2015 third quarter, and even if you remove the fact that we had some increases in the loss picks for healthcare, for example, in the third quarter of last year. So we are simply improving the underwriting performance of the longer tail lines of business.","With respect to the shorter tail lines of business, as you commented, there was a better result in severe losses. I also want to point you to the fact that we did announced earlier this year that we purchased a reinsurance program designed to limit some of that volatility in severe losses, and had you apply to that treaty, that reinsurance program to 2015, you would have a lower level of severe losses, even in 2015 using the reinsurance program that we put in place this year. So I think that for sure, there are improvements in the underwriting in the long tail lines. And while there's some volatility in the short tail lines, we had, in fact, made improvements in underwriting, and you have purchased reinsurance in a different way.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So you've never told us what's the budgeted number of severe loss units (44:57) in the new budget would be, but we should assume that going forward AIG's exposure to those severe man-made losses is lower than it was in 2015 or 2014?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","That way it works, Josh, is that the reinsurance that we purchased has an attachment point. So if there were severe losses, a high frequency of severe losses below the attachment to our reinsurance, then yes we could have an elevated level of severe losses. But generally speaking, our expectation is that our purchase of reinsurance will in fact reduce the level of severe losses moving forward.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Well, excellent answer. Thank you for it, and good luck.","Operator","And the next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks. The first question, I'm just curious, Rob, in the adjusted loss ratio for Commercial lines this quarter, how much was current in your development in that loss ratio you said that you adjusted loss picks in the program business?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, I gave that answer in my prepared remarks. That was 1 point, Brian.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Sorry. That was 1 point in the loss ratios. Thank you.","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","That's correct.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","And then, second question, Peter, I'm just curious if I look at your financial targets for 2016, as you commented, all of them pretty much getting close to there except for that book value growth. Maybe we can talk a little bit about why you're not achieving. Is there anything that you kind of learned this year that may make it challenging to meet that type of a target for 2017 as well?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","Well, I mean, I think that this year we had some somewhat unusual accounting asymmetries, which have given us a bit of a headwind in addition to some of the other dynamics, but in particular, one, that was sizable, was the asymmetry or the treatment of the significant change in the sterling exchange rate, which impacted the adjusted book value that we're targeting...","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","...but had an equal and offsetting gain in AOCI. So on a net basis, it's over $1.2 billion, I think, is that right, Sid?","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, so, Brian, actually we've included an exhibit on page 25 of the conference call presentation which really shows that on the book value per share side we view our growth year-to-date as in the ballpark of 8%, excluding the impact of market volatility. We talked about loss recognition today on legacy structured settlements. The change in reserve discount, which also impacts it...","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","...as well as some of the non-operating items that Peter mentioned, like the Brexit FX issues. So we think we're on a solid trajectory on book value per share growth at this point in time.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just had a follow-up on the six points of targeted accident year loss ratio improvement out to the end of 2017. Is that exclusive of the help that the loss ratio is currently getting from the UGC quota share?","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","Yes.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Understood. And then my follow-up was actually on the reserve release and annuities. And I guess intuitively, I would've thought that lower surrenders in an annuities business would be a bad thing just given where interest rates are. Could you just help us understand why that results in a favorable item?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, Ryan, it's Sid. I assume you're asking about the DAC locking on fixed annuities...","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Correct. Yeah.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Think about it as lower lapses mean people persist longer, which means there's more absolute dollars of income over time, which then creates the DAC unlocking.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. And then I guess my last one just quickly was I noticed you moved some new lines in the runoff. So, I mean, I guess I asked the question on the quota share. What's the impact of some of the lines that you moved into runoff on the loss ratio this quarter? In other words, how would it have looked if you didn't move some of those lines into the runoff segment?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, Ryan, it's Rob. We do not \u2013 we did not move business into runoff out of Commercial. And to be clear, for example, when we've exited business like Programs, that business that we've exited will continue to run off through my results and not help me until it has been fully earned in the Commercial loss ratio. So that creates a headwind for me. With that headwind, we still reaffirm the fact that because we've been able to terminate that business, that by the end of 2017, we do expect we'll deliver all six points of the loss ratio. Let me ask Sid to comment further.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, Ryan, it's Sid. I think the last time we had a move of items into runoff was in Q1, so you can look back to Q1. The only item of note, I believe, in this quarter is if you look in our financial supplement, we split out the UGC quota share that Rob has talked about to be fully transparent.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the Commercial line's underlying margin. You did point out about two points from property losses and also from the program adverse development of the current year. As we \u2013 and so that you've \u2013 as we think about the casualty and the specialty books, I guess, within Commercial, how did those books do sequentially on an underlying loss ratio basis when we compare to the Q2?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, so specialty, excluding programs, had a higher loss ratio in the third quarter of 2016 relative to Q2, and also relative to the third quarter of the prior year. The areas of specialty that would have been higher loss ratios would \u2013 the single biggest one for the quarter was actually aerospace and that's a short tail line. But I'll point to aerospace, and then as it relates to \u2013 relative to prior year, of course, it's environmental as we've exited some business that will continue to run off. As it relates to casualty, we've had much better results. The casualty result is more than three points better in the third quarter of 2016 than it was in the third quarter of 2015, and in part because we've got the reinsurance in place that will continue to earn in with increasing momentum across the course of the year. The benefit of that is better in Q3 than it was in Q2, and it will be better in Q4 than it was in Q3.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then in terms of the capital return plan, we did see a little bit of a sequential slowdown in the Q3, but the \u2013 it seems like the liquidity at the holding company did go up in the quarter. So as you think about Q4, I guess we should see a view towards an uptick there given when some of the divestitures and cash came into the company. And then also if you can comment, Sid, on the expected cash dividend from the operating companies in the Q4, if possible. Thank you.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","So, Elyse, I'll start with the first point, which is, yes, you're right, we did slow buybacks in the third quarter because we had two factors in the back of our minds. One, it's tax season and so we wanted to make sure that we were very well prepared for any uncertainty on catastrophes. And secondly, there were a number of transactions as we \u2013 I talked about, over five sizable transactions that \u2013 signed in the quarter, and we wanted to make sure that we got them over the finish line before we dialed it up.","In the fourth quarter, I think it's a good assumption to assume that there'll be a higher pace of buybacks, somewhat constrained by daily trading volumes. And as we look forward, while liquidity is one dimension that calibrates the pace of buybacks, it's only one. We also look at capital, we look at fixed charge coverage ratio, and we are very committed to maintaining an extremely strong balance sheet because that is a core part of our promise to our clients.","So I don't know, Sid, if you want to comment further on that.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, on the final question, Elyse, on dividends and tax share payments, we never comment on specific quarters. But if you go back to my earlier comments, we look very much on track of our window here in terms of the free cash flow generated from our subsidiaries. We have, I think, one of the strongest track records here in terms of free cash flow generation across our operating subs.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Larry Greenberg with Janney.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning and thank you. I just have a general question on service levels and how you maintain those service levels in the property casualty business while taking out so much cost. Competitors, and I think this is self-serving on their part, have talked about this and say they're capitalizing on some of your challenges. So given how important it is for the long-term sustainability of the franchise, I'm just wondering if you could talk about that topic.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I'll start by my observations when I meet with clients, especially large groups of clients, in our client advisory councils where they give us very candid feedback, many of them have been clients of ours for 20, 30 years. In some cases, they have seen a change in the person who is their account representative. And I'd say that in the first two quarters of this year, they were pretty grumpy and they would complain about the changes. In the third quarter, a number of notable clients came to me and said that the changes we made have been a net improvement in the service quality. We have a hungrier, more focused set of leaders that are more empowered to respond to clients' needs, and they are equipped with better technology than they have before to be responsive.","And so I'm very pleased with the overall \u2013 obviously, in a company that services 1 million claims a month, there will always be some that go awry and they obviously get more attention than others. But in overall terms, I'm actually very pleased on this particular point, and that's a core part of our strategy going forward, where we can focus our energy on service levels on the clients that need us most, and so that we can be for them. We can't be all things to all people in all countries, and that's a core part of our strategy.","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","And I'll just add one quick thing, Larry. It's Rob. I would just say that we are absolutely relentlessly focused on providing the best service possible to our clients. I would look at multinational as a great example of where we're doing things differently, and I think we're doing things dramatically better. So the feedback that we get from our multinational clients and the key performance indicators that we monitor regarding our speed, the accuracy, the capability that we're bringing to that space are better than they've ever been before. And I credit Carol Barton and her multinational team for some excellent leadership for us in the space.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","I think multinational is one of the most complex to service businesses there is, and I believe year-on-year, the numbers were up about 8.5%. So I think that we're pretty pleased with the way our service level is translating into growth of client business.","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","And I'd just add one more thing. As we are narrowing our focus, particularly in the Consumer business, we really are focused on value over volume. And we are currently participating in fewer products, fewer distribution channels and fewer geographies, which are allowing us to ensure that the places that we are focusing on, we're well-positioned to win. And so we're doing business in approximately 19 fewer territories than a few years ago and it's allowing us to focus our energy on those places that are our highest priorities.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you very much.","Elizabeth A. Werner - American International Group, Inc.","Operator, I think we...","Operator","And the next...","Elizabeth A. Werner - American International Group, Inc.","I'm sorry. Operator, I think we only have time for our last question since we're approaching the top of the hour.","Operator","All right. The final question is from Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. A bit of a follow-on to some of the other, but directionally, you've done a lot of heavy lifting in North America P&C. So when we think about premium growth next year directionally, is it going to be more flattish, up or down?","Robert S. Schimek - American International Group, Inc.","Adam, it's Rob. I guess what I would say is put in the transactions that Sid talked about earlier in his comments, so there's a couple of transactions that will impact the Commercial business. They include the Ascot transaction, the MSM transaction and the Fairfax transaction that we described. And those transactions will reduce our net written premium in the vicinity of $700 million in 2017.","And then I'd say the other thing that would be an environmental factor for us with premium growth is that when we announced our plan last year in the first quarter, on January 26, we were not able to impact the very important January 1 renewals in Europe in particular, and many of the renewals that we would've had in the first quarter here in the U.S., in North America, where we really do our heavy negotiation of that well in advance of the renewal date.","So I would say after we get past the first quarter, I expect our premiums, absent the three transactions that I described, to be relatively flat, maybe modest growth. But in the first quarter, especially thinking about the January 1 renewals and the fact that we'll continue to make sure we're using our risk selection tools to the best of our ability, we will have some reduction in premium in the first quarter. I think in total, it's probably accurate to say something like, including the three transactions, about a $1 billion reduction in premium in 2017 is probably about a fair benchmark for you.","Peter D. Hancock - American International Group, Inc.","Adam, consistent with our commitment to value versus volume, we have been proactive in getting our expenses down and returning excess capital to shareholders so that we are less concerned about that top-line number than perhaps others, because we really want to improve the quality and sustainability of our earnings rather than just the volume. And I think that the team has done an excellent job of getting ahead of the curve on expenses so that we won't see a retreat on the expense ratio as the top line is impacted by some of these tough decisions to exit either lines of business, locations or customer segments where we don't feel we're getting adequate returns on capital.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Elizabeth A. Werner - American International Group, Inc.","So, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning on our earnings call.

And at this time I\u2019d like to turn it over to our CEO, Bob Benmosche.","Robert H. Benmosche","","Thanks, Liz, and good morning everybody. For those of you who were following the presentation online go to page 3 if you would. And we\u2019re going to talk a little bit about 2011 and think about where you were a year ago. For us here, a year ago is probably a decade ago, but it was actually only 12 months.","When we started the year off we had, the whole recapitalization of AIG with the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury. And many of you said, I don\u2019t think they can make it. This just doesn\u2019t seem right. And by the way, we were three years early for what it is we were required to do at that point in time. But in fact, we closed at January of 2011. We had some divestitures to continue to reduce the level of debt in our SPV for AIA and ALICO. And you saw, we sold Star and Edison, a tough sale but we got it done.","Nan Shan in Taiwan, a tough sale, we got it done, as well as selling off the remaining MetLife securities so to bring the SPV down to the level we are today, which is well below the starting point of $26 billion.","We had to strengthen our liquidity during the year, continue to get access to debt markets and other facilities including banks. As you saw, we negotiated our revolving credit facility for $4.5 billion. We did our continued capital note and even ILFC was able to get out there and show its strength in the marketplace to deal with its credit needs.","But one of the conditions of closing if you recall was we had to raise equity capital. That was the condition of closing that we could access the market and we saw in May, we were able to sell a 100 million shares of AIG\u2019s stock alongside the Treasury\u2019s 200 million shares of stock.","That demonstrated our ability to access the capital in markets and in fact we were able to then extinguish the Series G which was bridged to us until we actually made this accomplishment. And still in the second half, we finished the first half and as we started the second half we told all of you that we\u2019re going from saving AIG to building AIG; that our crisis was over.","And so as we focused in the second half of the year some of the things we did that weren\u2019t anticipated until 2012, latter part of 2012 we did our senior debt hybrid exchange.","We also repurchased and have the authorization to repurchase AIG shares for $1 billion. It was just on at the end of the year. So, that shows our beginning to do our capital management as we talked, we're going to be able to do. But, when we think about capital management and where we are one of the things we anticipate is we will be regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is our assumption.","And therefore we're doing everything we can to make sure we do, to put in the disciplines and be ready for them when they arrive. One of the things they do require is stress testing. And so, we made our best guess as to how you run the stress test. We don't have all of the information. They haven\u2019t given us direction of what to do. But in attempting to understand what they announced recently we've run a stress test of AIG assuming we've got most of the major pieces correct.","We wanted to understand where our Tier 1 capital was and see if that\u2019s a binding constraint on capital management. What we found is, okay, you have to have 5% minimum and maybe a point and a half on top of that to be [sefi]. We came out in the 8% range of Tier 1 capital, which means we got it right in terms of our interpretation of the rules and we got some other things right in terms of how we attempted to execute it. We could have as much as $10 billion of extra Tier 1 capital in this company. And we said we\u2019re resolving for capital early on because we want to make sure that people understand we are financially strong.","That doesn't mean this $10 billion that we're going to put to work right away; it just says that Tier 1 capital looks like it may not be a bided constraint. What is a bided constraint is the operations of this company. Our ability to generate cash and as you can see, in 2011 we generated almost $3 billion of dividends out of the insurance companies, almost $1 billion in the fourth quarter alone.","So we're continuing to see the cash flows come in. We're comfortable with our capital ratios right now. And so the real challenge is getting operating performance right for this company. You see that in the fourth quarter.","We also had to deploy a lot of cash in 2011 because we had a huge pile of cash beginning of the year because we thought we\u2019re going to buy Maiden Lane II. We have succeeded in putting all of that cash to work throughout the year. You see that in our income in the fourth quarter, so you see the evidence of that money working.","We have been asked a lot of questions about how much of Maiden Lane II did you get? So I might as well just answer it, so that you don't keep asking it. Up until now there is one more tranche to go, but up until now while we\u2019ve added a lot of mortgage backed securities to our asset class that we had for the general account and so on, we\u2019ve only purchased just under $2 billion of the assets coming out of Maiden Lane II.","As we shared with you through the year, we had found that other institutions that want to reduce their risk rated assets; we were able to find some pretty good product, better quality credit and a pretty good yield. So that's what we chose to do instead of competing for pieces of Maiden Lane II.","We felt more comfortable with the whole thing, but if we didn't get the whole thing, we were very careful about what we bought within the Maiden Lane II. So just want to put that to bed if I could.","So our crisis is over. We had a good 2011. A lot of people say you made it, but, there is a but. So let's go to page four. What are some of the buts that I keep hearing? But it's a soft market. Try to say (inaudible) in the soft market. Rate is not coming back. You've heard us say throughout the year that we\u2019re now working hard to get, at least there across the capital. Peter has talked very eloquently about risk-adjusted profitability and we\u2019ve got to look at the risk we're writing, and do it in a more holistic way because our new organization allows us to do that.","So you can see we got rate 4% in U.S., Canada, workers comp, and we\u2019ve been talking about issues in workers comp now for the last year and a half. The market is beginning, our competitors are beginning to see the financial effect of that, but when you look at workers comp and property up 8%. So we\u2019re getting rate, but the reserves. We\u2019re concerned about the quality of the reserves, you see in the fourth quarter, we added about $13 million to the reserve, so on a year-to-date basis we added about $195 million to the reserve. When you think about $195 million for the year and again you saw throughout the year, it wasn't a surprised in the fourth quarter.","When you think about that, keep in mind what percentage that is of a $71 billion reserve. It's very infinitesimal, so we're very confident as we look at our reserves, we\u2019re still and many of our products above the central estimate of the outside actuaries; we've got a lot of people focusing on our claims, our claims process and our reserve process. So, I don\u2019t know what more we can do other than give you another year to see that the reserves are in very good shape.","Can we generate cash flow to do capital management? That was a big piece, along with the DTA. So that we have the tax cash flows as we\u2019re in taxable income as well as the dividends and so on. As you can see in here, very strong in the fourth quarter; strong for the year. But the low interest rate environment, you know the equity markets, your franchises were damaged. It\u2019s tough to make money in the low-interest rate environment.","If you look at our ability in SunAmerica they have performed very well. Remember it's not just the portfolio rate. It's what your crediting rates are, and there is going to be some pressure. But it\u2019s not as dramatic as every once and then sales continue, not in the case as they were, because people still need to save their money. They can\u2019t just sit in cash. So look at our numbers, our flows, you can see we had net flows again up $673 million, very strong for the year.","But the housing crisis; the housing crisis is going to drag you down. You\u2019re in a mortgage business, look at the other primary insurers, you got a problem. We have told all of you over the last two years, we have redesigned the way we write business at United Guaranty. They have a multivariate model that is extremely successful. We\u2019re getting better than expected returns and in fact the ROEs on the new business for writings in the 20% range.","So, while we have a housing crisis we see that pretty much behind us and you\u2019re going to see this business, which is now the leader of the industry continue to pull out with really good numbers as we move into 2012 and \u201913. And so the last but is, but the DTA. It says that you really are not confident about your future profitability, well we are. And the DTA constituent says we have a clear view now that we could use the tax benefits here within the timeframe that\u2019s allowed for them.","In fact, we think it says that we\u2019re well on our way to our aspirational goals, well on our way. And in fact as we get to 2015 and achieve those aspirational goals we think we\u2019ll probably use up [somewhere] around 65% of this DTA on the way. So, net to us is the fourth quarter is a clear demonstration that this company has not only survived, it's got its strength, its got its key people and we\u2019re moving in the right direction and we're going to continue to build value for our clients, for our shareholders and have a great place for our employees to thrive in.","So on that note let me turn it over to David Herzog who will take you through some of the numbers.","David L. Herzog","Thank you Bob and good morning everyone. This morning, I will go over some of the highlights over the quarter and then Peter and Jay will comment on specifically the results of Chartis and SunAmerica. And I'm going to build on Bob's themes that he set forth. And I would characterize the quarter as pivotal both for what did happen and for what did not happen.","And what did happen as our core insurance businesses made $1.3 billion despite $467 million of cap losses. What did happen is SunAmerica had another solid quarter with strong sales, strong flows and driven by growing distribution. What did happen as Bob referenced is continued capital flows from our operating companies to our holding company for capital management which is a key pillar of our long term aspirational goals.","And what did happen, as Bob mentioned is we completed our assessment of the DTA valuation allowance that we set out in our 10-Q's earlier in the year, where we concluded that it is more likely than not that we're going to realize a substantial portion of our DTA's, based principally on our return to sustainable profitability.","And what did not happen is the need for significant Chartis loss reserve development charge. In fact loss reserve development for the year and for the quarter were benign.","If you turn to slide five, you can see the increase in GAAP net income to $19.8 billion, which included $17.7 billion related to the reversal valuation allowance. Net income per share was $10.43, which included $9.34 per share from the valuation allowance.","After-tax operating income, which is our principal non-GAAP measure was $0.82 per share versus a loss of about $16 a share a year ago that included the reserve strengthening. Importantly, our GAAP book value per share increased 18% to $55.33, reflecting the valuation allowance. And book value per share, excluding AOCI was $52.69.","Also impacting book value in the first quarter of 2012, but to a far lesser extent in the valuation allowance is EITF 09-G. That's the new DAC standard. And in the 10-K we provide the GAAP after-tax impact to book value of 09-G and that's about $3.7 billion or about $1.95 per share, excluding AOCI and that will be recorded in the first quarter. The future earnings impact of 09-G are largely related to the direct marketing activities at Chartis.","Moving to slide six, in core insurance operations Chartis pretax operating income was impacted as I mentioned by $467 million in cat losses including $368 million from the Thailand floods. This was a record cat year for Chartis totaling nearly $3.3 billion. Despite the cat losses for the year Chartis delivered $629 million in dividends to the Parent at the fourth quarter and $1.5 billion for the year.","SunAmerica as I said had another strong quarter with pretax operating income of $931 million. SunAmerica's results included, little over $200 million from a favorable legal settlement, which was offset by little over $100 million from an IBNR reserve increase that Jay will comment on in a minute.","For both Chartis and SunAmerica, alternative investment returns were weak for the quarter compared to a very strong fourth quarter a year ago. Total fourth quarter alternative investment income declined by little over $700 million from a year ago. Last year's fourth quarter alternative investment returns were roughly 14% on an annualized basis making for a tough comparison.","For the full-year alternative investment returns were around 7% versus 9% in 2010. Looking ahead to the first quarter we\u2019d expect the returns to improve sequentially given the fourth quarter performance and the one quarter lag for our private equity investments. We continue to expect an approximate 10% annualized return over the long-term for the alternate investments.","Moving toward non-core operations, ILFC reported fourth quarter results of $119 million profit versus last year's loss. ILFC is benefiting from managing its fleet aggressively.","In the quarter we reported about $40 million of charges related to airline bankruptcies. As you know, we filed an S1 last September, which is consistent with our view that this is a non-core business. ILFC\u2019s book value was approximately $7.5 billion at the end of 2011.","One thing I want to share with you is the impact on our book value as it might relate to an IPO or a sale of ILFC. It is possible that our book value could be negatively impacted. For example, if we monetize ILFC at its net book value our book value could declined by approximately $2.7 billion or $1.50 per share. Within corporate, we reported a $484 million gain due to the hybrid tender that Bob had referenced.","Turning to slide seven, you can see the breakdown of our deferred tax assets for which we no longer hold a valuation allowance against with the exception of the life insurance capital loss carry forwards for which we hold an approximate $7.2 billion allowance. We are focused on strategies to capture a portion of the value of this asset, but we\u2019re retaining the allowance against this for now.","Going forward we continue to expect an effective tax rate of somewhere between 25% and 30% on our operating income. What is most important about the judgment we made with respect to releasing the valuation allowance is it signifies our view that we have returned to sustainable profitability.","On slide eight, you can see the impact of fourth quarter and the full-year from our capital management activity. In the fourth quarter our capital management activities included ranging an additional $0.5 billion contingent capital facility and renewing a $4.5 billion credit facility.","We also exchanged $2.4 billion in hybrid securities and began our share buyback program. We repurchased $70 million of our stock at an average price of $22.75. We expect to complete the $1 billion authorization in the foreseeable future.","Capital management is a fundamental part of how we will run this company, and with our goal of maximizing investor returns.","Slide nine highlights Parent company liquidity sources of $14 billion at year end. The full year of 2011, our insurance operating companies paid dividends and note repayments to the holding company of over $3 billion and we expect to reach $4 billion to $5 billion this year, supporting our ongoing capital management plans.","And with that I'd like to turn it over to Peter for a discussion of Chartis.","Peter D. Hancock","Thank you, David. Good morning everybody. I've got a couple of Chartis slides in the earnings presentation but they\u2019re just for your reference.","So I'm going to focus on a few notable items from the quarter, and those include catastrophes, reinsurance strategy, reserves, geographic alignment, our growth plans especially in the direct marketing channel.","So overall I was pretty pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. Excluding catastrophes, actual business results are pretty strong as were some of our key performance indicators, reflecting progress in our strategic initiatives to improve profit, generate growth and better manage our risks.","As David noted, this was a historic year for cat losses. And I must say I'm very proud of how our 11,000 claims professionals worldwide handled this, by working extremely hard to deliver excellent claim service to our customers. And we received a very good feedback on that from both customers and regulators.","We continue to consider our claims organization to be really an important competitive advantage that separates us from the rest of the market. As I reflect on the level of catastrophe losses in 2011, I'm satisfied with how well our efforts to manage our risk appetite resulted in a level of losses inline with the industry if you benchmark it as a proportion of capital and that's Chartis's capital, not AIG's.","The effective management of our catastrophe exposures also clearly recognized by the reinsurance market during our very successful Jan 1 renewal season. Today Chartis has a more efficient blueprint for its reinsurance strategy through a combination of managing our risk appetite, improvements to the structure of our catastrophe reinsurance program, and the issuance of $1.45 billion in multi-year cat bonds over the past two years. That reduces our reliance on traditional reinsurance.","Underwriting results in the quarter included favorable [prior] year reserve development of $13 million and for the full year 2011 Chartis had insignificant net adverse prior year reserve development of $72 million. And our $68 billion in held reserves regularly reviewed by internal and third-party actuaries as part of an enhanced risk management framework.","Similar to others in the industry we experienced increased frequency and severity related to the most recent accident years in primary workers comp. In environmental liability we saw increases from multi-year policies written in prior years. These were offset by improvements in excess casualty and executive liability products.","Excess casualty, workers compensation, specialty workers compensation, and asbestos the four lines with the largest reserve increases in the fourth quarter of 2010 experienced overall net favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Chartis continues to reduce our writings in these lines of business. They represented 5.1% of our net premiums in the fourth quarter, compared to 6.2% in the comparable period in 2010.","Expense trends were consistent with the increase in higher value added consumer lines, which have higher acquisition cost but lower combined ratios, and from our strategic investments in systems and processes that yield greater expense savings and improve service and efficiency in the long run.","We also expect an additional increase in our expense ratio in 2012 due to our growth in direct marketing. And I'll discuss that a bit more later.","The fourth quarter premium trends are consistent with our emphasis on profitability and capital optimization. Our mix of business demonstrates Chartis' flexibility in deploying capital across businesses and geographies, targeting them where the greatest opportunity for profitable returns exist, given current market conditions and our long term strategic view.","International business was 51% of our total net premiums in the quarter, an increase from 47% in the comparable period the year before. And on the consumer side it represented 43% of net premiums compared to 40% in the comparable period in 2010.","So we're very proud of the leadership we\u2019re demonstrating in the marketplace with respect to rates and terms and conditions. Rates in the U.S. and Canada region increased approximately 4%. Specifically workers compensation and property experienced the most notable increases, and they were needed at approximately 8% increase in both lines.","We recently announced the alignment of our geographic operations within three principal regions, the Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA. The new alignment promotes greater operational efficiency and allows us to utilize financial and human capital optimally. It also provides greater focus on strategic growth economy countries, such as China, India and Brazil among others that are vital to our growth plans.","With respect to China specifically this has been a very good month for further improving our prospects in a truly extraordinary country. We've established a long term strategic relationship with China, highlighted by the fact that we\u2019re the largest foreign owned insurer in China with more operating licenses and premium than any other insurer based outside the country.","This past week, I visited with Vice President, Xi Jinping in Washington and thanked him for his commitment to open up mandatory third-party liability insurance for motor vehicles, to foreign invested insurance companies. We\u2019re also able to renew our longstanding relationship with the People's Insurance Company of China in which we hold a 9.9% equity stake.","And third, we celebrated the opening of our new office in Jiangsu Province in China. This is our fifth license in China and the region includes 80 million people with a per capital GDP equivalent to that of a mid-sized European nation. We\u2019re well-positioned in China and we expect to broaden our relationship there including through direct marketing opportunities.","Beyond China, we\u2019re expecting a direct marketing strategy in approximately 50 countries. We\u2019re able to transfer our successful DM strategies in Japan, Korea and Israel to other parts of Asia-Pacific and elsewhere. Even with an increase in our expense ratio due to EITF-09G, which we expect to be a valid point on our combined ratio depending on our marketing costs, we believe that the DM related business offers very attractive risk-adjusted returns and we\u2019re going to continue to grow that channel.","Let me conclude by saying that I believe we're very much on pace to achieve our goals by year-end 2015. We also continue to measure and refine the risk-adjusted profitability of all our businesses and with directing capital and resources to optimize profitability where we see the opportunities. We still have work to do but our people and platform give me great confidence that we\u2019re on the right track.","So next I\u2019d like to hand over to Jay.","Jay S. Wintrob","","Thank you, Peter and good morning everybody. SunAmerica delivered a solid fourth quarter with improved year-over-year net flows, sales and base investment spreads. David mentioned the unusual items in the quarter. I just want to add that the IBNR reserve addition of $105 million this quarter reflected new information about the death claim verification procedures disclosed in recently announced settlements with other companies, including longer look back periods and that's what drove that increase.","Taking a look at page 12, compared to last year SunAmerica's fourth quarter earnings were negatively impacted by lower alternative investment returns of approximately 1% in the quarter, versus last year's strong alternative investment returns of approximately 14% annualized as David mentioned earlier and to a lesser extent, call and tender income and the ML II fair value market.","If you just look at those three items alone, the alternative investment change, lesser call and tender and the ML II mark that accounted for a $530 million decline in the prior year.","Looking ahead to 2012, we would expect full-year investment returns to reflect the benefit of last year's cash deployment and base investment spreads to be relatively stable.","Sales were strong across all of our product lines and total net flows as Bob mentioned were positive for the fourth consecutive quarter. We benefited from being reinstated on all distribution platforms and added to some new ones and surrenders remains relatively stable.","Term life and private placement VUL sales delivered strong fourth quarter results leading to retail life sales growth of 9%, and total life sales growth of 24% from a year ago.","With the sustained positive net flows continue to reflect our product diversity, sales of group retirement products increased nearly 27%, as our focus on individual rollover deposits continue to produce results.","However, we do expect sales of individual rollover deposits to slow in the near term due to the low interest rate environment. Variable annuities held by stronger equity markets in the quarter also showed good momentum with fourth quarter sales up 24% year-over-year and this positive trend is continued into the first quarter of this year.","Our discipline in the VA market has served us well. For example our guaranteed benefit writer fees remain about industry averages. And we were the first in the industry to index our living benefit fees to market volatility as measured by the VIX index reducing our exposure to changes in volatility. And just last month we launched our latest iteration of the de-risked product with the volatility control front designed to reduce the impact of market vol on fund performance.","Also in the quarter our mutual fund sales continue to accelerate due to strong fund performance and success of recent product offerings. And while mutual funds are not our highest margin products their modest capital requirements allow them contribute to our returns.","Fields of fixed annuities decelerated in the fourth quarter as expected given the very steep decline in treasury rates between the start of the third and fourth quarters. For example the base crediting rate on bank sold fixed annuities declined between 25 and 45 basis points depending on the product structure from the start of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter. And given the current interest rate environment with base crediting rates on new fixed annuities below 2% we would expect weak fixed annuities sales trends to continue.","Despite that we'll continue to actively manage our product pricing, in particular new and renewal crediting rates. We will renew new money rates for fixed annuities weekly and have the flexibility to manage crediting rates on over half of our enforce fixed annuity and universal life enforce account values.","On slide 13, we show the general improvement in base investment yields and base net investment spread throughout the year driven by a redeployment of cash and disciplined new and renewal crediting rate actions.","In the fourth quarter, we saw some impact in base yield from lower interest rates and we would expect additional pressure into next year, all things equal with rates.","On slide 14, we assume a continued low interest rate environment and the implications for operating earnings. Given our current new money rates, our disciplined approach to pricing and active managing of crediting rates, we would expect our pretax earnings to be impacted between really zero and about $10 million this year, solely from low rates, and between $65 million and $80 million next year due to the current low level of rates.","While the macro environment does present challenges, we\u2019ve not changed our view on statutory capital over the next two years, which remains strong, and we expect our product diversity and distribution breadth to provide continued growth opportunities at attractive returns.","And with that I'll turn it back over to David to wrap this up.","David L. Herzog","","Thank you, Jay. And turning to slide 15, we consider United Guaranty part of our core insurance business and it continues to be an industry leader in the mortgage insurance market. The company led new business written in the industry, and in the fourth quarter we wrote over $7 billion of new insurance.","United Guaranty's fourth quarter included a $42 million favorable reserve development. I'd like to highlight another sequential decline in delinquencies and the delinquency rate of just under 14% at 13.8%. Reserves remain steady with the reserve for delinquency of 27,000. I think more importantly I would note that we helped over 40,000 families stay in their home.","And finally, we've also provided some additional disclosure on non-core assets in the appendix. I\u2019d like to highlight that as a result of the recent sales of Maiden Lane II securities in February that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, senior loan will be repaid in March and as a result AIG will begin receiving payments on our Maiden Lane II interest this year.","Any proceeds in excess of our principal and interest will be allocated 56 to the Federal Reserve and 16 to AIG. All proceeds from Maiden Lane II for AIG will be used to repay any remaining balance in the AIA, SPV preferred interest. With respect to ML III payments continue to come in as expected and amounted to just over a $1 billion in the fourth quarter.","At this time, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Hey, good morning everyone. I wanted to first congratulate you on the disclosure on reserves. Its outstanding, it creates a lot more questions, but I think is what you guys need to be doing. Can you talk a little bit about the loss emergence trend, you\u2019ve said in the 10-K that you use a shorter term development pattern to set the reserves for excess casualty. That sounds like a contradiction to me, so maybe you can flush that out. And can you talk a little bit about what's going on in environmental, so we can be confident it's not a recurring event but a one-time event?","Robert H. Benmosche","Hey Josh, it\u2019s Rob Benmosche. Let me start with your question on excess casualty. You might want to rewind back to the fourth quarter of 2010. It was actually in the fourth quarter of 2010 that we shortened the period that we were looking at excess casualty trend. It actually resulted in us increasing our reserves in 2010.","And that was us giving more reliance on the development that we had experienced in the more recent years, as it relates to business that have been written previously. And so, really we\u2019re simply saying we stayed consistent with that time period that we shortened down in 2010. But it's just so happened at the more recent years are showing better results than they did just a year ago.","The next point regarding environmental, I think, I want to highlight a couple of things. There\u2019s two pieces of disclosure in the 10-K that I think people should be making sure they focus on. The first is, the difference between the inputs as best as an environmental and then the environmental line of business that we write. So with respect to that you might want to take a look at pages 93 and 102 of the 10-K, although I'm positive, I know that you have in particular, but I think some other people might benefit by taking a look at that disclosure.","What I would note is that with respect to the disclosure we provide on page 93, we provide a discussion of the fact that we write environmental business through a profit centre referred to as the environmental profit centre that sits inside of our commercial business. You'd note that through the first nine months of the year we experienced some level of adverse development in the environmental book of business. Following that adverse development, we spent a lot of our fourth quarter conducting a ground-up study of the claims in environmental, and our fourth quarter adverse development is the result of a very focused effort to try to make sure that we were really getting at a claim-by-claim evaluation of that exposure.","Historically, we\u2019ve used more traditional actuarial methods. I think that this is an improvement on what we have been doing historically, because in the end the best way to get to this exposure is really on a case-by-case claims review in connection with the work that's being done by the actuaries.","I also want to observe for you that this tends to be from accident years 2003 and prior and that most of that business was business written by this environmental profit center. It was written on a multiyear basis, and so we\u2019re at this point in time dealing with those multiyear policies that were written 2003 and prior.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","And then the policy years '08 and '09 which evolved into accident years '09 and '10, a lot of your most sober critics say that they\u2019re worried about the reserves there, and there was a little bit of reserve development on the unfavorable side for those years. Can we just go through those and then I'll disappear into the queue I guess.","Robert H. Benmosche","Yes, no problem Josh. I would say that consistent with what you're seeing from other participants in the marketplace, it's been more or so related to the workers compensation line of business. So it's not something broad-based across all of the businesses that we wrote in 2008, 2009, 2010, but in particular with respect to workers compensation, we\u2019ve done we think a very good job of pushing rates in workers compensation and in managing our exposure on workers compensation. That book of business has continued to shrink and if it plays where we have conducted a lot of work regarding the structural drivers of loss to get our hands around what's actually causing the losses in the first place as well as using predictive modeling to help us do a better job with respect to risk section and we think we'll continue to get better with respect to all aspects of that as we move forward.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Well, thank you. The details much appreciated.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Hi, thank you. I just have got question Peter in Chartis, the expense ratio look like what the, I should say the combined ratio in commercial lines was a bit higher in the fourth quarter. It looks like, the expense ratio was a contributor there particularly within international. I was just trying to understand what happened there? If you could, thanks.","Robert H. Benmosche","","Sure. Mike, its Rob Benmosche. I'll comment on that.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great.","Robert H. Benmosche","Let me start by making a couple of observations. First, as you know our international commercial business has a much heavier 1\/1 renewal date. So, if you actually go back and look at the premium trend one thing you will observe is that the earned premium and the written premium relationship changes throughout the year.","So, for example in the first quarter of the year our written premium outpaced earned premium for commercial international by $700 million. But, by the fourth quarter earned premium outpaced written premium. So, the exact opposite by $400 million, that actually causes a pretty significant change, a swing in our expense ratio and you'll notice that it's almost a 10 point swing in the expense ratio from the first quarter to the fourth quarter.","That\u2019s not unusual for us, that actually if you go back and take a look over time you\u2019ll see that, that same type of relationship existed in the prior year. So, that's one point to make.","The second thing I\u2019ll make observation regarding expenses is, international commercial is really the heartbeat of where a lot of our efforts are going with respect to some improvements that we're making with respect to our infrastructure. So we are in the process of a very large SAP implementation, probably the largest and most complex SAP implementation for a financial services company in the history of the world occurring in Europe as we speak. In addition to that we have Solvency II and a significant legal entity restructuring. So there\u2019s truly some additional expense there as well as typical seasonality.","The last point that I'd make regarding the loss side of the house for International Commercial is that it's largely on the casualty side of the house, and we are continuing to use the same kinds of efforts with respect to International Commercial Casualty as we do with respect to the U.S. Commercial Casualty, which is focused really on predictive modeling, evaluating the structural drivers of losses and pushing for improvement in rate so that we can get the appropriate risk-adjusted profitability. So I think it's really the combination of those three items, focusing in particular on the expense ratio in the quarter.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. And so, we\u2019re at 99.4 for Chartis overall on a full-year underlying combined. Thinking about 09-G, I'm guessing that's 50 basis points to 100 basis points on total Chartis. Thinking about the migration of the business towards consumer lines, some investments in technology, the better pricing that you\u2019ve kind of talked about and any loss trends in '11, like how should we think about that basket of attributes? As we look at profitability from Chartis from here is it sort of a J, in terms of the profitability declining and then starting to pick up or how should we think about that?","Robert H. Benmosche","I'll reiterate the overall observation that Peter made, which is that we certainly believe we continue to be on pace for our 2015 goals. That will result in different, sort of dimensions to the solution. But first with respect to expenses, you can expect our expense ratio to improve more in 2013, 2014 as we complete some of our efforts with respect to the investments that I described for you just a moment ago in the international commercial business.","And with respect to losses, I think you should continue to expect that we'll be making ongoing progress. And we're really focused heavily on using the tools and the technical pricing expertise that we are focused on heavily these days to make sure that they are a continual area of progress.","I think what I would look at if I were you is I'd look at, are they making continual progress on the underlying loss ratio, understanding that we think we have very strong plans and a very determined view that we will achieve our expense goals by 2015.","David L. Herzog","Rob, I'd just add a little bit, just on the direct marketing, the pace of growth there. Our current course and speed would add about 0.8 to the combined ratio, but I would love to deliver you the news that the expense ratio impact would be twice that because we have the bandwidth to grow faster than that because the prospective ROE on that business is very, very attractive, well above our cost of capital.","And so I think that we can demonstrate that through greater disclosures going forward if and when we accelerate the pace of our DM spend. But our current course and speed would be just under a point on the combine from the DM. But I think that our way of thinking about that business is economics, not accounting.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And what would be the loss ratio on that same basis? What would be the loss ratio impact if you're getting 80 points of deterioration on the expense side, what's the offsetting impact on the loss side?","David L. Herzog","The combined ratio of that business is in the high 80s, depending on the country. So it's very attractive business. The issue is bandwidth and how much of it you can do how fast? And so, we are expanding in 50 countries, prioritizing about a dozen, and we have extensive experience in terms of persistency, cross-sell, and up-sell ratios from our experience in Japan, Korea and Israel over the last dozen years.","So we have a good framework that applies in many countries. But I think that we can give you more disclosure on that going forward as we fine-tune the pace. But, right now our current pace of growth in that business would add about 0.8 to the expense ratio under the new EITF 09-G.","Robert H. Benmosche","I'd like to add that one of the things that I've said before and I want to repeat now is that we have not invested enough in technology to really do the predictive data mining and so on that we need to do. And so, we are going to continue to see that number flow through the expense ratio, and our issue here is to really position us well for the future. For example, we have 27 million claim records in our workers comp area that we never extensively studied.","We are now working with Johns Hopkins University to really understand those claims, what they say, what they mean and how we use that as a standard for processing claims and understanding claims going forward.","So we're investing heavily around this, so that you will continue to see the pattern of expenses from now and before continuing. But we did say, we would get to a $1 billion, say by the time we get to 2015 and we're on track to do that. But expenses are not a driver. What Peter talked about is having the right growth and the right risk-adjusted profitability of that growth, and being able to explain to you, if the numbers because if the accounting come out a little different than before, we'll make sure you\u2019re used to what that is.","But this is about growing smartly and still leveraging technologies as we do it, which as Rob said is going to cost us some money and that's not our driver.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","All right, thank you all very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jay Cohen with BofA Merrill Lynch.","Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you. It's Ed Spehar and then I think Jay will have one question as well. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about why you weren't more aggressive with the share buyback in the fourth quarter?","And sort of related question on capital generation, cash flow. The $4 billion to $5 billion of subsidiary dividends that you see, could you tell us just approximately how that would break down between Chartis and Sun, and again remind us about the uses of cash at the holding company? Thanks.","Robert H. Benmosche","Go ahead Brian.","Brian T. Schreiber","Sure. It's Brian Schreiber. How are you doing, Ed? On the first question about the share repurchase, keep in mind that the authorization was in November, so we had a very short window. We were also subject to volume limitations on how much we could participate in daily volume. And it was our intention to not be very heavy in the stock on low volume days.","So that I hope answers that first question. In terms of the question on the uses of the parental liquidity, there are several. Obviously we won a variety of stress tests and try and maintain a level of parental liquidity sufficient to meet those stress tests. We also have a variety of obligations, short-term maturities as debt service that we have to meet, and we also have a plan to reduce contingent liquidity risk at the company and take down the level of repose and funding arrangements that could result in additional liquidity needs. So we keep adequate reserves for that and again make sure that we do have adequate resources for our planned and anticipated capital management activities.","Unidentified Company Representative","Ed, I guess your other part of the question is with respect to the 2012 dividends. About $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion might come from Chartis and we'd expect somewhere around $2 billion from SunAmerica.","Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay and can you talk about just numbers on uses of the holding company beyond the sort of contingent liquidity, just the normal uses of cash at the holding company?","Unidentified Company Representative","Debt service is roughly $400 million.","Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Per quarter?","Unidentified Company Representative","Per quarter. Parental holding company expense is roughly $250 or so per quarter.","Unidentified Company Representative","Okay, I think Jay has a question.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Just really quickly on the commercial pricing, obviously good to hear that you're getting momentum in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what you saw in January? I assume a fairly active January season on the commercial side. Can you talk at least qualitatively about the direction of pricing? Do they continue to accelerate?","Peter D. Hancock","","I think that the trend is certainly continuing. But perhaps John Doyle, you want to give a little bit more color on that?","John Q. Doyle","","Sure, Peter. Yeah, Jay, we saw no slowdown in the momentum in January. We continue to be encouraged by where retention stands relative to the prices we\u2019ve been pushing.","Rob mentioned, Europe 1\/1 is a particularly big day for our business there and retention was certainly below expectation but rates were ahead of expectation, so we felt good about that. So there is decent momentum and we\u2019re continuing to push and lead the way.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Kligerman with UBS.","Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS","Great, good morning. Couple of quick questions, on your capital position, Bob you threw around a lot of numbers earlier. What would you estimate to be redeployable capital, and would an opportunity, say an equity offering be a viable situation where you could deploy it?","Unidentified Company Representative","There is a combination of what's available now, so something happens in the next two weeks is one availability. The other is, dealing with the sale of assets, recognizing we have the SPV here. It has to be paid down as a priority, so we are looking at that priority.","So I would say that until such time as we clear up the balance remaining on the ALICO AIA SPV, there isn't a whole lot of cash based upon what we can do from sales and so on until that's done.","So we're working through that constraint. Brian and his team have given a lot of thought to that. That's why we said we were looking forward to the IPO of ILFC, but the markets really are not welcoming right at this time, so we\u2019re still seeing that as a delay till things improve in the airline industry as well as in the market.","So I would say it's kind of limited in terms of what we really have in the short-term.","Unidentified Company Representative","As we explained where we were on the road for the equity offering last year, it was that the bulk of the initial capital management activities would be funded by the monetization of core assets and then the remaining portion through dividends from the operating companies.","And again, we set an expectation that capital management wouldn't really start in earnest until 2013. I mean you're seeing evidence now that we are a bit ahead of plan. But again, it's the value of those non-core assets when they get monetized will provide the bulk of the resources for capital management.","Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS","Got it. And then just quickly, it's a nice opportunity there to get a gain on the debt extinguishment. Do you see any near-term opportunities there, maybe with some of the hybrid securities?","Unidentified Company Representative","At the current time we don't have any plans for additional hybrid exchanges.","Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS","Okay, and then just lastly, with regard to the international commercial operations, so you had an expense ratio in the fourth quarter of 40.1%. It was 43.4%, and it looks like in past years you were kind of low mid-30s. I think you mentioned 2013, 2014. Do we sort of see this elevated level of close to 40% through 2012? And then where should we expect it to come down to, low to mid-30s?","Robert H. Benmosche","Jay, it's Rob. On the international commercial, what I want to give you a flavor of is timing with respect to those expense initiatives. So we're doing a very significant legal entity restructuring in preparation for Solvency II. We expect the vast majority of that will be completed at the end of 2012, certainly by the beginning of 2013. We are in the process separately, we are in the process of implementing SAP as I described.","We have a very significant roll-out of SAP occurring in the month of March. But we'll continue to roll that out across the rest of continental Europe through 2012 and all the way through 2013. So the timing for the backbone infrastructure work that we're doing will take us all the way through at least the end of 2013 before we start to see improvements in that area of the world.","Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS","At which time we would probably see a significant drop-off in the expense ratio may be down to low mid-30s at that point?","Unidentified Company Representative","What ends up happening is, as you know we can\u2019t get the benefits until we actually put the technology in place. So we're doing both a complete change in our target operating model structure in Europe, taking our geographies in which we're doing a lot of our efforts down from 20 different places down to a handful of different places and that will create significant benefits, but we\u2019re not going to get that until we actually can roll the technology out in 2013. So you\u2019re right, generally speaking you\u2019ll start to see that and we hope it's, we plan for it to be pretty significant in 2014, 2015.","Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dan Johnson at Citadel.","Daniel Johnson \u2013 Citadel Investments","Great, thank you very much. Most have already been asked and answered. So I\u2019ll just go with a clarification on the ILFC valuation. I think you\u2019ve mentioned that there is book value differences that I think you said at book value sale for ILFC that\u2019s got a $2.7 billion difference, very simply this is linear that is end up selling ILFC for $1 billion less than their carrying book value that the $2.7 billion goes to $3.7 billion whereas something else we need to consider?","David L. Herzog","","Yeah, Dan its David. It's not exactly linear gets a little bit smaller. But, I think you have that just out of because you can, the driver of that is obviously the difference between book and tax.","Daniel Johnson \u2013 Citadel Investments","Yeah, understood. And then maybe just for Peter I have a broad question just to given that you've got almost 20% of those business in traditional Europe would love just to hear some comments of what you folks are seeing on the ground in terms of how the economic conditions there impacting the business currently and talk on how it might impact it? And it also remains us for the rest of the year? And thank you very much.","Peter D. Hancock","All right, I think that in the short-term the uncertainty in the Eurozone is helping us. Some of our competitors' especially local competitors have experienced significant down grades in their credit-rating while we've had stable to stronger credit outlook. And so it's a bit of fly to quality to us. I take small joy in that even though there is some short-term gains from that growth because I think it's a symptom of a longer-term deeper malaise in the European economy and that can't be good in terms of ultimate demand.","So, short-term share gains and I'd see even (inaudible) where we have seen a pickup in our volume at very attractive rate. It's to me a symptom of fly to quality. But I do, I'm concerned about the long-term growth rate in Europe and as things stabilize. But there is, I think some light at the end of that tunnel, I'm pleased by the results from last two weeks in terms of policy at the macro level. But, it's an important part of our commercial franchise, I think that like the U.S. market its mature, we need to choose our shots, we need to manage the cycles well, keep our eye on the expenses, so that we don't feel we have to write that business to cover our fixed costs, and we need to use our capital sparingly and targeted at the more attractive growth economies.","Daniel Johnson \u2013 Citadel Investments","Understood, great. Thank you, very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the call, and congratulations on a good quarter. So, I wanted to expand the conversation little bit about some of the capital threshold, how much excess you would have overtime in some of the underlying drivers there? And specifically, I wanted to get a little bit more color around some of the other key capital and liquidity cash beyond the Tier 1 ratio you [flat]. So, if you could give us a sense of what the ratings agency coverage ratios? You think that are being help to us or for the holding company liquidity versus debt service, you recently, I think have put in place the capital maintenance agreement such as minimum RBC levels, it will be helpful to know.","And then also, if you could just walk us through technically how we should think about that DTA, the new valuation allowance playing through into capital under various measures. That I think would be a big help as we do our modeling in the future.","David L. Herzog","","Okay, Josh, its David, I\u2019ll take the last question first on the DTA ahead of think about. As Bob mentioned, as we think about between now and 2015 we'll use about two-thirds of the total NOLs or the FTCs in combination. In those cash flows will actually come to the parent company by way of tax sharing arrangements or treaties that have been in placed for a very long period of time.","So those cash flows will ultimately flow to the holding company will be a part of the parent company cash flow. As you think about the cash that will come, it's the dividends, the after-tax dividends from the operating companies, which we've talked a lot about, the tax sharing payments that will come through the tax sharing treaties. And as Brian mentioned the monetization of the non-core assets and we've laid some things out in the appendix pages 17 to 19 and [that] you can give a pretty good sense of what those cash flows might ultimately be.","And it's the combination of all of the above, it gives us the confidence and why we\u2019re committed to our long-term aspirational goals. It gives us the funding that we need. And also the capital resources to fund the business growth as Peter and Jay have talked about.","So that\u2019s maybe the last part of your comments. I think and others can certainly time in with respect to the capital hurdles. There really aren\u2019t any new constraints that we are coming across. I think we've laid those out fairly clearly. Bob talked about the capital requirements with respect to perhaps fed oversight, but again there are other things with respect to the rating agencies, all ratings are very important we place a very high degree of importance on that that's an important consideration. So it\u2019s the coverage ratios and the leverage ratios are not any different for us than they are for any other similarly rated company. So for a single A company, I think the coverage ratio is in the five to eight times range. Or again, they are no different for us than they are for others.","And leverage ratio, again I think this ties back to comments Bob made. Leverage ratios, we've got plenty of headroom. Again, when we did the recap we called over (inaudible) for capital and that's not a constraint, although it\u2019s a consideration and we\u2019re mindful of that over time. So hopefully that's helpful to you.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Great, great. And so if I take from all this that that sort of interior you guys can forward some substantial capital excess in the future, but at the moment combination of liquidity and things sort of makes it a much more modest number.","Unidentified Company Representative","I think maybe just to cover again, I would say we are and remain committed to our long term aspirational goals as we laid out for the world on our recent offering last year. So again, I think the pacing that will be driven by, again the framework that I laid out, but as well as monetizaion, importantly monetization of non-core assets and how that plays into considerations of our fed readiness and where and when we become, if we become regulated by the Federal Reserve.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Now I think that all makes sense. Of course we just on the business are trying to figure out the timing of all that. And just a follow-up question. And related to I think Brian\u2019s comment about sort of the slow pace of share repurchases, I mean obviously slow to consideration. In order to make all these repurchases at any meaningful level, presumably you'd have to be negotiating with the government.","I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of what, to the extent that they have shared any vision, any view on sort of how they think about exiting the remainder of the [position] and obviously that\u2019s a huge concern or opportunity for investors today.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah, that's a question you probably have to address to the U.S. Treasury. We're focused on operating the business and don't engage in discussions about that. So really, what I can say?","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thank you.","Unidentified Company Representative","You may take one more question.","Elizabeth Werner","","Operator, this would be our last question.","Operator","Okay, we'll take our last question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, guys thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to clarify one quick thing. It's pretty much everything I needed, but just the ROE aspirational goal of '10 and '015, which book value do I use for that? Is it the 55, and grow that forward or is it some other book value I should be using? I'm trying to tie it to an earnings number.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes, we assume that aspirational goal that the DTA was not part of that calculus.","Gregory Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, so can you just do the math for me? So what should I be doing to the 55 bucks? Should I take it to something different?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah, it's a good question. We announced why we put it in the financial supplement, both with and without. So we've done the math for you. Without, for the quarter we were 7.2, with, 6.9 I believe is the number that's in the financial supplement.","Elizabeth Werner","","It's on the page five.","Unidentified Company Representative","Page five of the financial supplement.","Gregory Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, okay. Great, thank you very much.","Unidentified Company Representative","Thank you.","Operator","Bob, I will open up to you for any closing remarks.","Robert H. Benmosche","I just want to say that this is another quarter and we got more to go and I think what you see here is, the foundation is extremely strong. The company is extremely strong. Our clients have been with us all the way through it and are very confident in us. And so look forward to talking to you at the end of the first quarter. Thank you all very much.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you, for your participation."],"2140":["American International Group, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Elizabeth A.

And before we get started this morning, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events.

AIG is not under any obligation and disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","Today's presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures.

This morning, you'll have the opportunity to hear from various members of our senior management team, including Brian Duperreault, Sid Sankaran, Peter Zaffino and Kevin Hogan. The format will follow that of past calls with one question and one follow-up.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Duperreault.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. There's a lot to talk about this quarter, and I'll share my perspective on how I view results, the market and how our business is performing. To begin, this quarter, the industry experienced catastrophic losses that surpassed historic levels and had a deep impact on all of us. AIG's response to the catastrophes highlights our strengths, our market presence, and the undeniable value that insurance provides during these times of great loss. Hurricane Harvey, in particular, hit home for AIG, as we have over 3,200 employees based in Houston. I was very impressed with the execution of our business continuity plans for our Houston-based businesses.","Due to our multiple-location structure, all these businesses were fully operational within a few days after Harvey hit. While I can say that our employees are extremely dedicated and worked hard for our clients through this event, I am most proud of their compassion in serving their communities. We call them our Houston Heroes, and they share their stories as well as those of others across AIG, including those in Puerto Rico. It is our people who are our greatest asset, and we believe their actions speak to the strength of AIG. To date, we've had over 11,000 claims from Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and our claims team in particular distinguish themselves in this difficult time. The severity of the recent catastrophic events forced AIG and all market participants to reassess appropriate pricing for the risks assumed.","We've successfully begun to raise rates in the wake of the catastrophes, and we'll continue to do so. We have recently seen other market participants follow across the property market. In addition to CATs, this quarter's results include additional actions on reserves for the 2016 accident year in particular. I previously stated that our reserve process is reasonable and sound, and the assessment continues to hold. You will note that there was no overall change for the accident years 2015 and prior on reserve subject to our ADC reinsurance agreement. However, this was our first chance to really view the 2016 accident year, where we made many changes to our underwriting processes and tools. The 2016 accident year is still very green, but we saw greater-than-expected claim emergence this quarter and decided to be more cautious on the 2016 and 2017 accident years.","Sid will comment further on our judgments in his remarks. The events of the quarter and my observations over the past six months are the basis for my plan going forward. The challenges on our Commercial business are ones that I've seen in the past and will be addressed by clear actions that I'd describe as blocking and tackling. This quarter marks the base from which I intend to grow profitably. Make no mistake, we have a great sense of urgency and have made changes. We have started with establishing an organization structure that plays to our strengths. And we announced this quarter with General Insurance and Life and Retirement. We will return to a disciplined specialization in how we run our businesses. And we will have more distinct business segments, with clear accountability for the P&L and unit integrity.","I've already taken action in creating a loss-sensitive business unit called AIG Risk Management, or AIGRM. This business is distinct in how we market, underwrite, and manage risk. You will see more actions such as this, and I'm announcing today that we are reconstituting Lexington as a true standalone operation and best-in-class surplus lines writer. Finally, you heard me mention our distinct global footprint on past calls, and it remains a core strength of the company, which we will build upon. We announced earlier this week the addition of Chris Townsend as CEO of International General Insurance to lead these growth efforts.","You will find a change in our philosophy on underwriting risk. As you may know, it's not my style to take large limits and retentions of risk. However, our challenge has been the size of limits and where we write in the tower for various classes of businesses. We will also partner closely with our reinsurers as they provide another valuable set of eyes into our book. Reinsurance is a capital management tool that allows us to better balance our capital and risk across our global businesses as well as manage our gross limits. Peter will comment more on this in his remarks. Finally, in General Insurance, I've declared 2018 as a year of the underwriter. We made and continue to make great additions in underwriting talent and leadership and are taking actions to position them to perform. We will simplify our structure, so they're aligned with the market and incented to write profitable business. No one has commented more on the importance of data analytics and technology in our industry than me.","However, it is the underwriter, properly armed with this information that is the central control point in our business. So, it is important that we get the balance back. Our use of technology and data will complement the strength of seasoned underwriters with the skill-set to evaluate business on a risk-by-risk basis. I'll take advantage of areas of specialization so that we better deliver resolutions to the market, building on our underwriting expertise and partnering with our reinsurer. I will expect this will take a bit of time, but you should expect actions and improvements each quarter with a goal of getting to sustainable underwriting profitability. These are the steps to improve profitability and achieve our goal of making AIG better than it has ever been.","The benefit of our diversification was evident again this quarter in our solid consumer results. Consumer reported over $1 billion in pre-tax operating earnings this quarter. These businesses continue to provide earnings stability to AIG and value diversity across products and geographies, which Kevin will speak to. Finally, on the topic of our recent de-designation as a nonbank SIFI. Well, this is an important milestone for the company. And we believe it puts us on a level playing field with our competition. This positive action was the appropriate response given our size and risk exposure. Our views on growth, both organic and inorganic remain unchanged, and we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow AIG profitably.","With that, I'll turn it over to Sid to discuss the numbers.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll comment on our third quarter financial results and provide an update on our capital and liquidity. Turning to slide 4, we reported an after-tax operating loss per share of $1.22, reflecting catastrophe losses and reserve strengthening on recent accident years in commercial. Our consumer businesses delivered another solid quarter of results with a normalized ROE of 10.6% in the quarter and 11.6% year-to-date. Operating results also benefited from our ongoing expense discipline, with general operating expenses on an operating basis down 11% or over $260 million from the third quarter a year ago.","Turning to slide 5, the catastrophe losses of $3 billion were in line with our previously disclosed range and were comprised of $2.7 billion in Commercial losses and almost $300 million in Personal Insurance losses. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, our early estimate of California wildfire losses is approximately $500 million pre-tax, net of reinsurance and largely in our Personal Insurance business. Turning to slide 6, I'll provide some commentary on reserves. First, we have completed our assessment on over 80% of our reserves in total during our third quarter reviews. This leaves a little less than 20% of our reserves remaining to be reviewed in the fourth quarter. As part of our studies, we accelerated approximately $6 billion of reserves into the third quarter from the fourth quarter based on lines that displayed adverse claims trends.","As a result of our reviews, we strengthened prior year commercial P&C loss reserves by $900 million pre-tax, excluding the $62 million benefit from the amortization of the deferred gain on the adverse development cover. Based on the detailed valuation reviews, there was no overall development on the lines covered by ADC with Berkshire. At this point, the remaining 20% of lines scheduled for the fourth quarter do not display any adverse claims trends. Our observations of 2016 underwriting and claims trends resulted in the judgments we took on 2016 and 2017 accident years. These lines are still green with a range of uncertainty, and we decided it was prudent for us to further move up in the range. Detailed analyses, claims trends, and an evaluation of our underwriting supported these judgments and varied book-by-book.","In our European Casualty business, we saw an increase in large losses driven by an increase in underwriting limits in Continental Europe. And we are taking actions to remediate this book. U.S. Commercial Auto, including certain program business, continued to experience higher severity beyond our prior expectations. The reserve strengthening on the program business was due to programs we have terminated that have performed extremely poorly, and should amount to only $50 million of premium in the fourth quarter. We also added to U.S. Excess Casualty to move up in our range of potential outcomes. And finally, we took a reserve action in our Financial Lines portfolio for accident year 2016, largely to respond to increased private company bankruptcy trends and increased claims in not-for-profit.","As a result of our detailed reviews, we've also strengthened the current accident year loss PICCs for 2017 by roughly 4.9 points year-to-date. There is a catch up this quarter worth 3.3 points relates to the first six months of 2017. You'll also note that we incurred higher-than-expected severe losses this quarter. Year-to-date, our Commercial accident year loss ratio as adjusted is 68.9%, as shown on slide 7. And while we can't provide insight into an actual fourth quarter loss ratio, a high 60%s is a reasonable expectation for a full accident year. As we look at the chart, which shows 2016 and 2017 on a restated basis, we see roughly two points of improvement year-on-year. This is being driven by our mix shift, along with improvements within our Casualty and Specialty business.","However, the significant deterioration within our Property attrition on severe loss results is largely offsetting many of these improvements. We also recognized the $284 million operating pre-tax benefit in our Life and Retirement businesses, related to the annual review of actuarial assumption. The benefit was largely in the Individual Retirement business and reflected lower assumed lapses on Fixed Annuities as well as strong equity market performance, increasing our expected gross profits for Variable Annuities. This was partially offset by a reduced long-term return expectations. Our balance sheet and free cash flow remained strong.","As shown on slide 8, Parent Liquidity at quarter-end was $6.7 billion. During the quarter, we received approximately $500 million of distributions from our insurance companies, including tax sharing payments. Outflows during the quarter included approximately $700 million of calls and tenders of our debt. In addition, during the quarter, we also repurchased $278 million of our outstanding shares and warrants. With respect to capital, the recent CATs did not require us to downstream capital to our insurance subsidiaries. Our current capital ratios at subsidiaries are expected to end the year within our target range. We continue to have the commitment and discipline in executing our legacy strategy.","In late September, we signed a purchase and sale agreement to sell the remaining Life Settlements contracts, which closed on November 1. The impact of book value is a pre-tax, non-operating charge of approximately $300 million in the third quarter of 2017 to write-down the contracts to their fair market value implied by the pricing on these transactions. The net proceeds to the holding company were $1.1 billion and a smaller portion also went to our P&C insurance subsidiaries. The sale of the Life Settlement portfolio has allowed us to fully achieve our planned $9 billion in capital to Parent slightly ahead of schedule. We will continue to make progress on our Legacy strategy going forward, and update you when further transactions occur.","Looking ahead to 2018, we expect $4 billion to $5 billion in dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, excluding any potentially Legacy-related activity and subject to our customary approvals. Tax sharing payments from subsidiaries will reflect the impact of the losses we've seen in our P&C companies this quarter. We also continue to carefully assess the potential impacts from U.S. corporate tax reform and are in the process of studying yesterday's bill. Our previous sensitivity analysis on changes to the statutory tax rates still hold. An immediate reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate to 20% would result in a reduction in our deferred tax assets by approximately $7 billion.","Similarly, we would expect our ROE to increase by approximately 150 basis points prospectively. So in isolation, we view this as a slight positive from a value perspective. As a reminder, our year-end reporting will reflect the new organizational structure, which will become effective during the fourth quarter. Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance segments are transitioning to General Insurance led by Peter Zaffino and Life and Retirement led by Kevin Hogan. General Insurance is expected to include U.S. and international results for Commercial and Personal Insurance.","Life and Retirement is expected to include Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets. In advance of our fourth quarter earnings release, we plan to release a recast of our financial supplement. To sum up, despite the volatility in the Commercial business this quarter, we have a clear line of sight into how we're going to improve our results. We have demonstrated the value of maintaining a strong balance sheet and free cash flow profile, which gives us flexibility to execute on our strategic options.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter.","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some of my early observations at AIG, our third quarter business results for the Commercial business, and our focus on building an operating structure that will drive long-term sustainable improvements in underwriting, as well as our financial performance. First, let me express how pleased I am to have joined AIG, and it's great to be working with Brian again. I'm also very pleased to be working with a talented leadership team, and all of our colleagues from around the world. I expect the majority of my first three months here as a Global Chief Operating Officer, interacting with clients, distribution partners and colleagues.","During my visit to many cities around the world, I've begun to review our operations in more detail, and learn more about our ability to provide value and service to our clients and brokers. As part of the transition to AIG's new operating structure and my expanded role, I have spent the last 30 days becoming more familiar with the underwriting process and claims process for the Commercial and Personal Insurance businesses. Our early observations have affirmed many of the perspectives I had from interacting with AIG as a business partner in previous roles. First, our clients and broker partners regard AIG as an insurer with deep risk expertise and very strong underwriting capabilities, along with innovative solutions to deliver on our expansive global footprint.","They want AIG to be a strong and active underwriter of risk, and we have received overwhelming support of our plans to position AIG for the future. My second observation is related to the team at AIG. The spirit and collaborative nature of our colleagues as well as their desire to rally around leadership is truly impressive. Nowhere has that been more strongly evident than the remarkable response to the recent natural catastrophes. While these times are devastating for those directly impacted, it is incumbent upon us and the industry to do what we do best and get clients back to business. In my opinion, this is where AIG excels. Even before the events hit, we positioned 500 claims colleagues from various worldwide locations so that they were prepared to inspect locations and adjudicate claims as soon conditions would allow.","We've responded to over 11, 000 Commercial and Personal Lines claims and have physically inspected 99% of the sites impacted by Harvey and Irma and have distributed funds to our clients.","Moving on to my observations of the business, there have been many changes at AIG over the past decade, with strategic priorities shifting under numerous leadership appointments. As a result, it's been hard to focus the organization on making intended, meaningful progress to improve overall financial results. Our new organizational structure will play to AIG's core strength of underwriting expertise in key segments, connecting our global platform and leading with innovation, making us more responsive to client needs. It will more closely align us with our clients and distribution partners, define clearer accountabilities within AIG, drive more empowerment in the field, and improve the speed of decision-making.","We are enhancing our new structure by hiring very experienced underwriters and former colleagues with track records of strong financial performance to complement the talent we have here today.","Let me transition to some key areas of our performance. Turning to slide 10, I will speak to Commercial's third quarter results. As Sid mentioned, we will shift to presenting results for our General Insurance in the fourth quarter. Commercial's reported underwriting results reflect the noteworthy events that Sid discussed in his opening comments. Net premiums written declined 13% excluding FX, with 9 points of the total decline driven by continued risk selection efforts, mainly in U.S. Casualty and Property, and the remaining 4 points related to the previously announced sales of Ascot and select international operations to Fairfax.","On slide 11, Liability and Financial Lines accident year results include the increase in current accident year loss PICCs for U.S. Casualty. Risk selection efforts to improve performance in U.S. Casualty and market competition drove the quarter's premium decline.","Turning to slide 12, Property is clearly a focal point this quarter given the significant natural catastrophe losses, and we also experienced an elevated level of severe losses. It's important to note that, by and large, AIG did not have any recovery from our CAT reinsurance programs. Our reinsurance agreements were not triggered given the multiple loss events, each of which did not exceed our retention. Having said that, going forward, we will take a long-term strategic approach to reinsurance, working in close partnerships with our major reinsurers.","During 2018, at a minimum, we will look to take a lower net retention on our property CAT book, take less per-risk net retention in Property, reduce our net limits in certain casualty lines, and look for opportunities to further reduce volatility in our results as we position the company for long-term profitable growth.","In 2017, we saw incremental underwriting improvement for Commercial overall, but recognize that there's been further deterioration in our property. As Brian mentioned, the third quarter events will be a catalyst for Property, and we're taking actions. We've been communicating the need for both rate and CAT and non-CAT risks with clients and distribution partners. While we have much to do, and it is early, there are positive signs that Property rates will improve. Our goal is to achieve double-digit rate increases on a risk-adjusted basis, which will deliver further improvements in the accident year loss ratio on an adjusted basis.","I'll wrap up my third quarter commentary by acknowledging we're not where we want to be in terms of underwriting performance. I came to AIG because I'm highly motivated to contribute to the success of this terrific organization. Together with our leadership team, I intend to run to problems and to develop a plan to fix them as quickly as possible. As Brian outlined, we now have the key components of the operating structure, and we'll continue to develop and add talent with a laser focus on underwriting excellence. These are the elements that will enable AIG to become an industry leader that meets the needs of all of its stakeholders.","Looking forward, our main priority is to allow our teams to successfully prepare for January 1 renewals and not disrupt their efforts as they work with our clients. We expect to have the full General Insurance operating structure clearly defined by January 1, 2018, and have begun making progress on three major parts of our business, which I'll just cover briefly.","The first is our International business, where we just named Chris Townsend as CEO of International General Insurance earlier this week. Chris will lead AIG's International growth strategy. Our second area of focus is AIG's Risk Management and loss sensitive business, a core strength, which requires infrastructure that few companies have. We named Bill Rabl as CEO of AIGRM to create best practices and consistency in how we deliver value to our large clients. Lexington is our third area of focus. As the largest excess and surplus lines underwriter in the U.S., we will invest in specialized leadership, expertise and a distribution strategy that enables Lexington to act more opportunistically in the market.","We are working towards a new era for AIG, where we will fundamentally improve risk selection to deliver a better quality book, deploy capital towards the best opportunities for profitable growth, and improve our operational process. While we are embarking on a journey that will take some time as the prior accident years earn out, I'm confident in the choices we're making to deliver a repositioning that will solidify AIG as an industry leader. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on slide 14, Consumer produced solid results for the quarter despite higher catastrophe losses. We earned over $1 billion in pre-tax operating income, and our normalized ROE was 10.6%. Higher catastrophe losses were partially offset by lower accident-year losses for Personal Insurance and the favorable actuarial assumptions update and higher fee income for Life and Retirement. Strength of the equity markets has continued to help partially mitigate the challenges and impact of the low-rate environment on our results. During the quarter, we continued to take further actions to enhance returns, strengthen our platforms and pursue targeted growth opportunities.","Turning to Individual Retirement on slide 15, regulatory uncertainties and disruption have continued to significantly affect distributors, negatively impacting industry sales, particularly of annuity products. This disruption, along with more aggressive competition in the Fixed Annuity space, led to materially lower Individual Retirement sales and net flows from a year ago. In the face of industry sales challenges, we continued our disciplined approach with respect to product pricing, product features and asset quality. We've enhanced the product design and features for our Variable and Index Annuities in a disciplined manner, which has attracted new sales. And continue to benefit from our broad product portfolio and diversified distribution network.","Individual Retirement's Assets Under Administration were at historical highs at quarter-end driven by equity market performance and positive Index Annuity net flows, which resulted in increased fee income. We continued our practice of active spread management but as expected, we saw compression from the runoff of higher-yielding assets and the low-yield environment. Also, Commercial mortgage loan and unexpected accretion income impacted base net investment spreads benefiting Variable and Index Annuities in the current quarter and Fixed Annuities in the prior period.","Turning to Group Retirement on page 16, our investments in VALIC has transformed the plan sponsor and participant's experience continued to pay off.","Improved net flows reflected strong sales, including a very high level of new group acquisitions year-to-date as well as improved group plan retention. Assets Under Administration for Group Retirement were also at historical highs at quarter-end driven by equity market performance. Despite disciplined rate management, net investment spread declined partially caused by higher Commercial mortgage loan income in the prior period, but also due to the run-off of higher-yielding assets and reinvestment in the low-yield environment. Looking forward, across Individual and Group Retirement, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our net spreads will decline by approximately 1 to 3 basis points per quarter.","Let's now move on to Life Insurance on slide 17. Our Life Insurance business continued to make progress, executing on our plans to enhance ROE and return to growth. In the U.S., our new modern administrative platform, distribution simplification efforts and narrowed product focus are supporting both top and bottom line growth. Our premiums and deposits increased and we had strong growth in both term and universal Life Insurance sales. Also, mortality experience was consistent with prior year and within the pricing expectations. Turning to slide 18, although the headline for Personal Insurance for the quarter was higher catastrophe losses, the normalized results reflected the strategic actions we have taken over the last few years to reposition this business.","These actions include a focus on markets and customer segments where we have a competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects. The improvement in Personal Insurance's accident year combined ratio as adjusted reflected lower non-CAT losses in the quarter. As I mentioned in our earnings call for the second quarter, we are moving our focus from margin expansion to growth at targeted margins. Finally, in Japan, we continue to make progress on our transformation, while producing solid underwriting results. We remain on track for the legal entity merger on January 1, 2018, with a completion of User Acceptance Testing and the resulting systems cut-over in October, allowing us to achieve the milestone of soliciting new and renewal policies on the new legal entity platforms and paper effective January 1. As this transition continues into 2018, we will have the expense of still operating multiple legal entities, which will have some variability ahead of savings being realized in 2019 and beyond. To close, I'm pleased with the progress we are making across our businesses.","Now, I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up to Q&A.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay, well, listen, let me do it. So, operator, let's start Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Thank you. And our first question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. Working through all the changes with reserve \u2013 inter-quarter reserve charges and whatnot, I look at the liability in Financial Lines segment and I see about 300, 400 basis points of initial PICC improvement from the first half of 2017 to third quarter 2017. Give that you had these early emergent loss problems in the 2016 year, is it prudent to be picking the third quarter of 2017 so much higher \u2013 or so much better than the first half of the year?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, Josh, I think we're being realistic about our loss PICCs. There was improvement. I think there is some \u2013 recognize, the starting points, but if you go accident-year-to-accident-year there was improvements in Casualty, whether it's reducing areas of high loss levels or changing reinsurance, et cetera, we're basically getting rid of programs, et cetera. So we have made improvements, so I think they're realistic. Yeah.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","The third quarter book looks somewhat different from the first half book is what you're saying?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, I don't know if it's the third quarter. I mean, I look at it on a year-to-date basis. That's the loss ratio you got to look at and that's the one I concern myself with. And Sid tried to give you a kind of a general idea of what the accident year for the \u2013 for all of 2017 is going to be and I think that's really, to me, our starting point. And that's the one I would use.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Thanks. So just going back to, I guess, Brian's earlier comments. You originally said that reserves appear reasonable, and I think you also said this morning that, that you still \u2013 that, that conclusion still holds. If that's the case, is this \u2013 is the lower reserve, I guess, activity we're seeing this quarter, that level of volatility, what investors should be used to or expect on a go-forward basis? Thanks.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. Let me clarify. I think the reserve process is reasonable. And when I look at 2016, it's the first chance we get to look at it really, first real view of it. So, I consider this more underwriting than actuarial. This is looking at our underwriting and understanding what our starting point was and whether the changes taking effect were as strong as they were, and we're setting that up.","So we are in a business of volatility. There's no question about it. So quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see movements, but as I said in my remarks, and Peter repeated, we want to dampen some of this volatility through reinsurance to take some of that out, and then get the right base going forward. And that's \u2013 I think the real takeaway for you is, that I would like you to understand is, the process is reasonable. The underwriting will get better, and we will get these accident year loss ratios down and we'll get to profitability.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And, I guess, thinking about the process of \u2013 whether it's establishing reserves this quarter or even just losses on the hurricane, is there anything different about, I guess, the approach that you might have taken in establishing what the right size of those was versus what you think AIG may have done in the past?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, look, it's very wise for me to comment on what AIG did in the past, and so, I don't want to do that. What I want to do is, say, look, I come here and I look at what we're doing now, and I think it's reasonable. I do. And to me, if you've got a problem, you recognize it, you recognize it early, you admit it, you have to fix it. That's our business. You can't go error free. What you can do is be relentless in the pursuit of the truth and the resulting actions that are required. And that's what we're doing. So, I think it's \u2013 I think we're on the right track. I really do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. One question and then a follow-up. The first, I just want to clarify that, as the remaining reserves are reviewed for Property Casualty in the fourth quarter, and we realized there's around 20% left. Am I right in saying or characterizing, what you're saying as, don't expect anything meaningful from a development standpoint in 4Q?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","I had a feeling you'd ask something like that, Jay. So, let me give you a couple of data points, okay. There was \u2013 yeah, there's about 20% left (36:12) $10 billion, I think something like that and 80% \u2013 here's the data point, 80% of that's basically covered by the ADC. So that's data point. And the other is, as Sid pointed out, we pulled forward anything that we saw that was showing deterioration signs, the rest isn't. so, I think those are two indications of what the fourth quarter might produce.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you. And then for Peter, I believe you mentioned in your prepared remarks expectations for double-digit rate increases in Commercial. Are you talking about just Commercial Property insurance? And, I don't if at this point you want to give any expectations for accident year loss ratio improvement in 2018?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Thanks, Jay. Why don't I just comment on what's happening on with rate. And as Brian mentioned and I followed-up is that the tax have been a catalyst for pushing rate, but the accident years for Property have underperformed I think in the industry, with a lot of rate pressure from the better part of the last four years. I think the lack of CAT has allowed the attritional loss ratio to kind of creep up. So in the third quarter, we began to push rate and that was on CAT exposed as well non-CAT exposed business and the rates are holding. I mean, just a reminder, our fourth quarter is the seasonally smallest quarter for Property, so it'll take a little bit of time. I actually think that the reinsurance market hasn't fully worked its way out either with the retro capacity we see capital being raised, so that's really to serve a lot of the current portfolio, how that translates into reinsurance and then into primary, we will see. But we have been over-communicating with distribution partners and clients and outlining a lot of specific reasons why we need rate and the early signs are that we're achieving it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. My first question, I guess, is a little bit of follow-up tied together, price and reinsurance. So Peter, on your comment, you pointed to purchasing more reinsurance next year with expectations that rates will be higher. Do you think you guys \u2013 is the strategy to get enough price on your own business to offset the impact of paying higher reinsurance price and just how do you envision that all coming together in the margins in your Commercial line's book?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","I think you want to \u2013 she wanted you to answer that, Peter?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","All right, Elyse, well, we had a fairly traditional CAT program on a per occurrence basis. We're looking at a variety of different options in the market now. We're looking at different ways of structuring the CAT, we're looking at different ways to structure our per risk, looking for perhaps some catastrophe covering our per risk. So, we're looking at a variety of different structures. So, we'll be in a better position to talk about it in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure that on our book, we're going to see a significant amount of rate in the reinsurance structure, that's yet to be determined. And that's not going to really influence what we're doing on the front-end. We're pushing rate because we need to improve our accident years in Property.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Can I just add to that? Elyse, let me just add to that. Look, we're buying reinsurance because we have too much volatility, frankly. And I want the partnership of a reinsurer to help me look at our portfolio. There's a lot of value in reinsurance, and we don't expect rate compression. We don't think that the resulting numbers are going to be out of line with where they should be, but we're going to see real value out of the reinsurance. And I don't expect that to be a problem. It's going to be a help to us.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then my second question, if we kind of think about the Property market today and just the expectations for higher prices, I mean just from sitting through and thinking about the softness that we've seen over the past years, how sustainable do you think a hard market could be? And, Brian, as you kind of think back, is there another kind of prior period you would compare the type of hardening market we're potentially looking forward to on the Commercial Lines side?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Elyse, that's interesting. I've been around a while, seen a few hard markets, but there haven't been that many. I mean, so we'll not talking about 20. They're all different. They're all different. They all start out different. They all end different. It's usually \u2013 obviously, it starts with the fact that the pricing, whatever level, isn't any good. And we certainly had that aspect. I think a lot of times, it's a withdrawal of capacity as opposed to a loss, because the catastrophe itself took it away. They tend to be localized. So in my experience, you could have a Property hard market, and you don't have a Casualty hard market. The 9\/11 time was a bit different. So I think the market is recognizing that the Property levels are unsustainable, number one. Number two, the Property market has believed (41:48) it's been living off of the CAT profits. They don't exist.","And number three, I think there is a real question about whether the models for CAT are hitting the mark. Is there a global warming, et cetera, the things that we're seeing, wildfires in California. So, I think there's maybe a question about the whole level of exposure that we have. All those are a great making for a market. How long it lasts? I guess it lasts as long as it lasts. How long is a piece of string? I don't know, but I do think it has all the ingredients for a significant improvement to Property because the Property has problems at the frequency level, it's got problems at the severe loss level, and it's got problems in the CAT, and all should be fixed. The interesting thing is the market \u2013 we have to do it anyway. We started taking actions and raising rates and taking care of our exposures. And the market is doing exactly the same thing. So we definitely see a sign of a market change here.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning. My first question on the underlying loss ratio trends, and if you look at the (42:52) trend, it improved about 2 points like to 69% in the first nine months of 2017. So, given the underwriting action you are taking right now, and just wonder, the pace of the improvements, the 2 points, do you see that will be slower in 2018?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","No, I don't think it'd be slower. I don't think it'd be slower.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Because we're addressing non-Property lines with the actions they require, and risk selection is the number one action taken, and we've already talked about the Property, so, no, I don't think it'll be slower.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. My follow-up question on capital management, you purchased about like $275 million of shares in the third quarter. Is that level the investor can expect going forward? And how do you see the $4 billion to $5 billion sub-dividends (44:00) going forward each year?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","I'm not going to give you an expectation of what we might do in share buybacks. We bought back shares. And we may buy back shares again. I won't tell you when or how or what, but it is a capital management tool; we've used it. We do have capital; we want to deploy that capital in our business, that's primary. I believe we have places that we can deploy to make improvements in our portfolio and long-term structure, and that's the number one priority. Okay. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Tom Gallagher with Evercore.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning. Two questions, Brian. The first one, just on the SIFI de-designation; given when you read the Fed's commentary about how much you shrunk the balance sheet as the rationale for the de-designation. Does this inform your view of what types of deals you might consider from an M&A perspective, meaning would you consider deals that added a lot of balance sheet given what the Fed said in that process?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, that's interesting, Tom. When I do a deal that adds to the \u2013 well, I think most deals do add to the balance sheet, so that's not my first thought, though, obviously. My first thought is, is it strategic? Is it something that makes us better? Do we get better people or better technology or better market penetration, or are we in places we don't? And I'm not \u2013 anything we do would make us larger. But I want us to be better and better balanced and have more diversification on earnings stream. And that trumps anything else.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Got you. And then my follow-up is, when I think about the message at AIG in 2015 and 2016, it was getting far more conservative and shrinking the casualty book. And now you have all this adverse development on the 2016 accident year for the long-tail lines. I guess, what I ask myself, is it possible that there was a lot of adverse selection there as AIG was executing the pivot? Is that part of what's going on here? Or is that \u2013 do you think that's not the right observation?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Tom, look \u2013 there's probably some of that. I would say that selection trumps price; let's start with that, okay. And if one takes action and it's price-oriented, you could suffer some risk selection issues if you're not thinking selection first. And so I've tried to emphasize in my remarks that risk selection is our first priority, and we will price the products that we like appropriately. And so if there is some adverse selection taking place, we're going to root that out.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Hi. Thank you. With the issues we've seen in 2016, 2017 books, it's clear and as you alluded today, AIG has continued to have some underwriting challenges. Based on what you observed, what do you think is driving this? And can you provide more detail on what you're doing on the underwriting side in terms of talent, processes, data, et cetera, to improve the results?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, look, I think there were some actions, and I don't want to denigrate all the work that was done here. I mean, there is some improvement. But I think the \u2013 back to what we said, Peter, and I said about the Commercial business, we attacked the structure because I think the structure was not recognizing that Specialty matters. So, there was a little too much general, it's not Specialty. We imposed, and rightfully so, better underwriting tools, tools to help underwriters get better. But we have to have the underwriters make the ultimate decisions. So I think we \u2013 I think the pendulum might have swung a little bit towards the science and less towards underwriting of selection. We want to restore that balance.","I think, I know, we're in a volatile. We take a lot of volatility. Our gross lines I believe were too high. I believe our net lines were too high. So when you have issues, they're extreme. If you make a mistake, it's exacerbated. So we want to cut those extremes down. And I think, we want a better balance. I mean, you've got to pick your spots where you can make money and where you can you should reduce. Some of that took place. There's a greater, maybe, an enhanced sense of urgency to do that and, yeah, there's a \u2013 we have good people here. But there are places where we need good people that we're getting from the outside. It will always starts with people. You put a good structure together, I think we got a great structure. You put good people in that structure, you empower them, and you hold them accountable, and this is very doable. I've seen it before, I haven't seen \u2013 there's nothing I haven't seen before. This is all basic execution and it's execution that will win the day here. And we are executing.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Thank you, appreciate the comments. And just \u2013 from the specialization of the business units, what does that mean from a practical basis? And how do you see that improving the results?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, we talked about AIG Risk Management. That's a business in our marketplace that comes in, in a certain way, has to be handled by specialists. We have diffused that and spread it across the business. Now we've created the unit, again, we used to have one, we created it again. Lexington; Lexington is a Surplus Lines company. It requires a separate unit with people who are specialists in Surplus Lines work. We had taken that business and kind of spread it into our branches. And so, there are \u2013 people were doing both. That's not a good way to structure, so we've gone back, and we're creating the Lexington. Peter, maybe you want to add something?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, Brian, I think just to add to what you were saying is that by creating these distinct units that have very strong capabilities within their segment, if you look AIGRM, the ability to share best practices across the loss sensitive and Risk Management business is going to yield better results. We are doing a bottoms-up review, so Bill Rabl is going to look at \u2013 there's a finite amount of risk, there's 800 (50:48), we're going to do a ground up view of risk selection, attachment points and using all the tools, data and capabilities that we have to price the business. So we're really going to get into the details and focus on underwriting and improving the book.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Larry Greenberg with Janney. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Just following up on underlying loss ratio. I just want to be sure I'm understanding this, that usually when we hear about underwriting actions and how the accounting works in this business, it usually takes a year to two for it to flow through the bottom lines. But am I understanding that, that with reinsurance, with cutting back limits, with some of the actions that you or your predecessors might have taken to-date that we can expect or should expect an improvement in 2018 levels?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, one would hope our 2018 has improved over 2017, that's the actions we're taking. And yeah, reinsurance can speed it up a little bit, I suppose. Things still have to earn out. 2017 is going to earn out into 2018, that's just life. And there's nobody that wants to get this done any faster than me. I know you're impatient I'm even more impatient than you are. There is a sense of urgency here. We'll get it done as fast as humanly possible.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great. And then the volatility in the larger severe losses in the Property line, is there any way to kind of give us a tolerance level for severe losses? Or how we should be thinking about that prospectively as you cut back limits?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Peter is going to answer that.","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Yes. I think Larry, back to what we had talked about on the risk appetite for a property per risk, we probably \u2013 when we were re-underwriting the book, I think we took some very good actions to try to improve the overall portfolio. I believe focusing on areas of key segmentation and continuing that evolution. But I think it'll be a better chance for us to update in the next quarter when we have an understanding of our per risk. I think our tolerance is going to decrease, and so some of those spikes that perhaps you've seen in the past will be leveled out. I think that's what Brian was referring to, and lessening the volatility that we're seeing on some of the losses, even in Casualty where we just have too big of a net. So, I don't think you can draw to one specific reason as to why it's occurring, other than we want to protect the balance sheet and protect our results through reinsurance purchasing above severe.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Two quick questions here for you. First, if I look at the general operating expenses, down 20% year-over-year in the Commercial line segment. So, Brian, Peter, I'm wondering, when are we going to start seeing the investments in the business that you'd talked about start to kick in on the expense side? And could that have some offset with respect to the margins in the business as the loss ratio may be goes down, you'll start to see the expense ratio at least in the interim kind of move up here?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. Investment is \u2013 we're investing in people. So there's good GOE and bad GOE, that's a good GOE.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Right.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","And we're investing in people. So that \u2013 and I said this in the last call, maybe you're going to see \u2013 you could see some offsets to reductions over here with increases over here, but we're adding to the strength of the company. Ultimately, that's a good thing. So I'm not \u2013 we have to be expense conscious in this business. We, as a company, still have an expense level that's in excess of our peers and therefore, in excess of what the market will bear. We've got to address that. There's no question about it. And there's different ways to address it, but getting better people in is \u2013 has to be a priority, period. Sid, you want to say something?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, Brian, I'd just remind you one of the areas that we've been most aggressive on and that has contributed to our expense discipline has been areas such as professional services fees, overhead IT infrastructure, real estate and we're going to continue to attack those areas I think with a tremendous amount of discipline, both at AIG level and in Commercial.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Right. And we're going through this \u2013 we mentioned the structure. The structure calls for \u2013 like all unit integrity, more specialized units, more of them. Technically speaking, that probably adds a little bit to expense levels. But my experience is when you put someone in charge, give them a unit, they squeeze the living daylights out of the expenses. So, I think ultimately, that's another great way to get our expenses under control. Give people responsibilities for a P&L, and you'll see expense discipline.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Great. And then, just next question quickly, just on the share buyback that we saw on the quarter, kind of taking a little bit different way here toward this, Brian. $250 million, not a whole lot, not that meaningful. Why buy back anything? Why not just keep the cash in your balance sheet for these investment opportunities?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","I got to say, what a great question, Brian. I mean, I didn't expect to say, why you're buying any stock back? So this is interesting. It's a management, it's a capital management tool, and we deployed it and I'll continue to deploy it. Look, I don't have anything against stock buyback as a management tool. If I can find something better to do with the capital, you know I better be doing that, that's what we get paid to do. So no, we make the decisions as the moment arises, and we'll continue to do that.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Look, I think I'm being told that we should wrap up. So operator, I'm going to just do some closing remarks now. Look, first of all, thank you, investing publics to \u2013 that listened to the story. I think, just be confident in our efforts. We will right this ship, it's started already. I am a very optimistic man about this, I really am. And then, I really want to finish by thanking the employees. Look, we've gone through a very difficult quarter, catastrophes that have affected us as a business and affected us personally, and I can't be prouder. So thanks, everybody.","Operator","And once again, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"2136":["American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG) Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference Call December  6, 2016 11:30 AM ET","Executives","Siddhartha Sankaran - Executive Vice President and CFO","Analysts","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Michael Nannizzi","Okay, we\u2019ll get started here. So everyone takes their seats. Just give a couple of more minutes. We have some seats at the edges here on the corners.","All right, chill I\u2019m Mike Nannizzi, I\u2019m the property & casualty insurance here at Goldman Sachs. We\u2019re pleased to have AIG joining us here today. AIG has approximately $66 billion from market capitalization among the world\u2019s largest property and casualty insurers, with a large life insurance operation as well.","Joining us today from AIG is Sid Sankaran. Sid is AIGs Executive Vice President and CFO. Prior to being appointed CFO in 2015, Sid served as the Company\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and was responsible for overseeing the Company\u2019s approach to both pricing and macro economic risk factors.","Today, as CFO one of his primary responsibilities is overseeing the company\u2019s strategic plan including its $25 billion capital return through 2017, a core product of this strategy laid out in the beginning of the year and one that has been a central focus of investors.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sid for his opening comments and then we\u2019ll sit down for some Q&A. Thanks.","Siddhartha Sankaran","Thank you, Mike. I\u2019ll just point you to our forward looking cautionary statements to read [indiscernible]. But really today, what I wanted to cover were progress on our financial targets, specifically our return-on-equity in both our operating and legacy portfolio.","Our general operating expense or efficiency program, capital management, book value per share growth and our accident year loss ratio. Before I dive into the detail, I thought it would be helpful for this side end if we just step back a little bit and provided some broader context for strategic planning.","So I always like to point people back to Peter Hancock\u2019s initial shareholder letter when he became CEO in early 2015. In that letter, I think Peter really highlighted three things. You know the first, was a priority to simplify the organization and focus on our core operating margins. Secondly, a need to invest particularly in data, science and technology. And thirdly, a commitment to scope the company and create a meaner more focused AIG.","As we provided an update on our strategic plan really in January of this year, I think the market context of that time is also of note. First, really, we saw a challenging interest rate outlook ahead of us and more importantly, we saw a lot of excess capital in the commercial insurance space. So our plan really focussed on aligning three things; revenues where we were targeting shrinking, expenses where we were accelerating our expense reduction plan and finally capital where we were committed to returning excess capital to shareholders.","So when you think of our strategy you need to think of those three elements, revenue, expenses and capital as really aligned. And as we sit here today, really three quarters into what I see as an eight quarter plan, I think we are very pleased with the progress against our strategic objectives and also against our goals and remain confident in hitting our 2017 targets.","I\u2019m going to turn the page -- as we\u2019ve said before we really feel AIG is best valued and best in three parts. First, in blue the operating portfolio, this is about three quarters of the company\u2019s capital and is our core business. If you were targeting at 10% return on equity and growth in strategic segments.","Secondly, in green the legacy portfolio, this is about a quarter of the company\u2019s capital. Here our objective is different; here we are focused on return of capital and free cash flow while minimizing the impact of book value per share.","Finally, in yellow what is really important to us is our deferred tax asset. And for those of you who haven\u2019t followed AIG that closely that the deferred tax asset for us is a very valuable source of free cash flow. And so, while there\u2019s been a lot of dialogue around changes in tax policy and it\u2019s still very preliminary at our investor day we did highlight some preliminary analysis. I think the key message is that we feel a reduction in the statutory tax rate is a positive for intrinsic value and a walk through why. First, for us we still believe that we\u2019re utilizing full all our foreign tax credits. So those will shield the higher amount of taxable income, which is very important.","Secondly, as you reduce the statutory tax rate, if there were an immediate reduction to 25% that would be approximately a 90 basis point increase in our return on equity. If it were to be an immediate reduction to 20%, that would be an increase in our normalized return on equity about 150 basis points. So we feel given where we are in the tax basis that that would close our gap on an ROE sense to peers.","Finally, clearly if we were to reduce the overall statutory tax rate as a function of tax policy, we did highlight that that would result in a re-measurement of our DTA, so an immediate reduction to 25% would result in a $4 billion re-measurement of our deferred tax asset associated with our NOLs and our timing differences and a reduction to 20% would be about $6 billion with respect to a re-measurement of those NOLs and the timing difference DTA.","So, that is in punch line a summary of how we think about valuing the company. If I turn the page and focus on the operating portfolio, here I leave you with a couple of messages. We have been extremely focussed on improving the overall return on equity of the operating portfolio and feel we\u2019ve improved it by about 150 basis points year-on-year. This has largely been a function of three things, improving our risk margins, our operating efficiency and capital management.","As we look to 2017, our projection is for approximately a 10% return on the operating portfolio and this will be a function of two drivers, continued efficiency gains which we\u2019ll talk about as well as continued underwriting improvements particularly on the loss ratio side.","For a moment spending a little bit of time on general operating expenses or what we call think of as our efficiency program. We expect as we announced on investor day to exceed our two-year target on expenses and efficiency.","As we said and disclosed in our last earnings call, we\u2019ve taken out about $800 million of operating expense, general operating expense as normalized on an operating basis year-to-date, so that is roughly 57% of the target we announced. Based on actions we\u2019ve taken already with respect to compensation and benefits, and in particular professional fees, we are anticipating approximately an additional 36% reduction of $500 million in the forward looking run rate.","So we feel we are about 93% of the way there, and this is really been based on our principles of simplification, modularity and automation and at the same time we\u2019ve been taking our expenses, we have done that while continuing to invest in strategic programs particularly technology. So again, the main message here is we expect to exceed our two-year targets on this dimension.","Capital return, obviously, as Mike alluded to this is a favourite topic of our investors and our analysts. And so, we feel we are very confident in meeting our capital return targets of atleast $25 billion of return of capital to shareholders. This slide has a few items that I call your attention to.","First, as of the investor day of a couple of weeks ago, we completed about $11.6 billion of capital return. We have remaining authorisation as of that date of approximately $3.6 billion. That leaves $9.8 billion remaining to our capital return target.","As we highlighted in the green bar here, we see about $12 billion to $17 billion of funding sources available to meet that $9.8 billion. What are those sources? First, we have $5 billion to $7 billion of dividends and tax sharing payments that would be net of our overhead and interest expense. Secondly, we spent a fair bit of time at investor day walking through the divestitures that we\u2019ve announced to scope the portfolio. There we see $4 billion to $5 billion roughly of free cash flow in our projections.","Thirdly, we previously announced a set of Life Reinsurance transaction having executed one of those transactions in the third quarter. So we have about $3 billion to $4 billion of funding from the Life Reinsurance transactions and as we announced previously we\u2019ve our new Doug Dachille, has announced a set of asset management and portfolio changes and in particular focussing on hedge funds and third party managers and we\u2019re still about roughly upto $1 billion of additional dividend flows coming from that reallocation.","So again, the rare punch line here is we remain comfortable with our targets and confident that we are going to hit them given our track record. What I would say I\u2019m most proud of is that we continue to do that without sacrificing the strength of our balance sheet. So as you see on this slide, we continue to maintain very healthy capital ratios in our subsidiaries and in addition I think we have industry leading free cash flow and holding company liquidity that really indicates for us a very strong strength of balance sheet.","Legacy, so I alluded to the legacy portfolio in our initial comments and our investor day did highlight a set of additional disclosures and I think Charlie Shamieh and the Focus Legacy team we have are doing a terrific job. A couple of few points here, first the legacy through nine months year-to-date has continued to act as a drag on our overall ROE, it\u2019s about minus 2%. We think as we are looking forward on a normalized basis the ROE will be in a range of 3% to 5%.","Again, the objectives here for legacy has been return of capital and free cash flow. And as you can see from the chart, we think roughly through three quarters of the year we\u2019ve managed to take legacy down from that roughly 25% to 16% and our liquidity to parent here the free cash flow has been about $6.3 billion from the fourth quarter to now. So Charlie and the team are focused, they are executing and you should expect to continue to see us update you with new transactions each quarter.","So this is the perfect time I think for me to shift a little bit to talk about our business. And with respect to both commercial and consumer, I\u2019d encourage each of you who didn\u2019t get chance to listen in on our investor day to pay attention to the remarks from Rob Schimek, our head of commercial and Kevin Hogan, our head of consumer and I think they frankly did a fabulous job in explaining why AIG has such great market leadership and unique franchisees. They gave detail I think on why we have market leadership with our clients, why we have market leadership with our distribution partners and how we are continuing to innovate and so it was a great opportunity to hear from them in a little more detail than you might have heard on a normal earnings call.","With respect to our commercial portfolio which is the area where obviously we spend the most time in our discussion. We provided detail which really highlights and this chart is an important one because it highlights based on the internal amount of capital we\u2019ve allocated at our mix of business and where we\u2019re heading. And where we\u2019re heading is in line with our goal of maximising intrinsic value, of course meeting client objectives, but also driving ROE improvement.","If you see on this slide, it\u2019s a little hard for me to see in small fund that we have a lot of levers that we can move. And so this slide is important because first you see the growth levers primary casualty international, M&A, cyber in the property space in particular large limit where we have a very unique capability as well as energy and engineered risk or I would say the same as well as credit lines.","At the same time, we are reducing participation in many segments of the overall portfolio, most clearly in excess casualty in the U.S. but also you see that in different pockets of environmental, E&S and property where we\u2019ve been actively reducing the portfolio and pricing has been challenged as well as programs and pockets of the aerospace business.","We are also going to continue to be very opportunistic, and so you saw a little bit of that where we are managing with intrinsic value and ROE enhancement as a top priority where we announced in the third quarter the sale of both MSM and Ascot and we are going to be opportunistic, you can also expect an allocating capital based on market conditions.","And we think that capital allocation along with a lot of what we are doing and I\u2019ll speak to you in a second on the account level side are really going to drive that ROE improvement that we talked about.","Accident year combined ratio as adjusted. The trend since year-end 2015 through the nine months of the year we think has been very strong with three points of improvements in the accident year combined ratio as adjusted. Now we\u2019ve announced a target of about six points over two years from 2015 to 2017 on an exit [ph] run rate basis around the accident year loss ratio as adjusted. We\u2019ve got two points of that which I\u2019ll speak to you in a little bit more detail.","Equally important and what we are doing based on the shift and mix of business is actively managing the expense ratio where you see a point of improvement as well as managing the mix of Cadex [ph] of those business. So we shared in our investor day our AAL.","And clearly here as I alluded to before, integrating revenue expense and managing capital for this portfolio of business is key because you\u2019ve got to get the cost and the fixed expense out while you are remixing that portfolio and bringing it down you know to improve the underwriting margin.","With a quick shift, I\u2019m going to talk now about what\u2019s driving the loss ratio improvement. So if you look at this slide, obviously our starting point is a 66% roughly accident year loss ratio as adjusted for full year 2015. We think year-to-date we got about two points of that, that\u2019s been driven largely by big business mix as well as improvements in casualty.","Now just a reminder on the casualty side, we think we\u2019ve got solid rate improvement now for the past four quarters. That has been \u2013 that improvement has been offset a little by the programs adjustment in the last peak that we talked about in the third quarter, but that\u2019s the two points that we\u2019ve gotten so far year-to-date.","The biggest driver of the forward-looking improvement as Rob has talked about has been the difference between written and earned. So based on the actions we\u2019ve taken with the book and what we\u2019ve underwritten over the next year or five quarters we expect that to earn into the P&L. And that will be about two points of improvement.","We did call out and we have done some questions around the UGC quota share and so, one comment that I might make that hopefully could be helpful in clarifying the UGC quota share for you is when we announced our targets in January of this year around six points, we did not include any of the subsequent divestitures that we announced.","So we did not include in that projection the sale of Ascot, MSM and Fairfax each of those you can think of as negative to us with respect to our loss ratio improvement plans plus positive to us when you are thinking about combined ratio, ROE and intrinsic value. And that loss ratio impact was offset by the positive from UGC.","So it\u2019s net flat and we did that just to be pretty transparent to folks so they could understand where the loss ratio improvements are coming from. You know in addition to those steps what we see as the coming benefits from exits, which are exits that we have announced that are coming up for renewal which will earn their way in. Growth, I talked about key growth lines just a second ago and then finally risk selection, because ultimately the big driver for us here is around ensuring rate adequacy on our book. And so, there we have a real discipline around what we called AQI or Account Quality Index that\u2019s driving the risk selection.","So the sum of that is what\u2019s driving our loss ratio improvement and as we sit here today we remain confident in that target and are looking forward to updating you a little bit more when we get to your end.","Flipping very quickly to consumer, you know again here we pictured how we are allocating our capital, so again this is a picture to scale on capital. But each of our businesses the key message I leave you with or at scale you know individual retirement is really variable annuity, index annuity and fixed annuity and in this space we\u2019re not number one in any of those segments but we are top five in each of them and number one in aggregate and here what really drives you know sustainable returns above our cost of capital is being agile on how we deploy that capital. When we look at the market and opportunities between those products, we do not have fixed distribution that we need to feed and so risk management is a key here in our competitive differentiation.","When you look at group retirement, you know Vallack [ph] has a very strong franchise and again if you look at assets under management, I believe Kevin highlighted this at Investor Day we are number two in the [indiscernible] sector, I believe we are number three in higher education, number four in healthcare. So very strong franchise here and solid profitability.","Life, you know obviously this is smaller segment of our capital allocated and with some of the reinsurance transactions; we\u2019ve been focussed on ROE enhancement and managing risk and capital here. This is largely U.S. Life book and for the first time we are back in the top five in the U.S. with respect to term sales which is where we want to be given the investment, interest rate environment at this point in time.","Finally, personal insurance. So personal insurance again we spent a lot more time talking about of late, but we\u2019ve had strong margin expansion here and in particular we have segments of the market that we think we have a prominent franchise and are growing.","With respect to consumer insurance and base yields and spreads, this is going to be key driver of earnings and we\u2019ve continued to maintain our discipline here on both pricing and asset liability management. So we\u2019ve previously disclosed that we think net spreads are going to decline about two to four basis points a quarter that obviously was in the second quarter when interest rates were lower. We are going to continue to evaluate our forecast and update that but obviously the interest rate environment has turned a little bit more positively of late.","And my final slide is on personal insurance which is you can see here, we\u2019ve got very margin expansion in personal insurance. We have sustainable loss ratio since time. We have been improving that expense ratio and feel pleased with where it is, but it still has more to come.","It has really got some elements of this business that are tremendous franchise, our private client group has been growing and benefitting from industry consolidation. We recently announced a very innovative multinational ultra high network, home owners property, which we think is unique in the market.","And so this business with its cash flow, it\u2019s risk, its diversification characteristics is a great contributor to the portfolio and we are pleased with how it\u2019s been improving but we still have a little bit more to do and we are confident in the team that\u2019s working on it.","So with that, Mike I tried to blow through a lot of information for you. We\u2019ll leave it open for some Q&A. But maybe well -- I\u2019ll grab a seat.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Michael Nannizzi","Great. Thanks so much. Starting on with a couple of questions from the audience, feel free to raise your hand or get the mike over to you. So I guess that one thing you mentioned at your investor day you talked and you alluded to in your presentation here as why that you are running ahead of your deployment targets or atleast the capital generation targets that you had outlined at the beginning of this year, but didn\u2019t update the deployment part.","I guess one of the question is, how should we be thinking about that addition or you talked about that sort of $12 billion to $17 billion versus the $9.8 billion to complete the $25 billion, is there a scenario where you would expect that capital to remain in the company or is it just a matter of timing in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about that?","Siddhartha Sankaran","Yes. We\u2019ve broken out the sources for you, right. We\u2019ve given you the dividends and tax sharing contribution, contribution of divestitures, as well as the life insurance transaction and hedge funds, so we have a good sense what\u2019s driving our funding sources for the remaining $9.8 billion. I think what I would say is, we remain confident in that $25 billion and returning at least $25 billion of capital as we\u2019ve said.","And clearly each of those funding sources that are going to come in over time, but I think to me the punch line when you look at this company extending in 2017 and beyond it has an extremely strong balance sheet, great free cash flow, tremendous capital generation. And so, we\u2019re constantly going to evaluate our alternatives for capital deployment between organic growth, capital return for share in organic growth and we\u2019re always evaluating that. But we just came out and I think at the Investor Day you guys all heard we\u2019re reiterating that at least $25 billion target.","Michael Nannizzi","Great. Thanks for that. And then, you talk a bit about margins on the commercial cycle, that\u2019s another area that\u2019s been a focus I think in the third quarter, the year-over-year improvement slowed. You\u2019ve reiterated your view on margin improvement for 2017 and 2018. Can you sort of help to reconcile third quarter versus the continued confidence and your view that you can generate the margin expansion that you expected at the beginning of the year?","Siddhartha Sankaran","Yes. I think, first of all nothing ever works perfectly in a straight line, as I always say, so I think you had very solid performance in the first quarter, in the second quarter and the third quarter had a couple of items to know. You know most important is programs. And so in programs we did catch up the loss pick in the third quarter and so you need to keep in mind that previously disclosed adjustments of loss pick for programs was rolled into the third quarter.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. I understand.","Siddhartha Sankaran","But you know, I think most importantly, obviously is looking forward and as we look forward we have a clear line aside. I think Rob and the team have done a terrific job in remixing the portfolio of business. And so, when you look at the bar that we shared with you on what is yet to earn into the P&L that is a function of actions that we\u2019ve already taken, so its not dependent on the pricing markets, its changes in the mix of business and there was a chart Rob had that particularly showed in Product Set 2b and 3 which is the poor performing portions of the portfolio, that segment coming down by about two points, I think $6 million, but its roughly I think a third, I remember in that slide from the Investor Day which I -- people to, so that obviously the key driver of the forward looking P&L.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. And I guess, we\u2019re looking ahead, now we sort of talked about these different factors in addition to the non-renewal business clearly the reinsurance program that you undertook early this year that\u2019s had an impact on the top line. How are you looking at when that contract comes up for renewal, what happens to the premiums that you see it, you probably have some view on how that focus performing. How should we thinking about that coming to fruition. Is it we\u2019re going to re-up that reinsurance program or maybe some business comes back to AIG or is there another option out there that you\u2019re thinking about it?","Siddhartha Sankaran","Well, I think the most important thing I think about that and insurance transaction to notice that obviously we\u2019re re-underwriting that entire portfolio. So it\u2019s a quota share of transaction, so the whole portfolio it has not been disruptive to our clients since reinsured, you know when we think of some of the larger transactions which is what I think you\u2019re alluding to. On those quota share of transactions there are obviously reinsured back to third-party provider, third-party re-insurer and we\u2019re continuing to re-underwrite that book, so that book is being subject to the same standards on a camp quality index, rate increases that the rest of portfolio is.","So while we actively remediate it, when we get to a point where we have to make that decision we do think there are plenty of alternatives open to us, obviously potentially you alluded to re-up in that transaction, restructuring the nature of that transaction with one or more insurers, retaining that business back on our books if we see its meeting our cost to capital. So, something we\u2019re I think the team has been very thoughtful about how they approach it and we\u2019re comfortable with how that overall for the forward looking business..","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. And then today obviously we\u2019re stepping outstand of insurances, a lot has happened in the last several weeks views on regulation, taxation which you alluded in your presentation, interest rates. Talk to me about how you are thinking about those changes and how they impact the maintenance of your strategic plan that you outlined at the beginning of this year and if the interest rates were a lot higher six months or a year from now there are things that you might consider doing differently?","Siddhartha Sankaran","Yes. I think it\u2019s a broad question, Mike; I\u2019ll try and break into\u2026","Michael Nannizzi","I could make it broader if you want to.","Siddhartha Sankaran","I\u2019ll try and break it into pieces. I think we can put tax aside, because I think in my prepared remarks covered that, so maybe I\u2019ll focus on interest rates and regulation. We always plan for multiple scenarios and multiple potential outcome, so with respect to rates in the second quarter we highlighted some disclosure and how we think the impact on interest rate obviously is with respect to both new business and with respect to the in-force. So you can break it a little bit between commercial and consumer and then we can speak about 2018 and beyond.","When you look at the in-force business for the consumer business, we announce that we had certain long-tail liabilities that were impacted by falling rates, obviously rising rates are positive for us with respect to that in-force book. So, in the second quarter we said that we thought our estimate of intrinsic value getting changes and interest rates of the market is down about 5% from the beginning of the year. Obviously the change in rates has rallied up, right. That\u2019s positive. When we look at the commercial in-force, obviously the sensitivity and interest rates will relatively well match.","It\u2019s less the question of interest rates and more a question of the underlying drivers of reserve and their financial inflation is probably less than the driver than medical cost inflation or poor temperature as we\u2019ve disclosed. But obviously inflation is something that we watch carefully in line with rates.","On the new business side, clearly for commercial high rates potentially means both higher volumes and high margins in terms of value of new business. And with respect to the commercial business where our long-tail lines are most impacted, higher rates as long as lost cost trends are eclipse by pricing, right and we always have to be careful what people think our rates in growth versus inflation, so again inflation is important as cost inflation.","Again we probably see that as a positive both with respect to volume and potentially with respect to a current value of new business. So, broadly the trend on the rate side we view as a positive. We carefully manage and watch inflation. And still I think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty geopolitically. So we really have a bank one rate scenario. I didn\u2019t get too down on the prior rate environment but people thought it was place two months ago and I\u2019m not overly getting third party over higher, so I think you had to mange it carefully. So that\u2019s how we think about it. We\u2019re very discipline on the ALM side.","Michael Nannizzi","But I guess in looking like life insurance, stocks and reactions to higher interest rates, as you think about the different business whether its P&C life or newly different businesses within those larger segments, does the change in the environment change the way that you\u2019ve thought about either retaining or disposing or divesting of assets?","Siddhartha Sankaran","No, very simply. I think we \u2013 and I\u2019ll explain why? We obviously actively look at the portfolio and evaluating the pieces on an intrinsic value basis, on some of the part basis, but for us our key driver with respect to the life business, the retirement business that you live to are two things; one the foreign tax credits, so these are interlink to some of the issues you\u2019ve highlighted.","On the foreign tax credit side, we continue to utilize how plans in place to utilize that foreign tax credit, that\u2019s a very valuable foreign tax credit. That\u2019s approximately about $5 billion, and that\u2019s the function of keeping the life and property casualty, entities together. And secondly, you continue to see capital diversification benefits. And while I think there may have been scepticism around the capital diversification benefits when we mentioned them about a year ago around this time. I think we\u2019ve seen with how external parties rating agencies look at break up and other scenarios they are real capital implications for main [ph] curves and spin curves and all the likes, so we are focused on those two elements and those two contributors to our intrinsic values to holders.","Michael Nannizzi","Great. Thanks for that. Any questions from the audience. I\u2019ll keep on going here. Again, if you have one, please feel free to raise your hand. When you think about clearly lots of expense cuts, you\u2019ve been very focused on taking the expense ratio down and which is come down and remain flat despite the reduction in premium levels. So you\u2019re thinking about that, how much is that impact did you\u2019re franchise, your abilities to customers or your constituents or broker intermediaries or work with reinsurance companies in terms of just from and infrastructure perspective. Is that put more stress on the remainder or is that some thing you\u2019ve been able to kind of just really trim access the capacity?","Siddhartha Sankaran","Yes. I think it\u2019s a great question Mike. I think you\u2019re first and in our business one of the biggest implications I think any kind of expenses transformation is people, right, people are big contributor to our costs and particularly on the business side, it\u2019s a continuity issue. And so, you know brokers or clients dealt with somebody on our end to that, somebody new facing off against them. What I will tell you just two things, one I think there was probably more noise at the beginning of the year, but I think Rob Schimek and his team got couple of folks in our commercial business sitting out there in the audience have done an absolutely terrific job on working with brokers and clients.","At an attending some of the recent client council, some of the feedback we get is actually the changes, while we had great people and they contributed to our success historically is while there is always noise in the initial change, some of the new people we\u2019re getting feedback from the clients, coming back to us and saying, hey, a new person is better than the person I had before, this person is terrific. And so I think it\u2019s obviously got some disruptive elements because of the human component but I think Rob and the team has done a very, very nice job.","Michael Nannizzi","Great.","Siddhartha Sankaran","We have a question.","Michael Nannizzi","We have a question.","Unidentified Analyst","You had paint the go forward picture of the commercial insurance business is kind of the big drivers of the improved combined being better risk selection. How much of that is actually you think better underwriting practices or just kind of a hardening of rates overall and you think that the market is going to get little better?","Siddhartha Sankaran","Well, I mean, I can tell you in our projections we don\u2019t have a lot of hardening of rates and if you look at our strategy, our strategy hasn\u2019t been growth strategy right, it has been shrunk it deliberately both strong two levels. First, I would say a portfolio level, so you saw the capital allocation slide what parts of the business were actually growing and shrinking. The second is around what we call Camp [ph] Quality Index.","So we rate each of our camps has you might expect A, B, C and D as if they were grades in school. And each of them had a different hurdle to hit rate adequacy when we look at our overall return targets in meeting our cost of equities. And so the primary driver at this point is we\u2019ve obviously had some dramatic shift in business mix as I alluded to.","We think in particularly AQI, which has been a big contributor, we\u2019ll continue to be contributor in the window. So I would say the driver for us is more in the business mix shift and AQI its not really more optimistic view on rates.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. I guess, you touch a little bit on the consumer business and so what\u2019s been happening there. I think at Investor Day Kevin had mentioned that we\u2019re trimming some geographies that one that performing because a lack of scale whereas you continue to have good performance in those scale markets. And then you also sort of touch a little bit on Japan. Just trying to get an idea, once you sort of get rid of some of those sub-scale markets, how much of a tailwind should we expect that to be to your performance and consumer and then post the integration in Japan, just maybe an update on timing there and how should we be thinking about that from just a order of magnitude perspective on profitability?","Siddhartha Sankaran","Yes. I think the most important metric that I think, I will call your attention to on personal insurance business is what we refer to as medium term target at 92% to 94% and the reason that there\u2019s not a firm date on it, just we\u2019ve alluded to Mike is and the dependency on our work on integration in Japan. We haven\u2019t provide any update on timing but I think as Kevin has said once we go through the merger approval process and as we have something that we could disclose we will obviously disclose that and that can give you more certainty on the timing side.","I think that, again when you look at this business you see very sustainable loss ratios, and so, much of the challenge that we have are around implementing the strategies on efficiency as well as on growth. And on the underlies as we\u2019ve highlighted with U.S. PCG you see double-digit growth there and we\u2019re very pleased about that. And as you look at the work that we\u2019ve done on exiting or running off specific companies as we sit here in December we feel good about that as well. So, I think when you look at that business I think setting that medium term combined ratio target out there and looking at the business mix and the premium you can see that this could be a strong contributor with respect to earnings in franchise.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And have you quantify though that just timing aside that sort of how much you\u2019re spending, excess spending is coming into the sort of integration effort in Japan and what that might look like once whenever that is done when its done?","Siddhartha Sankaran","Yes. I think the previous number that I think we\u2019ve disclosed is roughly over 125 to 159, one-time costs \u2013 run rate.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Siddhartha Sankaran","Obviously, there are other offsets against that is we have also announced that we\u2019re taking out certain costs associated at the same time with the integration of what we\u2019re permitted to do from a regulatory standpoint and we are absolutely 110% focused on meeting the regulatory requirements and the needs of the regulators that are in Japan. So obviously when we look at that investment, we\u2019re looking at on economic basis and we\u2019re saying given the alternatives out there that we are exposed to do we think that these -- the one-time costs is accretive. And the answer is we do and we think it has income payback period particularly first merger very quick.","Unidentified Analyst","You mentioned in your presentation punch of targets that management said between capital return, expenses, ROE and then the commercial P&C loss ratio, realize that are important but is there any way you could rank order them as far as importance to management or I guess focus \u2013 key focus areas?","Siddhartha Sankaran","Yes. You know Peter highlighted pyramid that really in the Investor Day there was a slide, which had a pyramid which really at the top was intrinsic value. An intrinsic value is not disclosed, but we think of it very much in the context of the value, you will say the value of the in-force kind of the embedded value of the balance sheet and what drives franchise value, future value of new business kind of profits and margins with respect to our clients, that is really at the top of our pyramid.","Beneath that we had ROE and book value per share growth and we think ROE obviously gives you a good sense on return on capital and our ability to meet our cost of capital and obviously in the long term sustainable book value per share growth is obviously a very strong indicator of intrinsic value growth. Beneath that there are lot of different subsidiary variables and we always have to be make trade-offs between them whether its loss ratio, expense ratio and growth, all those input. So, we really created that pyramid to try and give people a sense of the higher metrics that we\u2019re managing to.","It\u2019s not perfect, but when you look at some of the actions we\u2019ve taken, I look at Ascot as a great one. That\u2019s one where obviously Ascot is - the new owner of Ascot is very vantage owner of Ascot and we looked at that from a sense of maybe damaging to the loss ratio, but we think about our intrinsic value, ROE, book value per share in the long term sustainable way we thought there is a value accretive transaction.","Unidentified Analyst","First the $25 billion total cap return, if you lose the [Indiscernible] designation, where does that 25 go to?","Siddhartha Sankaran","25, I mean, I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent that we first of all, again start with what we think the right thing to do is and look at overall balance sheet strength and what we need to look like to maintain the trust of our clients and regulators and so we said that one of our primary constraints has been the rating agencies that\u2019s where we focus and so we continue to target atleast $25 million of capital return.","Michael Nannizzi","One more here in the corner.","Unidentified Analyst","Can you hear me?","Siddhartha Sankaran","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Is there a way, you meant -- the DTA and what happened to that, the domestic part of it in the case of corporate tax reduction. Is there a way to accelerate the usage of that whether it be through M&A or something strategic if you felt like the tax rate was coming down for sure?","Siddhartha Sankaran","Yes, what I would say is you know as part of our normal business planning and risk management we evaluate a range of \u2013 evaluate a test or range of strategies to ensure that that valuable DTA gets utilized. So we \u2013 I would just say we consider and tax alternatives, it\u2019s not something that you can think of it being on auto pilot.","Unidentified Analyst","Is there some reason why you would not be able to accelerate some of the usage if you thought, like if someone told you 100% for sure tax rate is coming down, 2018 you have one year to do something to use it, before you have to impair some, is there reason why you cannot do that atleast to some extent in the U.S.?","Siddhartha Sankaran","Yes, well just a reminder going back to our presentation earlier in the year, yes our foreign tax credit there is a cap on foreign source income and so there is a maximum amount that you can utilize on giving yield. We do feel we have the right risk management and capital and business planning strategies as we said to utilize about $2 billion to $2.5 billion over the next two years, but you do have that better to limitation on your ability on the foreign tax credit. You know with respect to the NOLs that\u2019s obviously a function of income, taxable income.","And so again, we evaluate everything as we you know again we go through on business planning strategies.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. I think we are about done. Thank you so much Sid.","Siddhartha Sankaran","Thank you.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks for your time. Thanks everybody for the meeting here.","Siddhartha Sankaran","All right. Thanks a lot."],"1769":["American International Group, Inc.

We are about to begin. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome today\u2019s American International Group\u2019s First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead","Liz Werner","Thank you. Before we get started this morning, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain certain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. Actual performance and events may differ possibly materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause this include the factors described in our first quarter 2012 10-Q and 2011 10-K under Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis and under Risk Factors. AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","Today\u2019s presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are included in our financial supplement, which is available on AIG\u2019s website, www.aig.com","Before we go through the results, I want to remind you that we adopted the new DAC standard on a retroactive basis, therefore, all prior period numbers in the 10-Q and financial supplements have been revised.","In addition, we plan on filing a Form 8K to recast our 2011 Form 10-K later today also to reflect these changes.","And now I\u2019d like to turn our call over to our CEO, Bob Benmosche.","Bob Benmosche","Thanks, Liz, and good morning everybody. I want to be brief because I want to leave time for David, Peter and Jay as they go their parts of the report. But the most important message I think that comes out of the first quarter of 2012 is the strong organic growth of this company and the strength of our insurance businesses, and I think you can see with that performance alone that we are well on our way to achieve our aspirational goal. So we are gaining more and more confidence that we can continue to grow, grow effectively and grow profitably.","However, there is a lot of things that happened in this quarter which I think are monumental. First is the fact of our ability to monetize non-core assets. As you saw, we sold another $6 billion of AIA as well as our Blackstone interest. This is important because it allowed us to do a lot of things in the first quarter that gives us financial flexibility as we look to the future.","So for example, we were able to buy $3 billion of our shares when the Treasury made their offer in March. That\u2019s significant in my mind because what one of the debates we have is the overhang, and what affect the overhang has on our company. Conventional wisdom has been, as long as Treasury has a large position; $29 is probably the ceiling for the stock.","We believe that our performance and we keep growing this company the right way, we believe that earnings will actually be what determines the value of this stock, and I think our performance since then has demonstrated that, at least the market has shown that. In addition to that, confidence in our company is growing. When you look at our CDS spreads and where we are today, in fact, in the 190s.","So that\u2019s all part of how the market has reacted to what we did in March but also we were able to pay down the SPV of $8.6 billion. So now we are free to deal with other non-core assets as we go forward. So we still have AIA\u2019s position. We are still looking to find the right time to do an IPO for ILFC and you can see that the Federal Reserve has started to sell down the Maiden Lane III portfolio.","Beyond capital management, which is important, but it\u2019s the core results of this company which is more important. So if you look at Chartis, we see loss ratios improving, we see rate coming in and we see a better mix of our business, but keep in mind that and I \u2013 we sometimes forget it, when it comes to the insurance business, it takes time to see these improvements emerge in our financials.","We had a lower cats, which is good for the quarter, but more importantly as you see our reserves continue to have modest movement where the movement this quarter was about 0.1%. When you consider the size of those reserves, that\u2019s nominal. So we really have had five quarters now of very good performance there. I know some people are still concerned about the reserves and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing everything we can to provide you as much information as we can. So you can see in a transparent way what we have and what we are dealing with.","SunAmerica continues to do well. You see the investment results are stronger as we invested that cash and keep reinvesting cash effectively. But more importantly you see positive cash flows again in their various products. Annuity \u2013 variable annuity sales were up and the good news is, we have very well positioned product, it\u2019s not aggressive in any one feature and we are balanced in the features that we sell and so we feel comfortable we\u2019re going to continue to see good growth and Jay will talk about that.","And of course, as you look at just the delinquency ratios and so on down the line, you see at UGC those are improving as well as our new business is growing and we\u2019re growing with our new performance premium algorithm, which means that we\u2019re putting very good business on the books as we grow that and in fact they had made a profit in the first quarter of this year. So that\u2019s a good business for us.","So overall, all of our businesses are profitable, we\u2019re continuing to grow, we see growth improving over time and our performance will improve over time.","So what I like to do now is turn it over to David who will take you through the numbers.","David Herzog","Thanks, Bob, and good morning everyone. In summarizing the quarter, the key theme that I would like to highlight is our continued execution around the drivers of value creation for our various stakeholders. We continue to execute on the core insurance growth opportunities across the franchise and just a few examples I would cite include Chartis as it continues to successfully grow the consumer business which was 41% and had premiums in the quarter up from 37% a year ago and Chartis continues to drive for rate, particularly in the commercial line.","SunAmerica is benefiting from a more favorable variable annuity market that Bob referenced and they also continue to be very disciplined in spread management. Then United Guaranty continues to grow faster than the industry and pricing targets on their new business in excess of 20% return on their equity.","We continue to execute on capital management, as Bob referred to, including our share repurchase, sales of non-core assets, $2 billion debt offering we repaid SPV which unencumbered, importantly, several billion dollars\u2019 worth of non-core assets that enhanced our financial flexibility.","And lastly, we continue to execute on preparing for Fed readiness and for Fed oversight. Consistent with our comments last quarter, we still estimate that our Tier 1 common equity ratio under the Fed stress test is still close to 8%. We have a very large team of people focused on preparing for Fed oversight including several subject matter experts. We\u2019re preparing as though AIG will be likely be designated SIFI and held to a standard that can differentiate us and provide additional security to our many stakeholders including our policy holders our bond holders and our shareholders.","So now what I\u2019d like to do is just step through the next couple of pages very quickly. If we turn to page 4, you can see that our after-tax operating earnings were $3.1 billion, up almost 48%, or $1.65 per share, which was up 23% from last year $1.34. Average shares outstanding a year ago reflect the recap that we completed in mid-January. Book value per share grew 30% to $57.68 or $53.85 ex-AOCI. Contributing to that was the DTA valuation allowance that we released in the fourth quarter.","We had share repurchases, and again, our continued strong earnings growth. We had earnings in our investment in AIA and MLIII, which I\u2019ll comment on more in a minute, but we also had our spreads narrowed by some 275 basis points in the quarter, which drove a mark-to-market or fair value CVA adjustment on the debt that we mark-to-market of about $580 million.","In the quarter, we also on a GAAP net income basis had a DTA valuation allowance release of about $180 million related to utilization of SunAmerica capital loss carry-forwards that resulted from some capital gains.","Let\u2019s turn to page 5. Chartis operating earnings were over $1 billion and included catastrophe losses of about $80 million versus $1.7 billion in the year ago. SunAmerica\u2019s is $1.3 billion of operating earnings reflected favorable investment spread, and importantly had a very strong spread management effects.","United Guaranty was profitable in the quarter and saw a further decline in delinquency rates, to 11.4%, and also importantly average gross reserves per delinquency is still around $29,000Non-core assets remain a compelling source of value for AIG. ILFC had pre-tax income of about $119 million in the quarter, relatively flat from a year ago. ILFC raised over $2 billion in the quarter, proceeds of which were used to reduce interest costs, eliminate a bank facility that had change of control provisions and to improve their liquidity.","AIA earnings included about a $580 million gain on the sale of the shares that we actually sold and another $1.2 billion in unrealized depreciation. Maiden Lane III had about a $1.3 million increase in fair value as a result of credit spreads.","Our first quarter tax rate, effective tax rate was around 25% and that\u2019s a little lower than usual and also was lower than the 35% statutory rate in part because of the tax exempt interest and the valuation allowance on the DTA on capital gains. Our first quarter operating income effective tax rate was about 30.8%, up from a little over 24% a year ago, in part due to a higher level of income on things like AIA or ML III which attract an operating tax rate of 35% and so that compares to more modest levels of tax exempt interest on our munis.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 6. Our approach to capital management is fairly simple, be ready. We were opportunistic in our sales of AIA and Blackstone in the quarter and we believe that it\u2019s absolutely critical to be ready when market opportunities present themselves. We have a solid foundation to build upon. Our leverage ratios remain strong at 18.7% of debt and hybrids to total capital.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 7; you can see the carrying values of the remaining non-core assets aggregate in excess of $20 billion that enhance our overall financial flexibility. We note that the potential gains would be offset by our NOLs, thus utilizing or realizing the cash benefits of our DTAs.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 8; you can see that the parent company liquidity exceeded $12 billion and that reflected the $3 billion in share buybacks in the quarter. In the first quarter, SunAmerica dividends and note repayments to the parent totaled some $1.6 billion and that contributed to the SPV pay down and Chartis contributed over $1 billion to the parent as well in the quarter.","Ratings remain stable and our year-end RBC ratios exceeded our CMA requirements of 350% for Chartis and 435% for SunAmerica. In the aggregate across Chartis U.S. and the SunAmerica companies, the amount of capital AIG is required to hold in the operating companies to meet the regulatory and rating agency requirements has not changed materially from 2011. And AIG\u2019s expected annual dividends from our operating companies is still in the $4 billion to $5 billion per year.","And in conclusion, again I just want to highlight the theme of continued execution in our results, both capital management, operating improvements and our march towards our aspirational goals of a 10% ROE by 2015, which we remain committed to.","And at this point, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Peter for comments on Chartis.","Peter Hancock","Thanks, David, and good morning everybody. I\u2019ve got some slides on Chartis, but I want to just give you an overall view of the quarter. And so first quarter results reflect meaningful progress towards increasing the intrinsic value of our business and I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019re very much on track with regards to our five-year plan. The current accident year loss ratio improved by several points from the effects of more profitable portfolio mix, stronger pricing, and enhanced risk selection. For the fifth consecutive quarter, reserve development was equal to or less than 0.1% of Chartis\u2019 total reserves, which were $67 billion as of quarter end.","Catastrophe losses were immaterial at about $80 million in the quarter and the expense ratio increased, but that was consistent with our expectations as we grow higher value, less capital intensive businesses, which cost more to acquire and as we make strategic investments in talent and infrastructure. These investments are necessary to strengthen our competitive position and are expected to ultimately yield significant savings in the future.","Turning to slide 9 of the presentation, it details Chartis\u2019 underwriting results and pre-tax operating income for the quarter. Chartis\u2019 accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was a 100.4% reflecting lower underlying loss ratios offset by the increased expenses. Pre-tax operating income benefited from $1.2 billion in net investment income, a 4% increase compared to the prior year and that\u2019s primarily due to higher interest income on fixed income securities driven by redeployment of excess cash and short-term investments into higher yielding securities. This was partially offset by a decrease in partnership income due to equity market performance and a decrease in mutual fund income as a result of a lower level of mutual fund holdings as part of Chartis\u2019 strategic asset allocation strategy.","The accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved by 3.1 points compared to the first quarter 2011 and 2.4 points from full year 2011 results. This result largely reflects meaningful progress in initiatives to shift the portfolio to higher value products and geographies to improve business with marginal returns and to use data and analytics more intelligently in the risk selection process.","During the first quarter, we brought together the global claims and operations and systems functions to create greater efficiency and reduced claims related costs. The global claims initiative and the implementation of our proprietary claims system signify steps we have taken towards improving claims handling. In addition, we are developing a much broader target operating model that will streamline processes and capabilities to deliver further loss ratio improvement and superior customer service in the future.","Consumer insurance represented 41% of total net premiums in the quarter compared to 37% in the first quarter of 2011. 56% of total premiums were generated outside of the U.S. up from 55% in the first quarter 2011. We continue to expand in growth economy nations, which represented 11% of total first quarter 2012 net premiums, up from 10% in the first quarter of 2011. That represents an 8.5% annual growth rate. We maintained our focus on driving improvement in pricing and terms and conditions. Rate changes in the U.S. and Canada increased approximately 5% across Chartis\u2019 diverse book of business.","U.S. property and workers comp experienced the most notable increases at approximately 11% and 7%, respectively. While we are generally experiencing positive rate change across most products and regions, some markets continue to lag. Customer retention remained strong, but in line with expectations, given our business mix shift and improved risk selection initiatives.","Slide 10 summarizes topline results Chartis\u2019 net premiums declined approximately 4.5% over the prior-year period, when adjusted for foreign exchange effects. The continued restructuring of our loss-sensitive business in casualty, which reduces premiums written but improves capital efficiency accounted for 1.6% of that overall decline.","An additional 1.6% of the variance was due to a large multiyear financial line policy written in the first quarter of 2011, which did not recur in the current year. The remainder of the decrease reflected our effort to improve underperforming lines continue adherence to rate discipline and management of catastrophe-exposed business, specifically within commercial. This is consistent with Chartis\u2019 strategy to improve the loss ratio and to shed business that does not meet internal performance standards.","Net prior year adverse reserve development was $66 million driven by loss emergence in casualty and increased activity from multiyear environmental liability policies written in older accident years. This was also favorable development on prior-year natural catastrophes, mainly the Japan earthquake. Expense trends were consistent with our desired mix of business changes, particularly in consumer lines which offer lower, more stable loss ratios, increased acquisition costs from growing the consumer business and the change of mix in the commercial business, as well as investments related to international growth which accounted for two points of the expense ratio increase in the quarter.","Approximately 1.9 points of the increase related to non-recurring items including an increase in bad debt expense and a reduction in the PGAAP benefits for the Fuji acquisition. We continue to make strategic investments in systems, processes and talent which we expect will yield greater savings and a stronger franchise in the years ahead.","We are transforming Chartis\u2019 business to be a more profitable and inherently a more sustainable value portfolio. As a result, the expense ratio will be under pressure in the near term but we expect it will be offset by improvements in the loss ratio and that pressure will abate as we start to see infrastructure investments in 2012 and 2013 yield savings in the following years. These actions will help us achieve a combined ratio in the mid-90s and a double-digit ROE by 2015.","In the first quarter, Chartis continued to execute its capital management initiatives making a $1 billion dividend payment, which exceeded plan, to AIG. Our capital adequacy levels are strong and in line with rating agency expectations. Significantly A.M. Best upgraded Chartis\u2019 outlook to stable from negative in the first quarter, which is in line with the views of S&P and Moody\u2019s. We made very good progress optimizing our reinsurance program in the quarter. We now define our risk appetite from a global perspective rather than locally and we continue to rely on intercompany reinsurance to help maximize capital fundibility.","Chartis\u2019 catastrophe exposure management is enabling us to reduce externally ceded reinsurance generating cost savings. As we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters, Chartis continues to grow its consumer insurance business in key regions as well as the portion derived from the direct marketing channel outside of the U.S.","In the first quarter, we had considerable success in consumer, all lines exhibited growth and direct marketing spend helped generate profitable returns. The Accident & Health business benefited from the implementation of its group benefit strategy from American General. Personal lines results reflect growth in warranty and personal property and importantly Chartis closed on the Service Net acquisition in the quarter, significantly expanding our warranty customer acquisition and service platform.","Chartis continues to measure and refine the risk-adjusted profitability of all its businesses and we are directing capital and resources to optimize profitability where we see opportunities. Our goal is to be the most valued insurance company in the world, the transformation underway in Chartis today and the progress we\u2019re seeing against our strategies gives me great confidence that we are going to succeed.","Now let\u2019s turn it over to Jay","Jay Wintrob","Thanks a lot, Peter, and good morning everybody. Turning first to slide 11, SunAmerica delivered a solid first quarter with $1.3 billion in pre-tax operating income. Strong sales across most product lines, positive net flows and improved base investment spreads.","As David mentioned earlier, SunAmerica distributed $1.6 billion to AIG as a result of the MLII liquidation. In the quarter, we recognized income of $245 million on the MLII investment, essentially flat with the first quarter of 2011. Going forward, SunAmerica\u2019s results will no longer include gains or losses from MLII. We saw strong sales growth in all of our product lines with the exception of fixed annuities, and as expected our fixed annuity sales declined during the quarter due to the low interest rate environment and we expect full year fixed annuity sales to remain below last year\u2019s levels.","Variable annuity sales were a highlight in the quarter and were up 38% as sales exceeded $1 billion in the quarter, a first since the financial crisis. The sales increase was driven by expanded distribution, increased wholesaler productivity, and our competitive de-risked product offerings. Last year, we were the first in the industry to index our living benefit fees to market volatility as measured by the VIX index, reducing our exposure to changes in volatility.","And during the first quarter of this year, we launched a new product offering with the Volatility Control Fund that further reduces the risk related to market volatility while offering a competitive benefit. The impact of strong equity markets in the first quarter decreased DAC amortization and guaranteed benefits expense by $52 million versus the first quarter of last year. Our variable annuity business is a relatively small piece of our balanced book of business.","Separate account reserves were $50.7 billion at March 31 out of total reserves in mutual funds of $230 billion of which $20 billon of reserves or less than 9% include living benefit guarantees. So we have the capacity, distribution capability, risk controls, and financial discipline to capitalize on the growing demand in this market as some of our competitors are pulling back.","Sales of group retirement products increased 8% driven by individual rollover deposits in the quarter. We expect rollover deposits to slow in the near term due to the impact of low interest rates. Retail life sales increased 7% in the quarter principally due to growth in term life sales through independent distribution and our affiliated direct-to-consumer platform Matrix Direct.","Mutual fund sales continue to accelerate as a favorable equity market and strong product performance drove new deposits. And as Bob mentioned, despite a $1.5 billion year-over-year decline in fixed annuity sales, our total net flows were positive for the fifth consecutive quarter, which highlights the advantages of our diversified product portfolio.","On April 12th, we announced a reorganized structure designed to better serve the needs of our clients and promote accelerated profitable sales growth. Key aspects of the new structure are distinct product divisions, shared annuity and life operations platforms and a unified all-channel distribution organization with access to all SunAmerica products. We believe this organizational structure will allow us to better leverage our competitive strengths, our diverse product manufacturing capabilities, our broad and strong distribution relationships and our experienced and talented leadership team.","On slide 12, we showed the general improvement in base investment yields and base net investment spreads over the past four quarters for Western National, our leading fixed annuity writer and VALIC, our group retirement company. Base investment yield represents our investment yield excluding the impact of alternative investment income, call and prepayment fee income and ML II fair value income.","Base yields in the first quarter were up significantly over the prior year quarter due to the redeployment of cash during 2011. Base yields were also up sequentially, as this quarter we invested approximately $7.4 billion at a yield of 5.3% across all SunAmerica including a 15% allocation to non-agency residential mortgage backed securities.","We continue to be opportunistic with our investments in structured securities in order to improve yields, increase net investment income and help offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment. These net investment spreads were helped by the improvement in base yields and our ongoing active management of new and renewal crediting rates.","And with respect to renewal rates at VALIC, we reset rates on a $16 billion block of business at the beginning of this year, which contributed to the sequential increase in base spreads of 24 basis point. Approximately 51% of SunAmerica\u2019s annuity and universal life account values are now at minimum guarantees, up from 45% at the end of the fourth quarter. Nearly 70% of total annuity and universal life account values have minimum-guaranteed crediting rates of 3% or lower.","Last quarter we provided information on the potential impact of a continued low interest rate environment on our operating earnings. We indicated then that we would expect a negative pre-tax earnings impact of less than $10 million this year and $65 million to $80 million next year. Given our current new money rates, our disciplined approach to pricing and active managing of crediting rates, our view on the potential impact remains unchanged.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to David to wrap us up.","David Herzog","Thank you, Jay. And before I go over to Liz on \u2013 to kick off Q&A, I just would remind everybody on page 13 of highlights of United Guaranty, the highlights of which I covered in my opening remarks. So, Liz, back to you.","Liz Werner","Operator, can we open the lines for Q&A at this time?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Andy Dinnhaupt from Franklin Mutual.","Andy Dinnhaupt \u2013 Franklin Mutual","I had two questions on ML III, the first is on page 15 where you break out the composition. Could you just tell us where the MAX CDO that was recently sold, which category that fell into? And then secondly in your 10-Q you disclosed that the ML III assets were pledged against the direct investment book. Does that hinder your ability to execute further sales in the ML III assets? Thanks.","Bob Benmosche","Yeah, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Bill Dooley, but first of all ML III is being sold by the Federal reserve and they go through the positions as they see fit and it\u2019s up to the Federal Reserve to decide how they want to liquidate it. MAX was the biggest one in the portfolio and the most complex from our point of view, so it was \u2013 in our view it was a very successful sale and as we think about those sales we could also be a buyer. So for the insurance companies, if we saw some value in the sale of MAX and in fact we bought $600 million of the positions in the insurance companies as part of our investment portfolio.","So we don\u2019t see anything that here at AIG that would represent a constraint on the Federal Reserve to sell ML III assets and to the extent we can get the price we think makes sense, we would be a buyer, but Bill do you want to talk about the pledge and the fact that as this occurs, and how that flows through in terms of cash?","Bill Dooley","Sure, first of all Maiden Lane III is unencumbered assets at the parent company and once it\u2019s monetized, a substantial portion can go into the financial flexibility of the firm. So that means liquidity management, leverage management and the ongoing capital management that we\u2019re doing. So as Bob just said, the flexibility is tremendous because of our opportunities to if we like the asset, if we like the price and we do know something about these assets, as everyone knows, that they were also eligible for the insurance companies to be bought at the same time.","Bob Benmosche","And I think that the bottom line here is that we had talked to everybody a year ago on the re-IPO that we were looking at 2014 second half as the beginning of receiving cash out of the ML III and we talked to ML II our cash wouldn\u2019t come until 2015 possibly. So we have already seen all that come in and what this basically says is we won\u2019t have to wait till 2014 second half to begin to deal with the liquidity opportunities this would create for us. So again that plus the paying down of the SPV a year early gives us enormous flexibility we did not think we would have until the middle to the end of next year at the earliest, so we\u2019re already there.","Liz Werner","Operator, can we go to our next question?","Operator","Yes. We will take one from Andrew Kligerman from UBS.","Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS","Good morning. Could you, having said earlier in the call that you\u2019re preparing AIG that it\u2019s likely to be a non-bank SIFI, can you address the degree of capital management that you\u2019d like to do given that over the next year. And then secondly with regard to variable annuities, you did a strong $1 billion plus in VA deposits. The big guys in that business are doing $3 billion to $5 billion plus, what\u2019s your appetite there? Do you want to get into that top three and do $3 billion to $5 billion per quarter?","Bob Benmosche","I\u2019m going to let Jay talk about his appetite because I think he needs to talk about the product design. I think the question by itself, Andrew, would not make much sense unless we talk to how we price and the ROEs and the risk management that\u2019s around our products. So I\u2019ll let Jay do that.","Why don\u2019t you do that first, Jay, so we get that one first, and then we\u2019ll talk about capital management segment?","Jay Wintrob","Sure. Thanks, Bob. Yeah, I think the most important thing, Andrew, is that we have spent a lot of time over the past couple of years reducing the risk in our variable annuity product. First, as I mentioned, with time the variable annuity rider fees to changes in the VIX to reduced exposure to volatility, requiring a portion of the assets to be invested in bonds or in the fixed account or on the equity side being invested in certain asset allocation models, and then just this year our latest component which was the volatility control fund being a part of the product in order to obtain the living benefit feature. We continue to feel good about how the product is structured and the pricing returns we\u2019re getting.","At the same time, I think if you look at our benefit rollup rates and our withdrawal rates and our age at which you can take withdrawals, they are not overly aggressive in any respect, and our fees remain certainly at the high end for the industry. Having said all of that, as we have been reinstated in certain distribution channels, we\u2019ve built up or internal and external wholesaling force and improved the productivity of our wholesalers. You have seen sales increase and we continue to have an appetite to do that assuming we can do it with products that have terms and conditions and costs that we\u2019re comfortable with.","We\u2019ve also invested a lot and continue to invest in our risk management, in our hedging program and our more general risk management. So, I would say that our internal goal is to continue to build up our distribution, consistent with our sales opportunities. If that moves us up in sales, so be it. We don\u2019t tend to target any ranking level. But depending on external circumstances, including how aggressive some of our competitors are, we may continue to move up in those rankings and I do continue to see our variable annuity movement in terms of sales and flows to be strong, so I hope that\u2019s helpful in response to your question.","Bob Benmosche","And the other piece I would add to it is that if you look at our year-over-year flows, we are concerned about fixed annuities at these low interest rate levels. We don\u2019t want to build a large book at low interest rates and then be concerned about disintermediation, if and when we see an uptick in rates and especially if there is a rapid uptick in rate. So, that you\u2019ll see a decline in sales and that\u2019s one we are being very strong in terms of maintaining balance on getting our return and being careful what we put on our book. So, it\u2019s really about the fixed annuity more so than the variable annuity that we\u2019d be most concerned by.","Coming back to SIFI and capital, the key to being regulated by the Fed and the impact of capital management is you\u2019d better have a very good well-documented process. So you have to know what you\u2019re doing, how you\u2019re doing it, show and demonstrate that you do it; and we believe we have got a team that\u2019s excellent, we\u2019re working through that and we\u2019re pretty confident that if and when the Fed arrives that we will have the process in place that will allow them to judge whether we have any constraints on our ability to continue capital management. So, we won\u2019t know till they get here. We won\u2019t know till we run their systems and they verify what we\u2019ve done but we feel pretty comfortable that were in pretty good shape, and then we don\u2019t see any significant impact to our ability other than to comply with their rules and regulations and time frames.","Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS","So Bob, looking at the assets you\u2019ve outlined, $6 billion plus worth of ML III something on ILFC, $8 billion worth of AIA, you don\u2019t see that as constrained at all over the next 12 months?","Bob Benmosche","What I\u2019m saying is that if the Fed arrives, and when they determine they are our regulator, then they will decide. We don\u2019t see the constraint but we have to go through their stress test process and their review and their audits to make sure that we are okay. And I think that the constraint might be more time in our view but could be wrong but we\u2019re thinking it\u2019s more about when we could do things, not if we could do things, especially when they go through the company for the very first time.","Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS","Right. So in the meantime you\u2019re moving forward with capital management?","Bob Benmosche","In the meantime, we see no constraint right now to our capital management. We\u2019re going to continue to look at our capital, look at our non-core assets, the selling of ILFC is not only about capital management, it\u2019s about recognizing it\u2019s a non-core business. It has a huge debt load and it\u2019s a business that doesn\u2019t fit in the insurance business and so we feel that that\u2019s a business we would not be in. And to the extent it provides us a lot more capital, that\u2019s great, because it helps us with capital management but it\u2019s also about de-risking the company and that\u2019s another aspect of it. So it\u2019s in combination, we\u2019re doing things that make the most sense for this company, it\u2019s credit ratings and our future.","Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Walsh from Citi.","Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi","Good morning. Thanks. First question for Peter, just thinking about with respect to Chartis, can you just talk about how you think about allocation of capital to each line of business? How that\u2019s communicated down to the troops, the underwriters and then how that\u2019s reflected in their compensation? Thanks.","Peter Hancock","Well, the first thing is that we think about capital through an economic lens first, but recognize that life in an insurance company with multiple constraints is a little bit more complex than that. So we look at multiple binding constraints whether they be rating agency view of capital or regulatory view of capital. But we start with our true north, which is an economic view of risk which drives the amount of capital needed to support that risk.","Secondly, consistent with our reorganization, we think about it globally. So the commercial lines run by John Doyle, has under him individuals responsible for the global allocation of capital. So George Stratts, for instance running Global Property, thinks about optimal capital allocation to where he is getting fairly compensated for the exposure we\u2019re taking. We measure performance using risk-adjusted profitability, which is ROE minus a cost of capital, times the amount of capital deployed. That metric is still in its early stages of implementation, but we have it calculated at a fairly granular level, and it\u2019s increasingly being used as a measure of people\u2019s success.","In terms of incentives, we think that the right way to incentivize people in this business is over the medium to long term. So any single period risk-adjusted profit number needs to be put in a broader context. We are in particular looking at changes and improvement as opposed to the absolute number, but we feel that there has been much more rapid uptake of this framework for thinking about how to properly balance growth, profitability and risk towards growing value than I could ever have hoped. So I\u2019m very pleased with the progress.","Bob Benmosche","Let me just make one other comment on the compensation part, and it\u2019s something that if you looked at the compensation of program here at AIG, the variable portion of the compensation for the underwriters that you are talking about is actually unfortunately too small. It\u2019s mostly a fixed income. You have very little variable comp. And we need to, as we become much more performance based, we are actually trying to increase that a little bit as we go forward. So we don\u2019t see that as a big incentive one way or the other. It\u2019s really about the quality of the way you do your job, so you don\u2019t have the kind of leverage that you are used to seeing in your own businesses.","Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi","And then just second question for John Doyle if he is there? Retention rate trends in the commercial lines, specifically the U.S. commercial business, if you could just talk to that a little bit? Thanks.","John Doyle","Sure Keith. Retention is in line with the expectations for it. After the first quarter as you know, we\u2019ve been shedding certain segments of underperforming business, so very low retentions in segments of our commercial casualty business. I would say client retention remains very high, but we\u2019ve been continuing to reduce our cat exposures and increasing price in property cat pretty aggressively over the course of several quarters now. So we are retaining more of this customers but reducing exposure there.","Outside of that retention remains within historical norms. As Peter mentioned earlier, we continue to see good rate improvement and good momentum on the pricing side. Property rates in the U.S. are up double digits. They are up more than that in parts of South East Asia. Casualty rate is up in single digits in the United States \u2013 some product areas and some geographies lagging a bit, probably most notably Continental Europe and Latin America, but really even in those geographies we\u2019ve seen an improvement over where we were in the fourth quarter.","You may have noted, we did take down the top line in Europe in the first quarter. It\u2019s a big renewal cycle for Continental Europe and that was some corrective underwriting action we took in the primary casualty. So, momentum is good. Retention is where we want it to be, given the pricing environment, and we took some aggressive action to improve the portfolio. So it was roughly a 3.7 point improvement in the accident year loss ratio in the first quarter.","Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Just picking upon Keith\u2019s question a little bit, I see the \u2013 I guess for John and Peter, the mix shift and the impact it had on the expense ratio. But as you move along this path, given the expense investments you\u2019re making and the mix shift towards higher expenses, lower loss business, when should Chartis begin to see underlying accident year profitability?","I guess along those lines, Peter, you mentioned the aspirational goals were here at 100-ish. Where do we have to be at year end for you to feel confident that we are on track to get to the aspirational goals by 2015? And one follow-up if I can. Thank you.","Peter Hancock","Well, I think that there are some one-off items that make the recent short-term trend in the expense ratio inconsistent with what my longer-term trend expectation would be. So I would expect the expense ratio towards the end of the year to be between 32% and 33%. But to be honest, we are absolutely focused not on targeting a specific expense ratio. We\u2019re really looking at the ROE and making the right trade-off between stable loss ratio improvement and whatever it takes to spend to get that in terms of infrastructure, distribution to get the best mix of sustainable business.","So, the infrastructure investments that are sort of heavy in nature are going to sort of peak in mid-2013. We have talked about that consistently over the last year, and the benefits from those will be long-term cost advantages and scalability of platforms through better shared services and so on. But importantly, I look at the large amount of expense that\u2019s in claims that\u2019s classified within the loss ratio and I really want to be agnostic about whether a cost is classified as loss ratio or expense ratio. I\u2019m not trying to \u2013 given the huge variety of businesses that we have, benchmarking our expense ratio against others is very hard to do, and so the bottom line on a risk-adjusted basis is a much better way to judge whether we\u2019re making progress and we feel very good about our ability to deliver the target ROE by 2015.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, thanks. And then Bob, if I could follow on the asset \u2013 non-core asset question, so if you were to sell \u2013 if AIG were to sell some part of the non-core assets that you showed on elide 7, is your kind of baseline expectation that you would be able to deploy all of that capital that you generate from those sales?","Bob Benmosche","I think we are going to take a look at what that is when we do it and what\u2019s available and what makes the most sense for our shareholders and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. I can\u2019t give you any more color than that. I think if you look at what we\u2019ve done so far that we\u2019ve got a pretty good track record of putting the money where it makes the most sense.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey, thank you. Two questions. One, can we talk a little bit about the moving pieces in the direct investment book, so we can think about how we should model that going forward? And second, with regard to ILFC, were there planes taken off-line this quarter and it appears to be there were no charges associated. Can you talk about the value of the fleet and how you\u2019re feeling about that?","Bob Benmosche","David, why don\u2019t you take the first question and then...","David Herzog","Yeah, Josh, could you maybe clarify what you\u2019re interested in, in the direct investment book. What piece of it?","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","The \u2013 obviously there was the credit related losses this quarter. Is that related to rising interest rates? How should we think about that model going forward?","David Herzog","Yes, it\u2019s a fair point, that\u2019s a good question. That was the CVA and when our credit spread. So again, directionally if you look at what\u2019s happening with our credit spreads, we had \u2013 our credit spreads came in 275 this quarter and we had a $580 million hit in that book. Now again, so what that means is our credit spreads came in much more than the credit spreads of the assets that we\u2019ve invested in. So the whole book is or that piece of the book is marked to market. So we had a disproportionate improvement in ours, which is good news, I mean it\u2019s terrific, that our credit spreads are tightening. So that\u2019s the biggest driver of it.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","On an operating basis, though, without the Blackstone gain, it would have been a much bigger hit to operating income. Is this an exceptional quarter, do you think, in terms of magnitude?","David Herzog","You mean in terms of the CVA, I think you can \u2013 I would think it\u2019s \u2013 there is going to be volatility in that number, in that mark. So I think that\u2019s the way you have to look at it and map it back.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then ILFC fleet values and what happened this quarter? I think it may relate to (inaudible).","Bob Benmosche","Yeah, let me just answer it just briefly that the planes have been repossessed and actually re-leased and all the accounting, everything else, pretty much is done in this quarter, so I think you will see some drag in the remaining three quarters, as we go through this but the teams did an outstanding job of getting those planes back.","Some of them were not re-leased, but they were actually put in part out. As you know, we\u2019ve bought the part-out company which gives us an option where if we don\u2019t think we can get a good price for planes, we don\u2019t have to be struck with them on the ground. We have a chance to get good value out of just taking them apart and selling them through that Aero Turbine organization so I think overall a quick reaction and all the numbers were in the first quarter that you can see other than a drag a little bit in terms of income going forward.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And no negative cost from the parting out?","David Herzog","That\u2019s correct. Josh this is David, just to \u2013 I want to add on to what Bob said with respect to Mal\u00e9v, there was no impairment in the quarter or last quarter with respect to Mal\u00e9v. Those planes \u2013 we had those planes valued accordingly in anticipation of that, so we did have some impairment charges this quarter, but it did not relate to Mal\u00e9v.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Perfect, thank you very much","David Herzog","My pleasure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the call, and I think you so much you are expanding your disclosures. I\u2019m sure you folks have been drafting for weeks and I, at least \u2013 I certainly appreciate it. The one \u2013 there are two questions. One if I can with for David and then another for Peter, the question for David if you go back to slide 7, it would be \u2013 which is asset values and sort of how we should think about potential future divestures not from a timing, but from valuation perspective.","Thinking about the taxes, can you give us some guidance as to either the tax basis we should be using when we model this out ourselves or simplistically just say, if the transactions were done at current carry values, what the actual \u2013 what, not the cash proceeds would be, because you told us they would be offset by NOLs, but the actual book value impact would be? Because presumably, I don\u2019t know that we can actually calculate what the DTA usage would be given that we don\u2019t know the tax basis.","David Herzog","Yeah, fair point. On ILFC we covered this last quarter but it\u2019s helpful reminder that the simple example that we used last quarter is if we sold it at book value, book value is book value and we lay that out basically $7.5 billion. Example is, we said its \u2013 and it has a very low tax basis. So effectively, the book tax expense that will be recorded is essentially the proceeds times the tax rate. That\u2019s the book tax and it will be offset with NOLs. So effectively you\u2019re accelerating the utilization of those NOLs. So there is no cash out the door for that tax expense.","And then the book basis, as you can see AIA and ML III are both fair value options. So they are on the books for what they are on the books for. So AIA is carried at this point, at the end of quarter, it was $8.2 billion and the tax expense would be \u2013 the tax expense and then it\u2019s again, utilization of our DTAs. So you have \u2013 we will have a book tax expense when we sell these, but we will not have a cash tax expense when we sell these. Is that helpful?","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","That\u2019s helpful color. I\u2019m just, is the AIA tax basis and the Maiden Lane III tax basis, are these values approaching the fair value, which is, I think what I heard you just say?","David Herzog","Yeah. We\u2019ve \u2013 that we\u2019ve already on AIA, we\u2019ve already taken the book tax expense. So I think it\u2019s the way to think about if the tax basis is less than that because of the timing of when we were filing tax returns etcetera, but it\u2019s again, I think from a utilization standpoint the way to model it is just to think about the fair value. That\u2019s the easiest way to think about it.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","That\u2019s helpful. And in ML III, maybe you are probably still in a loss position?","David Herzog","I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the case.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay, that\u2019s -?","David Herzog","For modeling purposes I would use the book value.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just if I could follow up on Andy\u2019s good question about the changes to ML III and its involvement with the direct investment book. Should we look at that as you guys have actually already having an unencumbered other assets which were at the holding company at year-end which were effectively pledged to the direct investment book and so in some fashion you have already sort of started to get liquidity from the ML III by pledging it against other \u2013 against those obligations?","Jay Wintrob","Yeah, I think the way to look at it is that, when we extinguish the remaining SPV preferred, we\u2019ll use the DIB, as a vehicle to do that. So for effectively $1.5 billion we were able to add about $3.5 million of asset value and that\u2019s excluding the net escrow to the DIB. So the asset is unencumbered, it\u2019s not in a regulated insurance company or anything like that and as it is monetized, depending on what the needs of the DIB or the parent are, we will determine how much excess value there is. It\u2019s our expectation that there will be a substantial portion of Maiden Lane III that would be available for a variety of corporate purposes including maximizing our financial flexibility.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","That\u2019s great, very helpful. And then if I could just overstay my welcome and ask, Peter, very much appreciate sort of the strategic color on the long-term growth strategy and mix management, loss ratio objectives and expenses. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us some of sort of color for the underwriting tranches of the kind of stuff you guys are actually doing today to take away sort of historically underperforming business to get where you need it just so we can sort go to the level of sort of understanding what you\u2019re really asking and expecting of your underwriters and sort of where we are in the execution of this story?","Peter Hancock","Well, I think that the first thing is that we are giving clear direction to our underwriters as to how to make the tradeoff between value and volume, and to do so with a view to optimizing customer relationships that we\u2019ve had for decades. And that means going to our customers early and really helping them with us to use our capital in a way that is most valued by them, so in the lines where we have the most distinctive capabilities.","And I think one good anecdote that happened in the first quarter was a longstanding manufacturing customer of ours in the U.S. that was up for a large property renewal where we the lead, and they expected contingent business interruptions to be included in the language as it always had been. But with the events in Thailand and in Japan highlighting the very real risk to the supply chain, we were unwilling to do the renewal without much greater detail on that supply chain risk.","So, we wanted to have it excluded. It was a real tipping-point moment where the customer eventually backed down. We had the exclusion. But importantly, we agreed to work together with them over the next year to really understand the risk to their supply chain so that we could include it next year but also charge for it and help them figure out what the right retention would be on that risk.","So, I think that our underwriters feel they have the empowerment from management to say no when that\u2019s the right thing to do, and to use the most sophisticated analytical tools to really help the customer manage their risk in the most sustainable way possible. So, I am seeing lots of nice examples where I think people are very aligned to make the right trade-offs.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. Just \u2013 I just wanted to ask a quick follow up on the ML III question. I guess based on the way it\u2019s worded in the Q saying it\u2019s allocated to the MIP, book, my question is really; is it the full $7 billion or so \u2013 and is that backing MIP debt right now, or it\u2019s just somehow an equity cushion within the MIP book? Like I just want to understand how we should think about that.","And then I guess my follow-up is, as the stake gets monetized over the next year, can you just give us some general sense for how much you think could be used for capital management, if it did occur this year in a more immediate way versus that which would have to remain for liquidity purposes within the MIP book?","David Herzog","Sure. First, there are no specific assets in the DIB or MIP that are specifically pledged against debt. There is a pool of assets and those assets will generate cash flows that we believe will be more than adequate to meet the needs of the DIB. When ML III is monetized, we will then determine using a number of sort of tests that we look at, what the appropriate level of capital and liquidity for the DIB is.","To the extent there is excess capital in the DIB, we should be able to use that freely at parent based on whatever opportunities we feel will maximize shareholder value. It is our expectation based on our numbers now that a portion of the Maiden Lane III assets will remain in the DIB but that there should be a substantial portion of excess value that we will be able to have discretion over how we use.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","That\u2019s very clear. Thank you and then just last follow up. I guess for David, the $8.2 billion of cash in short term at the holding company now and in addition, you have low financial leverage, can you talk about on a more near-term basis what your position is for ability to manage capital? Should we think about some portion of the $8 billion of cash in short term as available and potential leverage or can you give a little color around that?","Bob Benmosche","Yeah look, we are constantly looking at what we have and making sure that the biggest constraint we have amongst ourselves is to do what makes the most sense to continue to show strength in our credit ratings and how we use the money here and we will continue to look and examine what we have and we will do what is most prudent at that time. So I don\u2019t know it until I know it, until everybody around this table says that that makes sense to do. So that\u2019s about all I can tell you.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks, Bob.","Liz Werner","Thank you operator. I think we are going to wrap it up for now. I appreciate everyone dialing in and certainly if you have any follow-up questions at all, don\u2019t hesitate to give us a call.","Bob Benmosche","Thank you all.","Operator","Once again ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference.

We continue to execute on our reinsurance strategy, one of our key initiatives, which I will cover in a more detail and which Peter will also review in his remarks. Other actions we\u2019re taking to improve our underwriting capabilities and profitability are taking hold, and we started to see some of the resulting benefits in our third quarter results.","We continue to expect to deliver an underwriting profit including AAL for General Insurance as we exit 2018. Over the course of the last year, Peter and his team have made significant progress in executing on our reinsurance strategy. And this work will continue as we approach the January 1 renewal season. So far this year, we\u2019ve lowered our North American CAT cover attachment point from a per occurrence of $1.5 billion to an aggregate of $750 million and added an additional international cover.","As you will hear from Peter in his remarks, AIG\u2019s national market share in Japan is 6%, and in the area most impacted, it\u2019s 10% on the average. While our Japan reinsurance program was renewed in January 2018 maintaining its historical structure which included two separate towers for the commercial and personal insurance business, we have been working diligently throughout this year to get a single structure in place for 2019 to reduce our net exposure on both a frequency and severity basis. We are pleased with the contributions and balance that Validus brings to our business mix. The disciplined underwriting and risk approach that Validus takes was most evident this quarter in the estimated net CAT loss of approximately $200 million, which was in line with peers. Validus was neutral to our accident year results quarter this quarter and remains on track to contribute approximately 1 point to a combined ratio improvement as we exit 2018.","Our recent announcement of the pending acquisition of Glatfelter will provide further balance to General Insurance by improving our position in the programs market with the addition of one of the most respected firms in this space to our portfolio of businesses. The closing of this transaction is expected to occur next week.","Turning to reserves, we welcome Mark Lyons, to the team this summer, and he has hit the ground running in reviewing our actuarial processes and procedures. Net reserve additions of $170 million in the third quarter reflect the work Mark and his team performed relating to approximately 75% of our book. Year-to-date, net reserves development was flat.","Peter will provide an additional detail on General Insurance in his prepared remarks. And Mark is joining the call and will give you more color on the work he has done on General Insurance reserves.","L&R delivered another solid quarter, notwithstanding challenging year-over-year comparisons that reflect the impact of annual assumption reviews. Underlying ROE continued in double digits, and in particular our investments in businesses over the last few years are beginning to bear fruit with strong growth in Individual Retirement and life in particular. Sid will discuss the results of the third quarter actuarial review and Kevin will elaborate on the performance of this well-positioned business, which serves some of the most -- the world\u2019s most important needs, the need for sources of savings, lifetime income, and protection. Our steps to reduce exposures on our Legacy book and to allocate capital more efficiently underscore our capital management discipline and focus on long-term shareholder value. The sale of 19.9% of Fortitude Re, formerly known as DSA Re, to the Carlyle Group is imminent and will free up capital as well as provide a platform for potential growth.","Lastly, we have purchased shares and warrants totaling $1 billion through the third quarter of this year, including $350 million in the third quarter. We have $1.3 billion remaining in our authorization. Share repurchase remains a capital management tool that we will continue to deploy in addition to other uses of capital that will contribute to our goal of making AIG better than it has ever been.","In conclusion, we are making progress towards positioning AIG for the long term. We continue to work deliberately and thoughtfully and with a sense of urgency to improve our core underwriting capabilities, reduce volatility, deliver an underwriting profit, including AAL for General Insurance as we exit 2018 and physician each of our businesses for long-term success.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sid, who\u2019ll provide more detail on our third quarter financial results.","Sid Sankaran","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone.","This morning, I\u2019ll comment on our third quarter financial results, our capital and liquidity position, and provide an update on Fortitude Re and Validus.","Turning to slide four. We reported an adjusted after tax loss of $0.34 per share. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $66.83; and adjusted book value per share, which excludes AOCI and DTA, was $55.58 at quarter-end. Note that approximately $500 million of the reduction in book value is associated with an increase in the deferred gain on our adverse development cover, which will amortize back into earnings and book value over time. Overall, net investment income from our insurance operations including the Legacy insurance portfolios was $3.4 billion in the quarter or $9.9 billion year-to-date, which is in line with the $13 billion full-year guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year.","We continue to make progress on our restructuring initiatives in the third quarter, most notably in General Insurance were general operating expenses declined 5% from the second quarter on an ex-Validus comparable basis. We continue to expect to achieve the full $450 million of annual run rate expense savings, I referenced last quarter, as we enter 2019.","General Insurance, Life and Retirement, and Legacy results were all impacted by various noteworthy items listed on page five.","We report $1.6 billion of pre-tax catastrophe losses driven by multiple events, most significantly, Typhoons Jebi & Trami in Japan. We remain comfortable with our initial pre-tax losses in its for Hurricane Michael, which are between $300 million and $500 million. And this estimate will be included in our fourth quarter 2018 operating results. Given these events place us close to attaching North American catastrophe aggregate program and that our third quarter severe losses attach on our aggregate XOL sever loss cover, this reduces the risk of volatility in the fourth quarter.","Peter will speak further about our catastrophe losses and reinsurance program in his remarks. Note that Legacy incurred approximately $57 million of CAT losses associated with runoff property policies in Japan. As a result, Legacy\u2019s ROE was below or long-term 3% to 5% expectations.","Life and Retirement had a solid quarter with an adjusted ROE of 11.2% inclusive of a $98 million charge associated with the annual assumptions review. This was largely driven by adjustments in Individual Retirement due to refinements in variable annuity withdrawal assumptions, additional reserves related to older universal life policies and refinements to interest crediting to the Life Insurance segment. Note, these adjustments did not impact our assessment of profitability on new business written going forward or profitability of the core portfolio.","We completed our third quarter detailed valuation reviews, and year-to-date net prior year reserve development was roughly flat while the quarter was adverse by $170 million in adjusted pre-tax operating income. Mark Lyons will comment further with additional insight into this quarter\u2019s reserve review and actions taken.","Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was roughly 28%, which reflects the beneficial impact of tax discrete items this quarter on the pre-tax loss. We expect our full-year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate to increase slightly to approximately 25%. This increase is primarily related to the impact of the third quarter catastrophic events on our full-year net income projections, combined with our current assumptions around the impact of the U.S. Tax Reform on our operations.","Our balance sheet and free cash flow remain strong. As shown on slide six, parent liquidity at quarter-end was $4.5 billion. We continue to view the target level of liquidity at the holding company to be between $3 billion and $4 billion. Cash proceeds in the quarter included $1.6 billion of dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and tax sharing payments of approximately $200 million. Our base case for annual dividends and tax payments from our insurance subs remains approximately $6 billion, although we see potential upside for non-recurring flows.","Our capital ratios for our Life and Retirement and Legacy companies are above target levels and our GI companies are comfortably at target levels even after the third quarter catastrophes.","Our strong balance sheet should continue to provide us ongoing financial flexibility. During the quarter, we deployed approximately $350 million towards the purchase of common shares at an average price of $53.05, leaving our remaining authorization at approximately $1.3 billion.","Slide seven depicts our capital structure and ratings. We redeemed the Validus preferred shares totaling approximately $400 million in October. While our financial leverage ratio increased this quarter to 29.2%, reflecting the inclusion of Validus\u2019 debt and the net loss for the period, we are deeming Validus junior subordinated debt in the fourth quarter through excess capital in the legal entity which will reduce the financial leverage ratio by 0.6 points.","We expect to complete the sale of 19.9% of Fortitude Re to the Carlyle Group in the fourth quarter at which time, we will begin to report this minority share in non-controlling interests on the income statement, which will reduce Legacy\u2019s contribution to AIG\u2019s earnings per share.","Finally, with respect to Validus, we completed the purchase accounting during the quarter. Of the $3 billion of cash consideration paid in excess of tangible net assets, $2 billion was attributed to goodwill and related intangibles; $440 million was attributed to the value of the distribution network acquired or VODA; $298 million was attributed to the value of business acquired or VOBA with $268 million of other indefinite lived intangibles.","The VOBA, which was established, approximated the amount of Validus\u2019 deferred policy acquisition costs that were written off in purchase accounting. VOBA is being amortized consistent with the existing DAC one-off pattern of approximately two years and is included in adjusted pre-tax operating income and the underwriting ratios of the General Insurance segment.","VODA will be amortized over 15 years or roughly $30 million per year and will be reported in our other operations segment as part of adjusted pre-tax operating income.","To sum up, we continue to make progress towards delivering long-term profitability, reducing volatility and maintaining a strong balance sheet and free cash flow profile.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Peter.","Peter Zaffino","Thank you, Sid, and good morning.","Today, I will provide an update on General Insurance\u2019s progress against our key 2018 priorities to improve underwriting performance and position the business for long-term success; the recently announced Glatfelter transaction, third quarter financial results and our observations of current market conditions.","During the quarter, we continued to execute on our initiatives to strengthen General Insurance\u2019s core performance and achieve underwriting profitability. I am pleased with the progress we\u2019re making to implement fundamental changes to our underwriting strategy and guidelines. Under Tom Bolt, we have built a CUO structure to support our underwriters across the globe. We\u2019ve recently welcomed Mike Price as Deputy Chief Underwriting Officer and have expanded the role of Lixin Zeng, CEO of AlphaCat, who will work closely with Tom to bring Validus\u2019 best practice in model development AIG.","As we have shared in the past, our underwriting strategy has prioritized the reduction of gross and net limits in property and casualty. We\u2019ve reduced property\u2019s gross limits from $2.5 billion to $750 million and its net limits from $611 million to $143 million. In a similar way, we\u2019ve reduced casualty\u2019s gross limits from $250 million to $100 million. With respect to underwriting governance, we\u2019ve reviewed, validated and reissued 100% of global underwriting authorities to align with our revised risk appetite and instituted a new underwriter scorecard that measures performance against profitability and other key metrics.","As we reposition our portfolio, we are using reinsurance to support sustained profitable growth, while prudently managing gross and net exposures and protecting AIG\u2019s balance sheet. As a clear example, we\u2019ve recently expanded our existing $75 million excess of $25 million international casualty excess of loss treaty into a global program that now includes exposures across U.S. primary and excess casually lines, which aligns the net retention to our overall risk appetite.","We are currently in the marketplace to place a U.S. casualty quota share and preparing to enhance some of our existing covers during the January 1 renewal season, which we expect will yield additional benefits in 2019.","Organizationally, we\u2019ve continued to hire some of the industry\u2019s best talent, particularly in leadership positions across the world with the primary focus on strengthening our underwriting capabilities. Since last quarter\u2019s call, David McElroy has joined us as CEO of Lexington and we\u2019ve named Peter Bilsby of Talbot, as Head of our Global Specialty Business. Both David and Peter have already demonstrated the value they bring to the organization as we focus on improving our underwriting portfolio.","I\u2019m pleased to share that our new business leaders and the changes they are implementing have produced very positive feedback from our brokers, clients, and reinsurers, who recognize AIG as a better and more agile partner. We continue to work diligently to reduce general operating expenses and free-up capacity to invest in underwriting, actuarial and claims.","General Insurance\u2019s third quarter, general operating expenses declined 5% sequentially excluding Validus, and we remain on track to achieve our plan for 2018.","Finally, rounding out our efforts to strategically reposition General Insurance, we look forward to closing on the pending acquisition of Glatfelter Insurance Group next week. Glatfelter has an excellent reputation as a highly selective program manager with world-class underwriting capabilities and in-house technology, a track record of underwriting profitability, as well as a talented leadership team. The addition of Glatfelter to AIG will accelerate the repositioning of our existing U.S. programs business where we have or are currently in the process of non-renewing over 50% of our current programs, in line with our primary objective of improving General Insurance\u2019s core underwriting performance.","Turning to General Insurance\u2019s third quarter results. Slide nine details our overall performance and profitability metrics.","Third quarter net premiums written declined 2%, excluding both FX and Validus compared to the prior year quarter, largely driven by the execution of revised underwriting strategies in North America Commercial, partially offset by growth in North America Personal Insurance. Validus contributed $440 million in net premiums written to our North America and international top line results.","With respect to profitability, the third quarter combined ratio included $1.6 billion in net catastrophe losses. The breakdown of these losses is provided on slide 10. ","Validus\u2019 net catastrophe losses were approximately $200 million, over half of which were related to Japan, a result that was within our modeled expectation and in line with peers. Our core insurance businesses excluding Validus and Legacy experienced net losses attributable to third quarter events of $748 million in Japan, emanating from five events, and $439 million in North America, emanating from eight events with the majority of the remaining losses arising from prior quarter catastrophes.","To provide further context on our business in Japan, AIG\u2019s national market share is 6%; and in the Kansai region, home to Fuji Fire Marine and the location principally impacted by third quarter catastrophe events, our personal and commercial property market share is approximately 10% on average. As a result, our losses reflect both the unique severity and frequency of one of the worst catastrophe seasons for Japan in 25 years and AIG\u2019s footprint as the largest foreign-based insurer in the country.","As Brian noted, AIG\u2019s Japan CAT reinsurance program was structured in two separate towers for our commercial and personal insurance businesses. In late 2017, we began working to improve the program and successfully reduced the attachment points for both towers during the January 1st 2018 renewal. For the upcoming 2019 renewal, we plan to consolidate the program into a single tower to improve its effectiveness and further reduce our net exposure on a frequency and severity basis.","In North America, Hurricane Florence was a sizable industry event, which represented $325 million of our third quarter catastrophe losses, excluding Validus. North America Personal Insurance\u2019s accident year results include increased loss estimates for the California mudslides that occurred in the first quarter of 2018. The impacted territory is recovering from both the 2017 wildfires and the 2018 mudslides.","AIG\u2019s global claims teams have done a terrific job working with our insurers, often before the storms have made landfall and began inspecting and paying claims as soon as regional conditions allow. We have responded to clients representing over 84,000 commercial and personal insurance claims, the majority of which are in Japan, given the severe nature of the damages in that region. In U.S., our claims teams have completed physical inspections for 100% of the sites impacted by Hurricane Florence, where access has been permitted.","Shifting to accident year profitability. The adjusted accident year combined ratio was 99.4% and largely in line with our expectations. The adjusted accident year loss ratio of 63.6% reflects underlying portfolio management improvements of 240 basis points and a more moderate level of severe losses compared to the prior year quarter and the second quarter of 2018. The third quarter expense ratio was in line with second quarter results and our shift towards lower loss ratio and higher commission business in the North America Personal Insurance. The GOE ratio does not yet reflect the expense reduction actions I mentioned earlier, which will begin to be evident in the fourth quarter and as we enter 2019.","Moving to Validus. While the third quarter was challenging in terms of catastrophe losses, the business performed largely in line with our expectations. As a heavy writer of catastrophe exposed business, it is important to assess Validus\u2019 results on a four quarter basis. Since the closing of the acquisition, our teams have been working closely to drive value and we remain confident in the strong strategic contribution Validus brings to AIG.","Slide 11 and 12 provide North America\u2019s and International\u2019s third quarter financial results. North America Commercial showed improvement across most lines, driven by business mix, rate and risk selection. North America Personal Insurance had a solid quarter with an adjusted accident year loss ratio of 53.2%, and its acquisition ratio reflects the shifts we\u2019re making to grow lower loss ratio business. In International Commercial, lower severe losses were partially offset by attritional loss activity in the UK and European specialty businesses. We expect that the growing momentum of our underwriting strategy will address attritional losses, particularly as we look to the January one renewal season. International Personal Insurance continued to demonstrate profitability with an adjusted accident-year combined ratio of 97.2%.","Moving to current market conditions, the third quarter rate changes have been relatively in line with our experience over the past few quarters. North America Commercial\u2019s overall rates increased approximately 4%. We experienced admitted property pricing improvement in the mid-single-digit range, while E&S property rates improved in the low-double-digit range. North America casualty rates increased in the low to mid single digits on average, depending on the line of business, attachment point, loss history and other factors.","Looking at the reinsurance market and the upcoming January 2019 renewals. We expect property CAT and retrocessional rates to be relatively flat on average for non-loss affected accounts. Rates on loss affected accounts will be determined on a case-by-case basis including in Japan, where the majority of the renewals take place on April 1st. In casualty, we expect to continue to see terms and conditions tighten with rate change in line with loss cost trends.","In closing, we continue to expect that the implementation of our underwriting and reinsurance strategies to manage growth in net lines. Actions to reduce expenses and strategic contributions from Validus and Glatfelter will enable us to improve our underwriting performance as we entered 2019. Our deliberate and targeted actions are positioning General Insurance for long-term success as we transform into a high-quality underwriting organization that is committed to delivering on its commitments to all of our stakeholders. And I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished for the first nine months of the year.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark","Mark Lyons","Thank you, Peter, and good morning all.","I\u2019d like to make some comments this morning, firstly, about some general observations I have since joining AIG earlier this summer; secondly, I\u2019d like to provide more focused comments on loss reserves for the quarter; thirdly, I\u2019d like to provide some clarity around the reserving numbers themselves; and lastly, I\u2019ll get my views about the underwriting portfolio changes that have been implemented so far to-date.","Over the last four months, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet with many AIG executives and P&L owners, understand their strategies, historical results, budgets, competitive positioning and portfolio composition. I\u2019ve always operated under the assumption that an understanding of the underlying business strategy is critical towards evaluating reserves, profitability, portfolio mix and the like. Actuaries after all are charged with analyzing mountains of data and associated information to properly accomplish their job. It\u2019s best for them to understand the market conditions that spawn the data being analyzed.","I found here a talented group of professionals who are hardworking and care about the Company. They\u2019ve employed a host of appropriate actuarial methods that are suitable for the task in hand. This group has helped me review, analyzing and conclude on 50% of the General Insurance loss reserves during the third quarter and also helped me review challenge and understand the analyses done earlier this year. Overall then, I\u2019ve got my fingerprints on approximately 75% of the reserves through third quarter.","As for the fourth quarter, when the remaining 25% of reserves will be reviewed, the areas of focus will be U.S. Financial Lines, workers\u2019 compensation buffer access policies, international casualty reserves other than the UK and Europe which were reviewed this quarter, and personalized exposures.","At this time, on a preliminary basis and before the detailed reviews are completed, I see no material red flags for these fourth quarter lines to give me undue concern. Of course the work still has to be done, but that\u2019s how I see it at this point.","Lastly, I\u2019ve discussed the reviewed lines through the third quarter with our outside independent actuaries as well to gain their insights and their views.","Now, moving on to the third quarter area of focus. The only area where I felt the material reserve strengthening was necessary was in the excess casualty portfolio. More specifically, the strengthening was predominantly centered on construction defect exposures through practice, project and wrap policies as well as through excess casualty division other than those that specifically target construction.","The last several years, AIG has experienced the increased frequency of CD claims as well as an associated increased severity. Given the late nature of these reporting patterns, it was necessary to understand the historical and recent exposure characteristics of AIG\u2019s book. Beginning around 2009, AIG began to simultaneously reduce their construction at CD exposure as well as zero away from residential risk in favor of commercial risk. The book also shrunk exposure by approximately 70% as measured by our level of premium between 2009 and 2017 as well as proportionately away from the heaviest CD states such as California.","We project that most claims as yet unreported will emanate from commercial exposures rather than the residential exposures that make up most of our known recorded claims experience. We anticipate that commercial CD claim emergence will be fewer in number but be more complex in nature of a higher average cost per claim. And that higher average will be exacerbated by commercial insurers who as a matter of course purchased higher towers of coverage historically. Additionally, since AIG competed with capacity among other aspects, more limits per insured were exposed and was the case for residential policies.","Furthermore, an exhaustive internal analysis, outside claims audit in close collaboration with Anthony Vidovich who runs General Insurance Claims worldwide and his team, provided valuable insight into the claims history and patterns. Taking all these factors into consideration resulted in a $1.26 billion U.S. excess casualty reserve strengthening charge this quarter. This figure is gross of the adverse development cover or ADC with Berkshire Hathaway. There were other reserve adjustments this quarter in other lines of business that resulted in some partially beneficial net favorable development to the ADC, most notably from the Commercial Auto Line.","Overall, given these pluses and minuses, the ADC experience ceded adverse development of $723 million this quarter whereas AIG experienced net adverse development of $170 million, as Brian and Sid have already referenced. Both figures are highlighted on page three of the earnings release and on page 44 of financial supplement.","Now, I want to take a moment and make clear that these reserve charges result from underwriting policies that existed in the past. I do not view these as a carry forward issue into policies being written today under the revised underwriting strategy.","For additional clarity, I want to walk you through the progression of some of these reserve changes. You can reference slide 13, as I discuss this.","As stated, the reserve charge gross of the ADC for excess casualty was $1.26 billion adverse. The total charge across all lines of business for General Insurance also on a gross of the ADC basis was $950 million. This can be seen on page 44 of the financial supplement by adding the unfavorable developments and lives covered by ADC of $904 million and the unfavorable development from lives not covered by the ADC of $46 million.","The net of ADC adverse development for AIG of $170 million has already been reduced by the quarterly ADC amortization of $57 million. Adding back in this amortization results in net adverse development charge of $227 million, which implies the $723 million ADC adverse charge we just discussed. So, hopefully, that\u2019s helped you instead of confusing you more. The ADC as of 9\/30\/2018 has nearly $7.7 billion of remaining at the 100% level; and given the 80% session at $6.1 billion of remaining limits still available to AIG.","Lastly, from the perspective of the operating units, $170 million of net adverse development this quarter saw $134 million emanate from North America, mostly from personal line development on California Wildfires, another $38 million from international and a minor $2 million of favorable development from the Legacy portfolio.","Shifting gears a bit. As part of Peter\u2019s leadership team, I have been involved in the strategies of the various operating units and I have a fairly detailed view of the underwriting changes that have already been implemented. Peter has already commented on the massive construction of gross and net limits on the property, energy and casualty side of the business. And I\u2019ll just editorially add. When I say massive, on just a $468 million reduction in the vertical net on property and $150 million reduction in international casualty and roughly $80 million, those qualify as massive reductions, in my view.","As respect to other underwriting changes that have been implemented, clear underwriting appetites have been established. Clarity with distribution around these revised appetites is happening as we speak, and this will result in a targeted and higher quality submission as well. Thinner limits and higher attachment points and\/or deductibles are being bound, a market proportional shift to smaller accounts has occurred and continues especially in the excess casualty area, a definitive strategy to increase the mid-excess proportion of the excess portfolio has also been implemented, clear ventilation rules exist between AIG entities on the same risk with Chief Underwriting Officer governance. Heightened underwriter accountability now dovetails clearly with revised authority, improved pricing tools and portfolio monitoring has been developed for again excess casualty in particular. Peter referred to the successful binding of the global casualty 75 mill excess -- 25 mill excess of loss treaty, which shows the broad support the reinsurance market towards our significantly altered gross underwriting strategy.","Lastly, for those of you who know me, I am generally considered a skeptic and a cynic when it comes to reported benefits of underwriting changes. My 40 years of property, casualty experience however tell me that these changes are substantive and will lead to improved loss ratios in any market. Now, with all this going on, this is really an exciting time to be at AIG.","So, now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Hogan","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.","As you can see on slide 15, Life & Retirement delivered solid results for the quarter. Excluding the adjustments from the annual assumption update that Sid discussed, adjusted pre-tax income of $811 million was in line with our expectations, along with an adjusted ROE of approximately 13%. We continue to deploy capital to attractive opportunities, leveraging our broad product portfolio and channel strategy. As market conditions improved, we increased premiums and deposits across our annuity lines, fixed, index and variable. We grew Life Insurance sales, especially in our International Life business and increased premiums and deposits in Group Retirement. Higher general operating expenses reflect this new business growth, as well as our investments to strengthen our platforms and enhance our digital capabilities. If market conditions continue to improve, we are well-positioned to deploy more capital at or above our targeted economic returns, while recognizing we will incur additional expenses associated with new business growth.","Now, I will briefly discuss results for each of our businesses.","Turning to Individual Retirement on slide 16. Premiums and deposits grew by over 40% with particularly strong growth in fixed and indexed annuities. With these strong sales levels, we achieved positive net flows for the quarter, excluding retail mutual funds. Retail mutual funds which is a comparatively small basis of our business, continued to face headwinds in the quarter and net flows may continue to be challenged for a period of time.","Total assets under management and fee income for Individual Retirement remain strong. We continued our practice of active spread management, but as expected, we saw continued compression from our fixed annuity portfolio due to the rolloff of higher yielding assets that are being reinvested at rates below the overall portfolio yields. Base net investment spread for variable and indexed annuities benefited from higher accretion and other investment income. After adjusting for these items, spread decreased for these products in line with our expectations.","Turning to Group Retirement on slide 17. We increased premiums and deposits with solid periodic deposits and growth in individual product sales. Our confirmed new group acquisitions for this year are strong, although the timing of some of these planned conversions may shift to early next year. As I have mentioned on previous earnings calls, we will continue to see attrition of some large groups due to plan sponsors reducing the number of providers in their plans, M&A activity in the healthcare market and other competitive factors. Our surrenders were impacted this quarter by the loss of two large plans and the natural attrition of plans may impact surrenders in future quarters. We continue to believe that our differentiated model, which combines high-touch and high-tech service, positions us well as a leader in the growing not-for-profit defined contribution market.","Similar to Individual Retirement, assets under management remained strong and we continue to actively manage spreads. Base net investment spread for Group Retirement benefited from accretion and other investment income. Adjusting for these items, spread was in line with the prior year quarter. While we are more optimistic than last quarter, forward rate conditions are still below our portfolio yields and spreads remain under pressure. Also, in a rising rate environment, we will need to maintain market competitiveness on the crediting rates for our in-force business.","As we look forward across Individual and Group Retirement, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, our current expectation is that our base net spreads will decline by approximately zero to 2 basis points per quarter.","Let\u2019s now move to Life Insurance on slide 18. We continue to make progress in our life business, and separating our operating models from Fortitude Re will allow us to further focus on our new business platform. Total premiums and deposits increased and we continue to grow sales in the U.S. and the UK with particularly strong new business growth in the UK. Lastly, our overall mortality experience was favorable to pricing assumptions in the prior year quarter.","Turning to Institutional Markets on slide 19. We did not execute notable opportunistic transactions during the quarter. The market pipeline for pension risk transfer transactions over the next 12 to 18 months continues to be robust. Overall, our Institutional Markets business continues to be well-positioned to capitalize on available growth while remaining focused on achieving targeted economic returns.","To close, our results for the quarter reflect our ongoing strategy to leverage our broad product expertise and our distribution strength to deploy capital to the most attractive opportunities, which we believe continues to position us well.","Now, I would like to turn it back to Brian to open up the Q&A.","Brian Duperreault","Thanks, Kevin. Let\u2019s go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Yaron Kinar","Hi. Good morning, everybody. My first question is around the CAT losses. So, I guess, the one thing I\u2019m still struggling with after the preannouncement and in the quarter is, just get a better feel of the AAL and maybe why CAT losses were at least year-to-date seem to be tracking well above the AAL. And I understand that Japan losses were very significant. But, at the end of the day, I would have thought that these are items or the exposures were known or the market weighting in Japan was known well into this year. So, maybe any additional color you can offer on your thoughts on AAL here, is the 4% to 4.5% is still a reasonable number to think about?","Brian Duperreault","Yes, sure. Yaron, I think it is. But, I think Peter can give you a little bit more color.","Peter Zaffino","Thanks, Brian. And thank you for the question. Let me just start with the CATs. We had said a $1.6 billion in the quarter. If you take out Legacy, Validus and then the $150 million in the year adjustments for mudslides, you are down to about $1.2 billion. And so, the Japan loss, again, it\u2019s one of the worst CAT years in 25 years, is $750 million, Jebi being the worst. And so, on a current basis in terms of the return periods, it\u2019s actually exactly where we had thought. And so, there is -- with AAL and reinsurance, it was at expectations. Now, they had more frequency in the quarter than we have seen in the past. And so therefore, taking a look at the AALs, and I\u2019ll comment on that in a second, we also had about 440 in North America. So, when you look at those two and you look at the frequency that we had within the quarter on an aggregate basis, it\u2019s within modeled expectations.","So, Mark commented a little bit on what we are doing on property and gross limits. And the AALs, if you look over the last 10 years, have been around 100 basis points or thereabouts, lighter than our actual CAT experience. So, it\u2019s within line. We are looking to revise total insured values, looking at PMLs and looking at different reinsurance structures. Brian said in his prepared comments that we\u2019ll be relooking at Japan. So, we\u2019ll have less frequency and severity as we enter 2019. And we\u2019re running the models to recalibrate and take a look at the AALs, but they are very much in line with our expectations over a longer period of time.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","So, my first question is just on the underwriting profitability target. Brian reaffirmed the goal for the end of the year. So, I just -- as you guys think about inflation, can you just kind of talk to that and what you have embedded in getting to that sub-100 target. And then, just a clarification there, because I know that that\u2019s a year-end target. Is your expectation that General Insurance will plant a sub-100 underlying plus AAL in the first quarter of 2019?","Brian Duperreault","Well, let me do the last piece first. Yes. That\u2019s what I meant by entering into 2019. So, we expect the first quarter to be an underwriting profit. So, with respect to inflation, we\u2019ve got Mark here. I think, Mark\u2019s probably the best to answer that question.","Mark Lyons","Great, Brain. Thank you. And hello, Elyse. As respect to -- as Peter mentioned, we have 4% on the weighted average pricing increase. We view this that we are gaining. So, we are having a margin expansion. It varies by line of business, as you know. Averages can be deceiving. Our loss cost trends, which is a frequency severity combination, range from about zero in some lines to about north of 8 in other lines of business. Auto, for example, we see that as being fairly high at this point, around the 8% area; we\u2019re getting materially more than that in rates, and that\u2019s actually a margin expansion line. Most of our other lines, casualty, primary, excess, we\u2019re feeling those are margin expansion lines as well, given the rate changes we\u2019re getting. Where some of the challenge areas, where comp is a little more flat, we might be losing a little bit there. D&O overall is we think we\u2019re getting -- it\u2019s close to flat, but some areas are improving and some areas like EPLI, we could be marginally losing on.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to our next question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker","Can we talk a little bit about $148 million of California Wildfire losses a year later? That\u2019s a lot of houses or a lot of businesses? What\u2019s going on there?","Brian Duperreault","Mark -- I think Mark wanted to answer this question. This is great.","Mark Lyons","Hey, Josh. Well, you get some of the same effects, whether it\u2019s wildfires or the mudslides, which are really early in 2018. You have a lot of high-value areas that are very-hard to reach. Some of them are even on the sides of mountains. And regulatory abilities get in and even inspect them. So, you have some of that delay. You have a lot of demand for contractor services, not just the rates per hour but the cost of the equipment, and everything else is moving up as well. So, I would say overall that accounts for a lot of it. You also have -- because they are mostly high net worth individuals, there is additional living expenses that tend to accrue, and I would say some are using those liberally.","Peter Zaffino","I just would add one thing is that when we look at the mudslides, which were in the current accident year, there wasn\u2019t a lot of different, as Mark points out, there wasn\u2019t a huge amount of insureds. It was -- one is just being able to get in physically, inspect, assessing all of the different elements of the loss, and then looking at some of the demand surge. And then, you add in all the other components of it, it\u2019s just something that was not able to assess within the first quarter. So, we got a much better look as we progressed throughout the year.","Brian Duperreault","Yes. I\u2019d say that when I looked at our abilities to understand what the CATs are and price them properly, we\u2019ve got a pretty good track record. I think this is a bit of an anomaly, and I think it\u2019s just a unique situation with regard to this particular loss and the insureds. Next question?","Operator","We\u2019ll move on to our next question from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","My first question is on capital management. Given the stock is trading at 60% of book value, do you find it just more attractive to buying back your stock versus other deployments of your capital?","Brian Duperreault","Well, I mentioned earlier, we bought $350 million of stock in the previous quarter; price was around 53. So, I\u2019d say, this price is pretty compelling, let\u2019s put it that way.","Operator","We\u2019ll move on to Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher","Can you comment on 2016 and 2017 excess casualty reserve strengthening? How much that was? And how much rate do you think you need on this line now? And also, can you comment on -- I think 3Q had some current accident year true-up in it. How much did that negatively affect the loss pick in 3Q?","Mark Lyons","Yes. There was a couple of factors on that, one of them relates to the area of focus, which was on CD and wraps, because you have to look at that by policy year and the losses that emerge. I mean, the work or the poor work has really already been done. So, we anticipate some of those accidents occurring from those policy years in \u201816, in \u201817, in \u201818. So that\u2019s causative for some of the drift up, more so in \u201816 and \u201817, and more in \u201817 and \u201818, which you\u2019d expect with a shrinking book on that. So, that\u2019s a piece of it. And on the balance, which will also include \u201818, we\u2019ve made some, I\u2019ll call them market cycle adjustments, associated with where we think we are in the underwriting cycle. Excess casualty is a fairly volatile line of business and more extreme on the underwriting cycle. So, we made some adjustments in that respect. And I would say, lastly, and this is one of the key underwriting strategies of moving attachment points materially. There is some auto exposure coming in on a small set of lead umbrella policies that has some auto exposure, and we\u2019re reflecting that. That would have been more \u201816 and \u201817 though.","Brian Duperreault","Yes. I think, Mark mentioned earlier that the -- we think we\u2019re actually getting margin increases in the excess at this point, just in general. And with respect to construction, Peter mentioned that, I believe he mentioned we are reducing our appetite in that business to a very limited amount.","Operator","We\u2019ll move on to our next question from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","Yes, basically just a quick follow-up there. Mark, was there any current year development in the underlying loss or the loss pick in the third quarter in the general insurance operations? And then, a follow-up to that, a lot of the discussion has been on changing limits profiles in reinsurance and all such things. I assume we are going to improve your guys\u2019 loss ratios going forward. When are we going to see that? Because, Brian, I think a lot of the discussion has been improving the expense ratio going into next year, not so much the loss ratio.","Brian Duperreault","Let me answer that one first, and I\u2019ll let Mark talk about the other piece, which is the loss ratios in the third quarter. When do we see it? Well, I think we have seen a little bit already. Mark is talking about margin improvements. So, I said we\u2019re going to get into an underwriting profit next year. A lot of that is expense, no question about it. That\u2019s more immediate. And I\u2019ve mentioned this before and I think Mark would support the same position. And that is, we may believe that these changes are taking place, but we want to see it start to play out in the actual numbers. So, we\u2019re not going to -- we\u2019re going to take a more cautious approach to adjusting loss ratios down as we see the actual results start to show themselves. That\u2019s not to mean that we don\u2019t think there is some improvement taking place. But, we want to make sure that we\u2019re doing this the right way, long-term that we don\u2019t have to go back and adjust upward reserves, because we were a little too optimistic that the improvement took place early. So, you just have to understand how that\u2019s going to play out. But, we do see it coming and we expect that 2019 we\u2019re going to be in an underwriting profit position, not a great one, but a profit. And we\u2019ll move from there to a great one. Mark, do you want to talk about the third quarter?","Mark Lyons","Sure. Thank you. Brian, I think a more direct answer to your question is in the accident year with 90 basis points of loss ratio impact for the GI level in total by all the causative factors I just mentioned, emanating from the one product line. But, you have to look at it in two pieces. There was the current accident quarter, if you will, which was 30 basis points; then, there was 60 basis points of catch-up, the true-up the first two accident quarters of the year through third quarter. So, 60 plus 30; and so, it\u2019s 90 in total.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jay Cohen","Yes. Most of my questions were answered. Just one last one. Selling off part of the Legacy business, can you give us some sense of the earnings impact that that will have?","Brian Duperreault","Well, I think we\u2019ve given you an idea that the ROE is around 3% to 5%. And we\u2019re going to take about 20% of that off. Sid, do you want to do more of the arithmetic than that? But, it\u2019s a fairly simple arithmetic question.","Sid Sankaran","Yes. I think, you are going to see for the full-year that we\u2019ve had an ROE in that range. So, think of it as about 20% off the income is obviously the adjustment for the non-controlling interest.","Jay Cohen","Great. Thank you.","Brian Duperreault","[Indiscernible] third quarter, because we had this CAT in there and everything taking that out. I think it\u2019s a pretty simple arithmetic. Okay, next question?","Operator","We\u2019ll move on to our next question from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","I had a question for Kevin. You mentioned that the ROE for the Life and Retirement business was in line in with your expectations with the level of normalized earnings this quarter was well below where they were in the second quarter and the recent trend, despite benefits from a favorable equity market tailwind and good mortality. So just wondering, were there any other moving pieces to consider in the third quarter, and how should we think about the run rate earnings power for the business?","Kevin Hogan","No. I mean, there were no other unusual moving pieces in the third quarter. I think looking past the actuarial review impact, in the current conditions and especially at the current level of premiums and deposits, which we are enjoying which are higher than we\u2019ve seen for some time, I really consider the third quarter run rate to be within our range of expectations, and the returns in the low to mid double digits is pretty much within the range that we have previously suggested.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb","I had two questions. The first is what level of return on equity do you think AIG is capable of achieving, once you start seeing the improvement in property, casualty coming through, thinking about kind of 2020 and beyond? And then, the second question more near-term is, Sid, based on a 25% overall effective tax rate for 2018, that would seem to imply a fourth quarter 2018 tax rate around 30%. Am I am I right on that?","Brian Duperreault","Let\u2019s get that one last. No, you are not right. And, I think Sid will get that to you. So, return on equity. Well, I would say that the -- and you got to have -- we got to recognize we got a legacy return on equity that\u2019s in that 3% to 5% range. But the rest of it, the core I think would be 9% plus and so, weighted average maybe gets into the 8% range. Of course, it depends on where Legacy goes. But, assuming it\u2019s still part of the family, I think that\u2019s the number. Sid, do you want to talk about this tax rate?","Sid Sankaran","Yes. Thank you, Brian. No. I think the 25%, remember is simply intended to be as we look at, we\u2019ve previously suggested that for full-year we\u2019re looking at 21% to 22% excluding tax discrete. And so, as there is lower net income forecasted for the year, given the catastrophes, which would be taxed at 21%, we expect a higher expectation for the fourth quarter. And so, we concluded on our catch-up this quarter. So, it would be at that 25% level is our approximate expectation.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our last question from Paul Newsome from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Paul Newsome","Any thoughts on most recent earnings -- or equity volatility, financial market volatility this month on the Life Insurance businesses, both pro and con?","Kevin Hogan","As we\u2019ve reported previously, our hedge program has performed and continues to perform within expectations. Sid, if you have anything else?","Sid Sankaran","No. I think, as you know, we fully hedge for equity markets. And so, we haven\u2019t seen anything in the recent market expectation around our variable annuity hedging program. Just a reminder that of course on the investment side, there are securities in terms of private equity hedge funds and fair value options that do have equity market sensitivity. But, obviously, we need to see how the full year plays out for the Life Insurance business and the investment side there.","Brian Duperreault","Okay. Listen, I think we\u2019re going to end the Q&A. I really do appreciate all your attention. And we had a lot of content, so we cut the Q&A a little shorter than normal. Thank you for your indulgence on that. Before I end the call, I want to recognize the hard work and tireless support that our employees around the world have provided to our customers and neighbors affected by the numerous global catastrophes. Our hearts go out to all of those who\u2019ve been impacted. So, with that, thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s presentation. We thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded.","And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Sabra Purtill","Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Today's call will cover AIG's third quarter 2019 financial results announced earlier this morning. The news release financial results presentation and financial supplement were posted on our website at www.aig.com at 7.00 A.M this morning and the 10-Q for the quarter will be filed later today after the call.","Our speakers today include Brian Duperreault; President and CEO; Peter Zaffino, CEO of General Insurance and Global Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Hogan, CEO, Life and Retirement; and Mark Lyons, Chief Financial Officer.

The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are included in our earnings release, financial supplement and presentation.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Good morning and thank you for joining us this morning.","As I've said over the past few quarters, our leadership team has taken significant action on a number of fronts to lay the foundation for long term sustainable and profitable growth at AIG. The execution of our strategy is reflected in our results this quarter, which were in line with our expectations.","Our efforts in General Insurance have been focused on fostering a culture of underwriting excellence, outlining a consistent risk framework and reducing risk and volatility in our portfolio. Peter and the team in GI are executing with focused urgency that is impressive and the marketplace has taken notice. You're beginning to see the significant efforts pay off in our results with the third quarter performance in GI yielding remarkable improvement over prior years. I am particularly pleased that the GI reinsurance strategy played out as designed dramatically reducing volatility in CAT season and preserving capital.","We've been leading the market with our professional approach to judiciously deploying capacity, appropriately addressing laws cost inflation, and continued underwriting discipline on our pricing models. These actions are playing out against an industry backdrop of prolonged pressures on accident year loss ratios, laws costs inflation, significant catastrophes over multiple years pressuring the property loss, a lower interest rate environment, a complex retro market and a fatigue alternative capital market.","This market dynamic is different from the past because we now see the industry as a whole is acting more rationally and this combination of change behavior and external forces reaffirms my belief that this market cycle is sustainable for the foreseeable future.","One example where AIG has taken a leadership position in the industry is the way we tackle the increasing industry wide issue in cyber insurance. Companies are more focused on the severity of losses, increased systemic risk of more stringent regulatory environment, and ransom demands that are dramatically escalating. In September, we formally announced our affirmative cyber initiative, and it provided clarity for the market on how cyber coverage should be addressed and mitigated ambiguity that existed.","Turning to our third quarter financial results as you saw on our press release this morning, adjusted return on common equity for the third quarter was 4.1% and 8.6% year to date. Adjusted after tax income was $505 million or $0.56 per share for the third quarter compared to an adjusted after tax loss of $301 million or $0.34 per share in the prior year quarter.","Year-to-date 2019 adjusted after tax income was $3.57 per share, reflecting a $1.80 per share improvement over the first nine months of 2018. General Insurance delivered a third consecutive quarter of adjusted accident quarter underwriting profit. The adjusted accident in quarter combined ratio excluding cash was 95.9% and we remain on track to deliver an adjusted underwriting profit for the full year.","In addition, last week, GI announced the new syndicate at Lloyd's, serving the 50 billion specialists U.S. high net worth market. Lloyd's has undertaken a comprehensive plan to regain its preeminent position on the marketplace. We've been actively seeking opportunities to be part of that effort, first with our acquisition of VALIDUS, which included Talbot, a respected Lloyd's platform and now with this further partnership. Peter will give you more detail of the great progress we are making in General Insurance, as we position that business for the future.","Turning to Life and Retirement we continue to produce solid results in the third quarter with adjusted pretax income of $646 million and adjusted return on equity of 10.1% including the impact of the annual assumptions review. The adjusted return on equity was 12.5% if you exclude the impact from the actual review process. Despite continued headwinds from sustain low interest rates, we remain optimistic about our ability to deliver return on common equity in the low to mid teens for the year given the strength of our diversified product portfolio, and broad distribution network. Kevin will provide additional information on the work he and his team are undertaking in Life and Retirement.","Net investment income was $3.4 billion for the quarter and $11 billion for the first nine months, which is ahead of our original expectations. Our year-to-date performance is due largely to strong alternative returns. Mark will provide more detail on this and our overall financials.","Finally, I wanted to touch on AIG 200 our multi-year enterprise wide program to improve our core processes and infrastructure. We have four core objectives for AIG 200, which are achieving underwriting excellence, modernizing our operating infrastructure, enhancing user and customer experiences, and becoming a more unified company.","This work is absolutely critical if AIG is to become a top performing company, and we are carefully prioritizing areas for investment and transformation. We will provide estimated levels on investment charges and savings for 2020 on our fourth quarter earnings call. Peter as the executive leading this important initiative will elaborate further on the progress we've made through the third quarter.","Our ability to tackle transformational projects are supported by our strong balance sheet. We are focused on maintaining financial flexibility while reducing our leverage and reinvesting in our businesses. Looking to the remainder of the year and into 2020, we were confident in our ability to achieve our goals for 2019 and continue to believe that the momentum we have generated will enable us to deliver a double digit ROCE by the end of 2021. We still have a lot of work ahead of us and I'm very pleased with the progress we're making across the organization. Remain confident that AIG is well on its way to being a leading, global insurance company.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.","Peter Zaffino","Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone.","Today, I will provide an update on the General Insurance, third quarter financial performance, the turnaround that we are executing in key business units, along with our observations on the current rate environment. I will discuss the recently announced new Lloyd's syndicate serving the U.S. high network market. And finally, I will close with comments on AIG 200.","The General Insurance, third quarter results reflects steady progress towards our goal of achieving sustained underwriting profitability. We continue to execute on the bold strategic moves we identified as critical to reposition our global portfolio, which include disciplined underwriting and reinsurance strategies, a clear focus on operational excellence and investing in talent for the future.","We continue to significantly reduce volatility through improved risk selection, aggressive limit management, and align our businesses with our redefined underwriting strategy. We're achieving better rate adequacy; and in many cases, are leading the market.","As we expected, it will take time for these actions to fully earn through our reported results. But I'm very pleased with our improving financial performance.","Turning to our results, the third quarter adjusted accident quarter combined ratio was 95.9%, a 350 basis point improvement year-over-year, including a 210 basis point improvement in the adjusted accident quarter loss ratio, and 140 basis point improvement in the expense ratio.","In North America, the adjusted accident quarter loss ratio was 69.5%, a 30-basis point improvement year-over-year. Our financial performance in the third quarter reflected the favorable impact of changes to our business mix, which was achieved through reductions in higher loss ratio businesses, strong results from glad Glatfelter, improved rate adequacy across a number of lines, lower frequency of property attritional losses across retail, wholesale and western world, and the benefit of treaty and facultative reinsurance.","These positive drivers were largely offset by our Crop and Specialty businesses. Crop, negatively impacted North America's adjusted accident quarter loss ratio by approximately 100 basis points. Significant spring flooding in the Midwest, affected many of our insured farmers, which drove a higher volume of prevented-planting claims.","As a result, we increased our 2019 loss ratios despite remaining uncertainty regarding the ultimate profitability of this crop season.","We experienced higher losses in the Marine, Aviation and Energy, which negatively impacted North America's adjusted accident quarter loss ratio by approximately 250 basis points. We continue to take actions to improve performance in U.S. Specialty lines through enhanced risk selection, rate improvement strategies and reinsurance.","Despite these headwinds in North America, on a global basis, our Specialty business performed very well, with international seeing lower expected loss. North America, Personal Insurance performed as expected with 110 basis point improvement in the adjusted accident quarter loss ratio, and 100 basis point improvement in the adjusted accident quarter combined ratio.","Overall, I'm very pleased with North America's core performance, and believe the trends we're seeing demonstrate a higher quality, better price and more balanced portfolio that is improving each quarter.","Moving to International. The adjusted accident quarter loss ratio was 53.9%. A 430-basis point improvement year-over-year. In the International Commercial, we had fewer severe and attritional losses that were below trend, particularly in Specialty and Talbot, a Lloyd's syndicate.","Additionally, re-underwriting efforts in property within the U.K. and Europe are beginning to earn into our reported financials. The International Personal Insurance adjusted accident quarter loss ratio improved 290 basis points, as we continue to see a favorable trend in Japan Personal Auto.","The third quarter expense ratio for General Insurance of 34.4%, was in line with our expectations, and reflects our sustained diligence around expense control. The third quarter of 2019 was an active CAT quarter. Total net CAT losses were $497 million compared to $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2018, and $3 billion in the third quarter of 2017.","There were nine events in the quarter, six of which occurred in North America and three occurred in Japan. Our net CAT ratio in the third quarter with 7.5%, with 2.9% attributable to events in North America, 3.5% attributable to Japan, and 1.1% attributable to Validus Re.","Net CAT losses from events in North America were $203 million. Hurricane Dorian was a single largest driver of net losses at $135 million, of which $10 million was attributable to Validus Re. The five remaining smaller events in North America, range from $10 million to $14 million and net losses per event.","Net CAT losses from the Japan events were $294 million, of which $65 million was attributable to Validus Re. Typhoon Faxai, the strongest typhoon to hit the Kant\u014d region since 2004, was the main driver of these losses.","I want to provide an overview of our business in Japan, given our significant market presence and the actions we have taken to address our CAT exposure. Japan is AIG's largest market outside the United States. It represents approximately $5.1 billion in gross premiums written, with 82% in personal lines and 18% in commercial lines. AIG is the largest foreign owned General Insurance Company in Japan, with an average market share of 6% and the region is most impacted by recent CAT events.","As I said in the past, as part of our strategy to contain volatility and manage CAT within our risk appetite site, we enhance our reinsurance coverage in Japan to reduce net retention and protect against tail events.","When we restructured our worldwide CAT program for 2019, this included moving to a single occurrence tower for Japan, with a model expected to cash in point of the 1 in 7-year event.","This dedicated occurrence protection exhausts at the model 1 in 69-year event. We have additional protection from our global CAT cover, that provides protection in excess of the 1 in 500-year event.","Additionally, we also purchased international annual aggregate protection, which attaches at 1 in 10 year event for losses outside of North America, with approximately 80% of the model expected loss is coming from Japan.","Overall, Japan has been a profitable business with an average historical adjusted accident year loss ratio of approximately 50%, and its prospects for improved profitability are very strong. With respect to the recent CAT events in Japan, it is still early days from typhoon Faxai. And as a result, industry loss estimates from the modeling firm stand at broad range of between $3 billion and $9 billion.","Typhoon Hagibis, a fourth quarter event, is also expected to be sizable with AIR's early industry loss estimate currently at $8 billion to $16 billion. To the put the recent CAT activity in Japan perspective, there have been 12 designated catastrophic tropical storms since 1984. Four of which occurred in the last two years. 2018 and 2019 will be the two largest years for insured losses from tropical storm events in the last 40-years.","However, irrespective of the eventual size of these industry losses, AIG's expected maximum retained net loss is limited due to the benefit of both the occurrence reinsurance and the International CAT annual aggregate protection.","Based on our current estimation of year-to-date CAT losses in International, and excluding Validus Re, our net loss before reinstatement premium arising from this event is estimated at no more than approximately $75 million.","We have significant additional covers in place to protect against further fourth quarter CAT activity in our international business, including Japan. And taking Hagibis into account, our maximum retention on any one loss is now $20 million before any additional reinstatement premiums for the remainder of the year.","With respect to Validus Re, we have an aggregate retro in place. Given the wide range of model loss estimates, it's too early to provide a net CAT loss estimate from typhoon Hagibis. However, we expect the retro aggregate to attach with another 155 million in CAT losses.","As I've done in past calls, I'd like to highlight a few businesses that exemplify the work we're doing to reduce risk, reposition our portfolio and establish AIG as a market leader. I recognize that I've mentioned Lexington often, but the magnitude of the turnaround in this business over the past year is powerful and worthy of another update.","In Casualty, submission volume increased 62% in the third quarter, and we were successful in further diversifying in the middle market while reducing total limit by 58% and improving rates by 31%.","In Property, submission volume increased 47%, while we reduced total limits by 74% and increase our overall proportion of excess policies from 11% at the end of 2018 to 25% on a 2019 year-to-date basis.","In addition, we increased deductibles by 18%, continued to improve terms and conditions and achieve third quarter renewal rate increases of 15%, which we expect will continue to increase particularly due to the recent global CAT activity.","Turning to North America retail property, we continue to reduce aggregates and exposure to certain classes, increase deductibles and achieve meaningful rate increases. We reduce total gross limits by over $20 billion or 37% of the third quarter and over $80 billion or 49% year-to-date.","Average deductibles increased by 27% in the quarter and 30% year-to-date. These significant underwriting actions are reducing volatility, improving attritional loss exposure and significantly reducing cat exposure.","Multi-year agreements represented approximately 30% of the retail property portfolio at the end of the third quarter. These agreements will be approximately 20% of the portfolio by the end of 2019. And we'll trend lower during 2020 as we will drive additional momentum in our reunderwriting efforts.","In the third quarter, we saw North America retail property rate increases accelerate as there was broader pullback in market capacity, and discipline underwriting was more prevalent. The portfolio yielded high teen rate increases and achieved mid 20s rate increases when you exclude the impact of long-term agreements. We expect to continue to see rate increases through the remainder of the year and then to 2020.","In North America, financial lines we accelerated remediation of challenge segments, and in the quarter we achieve rate increases exceeding 30% across commercial D&O led by increases exceeding 35% in public D&O. At the same time, we reduce primary commercial D&O aggregate limits by over 40% compared to a 30% reduction the second quarter, and we reduced primary commercial D&O policies with limits greater than 10 million in lead layers high over 40%.","While we've done significant work to reunderwrite our global portfolio we're also focused on investing and attractive growth opportunities such as accident and health. A&H represents more than 3 billion in gross premiums creams written and is one of our best performing businesses. We believe A&H will be a strong engine of future profitable growth because global demographic trends and demand for A&H products match up well with our product offerings and global footprint.","Now I'd like to comment briefly on the overall rate environment and some broader market observations. We continue to see meaningful rate increases across the board in the third quarter a trend that is accelerated throughout the year. In some lines rate improvement has been at the highest level in over a decade. The overall third quarter rate improvement for general insurance excluding Validus and Glatfelter was in the high single to low double-digits.","North America commercial rates increasing in the low double-digits compared to a high single-digit rate increase in the second quarter. International commercial rates increased in the low to mid single-digits on average across all geographies, consistent with the second quarter.","Outside the specific businesses I highlighted earlier in North America were seeing meaningful rate increases in the mid 20% range in admitted excess casualty and energy and international rate increases continue to accelerate in the UK, driven by approximately 20 points of improvement in D&O over 30 points improvement in marine and low double-digit improvements in energy.","These increases are being driven by proactively addressing loss cost trend inflation, as well as our unique position as a primary lead market across the commercial insurance landscape. As we've noted on prior calls, loss trends due toward environment and social inflation continue to be key areas of focus for us. We recognize this growing trend a while ago and we continue to monitor the changing landscape and respond to risks as they evolve.","Given recent news reports about settlement activity, I want to touch on developments concerning litigation related to opioids, which has been filed primarily by state and local governments against manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. While it's too early to predict or quantify the outcome of all the litigation, or the insurance that may apply, we've been very closely tracking these developments so that we can address these complicated risks appropriately as they continue to evolve.","As Brian noted, we recently announced the plan to launch an innovative syndicate Lloyd\u2019s focused on the U.S. high network portfolio. We expect this syndicate will support new and renewing business starting in the first quarter of 2020. The specialist syndicate, syndicate 2019 is expected to be Lloyd's largest ever single new engine premium of up to $1 billion. Lloyd\u2019s unique capital structure provides us with increased flexibility and efficiency, and enables us to attract new and diverse long-term capital partners to support profitable growth where opportunities exist.","Before turning the call over to Kevin, I'd like to make a few comments on AIG 200. As Brian noted, AIG 200 is our global multi-year effort to reposition AIG as a top performing company. We're focusing on programs that involve transformational change to our infrastructure and underwriting operations, as well as developing a new data architecture, all of which will be designed to achieve best-in-class operations that deliver value to scale and simplification.","While AIG 200 primary purpose is not cost cutting, we do expect to achieve a reduced expense base over time, and more importantly, a much better experience for our distribution partners, clients, policyholders and colleagues. AIG 200 reflects our commitment to continuous improvement as we pursue operational excellence and fortify our competitive position. We're very pleased with the high level of engagement from colleagues across the company who are committed to shaping the future of AIG.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Hogan","Thank you, Peter and good morning everyone.","Life and Retirement recorded adjusted pretax income of 646 million for the quarter and adjusted return on attributed common equity of 10.1%. Excluding the annual actuarial assumption update, the adjusted pretax income was 789 million and adjusted return on attributed common equity was 12.5% within our expectations. Adjusted pretax income decreased by 67 million from the prior year quarter.","The primary driver\u2019s of the difference was the annual actuarial assumption update, which accounted for 45 million of the decrease and elevated mortality. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by the lower interest rate environment driving increased call and tender income and higher returns on fair value options securities, as well as other net investment income adjustments.","There was nothing in our assumption review or mortality experience has suggested a change in the inherent profitability of our products, nor a need to change our pricing strategy. Also it's worth noting that from a pretax income perspective, the overall impact from the assumption update was positive 20 million.","Year-to-date, our adjusted pretax income was 2.6 billion and adjusted return on attributed common equity was 14%. We are pleased with our results to date, but recognize the challenges and headwinds below interest rate environment presents, along with the potential for increased volatility in equity markets, given global trade and geopolitical concerns. Declining equity markets would among other things, negatively impact fees as well as deferred acquisition costs amortization.","Declining interest rates would typically result in higher returns on fair value options securities although the impact on net investment income could be uneven, and would depend on the timing and degree of interest rate movement. At interest rate levels as of the end of the third quarter, our current expectation is for base net spreads to decline by approximately one to three basis points per quarter through the end of next year.","Finally, from a statutory perspective, we expect to continue to generate solid earnings before our year end 2019 risk based capital levels to be higher than our strong year end 2018 levels. Our topline results continue to reflect our ongoing strategy to leverage our broad product portfolio and diversified distribution network to satisfy customer needs.","During the quarter, we grew indexed annuity sales and individual retirement and executed opportunistic transactions in institutional markets. We expect lower levels of sales for certain product lines in the fourth quarter, due to lower interest rates and the uncertain environment. We will remain disciplined with respect to product pricing and features and continue to deploy capital to available attractive new business opportunities.","For individual retirement, premiums and deposits increased slightly due to growth and indexed annuity sales. Although fixed annuity sales were basically flat from the prior year quarter, they have declined significantly from first quarter levels. We expect lower sales of fixed annuities in the prevailing interest rate environment. We achieved positive net flows excluding retail mutual funds, which is a comparatively small part of our earnings.","Total assets under administration increased driven by strong equity market performance and growth of annuity deposits during the first half of the year. For Group retirement premiums deposits were lower than the prior year quarter driven by a decrease in individual product sales related to lower crediting rates. Net flows improved from the prior year quarter due to lower group surrender activity but still remain negative.","Although the timing of group acquisitions and individual contributions will result in quarter-over-quarter variances in deposits, we expect surrenders and other withdrawals to continue to drive negative net flows.","It is also important to note that the financial impact of outflows will vary based on product characteristics. Despite facing negative net flows for a period of time, we've continued to produce solid earnings for this business, as assets under administration have continued to grow.","For our Life Insurance business, total premiums and deposits increased to the international sales. Our U.S. life sales declined as we deemphasize guaranteed universal life sales in the current interest rate, environment and index universal life sales remain under pressure while mortality was elevated during the quarter, it should be viewed in the context of generally favorable mortality trends we have seen over the last two years.","For institutional markets, premiums and deposits increased due to a large GIC issuance and select transactions in our pension risk transfer business. We have continued to opportunistically grow our asset base, and our institutional markets business continues to be well positioned to capitalize on available growth while remaining focused on achieving targeted returns.","Across our businesses, we are continuing to invest as needed to prepare for the evolving regulatory and accounting landscape, including the SECs regulation best interest, New York State's Regulation 187, NAICs variable annuity framework and FASB LDTI among others. We will take the opportunity to leverage these ongoing investments to further improve our efficiency and competitive position.","The close, we remain committed to our ongoing strategy to leverage our broad product expertise and distribution footprint to deploy capital to the most attractive opportunities, which we believe positions us well to help meet growing needs for protection, retirement savings, and lifetime income solutions.","Now I will turn it over to Mark.","Mark Lyons","Thank you, Kevin and good morning all.","AIG's adjusted after tax earnings per share $0.56 for the quarter, compared to a negative $0.34 per share in the corresponding quarter of 2018 representing a $0.90 per share improvement. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes AOCI and the DTA increased 1.2% sequentially from second quarter and increased 4.8% relative to year-end 2018.","As Brian mentioned, adjusted return on equity was an annualized 4.1% for the quarter and 8.6% on a nine-month year-to-date annualized basis. Keeping that theme, the individual segments achieved the following annualize nine-months year-to-date returns on attributed equity. General Insurance 9.5%, Life and Retirement 14%, and Legacy of 4.6%.","Net investment income or NII in the third quarter was nearly $3.5 billion on the adjusted pretax income basis at $3.4 billion on a GAAP basis. This was nearly identical to the third quarter of 2018 on both an adjusted and GAAP basis, and sequentially was $260 million lower on an adjusted pretax income basis, and $337 million lower on a GAAP basis.","This quarter investment income from all fixed income securities was virtually identical to that of the third quarter of 2018, whereas returns from the hedge fund and private equity composites is down materially to an annualized 4.6% versus the previous six months year-to-date return of approximately 17.6%.","Turning to General Insurance, Brian and Peter commented on the accident quarter results, so contrastingly the calendar quarter combined ratio of 103.7% reflects 7.5 points of CAT losses as Peter pointed out with Japan representing approximately 60% of the global CAT losses.","The combination of gross line re-underwriting together with our improved reinsurance program has resulted in a material reduction in General Insurance net CAT ratios from 45.5% of premium in the third quarter of 2017 to 22% even in the third quarter of 2018 to the 7.5% this quarter, an 84% reduction over a two year period.","Additionally, the prior period development ratio was negligible for the quarter net of ADC recoveries and ADC amortization. Broadly speaking, calendar quarter underwriting gain was nearly $1.5 billion higher than the third quarter of 2018 with North America contributing $802 million of underwriting gain improvement and the international operations providing $675 million of underwriting gain improvement.","Also both commercial and personal lines improved their accident quarter underwriting margins third quarter over third quarter. It's also informative to comment on the General Insurance performance on a year-to-date nine months basis versus the first nine months of 2018. And on that basis, the year-to-date current accident year combined ratio excluding CATs improved 390 basis points with the loss ratio contribution being a 240 basis point improvement, another 200 basis point improvement from the GOE ratio with a partial offset of a marginal 50 basis point increase through the acquisition ratio.","As respect to volume, year-to-date reported net or premiums are nearly flat with last year on a U.S. dollar basis but the continued success with the improved gross underwriting strategy together with the increasing seeded earned premium from reinsurance previous place, are expected to reduce the fourth quarter net earned premium by approximately 5% sequentially bringing the additional reinsurance purchases.","Now, I want to take the opportunity to reinforce the magnitude of the portfolio reshaping that Peter outlined in his prepared remarks. This level of change is unprecedented in my 42 years in this business, but there are nuances however, that should not go unnoticed.","For example, reducing Lexington causality total limits by an impressive 58% in the quarter, while simultaneously increasing or achieving an average rate increase in excess of 30% is only part of the story. The 62% increase in submission volume signals the igniting of the wholesale distribution channel along with its emphasis on smaller accounts that have more localized exposures and lower capacity needs. The result in spectrum of risk quality has also broadened thereby improving overall rate adequacy as well.","Peter also commented on General Insurance's achieved rate increases for the quarter and helping to put the trajectory of those rate increases in context two lines will be highlighted. First U.S. Directors and Officers liability or D&O combining primary and excess coverages accelerated between the fourth quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2019 inclusive as follows; 9% increase in the fourth quarter of 2018, 11% in the first quarter 2019, 17% in the second quarter of 2019, and then 28% this quarter.","Secondly, Lexington's casualty business rate increases were similarly increasing as follows; 6% in the fourth quarter of 2018 increasing to 8% in the first quarter of 2019, 20% in 20 - in the next quarter and then 31% this quarter.","Furthermore, we were extremely pleased that our leadership position is driving rate extended even further beyond the United States with Canada achieving a 9% weighted overall increase, the U.K. with a 10% increase and continental Europe achieving 6% in the quarter.","Turning to prior year development, although actual versus expected loss emergence was reviewed and incorporated globally, the major areas receiving deeper reserve dives this quarter, were in decreasing order of reserve size, U.S. primary workers compensation, U.K. and Europe casualty lines, U.K. and Europe financial lines, U.S. commercial property, and U.S. financial lines errors and omission for E&O disclosures.","The negligible prior periods development referenced earlier benefited from $58 million of favorable impact from the ADC amortization of the deferred gain and therefore adjusting through this the development was unfavorable by $55 million.","Unpacking this further, the pre-ADC prior period development before any ADC recoveries was favorable by $74 million. This potentially counter-intuitive results stands from the sliding by accident year, $226 million of net favorable development emanated from accident years 2015 and prior at approximately $152 million of net unfavorable development coming from accident year's 2016 through 2018.","The accident year 2015 and prior net favorable development emanated primarily from U.S. worker's compensation, whereas accident year 2016 through 2018 net unfavorable developments stand primarily from U.S. financial E&O lines, the U.K. European casualties in financial lines with a partial offset of a favorable development from European property in specialty and European and Japan personal lines.","Digging further, approximately one-third of this aggregate $152 million of net uncharitable development for accident year 2016 to 2018 stems from an isolated impact of one large long-term agreement affecting all three accident years. Approximately another third was centered in the U.S. architects and engineers book on both the primary and excess basis and we reacted to this due to an increased frequency of moderate severity claims so as to reflect negative trends more quickly than positive trends.","The remaining one-third were collected various U.K. and European impact in casualty and financial lines driven by a smattering of loss claims such as in French and Italian motor business and Irish's employers liability.","Overall though, the pre and post ADC prior period development represents approximately one-tenth of 1% of carried reserves. As for accident year 2019 implications of the net on favorable development, we don't see any carry forward issues with the one long-term agreement, whereas the U.S. architects and engineers was deemed to have a minor roll forward impact, as well as some of the European indication.","As a result, these deep dives, which year-to-date, represents 65% of total loss reserves, saw 0.5 point loss ratio increase to action year 2019, which reflected about 0.2 points for the current action quarter with another 0.3 points of catch up, for the first two quarters of 2019. This was virtually offset by the earned impact of stronger rating versus being achieved on the subject lines of business and anticipated within the original 2019 budgeted loss ratio.","Turning to the Life and Retirement segment, the annualized nine month return on attributed common equity of 14% would be unchanged after adjusting for both the actuarial assumption impact and the removal of a large beneficial IPO gain discussed last quarter, so they virtually negated each other.","It's also informative to note that on a nine-month year-to-date basis, the adjusted after-tax income is nearly identical at $2 billion even compared to 2018. Net spreads on the variable and indexed annuity composite were up marginally from last quarter, and so fixed annuities were virtually flat with the sequential quarter.","Surrender rates on a year-to-date basis were flat for the variable and indexed annuity composites, and slightly better for fixed annuities within Individual Retirement, and 70 basis points better for Group Retirement.","Life Insurance experienced moderately increased mortality relative to the first half of the year, with overall lapse rates fairly consistent with a year ago. And institutional markets had roughly $350 million of pensioners risk transfer deals and also have roughly $375 million in debt issuance as Kevin noted. Lastly, assets under administration increased 1.1% sequentially, and grew 10.4% since year end 2018.","Turning to Legacy. Adjusted pre-tax income was down slightly to $93 million on a sequential basis, but up from $84 million in the third quarter of 2018. Like Life and Retirement, Legacy's results reflected an adverse impact to the annual actuarial assumption update of $30 million. Legacy net investment income on a year-to-date basis was flat with 2018 at $1.8 billion. And the annualized return for the quarter was 4.4%.","As respect tax, the estimated effective tax rate was 22.6% for the year, applicable to adjusted pre-tax income, and was 25.3% for the quarter, inclusive of discrete items. As you know, the effective tax rate is updated each quarter using actual year-to-date results, and then supplemented by the forecast of the remaining quarter.","As always, the tax rate is heavily influenced each quarter by the geographic distribution of income by tax jurisdiction. We did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter, so our Board authorization remains at $2 billion.","And moving to leverage, as compared to year end 2018, our total debt and preferred's to total capital ratio has now improved to 26.1% this quarter, which represents a 320 basis point improvement relative to year end.","We also had a bond trunk redemption of $1 billion in mid-July, that had been prefunded by our March 2019 debt raises. This debt overlapped at the end of the second quarter, plus growth in earnings flow and leverage ratio improvement to 26.1%.","Adjusted book value per share, increased 4.8% from year end 2018 and GAAP book value per share increased 15.1% since year end 2018, benefiting from approximately $7 billion of year-to-date AOCI gains.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Thank you, Mark. So let's go to the questions-and-answers. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Paul Newsome","I guess I'd like to focus in on the underlying combined ratios improvement. And is there any sense of how we can think about the magnitude as we look respectively into - not necessarily next quarter, but prospectively, obviously there was sort of a big bang this year with - from certainly pretty serious changes in reinsurance. But how does that rule forward look into 2020?","Mark Lyons","Well, clearly, you have a lot of things going on at the same time, which I understand makes it somewhat difficult to try to penetrate. You have all the gross changes that Peter has itemized, which are fairly massive.","You have an increasing accelerated rate change on a written basis that will earn in to 2020. And you have some level of loss trend that the industry's discussing, that could perhaps go a little bit the other way.","So without getting into chapter or verse, I think it's fair to say there'll be some level of improvement into 2020. But the magnitude is, let alone the reinsurance purchases, which affect your mix of business, really all need to come to bear. So at this point, I'd say that is good. You should think about improvement, but I'm not prepared to get into magnitude.","Brian Duperreault","Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Brian, there's one thing I would just add to agree with everything Mark just outlined. But the other piece of that, we've been designing reinsurance structures that reflects the portfolio that we have. And so with all the massive changes that we've seen in the property book, I mean, that's what we're assessing over the next, call it, 45-days in terms of putting together some of the reinsurance structures that reflect the risk of the portfolio today. So that that will evolve as we enter into 1-1","Brian Duperreault","Yes, you know, the other thing I'd say, Paul is, I've given you a data point, which is our expectation for return on equity; which by the end of 2021, we want to get over 10%. So, in order for that to happen, clearly the GI, big portion of it has to continue to improve.","And I think that gives some indication of what we think is going to happen. A lot of the work that gets done is in rate, underwriting, et cetera. But it also is the expense levels that GI has, and those expense levels are high. We have to get to those as well.","So, yes, we'd love to be a little clear on that. But all I would say to you is we're committed to continuous improvement in the combined ratios to get it to what should be world class levels. That's going to take some time, but we're committed to doing it over multiple years.","Paul Newsome","I was just going to ask on the Life side, any thoughts or comments on the SEC investigation that's obviously very topical to investors?","Brian Duperreault","I think you can appreciate that we just were not able to go into any detail about ongoing regulatory inquiries beyond what you would read in our 10-Q disclosure. That document is going to be on file soon. So I just want to point you to that for the additional information.","Okay, next question, please?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher","I'll just ask two quick ones. Given the increase in specialty losses in North American commercial this quarter occurred while you've been growing top line pretty well; are you comfortable, you've been growing that line profitably? That's my first question.","And then Peter, your comments on the Hagibis losses for 4Q, I just want to make sure I have the numbers right. I was getting AIG's net retention being a maximum of around $75 million, and Validus max of $155 million. Is that a good way to think about 4Q, based on what you know today?","Brian Duperreault","Yes, let's do it backwards. Let's do the Hagibis first.","Peter Zaffino","Yes, correct. I mean, the maximum \u2013 the first part, I just want to clarify the Validus Re. The first part is that because of the per occurrence and the way the international aggregate and our global aggregate works, that the maximum we would have on Hagibis is $75 million, assuming the forecast we've had for Faxai and others, end up having the gross loss that we anticipate.","So I think that $75 million is a very good number. What I said in terms of the Validus is that their retro would attach with another $155 million, or thereabouts, of retro loss. So you should think about, as it goes above $155 million, we have significant retro protection in place.","Brian Duperreault","Yes, on the specialty, let me start. But I think Peter needs to give you the most clarity on it. The first thing we said was, North American specialty was higher. The International was lower. Net-net was actually pretty good. But it just happens to be the geographies here. And frankly, we managed that business on a global basis. We think of it as a truly global line. You're writing aviation across the world.","I'm not sure it's fair to classify it as something we've been growing dramatically. And maybe Peter, you could give a little bit more color on it.","Peter Zaffino","No, I think you really outlined it well, Brian. I think the only other thing is we've been getting rate in the specialty classes. When we look at global performance in the quarter, we were very pleased. Then when we look at the global performance what we seen here year-to-date, it's been a very strong performer and expected to continue to have, good performance in the future. So like what I said in the prepared remarks is that we're looking at, limit management, our driving rate and how we\u2019re underwriting it. But overall, it's a very good book.","Brian Duperreault","You wanted to add.","Kevin Hogan","Just one thing if I could on Peters, I think good explanation to your question about the maximum. Just keep in mind that the 75 million as he outlined it, in a likelihood sense is more likely than Validus additive number as a collection of seating companies its different attachment points and that\u2019s remains to be seen. I wouldn't take those two as additive necessarily.","Operator","Our next question will come from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Joshua Shanker","Yes thank you for taking my questions. I'll be quick, there is sort of similar on life one P&C. On the P&C, the improvement in commercial is outstanding when you take the medium and large loss in the crop numbers out of it. I'm just wondering with the new orientation of the book, is there seasonality in the accident year loss ratio in North American commercial that 3Q would be better than other quarters?","Brian Duperreault","Well look at accident quarters are so little small that the volatility of a single accident quarter, I think would, exceed any kind of seasonality. I suppose you could come up with some in property where with wind activities and things like you could have a seasonal movement. But I just think you can't look at this an accident quarter as something that's very, very predictable. There's a lot of volatility in a particular quarter that's why we report it because we have to I really point to the nine months as a better indication of movement.","Joshua Shanker","And then I'm life, Kevin said that the mortality in the life business should be viewed in the context that you've had very good mortality for the last couple of years. Does that mean that that life has been over earning just that one sub segment and we should consider that in our forward model?","Brian Duperreault","Well, Kevin?","Kevin Hogan","Yeah thanks, Josh. No, I think that the underlying message is, is that the third quarter was an anomaly. We have seen, our mortality well within pricing, in fact that for eight of the last 10 quarters within pricing. And so the message is, is that we don't see this quarter as a suggestion that our ongoing trend for mortality is likely to change.","Operator","Going next to Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","One quick clarification number and then another one. Peter, I think you said that the events going forward now we're going to have $20 million retention. So either the California fire is going on right now, if they get big or small whatever, it shouldn't be that big of an issue?","Peter Zaffino","What I was referring to was 20 is after Hagibis, that's our maximum retention in our international business.","Brian Meredith","International got you.","Peter Zaffino","Yes, I mean Brian, in terms of North America, we still have significant cover. I mean, we have, you know, some buy downs at are California specific that attach at 50 million. We have a lot of occurrence cover, and we have a lot of aggregate. So I mean, it's really hard to predict in terms of North America with the wildfires, but we have ample protection. And, we'll see how it all evolves.","Brian Meredith","And then my next question is there's been a lot of discussion this quarter about the total inflation environment, particularly with respect to general liability lines. I'm just curious - give your perspective on it as well as what are the severity assumptions that you're assuming in your loss picks and your kind of preserving actions today?","Brian Duperreault","I think Mark that probably more yours.","Mark Lyons","Yes, happy to thanks hello Brian thanks for the questions.","Brian Meredith","Hi.","Mark Lyons","I think as we mentioned last quarter, we have I think, some pretty steep loss trend to our premium assumptions - a lot the lines of business subject to what you\u2019re concerned about. Some of them in the mid to upper single-digit trends already. So that's already been kind of baked in and how we look at things translates into pricing models, so forth and so on. I think on even a broader basis, I mean, our view of those last trends is based upon a lot of our own information.","And how that's moved over time between actually years, and when you kind of think about the overlay of the macroeconomic environment with everything Peter described, about moving up, and attachment points, chopping the limits dramatically. I tend to look upon a portfolio basis of all that reshaping becoming a natural inflation hedge irrespective of whether it\u2019s economic or social. So I think the book characteristics are very protective in that respect.","Brian Duperreault","Yes, I can emphasize enough thanks Mark, about the - whether it's a deductible or it's an attachment point or it's layering done in some of the excess whether it's D&O or other excesses, all of those things are more powerful than the rate in terms of adjusting for inflation. Next question.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","I had a question first just on the lack of buybacks so far this year. So given that you've got the AIG 200 initiative coming up, and I'm assuming you're still interested in acquisition. Should we assume that buybacks are probably going to be fairly light until maybe the leverage ratios improved further. And then I had a question also on just your flows on the Life and Retirement aside, specifically at VALIC they seem pretty weak. And if you could just comment on what's going on there and your outlook?","Brian Duperreault","Okay, Kevin can take the flows. Let me address the buyback so yes we didn't buyback this quarter in my prepared remarks, I emphasized that I want to invest. Well, first of all, we want to do leverage so that's an important thing to keep in mind. And I want to reinvest in the business. Some of that is the AIG 200 still being quantified.","And, the other thing to keep in mind is, when you're in a catastrophe quarter you wouldn't normally buyback anyway. And whether it's the third quarter, the fourth quarter we see in the fourth quarter also produce some catastrophes. I just think it would be prudent not to buyback in any case, but the emphasis is on the other aspects of capital management that I refer to. Kevin wants to talk about the flows.","Kevin Hogan","Yes, sure so thanks, Jimmy. So, the situation at VALIC we have been in a negative flow environment over the last couple of years. I think it's a reflection of the fact that, the new case acquisition for a period of time had tailed off. We've seen an improvement in that recently, but this is a natural effect of the ageing of the portfolio.","The VALIC has been a leading participant in this business for a long time and as either in plan participants rollout of the plan or as people start to utilize the underlying benefits that they have, that certainly is part of what leads to the outflows.","In addition to that, particularly in the healthcare industry, over the last couple of years, there has been a lot of M&A activity. And in cases where plan consolidations occur, in some cases, we're on the winning end of those, in some cases, we're on the losing end of those, and we've reported those sort of large outflows as and when they occur. So, we're continuing to be successful in new plan acquisition.","We continue to see strong periodic deposits and non periodic deposits. And we're likely to continue to see some negative flows in this business because of that natural ageing effect in the portfolio. But I think it's also important to recognize that the dollar value of the flows is uneven if they're higher guaranteed minimum interest rate flows that is less of an impact on future earnings then more recent products.","And the finally that the assets under management of this portfolio, which is the source of earnings in the business have continued to grow along with the equity market. So we're outpacing the negative flows with growth and assets under management.","Operator","We'll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question, you guys provided a lot of good information on the pricing environment, high single to low double-digit increases, getting a lot of rate in your commercial book. I guess I'm trying to think through the rate versus trend if you could help us think where kind of loss trend is on a composite basis. And then how we could think about I think you guys said half a point of rate versus trend this quarter. How we could think about that building up as when it comes into earn over the course of the next year?","Brian Duperreault","Mark?","Mark Lyons","Well, it's a great question. See if I can give you a great answer you bet. So - first is very generic comment when you get a 12%, that's a North American number a 12% weighted average written rate increase. What is your loss trends assumption is four, six or eight? Yeah you're getting expansion, and I'm picking those out just illustratively. So, we don't really get into what our weighted average is across the board it really does vary by quarter with the massive changes Peter described.","But we're viewing that as a beneficial 2020 benefit. And because the way things go in, it's going to be more second half, associated with the rate of increases of the rate changes. So, it's expansion, on a gross basis, but you're looking at our results on a net basis, and that interaction between it, is very difficult to measure and probably from new law and the outside looking in even more so. But I'll just keep it at least that you should expect expansion.","Brian Duperreault","Okay.","Elyse Greenspan","And then my second question on kind of ties back to the comment you made about gross versus net. You guys have been buying a lot of, you know, changing your re-insurance strategies in addition to re-underwriting the whole book. As we think about 2020 - there is still big reinsurance projects or something that you have in mind or should we think about kind of a stable-ish retention year-over-year meaning, we could start seeing on some expansion on the net premiums line?","Brian Duperreault","Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Thanks, Elyse. So a couple things, one is we will be consistent with making sure that we're looking across the portfolio for reduction of volatility and outsize line size. So there could be segments such as financial lines that we'll look at of doing something perhaps as we enter 2020. And then the most important part is looking at the CAT because we've made so much dramatic change in terms of the gross limit and CAT exposed and the strategic projects that we're doing with Lloyd\u2019s.","So again, there's a lot of moving pieces and the reinsurance, and what we decide to put together for 2020 will reflect the portfolio that we have in force. And so there will be some changes. I can't describe those today because we're in the middle of it and, but we'll be very transparent as we hit the sort of fourth quarter call.","Brian Duperreault","Okay, good. So we've just crossed the hour, but I think we should take only one more question and we will close. So operator, take one more - one last question.","Operator","Our final question will come from Erik Bass with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you for fitting me in. Can you provide more details on the drivers of your annual assumption review updates and particularly any changes you made to your long-term interest rate assumption. And if there's any impact on go forward earnings from that?","Brian Duperreault","Well, Mark. No, I mean, Kevin is better at this. Go ahead.","Kevin Hogan","Sure, thanks Erik. First let's talk about what we didn't change. We did not change our long-term interest rate, assumption, our assumption - each product has its own parameters - to derive - the final assumptions. But generally we assume a reversion so they mean over 10 years to 3.5% for the 10 year treasury. Now to the rest of the review as we have a strong diversified portfolio between fixed index and variable annuity as well as a life insurance.","And each of those lines response to economic changes differently and experience emerges separately. So the overriding situation rates are lower this year, which inevitably results in reduced lapse expectations for the fixed annuities where we write up the DAC and that increases sort of APTI. And then in index one of our newer products, we're just seeing some experience emerged and where we updated, lapse rates.","And then in the guaranteed living benefits, as we account for those as an embedded derivative below the line. There were two different effects on that this year. The first was updating, our lapsed model and the second was updating our mortality. And both the fee income as well as the benefit usage goes below the line, which is why you see that economic movement below the line. And then finally, in the life insurance business, there is the effect of interest rates on policyholder behavior, not to similar to fixed annuities.","And we've updated some of our premium projection capability and reinsurance calculations. So, net-net I think that these are largely changes associated with what we've seen happen in the market. No dramatic changes relative to the sizes of our reserves. And as I stated in my prepared remarks, we do not see anything that changes our understanding of the inherent profitability of the business nor we need to change our pricing strategy.","Brian Duperreault","Okay Erik.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks, so this is Ryan Tunis. I just had one follow-up on the P&C side for Peter. In your opening statements you touched a little bit about the opioids and how it's still too early. Just hoping you could maybe expand a little bit on what you guys are looking for there and what we should be thinking about in terms of timing of any potential reserve action or anything along those lines.","Brian Duperreault","Well first of all, I think look at reserve action I'd like Mark to talk about them first.","Mark Lyons","Sure well, interestingly AIG over time has been building up mass tort reserves. Not that we really talk about it, but it's a meaningful number, associated with in our aggregate reserve levels across all accident years. When you get into some of these complex coverage issues that you're talking about, it's really difficult to even talk about it because we don't know the theory of liability that\u2019s going to come down.","You don't know how it's going to be triggered. Therefore you don't know exactly how it may also be play out, but we have a good amount of net mass tort reserves and we still have roughly $6.5 billion in the ADC. So that is still available for this. So we feel - from a reserve standpoint and given what we know today in pretty good shape.","Brian Duperreault","Yes look, I think that's probably is a good conclusion to the opioid question. So let me just thanks Erik let me close by just - and telling everyone how pleased I am with our progress to achieve long-term, sustainable and profitable growth rate AIG. And I want to thank our clients, colleagues, shareholders, industry partners, and other stakeholders for their continued support. Thank you and have a great day.","Operator","This does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation."],"1964":["American International Group (NYSE:AIG) Q3 2013 Earnings Conference Call November  1, 2013  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Liz Werner - IR","Bob Benmosche - President and CEO","David Herzog - CFO","Peter Hancock - CEO of AIG Property Casualty","Jay Wintrob - CEO of AIG Life and Retirement","John Doyle - CEO, AIG Property Casualty","Mary Jane Fortin - CFO, AIG Life and Retirement","[William Dooley - EVP, Investments & Financial Services and CEO, Asset Management]","[Brian Schreiber - EVP, Treasurer]","","Analysts","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Operator","Good day and welcome to this American International Group\u2019s third quarter financial results conference call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, head of investor relations. Please go ahead.","Liz Werner"," ","Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to AIG\u2019s discussion of third quarter 2013 results. Speaking today will be Bob Benmosche, President and CEO; David Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; Peter Hancock, CEO of AIG Property & Casualty; and Jay Wintrob, CEO of AIG Life and Retirement. Other members of senior management are also in the room and will be available for the question and answer period.","Before we get started this morning, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. ","Actual performance and events may differ, possibly materially, from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause this include the factors described in our third quarter and second quarter 2013 Form 10-Qs and our 2012 Form 10-K, under management\u2019s discussion and analysis and under risk factors. AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. ","Today\u2019s presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement, which is available on AIG\u2019s website, www.aig.com.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn our call over to Bob. ","Bob Benmosche ","Thanks, Liza, and good morning everybody. This is another solid quarter for AIG and we clearly have said we\u2019re going to work on making sure that you see consistent and improving earnings of the company over time, and I think you see that in our operating numbers for the insurance companies in particular.","I\u2019d also like to welcome Kevin Hogan. As you know, we have held the position of the consumer group open under Peter Hancock. We have waited for Kevin to return. A 24-year veteran of AIG, having run much of the consumer businesses over that career, and we\u2019re pleased to have him back. So Kevin, welcome back and we\u2019re looking forward to you talking to our investors next quarter on the progress you\u2019re making on the consumer side.","Before we get into the numbers, first about ILFC, we continue to work with the consortium that has been working with us over the almost past year. We still feel that while they\u2019re making slow progress, they are making progress, but this quarter accounting suggests that we have to think about whether this can continue to be a discontinued op and some other accounting rules, so we\u2019re really thinking hard about if we can\u2019t get this transaction closed this quarter, then we may want to commit to a path of IPO for next year and not continue to carry it the way we\u2019re carrying it on our books. So that\u2019s a decision we hope to make in this fourth quarter. However, we still feel that there\u2019s a good chance this transaction can close as is. ","On the aspirational goal comment that I made yesterday, and we want to talk about today, clearly when we did our re-IPO in May of \u201911 there was some serious concern in the marketplace, could AIG survive and continue to grow and thrive? And we put together some key points that we felt we needed to all work towards to give you the confidence that we can, in fact, return to a very strong company.","And we have been committed to those aspirational goals and we are still committed to those aspirational goals, and this entire company is working towards achieving that. However, as we get closer to 2015, we feel that comments going forward are more like guidance rather than the direction we\u2019re all working towards.","And so we are going to stop making comments on that progress towards the aspirational goals we are still, as I said, committed to them, but we\u2019re not sure whether we\u2019ll get them done by 2015. And so once we get closer, and beginning to comment on it, that\u2019s where the theory of guidance comes into play. So I do want you to understand we are committed to them, we\u2019re working hard to get there, and we\u2019ll get there as quickly as we can.","So, let me move to page three and talk about capital management and liquidity. You see our liquidity continues to be strong we\u2019re continuing to focus on our coverage ratio, which is what we said we would do in terms of buying back debt, but we\u2019re also issuing debt where it makes sense for the future, and looking at our future trendlines in terms of when debt is coming due. ","We also declared a dividend for the quarter, so we\u2019re back doing that. And in the middle of the quarter, we were able to start our buyback program after we received authorization to do so. So capital management continues to be strong, and you can see also the dividends flowing into the holding company continue to be strong, as we\u2019ve said before.","On the property-casualty front, continued progress on loss ratio, when you look at the trendline. Remember that\u2019s not a linear line, and it\u2019s a line that will up-down a little bit each quarter. The main thing is to look at its pattern over time and it looks very good and continues to look good. We continue to get rate change in the segments that make sense to get it. Our premiums are actually growing in spite of what\u2019s reported, because primarily it\u2019s reported down because of the currency exchange between the dollar and the yen, where we have such a big business in Japan.","And during the quarter, while we are supposed to have big cats, but sometimes we have little cats, and we also have severe losses and Peter will talk about that. So it was a modest quarter of what I would call catastrophes and severe losses. ","The mortgage guarantee business continues to show its strength after we redesigned its risk selection model. And so today almost 55% of our premiums are in that new model. That is throwing off good, steady earnings on the legacy book. Delinquencies are down slightly. However, keep in mind in almost every 5% of those who are delinquent have been delinquent before and [they cure]. It seems that people just can\u2019t keep up with the time limits of their payments, but so far they\u2019re still keeping up with the mortgage overall.","On life and retirement, a very strong quarter of sales. Jay will talk about that. Good net flows as well. Very good pricing on the products that are being offered out there. And so we\u2019re feeling very confident on that part of the business as well. So, overall, I think all of AIG is performing well, and that gives us the confidence to look forward to the things we have to do as a company.","So let me turn it over to David, who will take you through some more details.","David Herzog ","Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned, our insurance operations delivered a solid operating earnings of about $2.2 billion and we continue to execute on our capital management plans. And our businesses continue to work towards growing their risk-adjusted returns.","As we have said in the past, ILFC remains a noncore asset and is accounted for as held for sale, given our plans to monetize it through a sale or an IPO. We have already written ILFC down to a fair market value and this quarter, when ILFC files their results with the SEC, they will have completed their annual aircraft impairment review. This review resulted in a $1.1 billion impairment from older out of production aircraft, but this impairment has no effect on AIG\u2019s carrying value of ILFC.","Further to Bob\u2019s comments on our work towards our long term goals, we\u2019ve made good progress on deploying capital. We\u2019ve deployed $18 billion in capital through equity buybacks, a combination of equity buybacks, debt capital management, and the reestablishment of our common stock dividend. And importantly, we remain focused on generating deployable capital with distributions from our insurance operating companies of about $4.6 billion year to date through the third quarter.","We\u2019ve made good progress on our expenses, but we\u2019ve still got a lot to do in terms of investing in our infrastructure and our growth opportunities. We\u2019ve also made good progress on improving our ROE and are committed to our strategies. You can see the progress we\u2019ve made in reducing the accident year loss ratio in property-casualty, which has declined roughly 3 points annually over the last couple of years.","Turning to our financials, on slide 4, net income for the quarter was $2.2 billion, and included an after-tax provision $260 million for legacy litigation matters as a result of current period developments. ","We also determined that recently identified tax planning strategies met the prudent and feasible criteria and we released, through income, about $900 million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance relating to our capital loss carry-forwards.","Our capital gains taking program has allowed us to realize roughly 63% of our capital loss carry-forwards. In addition, we also released about $300 million of valuation allowance from foreign DTAs.","Our operating ROE for the quarter was 6.2% and was 7.6% for the first nine months. Since our earnings are tax-affected and we are not paying U.S. taxes given our NOLs, our ROE, excluding the DTA would be about 130 basis points higher.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $62.68, up 8.3% from year-end. Our operating results begin on slide five, and you can see the solid growth in our insurance operating income from a year ago. Strong fundamentals are driving our business. ","Property-casualty comparisons are driven by accident year loss ratio improvements and lower cats, and continued benign prior year reserve development. Mortgage guarantee continues to benefit from improving housing market and risk selection. ","Life and retirement earnings were about $1.14 billion, reflecting continued disciplined spread management and lower alternative investment returns, offset by net favorable DAC unlocking from the annual assumption review. Life and retirement premiums and deposits were very strong, totaling $8.4 billion. Peter and Jay will discuss these results further in their remarks.","The direct investment book in global capital markets earnings collectively were $139 million in the quarter, reflecting continued appreciation in the portfolios, albeit at a somewhat slower pace from the first two quarters of this year.","As we have stated in the past, the direct investment book in global capital markets results are impacted by market pricing due to their mark-to-market accounting treatment and earnings can thus vary significantly from quarter to quarter.","Corporate expenses in the quarter reflect our ongoing infrastructure buildout. A year ago, we benefited from an expense credit relating to the monetization of the U.S. Treasury stake in AIG, so the comparison is not straightforward. Our reported operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 18% and reflected a favorable tax settlement and related discrete items for about $200 million. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate was more like 32%, and we expect our annual effective tax rate to be roughly 31%.","Turning to slide six, you can see the impact of capital management activity year to date. In the quarter, we issued $1 billion of seven-year notes at just shy of 3.4%, and also in the quarter we repurchased or redeemed in the quarter, and thus far in the fourth quarter, $1.1 billion with an average coupon of about 5.7%. In October, we also issued $1 billion of 10-year notes. ","Including the direct investment book, when you take into account our year to date liability management and our full year maturities, we\u2019re on pace to reduce our leverage by over $6.5 billion and reduce our annualized interest expense by roughly $325 million.","On the equity side, we distributed $147 million in dividends to our shareholders and deployed just over $190 million, repurchasing 4 million shares. We will continue to be opportunistic in our debt capital management going forward and we will continue to deploy our existing unused share repurchase authorization in an orderly way. ","As you can see on slide seven our insurance operations remain a source of parental liquidity as they sent $1.9 billion in dividend and distribution to the parent, and as I mentioned earlier, $4.6 billion year to date. ","These dividends, combined with the impact of our capital management activities I mentioned earlier resulted in parent cash and unencumbered securities of $12.7 billion at the end of the quarter. Included in the parent liquidity is $5.9 billion related to the direct investment book, which is allocated for future debt maturities and contingent liquidity stress needs. As we\u2019ve indicated in the past, nearly 80% of the direct investment books liabilities mature by the end of 2018. ","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Peter for comments on property-casualty. ","Peter Hancock ","Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Before I begin my comments on the quarter, let me echo Bob\u2019s comments about Kevin Hogan\u2019s return to AIG. Kevin\u2019s the right leader to grow our market leading global consumer business, including life, and I believe they will prosper under his very strong leadership. ","AIG property-casualty results in the third quarter reflect our consistent focus on underwriting improvements and targeted growth. The current quarter benefited from modest catastrophe losses, our ongoing shift in business mix, increasing pricing, and enhanced risk selection, partially offset by elevated severe losses and alternative investment returns that were lower than our expectation.","As we discuss the quarter\u2019s results today, I\u2019ll highlight our focus on balancing growth, risk, and profitably. Turning to slide eight, net premiums written grew 3% on a normalized basis. This growth is consistent with our expectations for 2013, as we continue to be disciplined in our underwriting and opportunistic in our pricing actions. ","The accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, declined by 3 points from the year ago quarter, reflecting continued progress improving our business mix and risk selection. We\u2019ve said in the past that there would be quarterly volatility in the accident year loss ratio, and this quarter we experienced severe losses of $211 million, which are concentrated in seven property losses largely outside of the United States. We continue to expect improvement in our underwriting results. ","Pre-tax operating income of over $1 billion included lower catastrophe losses of $222 million versus $261 million a year ago. Catastrophe losses related to multiple perils around the world including Colorado flooding, wildfires, and European weather events, but no major U.S. windstorms. Our reserves remain stable and net adverse development was $72 million in the quarter compared to $145 million a year ago, a benign level given our $63-plus billion of reserves overall. ","Turning to slide nine, commercial insurance continued to progress in reshaping its portfolio across products and geographies. Excluding casualty, top line growth was 9%, and as you know, we have been reunderwriting our casualty book, thus overall commercial top line growth was a net 2%.","We grew in risk-adjusted profitably accretive lines - or RAP accretive lines - and regions, including property, financial lines, and specialty, while continuing to reduce exposure to U.S. casualty and certain European liability segments.","Rate increases globally for commercial lines were 3.4% and the North American market continues to lead rate improvement with a 5.5% rate increase in the quarter. U.S. casualty led with a 7.3% rate increase while U.S. financial lines increased 5.8% and U.S. property increased 9%.","We have also used highly differentiated rate to improve our retention strategies, and as a result, retention is higher among our higher quality risks. Our commercial accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was down 4 points from the prior year to 66.2%, despite a $91 million increase in severe losses as we see a sustained benefit from our enhanced risk selection, pricing discipline, exposure management, and claims management. ","The sequential trend was impacted by severe losses, which demonstrates the volatility within any one quarter. Turning to slide 10, consumer net premiums written grew by 4% on a normalized basis. ","Consumer growth was driven by momentum through multiple distribution channels. Accident and health net premiums written reflected declines in the U.S., offset by growth in Asia, while personal lines grew 7% on strong growth in the U.S.","Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by retail warrantee losses in the U.S. We have taken actions to improve rates and amend terms and conditions which should return margins to target levels promptly.","Slide 11 illustrates our investment portfolio mix and quality, while the low interest rate environment and alternative investment returns affected net investment income in the quarter, we continued to be pleased with our overall returns and are satisfied with our strategic asset allocation.","In the quarter, we made a $716 million dividend payment to the parent and expect to contribute our planned dividends for the remainder of the year. As we look at our nine-month performance, our continued focus on balancing growth, risk, and profitability has delivered almost $1 billion of high-quality additional operating profit from a year ago.","Turning to slide 12, our mortgage guarantee business reported operating income of $43 million, which represented another quarter of improving profitability and growth in new business. Mortgage guarantee continued to benefit from its proprietary risk selection model and an improving housing market, with 55% of earned premiums generated by high-quality business written after 2008. Delinquency fell to 6.4% at the end of the quarter for a one-third reduction compared to the third quarter of last year.","UGC continues to be strongly capitalized and holds an investment portfolio that\u2019s highly liquid, with 85% of the investments rated A or better. As a leading U.S. mortgage insurer, UGC currently insures 780,000 mortgages across the country.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jay to discuss life and retirement results. ","Jay Wintrob ","Thank you, Peter, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019m going to begin on slide 13, where you can see that AIG\u2019s life and retirement delivered another strong quarter from both a top line and bottom line perspective. Operating income was $1.1 billion in the third quarter, up 38% from a year ago.","The year over year comparisons were impacted by several items in each period, including a net positive unlocking of assumptions in the current quarter versus a charge in the year ago quarter, primarily related to our [GIC] portfolio and other liabilities.","Even after adjusting for these items, we delivered bottom line growth in the quarter with positive comparisons across the majority of our product segments. Strong fundamental trends, including variable annuity fee income growth and continued enhancement of profitability through active spread management were key contributors to our favorable earnings comparison. ","The third quarter highlighted the strong cash generation capacity of our business. As David mentioned, AIG life and retirement distributed $1.2 billion to the parent this quarter, bring our year to date dividends and loan repayments to more than $3.1 billion. ","This reflects both our solid capital position and the strong profitability of our businesses across multiple product segments. And even after the payment of dividends, we grew shareholder\u2019s equity, ex-OCI, by $2.2 billion since year-end 2012, ending the quarter at $33.8 billion in shareholder\u2019s equity ex-OCI. ","We continue to experience strong sales momentum, and this quarter achieved our highest level of sales in life and retirement\u2019s history. Innovation product design, favorable market conditions, and increasing effectiveness of our distribution strategy all contributed to a 118% increase in retail premiums and deposits from the year ago period.","Sales increased across all retail investment products, from both the prior quarter and the year ago period. Surrender rates also declined sequentially across all product lines. Individual variable annuity and retail mutual fund sales momentum continued, reaching $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion respectively, for the quarter.","We also saw meaningful acceleration in fixed annuity sales, which reached nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter. Growth in institutional premiums and deposits was driven by a midsized pension buyout case and a large group retirement plan takeover in the quarter.","Additionally, we closed on $5.3 billion of stable value wrap business in the quarter, bringing total stable value wrap assets under management to approximately $19 billion at the end of the quarter.","Net interest income declined 5% in the quarter, largely due to lower than expected alternative investment returns and the continuing impact of reinvesting at rates below our current portfolio yields. However, while reinvestment rates were lower than current portfolio yields, they have increased sequentially for the past two quarters. We continue to be opportunistic in our investing strategy and seeing attractive opportunities across various asset classes. ","Operating income benefited from the increase in fee income as well as our ongoing strategy of active crediting rate management to enhance profitability in both our retail and institutional spread businesses. Additionally, a net positive adjustment of $118 million related to the review of gross profit assumptions and an associated positive unlocking, is reflected in operating income for the quarter.","Assets under management increased 10% from a year ago as a result of growth in both the retail and institutional businesses, demonstrating the value of our diversified business model. Sales momentum and strong equity markets contributed to growth in retirement income solutions, retail mutual funds, and group retirement assets. Net flows from these products and our fixed annuities business were $2.5 billion in the quarter, or an increase of nearly $3 billion versus the year ago quarter.","All product lines contributed to this favorable trend, with the majority of the improvement driven by the increase in fixed annuity sales and continued strength of variable annuities and retail mutual fund activity.","In the institutional markets, as previously mentioned, the development of the stable value wrap business added over $19 billion in AUM over the past year, all with contractual fees and investment limitations on the wrapped assets, well within our targeted pricing and terms. ","With the quarter\u2019s rise in interest rates, we did see the unrealized gain position in our invested asset portfolio modestly decline. This decline partially offset a portion of the increases in AUM we experienced from the improved net flows. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the growth in AUM we are seeing across our portfolio of businesses.","Slide 14 highlights the diversity and scale of our businesses. Retail operating income increased 54% versus a year ago, primarily due to growth in fee income on separate accounts, as well as credit and rate actions, which together contributed approximately $100 million of the increase in earnings.","Retail earnings also benefited by $198 million from net positive adjustments related to our review of gross profit assumptions, principally due to differences in our yield and mortality assumptions versus our models. Institutional operating income increased 7% and also benefited from higher fee income on separate accounts and crediting rate actions. ","These positive trends in our institutional business were partially offset in the quarter by lower net investment income as well as an $80 million negative unlocking adjustment related to our group retirement business as a result of lower investment yields previously assumed in our DAC models. The comparison to the year ago period is also affected by a $110 million charge related to our GIC portfolio that we took in the third quarter last year. ","Our sales trends continue to reflect strong consumer demand and increased distribution penetration for our investment products. In fixed annuities, crediting rates have risen in line with market interest rates, making this product more attractive when compared to competing bank and short term fixed income products.","Consequently, we are seeing volume growth while continuing to achieve increases in our target returns. Our $1.2 billion in fixed annuity sales is a high for the past seven quarters, and is consistent with the improvement in the market overall. Fixed annuity sales moderated with the recent pullback in market interest rates in October, but continue to be at levels higher than the first and second quarters of this year. ","We\u2019re pleased with current pricing conditions and look forward to continued fixed annuity sales momentum, assuming a modestly rising interest rate environment. Our retirement income solutions business continues to grow profitability, and we remain comfortable with our sales run rate. ","By offering a product to the consumer that is competitively priced and meets their income and investment needs, with terms and conditions conservatively designed to enable us to manage our risk effectively, we\u2019ve been able to grow our book of individual variable annuity business in a controlled and profitable manner. ","At quarter end, our variable annuity account value, including both fixed and separate accounts, was $35 billion in our retirement income solutions business and over $54 billion in our group retirement business. And as an update to last quarter, of our $25 billion of VAs with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, 63% are in benefits with strong derisking features such as VIC\u2019s indexing of fees, volatility control fund requirements, and required minimum allocations to the fixed account. ","So the combination of a relatively small legacy block and enhanced risk controls in our current features has allowed us to capitalize on opportunities when competitors have chosen or been forced to pull back from the market.","Finally, slide 15 and 16 depict our investment portfolio composition, returns, and yields. Overall base yields declined slightly in the quarter as a result of the impact of investment purchases made yields lower and the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio. At the same time, we\u2019ve actively managed down crediting rates over the course of the year, which is reflected in the lower cost of funds for both our fixed annuities and group retirement businesses.","Overall, spreads expanded for both fixed annuities and group retirement from the prior year. At the end of the third quarter, about three-quarters of our fixed annuities and universal life account values were at minimum guaranteed crediting rates, and we remained focus on managing spreads actively. ","To sum it up, we\u2019re pleased with our solid earnings, strong sales, improving net flows, and level of cash distributions to AIG through the first nine months of the year. We remain focused on executing our growth strategies by leveraging our strong relationships with distribution partners to increase profitable sales of our broad product portfolio across all channels, while continuing to look for opportunities to grow our business where we can achieve the most attractive risk-adjusted returns.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Liz to open things up for Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] We will hear first from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. ","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","I guess one question, Bob, maybe on ILFC I guess. If it\u2019s not resolved immediately, does that imply it could come back on the balance sheet and could that complicate the SIFI review process at all?","Bob Benmosche ","I don\u2019t think it would complicate any SIFI process whatsoever. I think it\u2019s a noncore asset. We would continue to divest and deconsolidate it, and we\u2019ll do that in as rapid a time as it makes sense financially for the company to do it. With what the value of that company is, we know what\u2019s been accomplished, and when you refinance almost $20 billion of debt and do it in a way that gives us a very tight match between cash flows and debt maturities and so on, I think it\u2019s a property that we can divest of. But I\u2019ll have David talk about the actual accounting.","David Herzog","","There are two things, one on the balance sheet held for sale, that\u2019s one \u201caccounting judgment\u201d, and then there\u2019s another judgment we make with respect to discontinued operations. And those are two different judgments. Connected, but they\u2019re two different judgments. And the held for sale treatment is pursuant to our plan. We have a plan, we are pursuing the plan. It includes pursuit of the jumbo transaction, but there are other interested parties as we\u2019ve said, as well as an IPO alternative. So there\u2019s a solid basis for the held for sale.","And then the question is, on discontinued operations, depending upon the ultimate disposition path, we need to make a determination whether or not we will have significant continuing involvement. And that will be a facts and circumstances judgment that we\u2019ll make, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate facts and circumstances. So it\u2019s the held for sale. It\u2019s not going to come back on balance sheet, and so now it\u2019s just a matter of how we go about divesting it.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs ","And on partnership returns, you noted in your disclosure that returns were impacted negatively by equity markets, but I\u2019m trying to remember the lag. I think you\u2019re either three months or one month, depending on the investments. Equity market has been very strong. I was trying to understand, even not relative to last year but just relative to sort of a run rate, the returns [unintelligible]. I\u2019m just trying to get a better understanding for how we should think about that.","David Herzog ","The partnerships are a quarter lag, and hedge funds are a month lag. Private equity partnerships are a quarter lag. Bill, anything to add? ","[William Dooley - EVP, Investments & Financial Services and CEO, Asset Management]","As far as the year\u2019s concerned, first of all these returns aren\u2019t linear each quarter, so they\u2019re a little lumpy. Our goals are somewhere between 8% to 10%. And already this year we\u2019re close to our annual goal on the return on these assets. ","So even though this quarter was lighter than the previous quarters this year, we\u2019re still very confident in it, and as David said, the hedge fund part of the portfolio is in the books already. We just don\u2019t know what it is, because we need the information flows to come in, and the hedge funds have one month to go. ","And there is a correlation between that and the markets, and you guys can judge from where the markets are today how the quarter\u2019s going to line up. But I think that asset class is certainly performing the way we expect it to. ","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs ","If we did that math backwards, though, I guess we wouldn\u2019t quite get there, and I wonder is the 8% to 10% return goal against the backdrop of a market that has risen as much as equity markets have risen this year, and this could be just a wrong assumption, but that that would kind of gradate with the underlying return in the equity markets, not be sort of kind of a fixed return threshold.","[William Dooley - EVP, Investments & Financial Services and CEO, Asset Management]","No, it\u2019s not a fixed return threshold. As I said before, these returns aren\u2019t linear, and the type of funds that we invest in depending on the volatility of the fund, the risk associated with the funds, we try to maintain 8% to 10%. And as I said, we\u2019re in good shape through the first three quarters to attain those goals. ","Operator","And now we\u2019ll take the next question from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein ","A question for Peter if I may. You\u2019ve made a lot of progress in commercial lines in particular. I\u2019m wondering if we could talk a bit more about consumer. When I think about these businesses, most of them are structurally more attractive in your consumer lines - the lower elasticity, lower risk, and not really as broken. ","But you haven\u2019t thus far been getting a ton of margin momentum, and recognize this is partially you\u2019re investing in growth and maybe some other is just getting the team in order. I\u2019m wondering if you can walk us through a bit more granularity what you guys intend to do to actually drive the consumer combined ratio to a low-90s number, and sort of what the realistic trajectory of that would be to play through. ","Peter Hancock ","I think that the first thing to remind everybody is how much of our consumer business is in Japan. And so what\u2019s going on there is a major merger integration effort between Fuji Fire Marine, AIU, and an integration of many capabilities which will improve the expense picture on by far the largest consumer operation we have. ","So that is certainly progressing well, and we expect that to improve the margins in what is a large and stable book of business. But it\u2019s not growing that fast obviously, with the demographics in Japan as they are. The one exception there is the excitement we have about Fuji Life, and so we see good growth there as we rebuild the life business, taking advantage of the aging population in Japan. ","The other dimension is the investments that we\u2019re making in building a firm foundation for scalable growth in emerging countries. And I\u2019d say that there are three large emerging countries which we\u2019ve been investing quite heavily in over the last year, where we have taken perhaps a little longer than expected to build the platform that we wanted and get the sales kicked off at the rate that we\u2019d like, but we have still a high degree of confidence that those platforms will performance fairly promptly. So slightly delayed startup in three large emerging markets, which we\u2019re investing in.","And then the USA&H story, somewhat negative for a variety of reasons that are kind of one-offs, but we\u2019ve got other quite good growth momentum on the consumer side, especially on the extended warranty side despite the short term profitability issue that we talk about in this quarter on one particular extended warranty program.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs ","Bob, if I could switch to sort of a bigger topic, we all get that you don\u2019t want to provide guidance, and the aspirational goals were stretch goals back in 2010, but you\u2019ve since made a lot of progress against them. And so when you say - I think I\u2019m getting this right - that we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ll get them done by 2015, investors just wonder what to expect. ","And recognizing you\u2019re not going to give guidance, there were, I think, fundamentally three big pieces to the aspirational goals: driving ROE 10%, returning capital of $25 billion to $30 billion, and investing to get some growth and rebuild the franchise. I\u2019m wondering if you could at least give us some directional sort of color on which of these big pieces you think may be at risk.","Bob Benmosche ","First of all, you\u2019re assuming it\u2019s at risk. What we\u2019re saying is that once we get closer to the time we need to give you maybe a range around it. We\u2019ve discussed a whole lot of things one would have to do once we get closer. Because look, if I could tell you exactly what I could be, at exactly a point in time, I think I would have problems with some of the people in Washington in the enforcement group, because you can\u2019t run this business with that degree of accuracy, and you all know that. ","What\u2019s important is we look at how we\u2019re running it, what are our focuses on different things within this company, and we have said we\u2019re focusing on expense and we\u2019ve been investing a lot of money to get our expenses down, so we had to spend to eventually see the savings. ","We\u2019ve talked about our investment portfolios and the things we\u2019re doing there. We talked about making sure we understand our cost of capital for the businesses and the risks we\u2019re taking. And we want to earn more than our cost of capital, especially in the property casualty business, [with its big focus], so that we are capital light on the things that make the most sense for us. ","So we\u2019re continuing to do all of that. And it all comes together, including capital management. So it\u2019s not a question of anything other than, as you go through all of these things, when we get closer to 2015 you\u2019re going to ask us to be a little bit more specific and instead of an aspiration it becomes we will achieve something around this in this period of time. And that would be guidance, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re concerned about. ","So we\u2019re focusing on all of it, and we\u2019re proud of the progress we\u2019ve made, and we\u2019re putting a lot of energy into achieving all of it by 2015. But what I\u2019m saying to you today, well in advance of that time, is we may not get there by 2015. It might be a little later. ","And that\u2019s about all the comment we can make on the whole subject, but I think you need to look at our progress every quarter, look at the trends every quarter, and I think you\u2019ll see a continually improving organization here. ","Operator","And now we\u2019ll hear from Adam Klauber, William Blair. Go ahead please. ","Adam Klauber - William Blair","The ramp up in some of the life and retirement products is very good to see. I guess two questions. Do you think it\u2019s the earlier part of the ramp up? In other words, can it continue to accelerate? That\u2019s number one. And number two, how should we think of the returns of that business today, and particularly the fixed annuity business today compared to what they\u2019ve been more recently and historically.","Jay Wintrob ","First of all, in terms of the ramp up, I think that the potential demand for the products we\u2019re selling, based on demographics, greater concern about longevity risk, outliving your savings and such, is definitely there, as well as the continued movement of money from defined benefit pension plans into defined contribution plans and ultimately to IRA accounts, where the money moves from, in effect, institutional management to retail management and more personal control. ","I think that primary driver though, of the kind of quarter to quarter growth, is going to have a lot to do with market conditions. The equity markets, certainly rates, the shape of the yield curve, and such. But I think the underlying demographics and the basic demand growth will continue to be there, but market conditions will have an overlay that\u2019s going to play a big role in quarter to quarter results.","You saw, for example, this quarter a very significant increase in fixed annuity sales based on rate movements. And we generally follow the 10-year Treasury, assuming credit spreads are the same quarter to quarter. And you saw the kind of movement not only for our company, where we\u2019re able to take advantage of that, but really for the industry, as I mentioned in my comments.","At the same time, the pricing continues very strong. We continue to target pricing for fixed annuities in the roughly 11-12.5% return on equity or internal IRR basis. And we continue to get that pricing [unintelligible] at the time we\u2019re writing that business. So pricing is actually very good in this environment. Market conditions will depend a lot on rates and spreads, and I think we\u2019ll be ready to go with our low-cost operating platform and our very strong distribution organization to take advantage of that or any other product segment that grows going forward."," ","Bob Benmosche ","To add what Jay just said, it\u2019s a fact that people wonder about the businesses, keeping them together, and the diversity of risk and the diversity of dividends to the holding company and so on. But a startling number that just keeps hitting me is that over the next 35 years, there will be four times the number of people over 65 than there are today. ","So forget about percentages and numbers and all the other stuff. That is four times the number of people in that age code category. And that is the area where we do a lot of business, where we deal with protection and life and other products. So we see the opportunity not only in the U.S. market, but you have those statistics even more exaggerated in China. So this is a great growth business over time. So it\u2019s not only quarter to quarter in the markets, but it\u2019s also about client need. ","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley. ","Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Just wanted to get a little more detail on the tax rate. The tax rate we were expecting was in the low 30s. You put up an 18%. You mentioned the credits in the commentary. Can you go into kind of the timing around that, what they were, and whether there\u2019s any more like that coming forward?","David Herzog ","Again, we\u2019ll address discrete items in any particular quarter as they occur. And we\u2019ll give you plenty of disclosure around that. And so the 31% rate that we expect going forward is really a reflection of the ongoing operations. As you know, over the last couple of years we\u2019ve done some portfolio rebalancing in property casualty to reduce our holdings of tax-exempt securities. So that certainly affected the effective tax rate. So again, I\u2019m not going to give you any specific guidance as to what to expect. Again, the 31% is really sort of the normalized rate, and then we\u2019ll break out the discrete items that we do. And then we\u2019ll let you know when those occur.","Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley ","What I\u2019m wrestling with, and I know you mentioned it earlier, is just the difference between the definition of aspirational and guidance. To me they\u2019re the same thing. And in a quarter where the pre-tax miss was pretty sizable, why choose now to suspend guidance, effectively, going forward? And I appreciate you guys are aiming for 10%-plus, but even then I thought that the plus would have covered you. You don\u2019t have to give decimal point accuracy, so to speak. I just don\u2019t know why right now you would suspending guidance.","Bob Benmosche ","It\u2019s very simple. We\u2019re getting too close. You want to wait until next quarter, or the quarter after? Sooner or later we\u2019re going to face this issue, and so the feeling is that guidance is something that I believe, from what we\u2019ve looked at, we have a likely chance to achieve. ","Aspirational says we look at this company and all the things we need to do over a five-year period, we believe that we could get to this kind of target. And so the word aspirational, and why we used it, was to say to you that we don\u2019t have a plan specifically that says you can get there. ","We haven\u2019t gone through the details, but we knew that directionally, if we do a whole lot of things and it began to take hold, we could get into that ballpark. And so we\u2019re going to get through a journey, we\u2019re going to get to southern New York. Now you\u2019re going to ask me, well, are you going to make it to Westchester, or are you going to make it to Putnam, or are you going to make it to Manhattan? That\u2019s guidance. ","Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley ","Lastly, just for Peter maybe, on the pricing outlook in P&C, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve given a lot of color on where you think it could be, but decelerating a little on the margin. It\u2019s great to see the gains. But how do you think this thing plays out going forward, from a pricing perspective on the commercial side?","John Doyle ","You know, rates were up for us in the U.S., where rate is needed the most, by 5.5% in the quarter. A little down from the second quarter. Casualty rates in the U.S. remain fairly strong. The property market seems to have gotten a bit more competitive. We\u2019ve been observing that over the course of the last several months. But I expect the same factors driving pricing improvement in casualty in the U.S. to continue in the near future.","Bob Benmosche ","John\u2019s answer is very correct, but underneath that answer is something that many of you would not know, and that is the amount of analytics going into understanding what is our account quality index, thinking about the quality of clients, the quality of the risk and so on, down the line, to make sure we\u2019ve segmented that in a much more refined way. ","We\u2019re now looking at brokers and what the broker quality index is. So we know the kind of business that is being brought to us by brokers, some of them taking a shot in the dark and hoping someone at AIG will write it versus somebody who really prides their business with AIG and tends to bring us very good risk and very well field underwritten. ","And so when we talk about price increases, we actually look at it by these segments, and we\u2019re going to get more refined by these segments. So we have very good retention in our best clients and very little rate increase, but we\u2019re getting pretty good retention in some of our lower quality clients, where you need the rate because of the performance of those accounts. ","And so it isn\u2019t just following the market anymore. We\u2019re becoming much more scientific, and where in our client base or brokerage brought business do we want to begin to add rate? And that would be independent of what\u2019s actually happened in the market. ","So it\u2019s not just the old everybody\u2019s up and down by the tide. So I\u2019m very impressed and very optimistic about what John\u2019s been doing in particular in the whole commercial business with Peter. So that\u2019s a different level of detail behind that answer. ","John Doyle ","I would add that beyond the tools that we\u2019re building to help make better judgments at the underwriters desk, we\u2019ve made big investments in the claims side as well, in people and process and in technology, that are enabling better results for us to reduce the cost of risk once the claim hits. And so that\u2019s an important part of the improvement as well.","Operator","Now we\u2019ll take a question from Joshua Shanker, Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ","My first question is for Jay. In terms of the amortization of the DAC on the life business, interest rates were kind of stable during the quarter, but you got a benefit there. Can you talk a little bit about what went into this quarter\u2019s change in the DAC and what we might see happen in future quarters if rates go up, and when that actually hits the P&L?","Mary Jane Fortin","In terms of the DAC, you\u2019re results. In terms of the fixed annuity business what we saw there were really two things: the yields on the portfolio supporting the book were better than what we had modeled, as well as Jay has talked to you about the crediting rate actions we\u2019ve been taking and really managing the overall spreads. That benefited us in terms of the actual spreads coming through versus what we had assumed in our model. ","Our model, if you go back a year ago, still is anticipating continued pressure around yield and spreads, and we\u2019ve been able to really manage through that by both the investing side and actively managing the crediting rates. ","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ","This may sound somewhat na\u00efve, but I would have probably thought that would happen more likely in Q2, and we didn\u2019t see it, then, in Q3.","Mary Jane Fortin","Well, we do our annual review of the critical assumptions on an annual basis, and so we are tracking our actual experience quarterly, but we do do a detailed review. And we also want to make sure we see the patterns emerge over time. And so this was, really since last year, the first time that we did a detailed review of where the yields and spreads were coming in, and therefore adjusted in the quarter, across the whole life and retirement portfolio.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ","And on share repurchases, what told you you had about capacity for $200 million of repurchasing during the quarter? And I\u2019m wondering if you were blacked out for any periods in the quarter otherwise.","[Brian Schreiber - EVP, Treasurer]","We received authorization midway through the quarter in August, so we didn\u2019t have a full quarter, and we also have a blackout date that started on September 15. So we were really only in the market for 27 days. We didn\u2019t have $200 million of capacity. That\u2019s how much we did. But we wanted to be just disciplined in how we were deploying the authorization.","David Herzog ","Our capacity was $1 billion. We have the authorization for a billion. We used $190 million, and so as I said in my remarks, we\u2019ll remain committed and disciplined around deploying that capital.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ","And is it reasonable to say you get about 25 days a quarter that you can be in the market?","David Herzog ","Yes, but again, it depends on when we get the authorization, where in the quarter it is.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ","That\u2019s true. This quarter you already have the authorization, so you have more days?","David Herzog ","Right.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll hear from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Two questions on the property casualty side. The first is you had some adverse development of primary casualty business, more so than we\u2019ve seen in the past. And I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s going on there, what drove that. And then secondly, just explain what happened in the retail warranty business, what drove those losses? It wasn\u2019t quite clear from the press release.","John Doyle ","The adverse [POID] we experienced was related primarily to construction defect. And we saw some increased frequency. We accelerated a review that had been scheduled for a later period, and really impact of prior major cat events, as well as the expansion into some new states that historically hadn\u2019t been troubling in this regard. We had historically tracked a couple of different states where [CD] had been a challenge for us. ","We saw, again, some increased frequency and some new states accelerated around the review. And I would also say, beyond the impact of major cats in the United States, also the impact of the credit crisis. Now we\u2019re observing a tail that\u2019s longer than what we had expected, and the issue moving into some other states. So again we accelerated review and dealt with it in the quarter. ","Peter Hancock ","On the warranty business, this is working with one or two large retailers, and in particular one. So this is a program where the profits and the risks are shared with the retailer. And there is a mechanism to true up through rate change historical profitability. So while in any given quarter you can have fluctuations, which we\u2019ve had, we have confidence that we can recoup those adverse results within a very prompt period. So it really is a partnership with the retailer, and it\u2019s not as much risk transfer as the numbers would suggest.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","What kind of underlying products are we talking about? Is it white goods, computers?","Peter Hancock ","All of the above. But in particular mobile phones in this quarter.","Liz Werner","Operator, I think we\u2019re at the top of the hour, and so I know we have a lot of questions in the queue.

AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Additionally, some remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement, and slide presentation, all of which are available on our website, www.aig.com.","This morning, you'll hear prepared remarks from our CEO, Brian Duperreault; our COO and CEO of General Insurance, Peter Zaffino; our CEO of Life and Retirement, Kevin Hogan; and our CFO, Mark Lyons. During the Q&A, we ask that you limit your questions to one and with one follow-up.","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. As we continue to position AIG for long-term sustainable and profitable growth, disciplined execution of our strategy is reflected on our strong performance in the second quarter and first half of 2019.","Adjusted return on common equity for the second quarter was 10.4% and 11% year-to-date. Adjusted after-tax income was $1.3 billion or $1.43 a share for the second quarter and $2.7 billion or $3.01 per share year-to-date, nearly $1 per share improvement over the first half of 2018.","Throughout the first half of 2019, we remained focused on the foundation work that continues across AIG, particularly in General Insurance, which delivered a second consecutive quarter of profitability with an accident quarter combined ratio including actual CATs of 98.7% or 96.1% as adjusted, Calendar quarter combined ratio was 97.8%.","The turnaround in General Insurance which has been led by Peter Zaffino and his team is impressive. AIG is taking a leadership position in its approach to disciplined underwriting and innovative reinsurance strategies and we have strong momentum heading into the second half of 2019. I can confirm that we expect to achieve underwriting profitability for the entire year. Peter will provide more detail in his remarks on the significant progress being made in General Insurance.","With respect to premium rate trends, I want to follow up on my comments from the first quarter. Rate increases accelerated in the second quarter, in some cases materially. I've seen a number of market cycles and each one has different characteristics. I would describe this market as one where there was more underwriting discipline and rigor around the deployment of capacity, rather than a major decline in capacity.","That discipline seems to be playing out through the pricing models and underwriting processes that are recognizing increased loss cost frequency toward environment and other emerging risks. To me, that means the turn is based on facts, rather than an emotion, and is therefore more sustainable.","With respect to AIG, we are seeing strong rate improvement across most of our global portfolio. In addition to industry dynamics, rate increases reflect our comprehensive and disciplined strategy to reposition our businesses as market leaders by refining our risk appetite, significantly reducing gross and that limits [ph] tightening terms and conditions and reducing capacity in certain areas. Peter and Mark will provide more details on rate in their comments.","Life and Retirement also had a solid quarter, posting a 17.3% adjusted return on common equity due to continued discipline and execution of its strategy as well as strong private equity returns and favorable market performance. Equity markets remain highly volatile and unpredictable and as a result, we are not changing our 2019 guidance for Life and Retirement of full year adjusted return on common equity in the low to mid-teens. Kevin will provide more additional information on Life and Retirement.","Net investment income was $3.7 billion in the second quarter, reflecting strong performance in the equity markets and tightening spreads in the credit markets, as well as a significant gain on private equity investments. Mark will provide more detail on our overall financial results later in the call.","Since I arrived at AIG, we have focused on addressing several critical areas, including refining our approach to underwriting, reducing our risk profile, overhauling our reinsurance strategy to reduce volatility, making our General Insurance business profitable and remediating challenged legacy businesses. We have also been working on AIGs strategic positioning in the global insurance marketplace and longer-term priorities that define who we are as a Company and how we create value for our stakeholders.","Given the progress we have made, we are now placing greater focus on a multiyear enterprise wide program, which we have branded AIG 200. I've asked Peter in his capacity as Global Chief Operating Officer to lead this effort across all of AIG. AIG 200 will focus on opportunities to improve our core processes and infrastructure. If we were to become a top performing company, we must make transformative and sustainable improvements that will require investment.","This work ultimately will lead to a reduced expense base and improved experience for our clients, policyholders and colleagues. Like the foundational work that started in late 2017, we are not taking shortcuts with this program, AIG 200 is critical to our long-term success and we will report on our progress on future calls.","With respect to capital management, you will hear from Mark that we did not buy back shares in the second quarter. Our capital plan for the remainder of the year remains focused on reinvesting in our business and reducing our leverage.","With that, I'll turn it over to Peter.","Peter Zaffino","Thank you, Brian. Good morning everyone Today, I will provide an overview of several highlights in the second quarter. I will provide detail on the financial performance of General Insurance, highlight rate actions which Brian mentioned, provide insight into the progress we're making in our businesses, and the tangible impact of focused and disciplined actions are having that changed the composition of our portfolio. I'll briefly update you on Validus, summarize progress on our reinsurance program, and lastly share some observations as we look towards the second half of 2019.","We continue to execute on focused actions across General Insurance that will position our businesses to be leaders in their respective markets. These actions include enhancing the quality of our underwriting and desired risk appetite, evolving our reinsurance program to reflect our improving book of business, and exercising expense discipline in order to provide bandwidth for future investment.","We are operationalizing these actions throughout General Insurance by embedding more disciplined end-to-end business processes. I'm very pleased with the demonstrable impact these actions are having on our business results, as evidenced in our improved financial performance in the second quarter, and the first half of the year. I believe this is not only sustainable, but will improve over time.","Building on our momentum from the first quarter, we achieved an accident quarter combined ratio including actual CATs of 98.7%, an improvement of 460 basis points year-over-year, and an accident quarter combined ratio as adjusted of 96.1%, an improvement of 490 basis points year-over-year. The calendar quarter combined ratio was 97.8%, an improvement of 350 basis points year-over-year.","The accident quarter loss ratio, excluding CATs for the second quarter was 61.3%, a 410-basis point improvement year-over-year, and a 50-basis point sequential improvement from the first quarter 2019. This quarter-over-quarter improvement was a result of the change in business mix and continued reduction in lines where we are not achieving our targeted returns, improved areas of performance, reduced volatility stemming from our underwriting actions and comprehensive and vastly improved property reinsurance program, and improved loss experience in certain areas such as Japan Personal Auto and Commercial Properties.","In the second quarter, we experienced net CAT losses of $174 million, which were primarily driven by storms and tornadoes in North America. Overall, our aggregation strategy along with reinsurance continued to reduce our gross and net exposures on a worldwide basis.","Net premiums written for the second quarter were $6.6 billion, down approximately 3.7% year-over-year on an FX constant basis. Our net premiums written excluding Validus and Glatfelter has declined almost 15% year-over-year, we've reduced our exposures by greater magnitude and the re-underwriting of our portfolio improved the quality and rate adequacy of our overall book of business.","Our focused discipline will continue to improve our combined ratio, which I will expand upon later. The second quarter expense ratio of 34.8% represents an 80-basis point improvement year-over-year, and a 50-basis point increase from the first quarter of 2019. This 50-basis point increase is largely due to the second quarter acquisition expense ratio of 22.2%, which reflects an increase of a 40-basis point sequentially, and 110 basis points higher year-over-year.","A significant amount of the year-over-year increase is attributable to a one-time favorable premium adjustment in the second quarter of 2018. The acquisition ratio in the second quarter of 2019 was impacted by improved performance in the travel and warranty businesses, which have lower loss ratios, but higher commissions. The general operating expense ratio was 12.6% in the second quarter, in line with our run rate and expectations, and a 190-basis point improvement from the prior-year.","Excluding the impact of acquisitions, general operating expenses on an FX constant basis declined by approximately 18% year-over-year. We continue to execute on our strategy to optimize our portfolio by concentrating on a risk framework and risk appetite that identify areas for growth and remediation and leverage AIGs unique market position.","Moving on to rate in the second quarter, as Brian noted, we continue to see meaningful rate increases across our portfolio on average excluding Validus and Glatfelter in the high single-digits compared to a mid-single digit improvement in the first quarter of the year.","In North America, excluding Validus and Glatfelter, and in the UK, we obtained high single-digit increases. The strong rate increases in the US were mostly in E&S casualty, commercial property, both retail and wholesale, D&O, energy and excess casualty. In the UK, the accelerated rate increases were led by Marine and Energy and Financial Lines. In our reinsurance business, we obtained mid-single digit rate improvement on a weighted average basis, which I will provide more detail on later.","Let me share some specific business highlights from the second quarter where we made material progress. Lexington has undergone extensive repositioning with revised risk appetite and distribution strategy that has resulted in vastly improved submission flow and tighter limits. As a result, we achieved strong rate improvement in the mid-to-high teens in property and casualty.","Property submissions were up over 35% year-over-year, and in casualty, the increase was almost 75% since the second quarter of 2018. We strategically targeted reductions in most of our volatile accounts, resulting in a reduction of property limits of over 55% and of casualty limits of over 50%.","I'm very pleased with our leadership team, these outcomes reflect the extent of the re-calibration of the business, the pace of change and progress in becoming a leader in the E&S market space.","In Financial Lines, we're demonstrating leadership as we aggressively execute on our plan to improve the composition of our portfolio, reduce our gross limits for lead layers and prudently deploy our capital in those lead layers. Rate continues to be very strong and ahead of rising loss costs, which Mark will expand on in his remarks. For example, in primary corporate D&O, we saw a rate increase of over 30% with the policy count retention of approximately 90%.","In parallel, we reduced primary commercial D&O aggregate limits by approximately 30% and primary commercial D&O policies with limits greater than $10 million in lead layers by over 45%. In our European Financial Lines portfolio, we reduced public US D&O limits by over 50% with premium increases in the high teens. And in the UK, we reduced public US D&O limits by over 20% in the quarter, and increased premiums by over 20% from the prior year.","In North America Property, we continue to execute on our aggressive actions to improve our overall portfolio. This entailed reducing total gross limits by over 60%, increasing average deductible by over 60%, and achieving rate increases of over 20% on a written basis in the quarter.","As Brian noted, there has been industry commentary about the evolving tort environment and the expanding impact of social issues and social inflation. These are not new issues and we've been following legislative in case for [ph] developments for some time now, including as they relate to pose and adopt [indiscernible]","We're in the business of managing risk and paying claims. AIG is particularly adept at handling very complex claims. Our experienced underwriting actuarial claims professionals have been working together to understand these developments and to appropriately address these emerging complicated and sensitive risks as they mature.","Turning to Validus Re, this business had a very good quarter. The main areas of focus were the April 1 Japan renewals and June 1 Florida renewals. Demand was generally flat but capacity tightened due to a combination of factors such as prior hurricane loss development and reduced capacity from the ILS and retrocessional markets resulting in rate increases. Validus continued to show discipline in shaping the portfolio.","For example, as I mentioned last quarter, in connection with Japan renewals on April 1, the average rate change in the portfolio was 10%, with rate increases ranging from 15% to 25% for loss impacted CAT layers and flat to 7% for layers not impacted by CATs. For the Florida renewals, our portfolio aggregate reduced by 17% year-over-year, while risk adjusted rates increased by 9% representing a net 3% premium increase relative to expiring Florida renewal [ph]","A quick update on our reinsurance program, reinsurance plays a critical role in our overall strategy to manage volatility and we continue to be very pleased with our ongoing accomplishments and strategic position. When combined the advancements we're making on underwriting discipline and the composition of our core portfolio, we see strong progress towards delivering a sustainable, profitable and less volatile underwriting result.","In the second quarter, just two additional property treaties that were placed below our CAT program to address specific areas of concentration and repurchasing aggregate retro public for Validus Re. The more meaningful of the two property treaties is a single limit per current cap cover for the Caribbean NOI [ph] The attachment points are $200 million and $100 million for the Caribbean NOI respectively with a single shared limit of $325 million.","We also continue to manage our exposures for large individual property risks. In addition to gross limits management, we purchased facultative automatic reinsurance on some of the higher asset risks in the portfolio, providing additional volatility containment.","As we move into the second half of 2019 and into peak hurricane season, we now have comprehensive currency and aggregate protection in place and we will continue to further enhance, refine and evolve our reinsurance program as our gross underwriting improvement begins to earn into future quarters. I look forward to updating you on our next call.","Turning to talent in General Insurance, we continue to focus on building and retaining a best-in-class team, we strengthened our underwriting leadership team in the second quarter, added new talent to our reinsurance organization, expanded our operational capabilities that linked to the rest of the organization, and overall, continue to build our bench.","Additionally in personal insurance, we added a seasoned veteran to lead high network as we continue to refine our strategy to reformulate that business. I'm extremely proud of our team globally. The performance of General Insurance in the first half of 2019 reflects the dedication, commitment, capabilities and extraordinary efforts of our colleagues across the globe.","Lastly, I want to comment on AIG 200, which Brian mentioned in his opening remarks. As we look to the second half of 2019 and beyond, it's critical that we focus on our infrastructure and businesses across all of AIG and invest to modernize and digitize our workflows, as well as create a more unified AIG.","As we did with General Insurance over the last 18 months, we are filling critical roles in adding a number of seasoned executives to the corporate center with proven track records of achieving excellent results during transformation.","In my capacity as AIGs Global Chief Operating Officer, I look forward to meeting this next phase of work that will accelerate the progress we're making towards achieving AIGs long-term strategic, operational, financial goals and enable us to become a top-performing company.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Hogan","Thank you, Peter, and good morning everyone. Life and Retirement recorded adjusted pretax income of just over $1 billion for the quarter and adjusted return on common equity of 17.3%. Adjusted pretax income increased by $87 million from the prior year quarter. A primary driver of this increase was a one-time gain of $138 million for a private equity holding following an initial public offering.","Our earnings also benefited from the broader capital markets environment. Net investment income reflected both higher returns on fair value option securities of $48 million and higher call and tender income of $22 million due to significantly lower interest rates. Additionally, favorable mortality drove an increase of $35 million. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an allowance for reinsurance recoveries of $38 million in our Life Insurance business and expected spread compression in our Retirement businesses.","New money rates are below portfolio yields across our retirement portfolios resulting in reduced but still attractive spreads in many products. The prior year comparison for adjusted pretax income also reflects net positive actuarial adjustments of $51 million in the second quarter of 2018, a benefit of $98 million in life insurance and an unfavorable adjustment of $47 million in individual retirement.","Our market assumptions for the full-year have not changed and recent market volatility is a reminder that the second half may be much more challenging from a capital markets perspective. While our first half results provide some balance for the full year outlook, declining equity markets would, among other things, negatively impact fees as well as deferred acquisition cost amortization. Further with recent large declines in US interest rates, our current expectation is that base net spreads will decline to the higher end of our approximately zero to 2 basis points range per quarter.","Finally, declining interest rates would typically result in higher returns on fair value option securities, although the overall impact on net investment income would depend on the timing and degree of interest rate movement. From a statutory perspective, we expect to continue to generate solid earnings and for our strong year-end risk-based capital levels to improve over year-end 2018.","Separately, we are pleased the FASB appears poised to extend the required date for adoption of the new accounting for long duration contracts until 2022. Nevertheless, we have a large and growing effort underway to understand and operationalize all the changes which are very broad reaching. It's too early to comment on impact, but we take comfort in the quality, underlying economics and cash flows of our in-force and the new business we write.","Our results for the first half of the year reflect strong growth from our ongoing strategy to leverage our broad product portfolio and diversified distribution network to satisfy customer needs. With strong market demand and favorable pricing conditions during most of this period, we significantly increased sales in fixed and indexed annuities.","We expect lower levels of sales for certain product lines in the second half due to lower interest rates and the uncertain environment. We will remain disciplined with respect to product pricing and features and continue to leverage our broad capabilities to deploy capital to available attractive new business opportunities.","I will now talk briefly about the results for the quarter for each of the businesses. For Individual Retirement, premiums and deposits grew by 13%. We produced strong sales in fixed and indexed annuities during the quarter, although fixed annuity sales declined from first quarter levels.","We do expect lower sales of fixed annuities in the prevailing interest rate environment. We achieved positive net flows, excluding Retail Mutual Funds, which is a comparatively small part of our earnings.","Total assets under management increased driven by strong equity markets performance and growth of annuity deposits during the first half of the year. For Group Retirement, premiums and deposits were lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to two large group acquisitions in the second quarter last year. In plan contributions and individual product sales continued to be strong.","Net flows improved from the prior year quarter due to lower group surrender activity, but still remained negative. Although the timing of group acquisitions and individual contributions will result in quarter-over-quarter variances in deposits, we expect surrenders and other withdrawals to continue to drive negative net flows. It is also important to note that the financial impact of outflows will vary based on product characteristics.","For example, the impact will be lower if the outflow is from a higher guaranteed minimum interest rate annuity policy or from a lower margin group mutual fund offering. Despite facing negative flows for a period of time, we've continued to produce solid earnings for this business as assets under administration have continued to grow.","For our Life Insurance business, total premiums and deposits increased for the quarter driven by sales growth in our UK individual protection product line as well as the addition of group protection from the acquisition of Ellipse. Our US life sales declined as we deemphasized guaranteed universal life sales in the current interest rate environment and indexed universal life sales remain under pressure.","Overall, mortality experience was favorable to pricing expectations and the prior year quarter. We have been pleased with our mortality results over the last several quarters while recognizing that there will always be some volatility quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted pre-tax income decreased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the favorable actuarial adjustments in the second quarter of 2018 and the current quarter reinsurance recoveries allowance that I mentioned earlier.","Institutional Markets' premiums and deposits were lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to large GIC issuance in the second quarter of last year. We continue our opportunistic strategy in the pension risk transfer business and the market pipeline over the next 12 to 18 months remains robust. Overall, our Institutional Markets business continues to be well positioned to capitalize on available growth across its product lines while remaining focused on achieving targeted returns.","Lastly, I wanted to briefly comment on AIG 200 which includes Life and Retirement. We plan to focus on investments that will accelerate our efforts to enhance the customer and distributor experience across our businesses, complete the work needed to fully focus our Life Insurance business on the core portfolio, further prepare for the new standards of care in advisory expectations and position our businesses for future product and distribution channel expansion, while improving overall efficiency.","To close, we remain committed to our ongoing strategy to leverage our broad product expertise and distribution footprint to deploy capital to the most attractive opportunities, which we believe positions us well to help meet growing needs for protection, retirement savings and lifetime income solutions.","Now, I will turn it over to Mark.","Mark Lyons","Right, thank you, Kevin and good morning all. AIGs adjusted after-tax earnings per share was $1.43 for the quarter compared to $1.05 per share in the corresponding quarter of 2018. In dollar terms, AIG had nearly $1.7 billion of adjusted pretax income and $1.3 billion of adjusted after-tax income. Book value per share, which excludes AOCI and DTA on an adjusted basis increased to $1.42 per share or nearly 2.6% as compared to the first quarter of 2019.","As respect to adjusted return on common equity adjusted return on common equity or ROCE, which also excludes AOCI and DTA, AIG returned an annualized 10.4% for the quarter and the segments achieved the following returns on attributed equity. General Insurance achieved the 10.3% return. As Kevin mentioned, Life and Retirement is 17.3% return and Legacy with a 5.2% return. As mentioned last quarter, AIG now is using the term return on common equity because the last quarter we introduced some preferred stock into our capital structure.","Net investment income or NII for the second quarter was $3.74 billion on an adjusted pretax income basis and $3.75 billion on the GAAP basis, compared to $3.72 billion and $3.88 billion respectively in the sequential first quarter of 2019. This level of NII had the benefit of an approximate $0.13 per share after tax gain, associated with an IPO in our alternative private equity asset class. This $142 million pretax gain is reflected in Life and Retirement for $138 million, and $4 million within our Legacy segment.","Strengthening equity markets and tighter credit spreads also helped this quarter's investment results. I am pleased to recall that effective last quarter, AIG implemented two changes in the accounting presentation that now recognized changes in the fair market value of equity securities below the line and the non-insurance subsidiary NII that had been reflected within other income is now reflected in the NII line profits.","Turning to General Insurance, for the second consecutive quarter, the segment produced both a calendar quarter and a current accident quarter underwriting profit, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 97.8% as Peter mentioned, which of course reflects actual catastrophe losses and prior period development, and a 96.1% current accident quarter combined ratio, excluding CATs. The actual CAT ratio for the second quarter of 2019 was 2.6% of net premium and for the first quarter of 2019 sequentially was 2.7%. The prior-year development ratio or PYD ratio net of the ADC and amortization was a favorable 0.9 loss ratio points for the quarter and for the first quarter of 2019 sequentially was 1%.","Furthermore, improved gross underwriting along with reinsurance purchases designed to reduce per risk attachment points and provide horizontal exposure coverage, reduced the level of large net property losses. The North America segment of General Insurance produced a 96.8% current accident year excluding CATs combined ratio with the North America Commercial Lines component producing a 99.2% current accident quarter combined ratio, excluding CATs, which represents a 9.3 combined ratio point improvement over the second quarter of 2018.","The North America Personal lines operation produced a 90.1% current accident quarter combined ratio, excluding CATs, which represents a 7.8% combined ratio point improvement over the corresponding quarter of 2018. The International segment of General Insurance produced a 95.5% current accident quarter combined ratio, excluding CATs versus 98% even comparable ratio in the second quarter of 2018. This improvement was driven by the commercial segment, which saw a 6.5 combined ratio point reduction over the second quarter of 2018.","It's also informative to comment on the General Insurance performance on a year-to-date six-month basis versus the first six months of 2018, and on that basis, year-to-date net earned premiums were up 1.1%. The calendar year combined ratio improved 5 points even and the current accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, improved 4.2 points. Furthermore, the general operating expense ratio or GOE ratio improved 2.2 points prior to adjustments from the Validus acquisition.","Lastly, the year-to-date General Insurance return on attributed common equity is 12.1% in 2019 versus 5.3% in the first half of 2018, a 680-basis point improvement.","Turning to prior-year development or PYD, this quarter saw $63 million of net favorable development with $66 million of favorable stemming from General Insurance and $3 million of unfavorable emanating from Legacy operations. Although actual versus expected loss emergence was reviewed globally, the areas receiving deeper reserve dives this quarter were mostly US exposures, primary and excess casualty on both admitted and non-admitted basis, Environmental, Health Care, GL and MedNow [ph] within programs, personalized property and some specialties lines.","The $63 million of net favorable development is mostly driven by the amortization associated with the deferred gain of the adverse development cover for $58 million. The remaining post ADC $5 million of net favorable development was scattered across many lines, but unpacking this further, and looking at things on a pre-ADC basis, net favorable development was a $132 million split as $129 million favorable in North America, $6 million favorable internationally, and pre-aforementioned $3 million unfavorable from the Legacy segment.","But an equally relevant view of this $135 million of pre-ADC favorable general insurance PYD is that $230 million represents favorable development for accident years 2015 and prior across many lines and is largely subject to the ADC, and $95 million of unfavorable development for accident years 2016 to 2018, which is split $55 million from US admitted excess casualty, $10 million from US primary casualty workers' compensation life combined, and $30 million of unfavorable development emanating mostly from short-tailed personal lines and European property and specialty lines.","I am pleased that this quarter's deep dive review, representing 30% of total reserves that also have historically been volatile lines of business, resulted in relatively minor movements. For example, on a year-to-date basis, accident year 2017s loss ratio has only moved one-tenth of a loss ratio point and accident year 2018s movement doesn't even register.","The Legacy segment incurred $47 million of unfavorable development from accident year 2018, stemming from two environmental cleanup cost cap policies written in 2006 each for 30-year terms, which is totally distinct from General Insurance but only $3 million in favorable for legacy across all actual years.","Peter commented earlier on General Insurance's achieved rate increases for the quarter and helping to put the pervasiveness of these rate increases in context, nearly 60% of the quarter's gross premium was associated with double-digit rate increases, whereas less than 10% of associated with rate decreases.","I'd also like to add some color on the related concept of margin expansion, which is defined as the beneficial impact of effective rate changes over loss cost trends. In North America Commercial, the weighted average loss cost trend was approximately 3.5%, but that varies widely by product line and ranges from a positive 1% trend to a plus 9% trend but that is on the line. ","Given the discussion of rate changes given by Peter earlier, on a written basis, one can see that the degree of margin expansion above what was already contemplated with our 2019 plan loss ratio has been significant in the quarter, and this expansion has been centered and led by commercial property, E&S casualty business and directors and officers liability, although almost all lines had some degree of expansion.","Turning to the Life and Retirement Segment, Kevin has already provided a good overview, but I would add that the boost to NII from the previously referenced IPO at an approximate 230-basis point beneficial impact on the quarter's annualized return on common equity, and therefore their return would have still been approximately 15% without that impact. All units reported increases in adjusted pretax income sequentially and quarter-over-quarter except for the life unit which is experiencing growth along with the associated expense drag on income.","Individual Retirement net flows for the quarter were $300 million negative, but improved materially compared to the $1 billion negative in the second quarter of 2018. These net flows, however, were approximately $470 million positive across all annuity types, fixed, variable and indexed combined, with indexed annuities providing $1.1 billion of positive net flows.","As mentioned by Kevin, retail mutual fund outflows were the most challenged in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, indexed and variable annuities combined show a flat surrender rate whereas fixed annuity saw a minor uptick. Net investment spreads for Individual Retirement were under pressure during the quarter, whereas Group Retirement net spreads increased.","Life Insurance, we've seen growth in international sales, favorable mortality experience relative to the original pricing assumptions and the comparison with the second quarter of 2018 becomes favorable when controlling for that quarter's $98 million of beneficial actuarial refinements.","Assets under administration grew in both individual and group retirement primarily due to strong equity market performance. Institutional Markets' pretax income improved quarter-over-quarter, but deposits and premium shrank comparatively due to a large GIC issuance in 2018 that was not repeated in 2019.","Turning to Legacy, adjusted pretax income was up slightly on a sequential basis to $119 million, and the after-tax income to attributed common shareholders is $93 million in the quarter, which translated to a 5.2% annualized return. Legacy NII was comparable to the first six months of 2018, but even though the year-to-date return on common equity is 4.7%, we continue to anticipate a 2% to 3% return for the second half of 2019, similar to original guidance.","As respect to tax, the effective tax rate was 22.4% for the year applicable to adjusted pretax income and 21.8% for the quarter, which is inclusive of discrete items. As you know, the effective tax rate is updated each quarter using actual results or that supplemented by reforecasting the remaining quarters. And as always, the tax rate is heavily influenced each quarter by the geographic distribution of income by tax jurisdiction. It's worth noting that approximately $350 million of the DTA was consumed this quarter.","The utilization of net operating losses in foreign tax credits with both Life and Retirement and General Insurance contributing towards that consumption. As Brian noted, we did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter, so our Board authorization remains at $2 billion. As compared to the first quarter of 2019, our total debt and hybrids to total capital leverage ratio improved another 120 basis points sequentially this quarter to 26.9%.","We also had a bond issuance mature for $1 billion in mid-July that was effectively pre-funded by our March 2019 debt raising. This debt overlapped at June 30 when adjusted results in an additional 80-basis point improvement in the total debt and hybrids-to-total capital ratio to 26.1%. When you look at this on a year-to-date basis, there was a 320-point reduction in this leveraged metric.","Adjusted book value per share increased nearly 2.6% in the quarter and book value per share increased 6.2% sequentially and 13.2% since year-end 2018 benefiting from AOCI gains. As respect to the agency discussions, we completed our reviews last month with the following results for our various financial strength ratings. AM Best affirmed our A rating, and stable outlook. S&P affirmed our A plus rating and upgraded our outlook to stable, and Fitch affirmed our A plus rating and their negative outlook on an interim basis until their full review, which takes place later this year. Moody's reviewed us as well, but this was considered an internal review within their multi-year process.","Lastly, as Kevin alluded to, as for the financial accounting landscape, AIG is in the process of evaluating and planning for three fundamental accounting changes currently, that will be implemented in 2020 through 2022 depending upon the standard.","These are long-duration accounting affecting our Life and Retirement Division, IFRS 17 affecting our General Insurance International operations, but mostly in a compliance sense, and thirdly is FASB [indiscernible] current expected credit-loss model which really affects both sides of the balance sheet. We will provide more details around the impact of the changing accounting standards over the next few quarters.","And on that exciting note, I'll return it back to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Thank you. Okay, Jake, well let's go to Q&A portion of this. First question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will begin with Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question on General Insurance, you've again mentioned a lot of the underwriting actions that you've taken within that book combined with obviously now you're getting more of a pricing tailwind, so it does sound like the second half of this year, the margin should be better than the first half. Brian, I know you guys said you have the target for the underwriting profit maintaining that for the full year. Could you just give us a sense of how the second half that accident year combined ratio is adjusted within General Insurance, the type of improvement that we should expect from that 96.1% that we saw in the first half of the year?","Peter Zaffino","Well, Elyse, I have -- I said, we expect an underwriting profit for the year, it's very hard to predict the accident quarter. So, we've been -- we've been improving the volatility of this book, and so I think that the results get to be a little bit more predictable, but we still have a -- we still have a relatively interesting mix of business.","So, I just -- I don't really want to predict some to the decimal point change. We want to continue to sequentially improve, but will that happen in a -- in some kind of straight line, I can't tell you, but over time, yes, we continue to target an improvement in the General Insurance and as I said and get to a sustainable 10-point return on adjusted equity over the next couple of years, but don't hold me to what the accident quarter is going to be.","Brian Duperreault","Next question?","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, wait, I just -- excuse me, I also had a follow-up. So my second --.","Brian Duperreault","Go ahead, please.","Elyse Greenspan","My second question just on AIG 200 that you guys outlined throughout the call, I just want to get a sense on does that ultimately -- does the $200 million [ph] that you guys are looking for 200-basis point of improvement in your expense ratio. Just trying to get a sense of where that 200 comes from? And if you can just give us a sense of the timeframe there and any investments that we should be thinking about that you're making?","Mark Lyons","That's interesting. It's going to be more than 200 basis points, I'll tell you that. Now it's really a reference to -- we've just in this year celebrating -- let us go book back 100 years, and so this is to look forward to the next 100, and so maybe I should have called it, well I won't give you a number.","Brian Duperreault","But anyway, yes. So look at -- if we're ever going to be a great company, and it's our intention to be a great company, if you assess where we are now, the Life and Retirement, great set of products, great distribution platform, handling issues that come along in terms of the market.","Peter is bringing the General Insurance to an underwriting excellence position where it belongs. It is what we do for a living. We've got the best investment management in the business. But the one thing we've never been noted for is operational excellence and this is the one thing that we have not invested in. We've got legacy processes, too many manual interventions on and on and on. And it is a drag on our performance if you look at the GI expense ratio in particular.","I pick a number, it is at least 500 basis points, too high in my mind, and how are you ever going to get that down. We have to transform the Company, we have to do it fundamentally, it's going to take us some time, but it's the next great step and to me, it's as important as anything we're doing to date in this Company.","And so it's a very, very important effort, it's across the whole company and it will provide that long-term benefit and get us to that position of greatness that we've achieved -- that we aspire to. Next question please?","Operator","And that question will come from Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley.","Mike Phillips","Thank you. Good morning, Brian. I appreciate your comments at the beginning on kind of the comments on the discipline of the market and being more fact based and how that's driving this cycle. I guess some of your peers have talked about, have described the cycle as reserve driven and income statement driven. And I guess, want to hear your thoughts on that description and the question kind of goes to not for your book, but just kind of overall for the industry profitability of the current year versus kind of the profitability of prior year still?","Brian Duperreault","Well, I think the market is reacting to the fact that they don't think the current year profitability without these rate changes would have would have matched prior years. And I mean that's logical given the kind of trends that we refer to whether it's social inflation or the kind of tort movements, just frequency of loss. And so I think the market is reacting as I said in a natural way, a way that one would expect a well-managed industry to do. So, I am encouraged by that. What else would you like to ask Mike?","Mike Phillips","Yes, okay. Yeah, thanks. Just a specific one on the torts, the legislative changes that we've had and a lot of headlines obviously on the sexual harassment stuff, is that the next asbestos for the industry?","Brian Duperreault","I think asbestos has been the next asbestos for this industry [indiscernible] I don't want to -- I have got to leave that supreme. But it's certainly a society wide problem but it's certainly a society wide problem, all this stuff that's going on and it will be reflected in societies' reaction to it.","As Peter pointed out, the one thing that we have been known for when I talk about being a great Company, this kind of large widespread phenomenon is something we've been handling for a very long time, but it is certainly an issue that everybody has at the top of their mind.","Peter Zaffino","Thank you, Mike. Next question please.","Operator","We'll hear from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","Hi, good morning everybody. I wanted to start with a question on NII. So you had two strong quarters openings of the year, how should we think of the kind of $13.2 billion to $13.3 billion run rate that you talked about last quarter with the rate environment being what it is today?","Brian Duperreault","Yes, okay. Well, I think I'll have Mark do this one.","Mark Lyons","Thank you. I mean it's a reasonable question. I mean, what I would just kind of comment on. Last quarter, we kind of gave you a framework. We said it is roughly 91% of the carrying value of investable assets is in pretty stable, predictable stuff. I mean, that's still got some variability to it of course, but on a relative basis, and then there was another 9% that has a lot more volatility to it, some because of the inherent asset class itself and some because of the accounting election that was put through.","And that mix is still pretty much in force this quarter. So there a couple of things, one, if you look back even through our fence up, you're going to see in PE and hedge fund composites pretty, pretty broad volatility. It's -- we have a minus 11% in the fourth quarter that rebounded to 18%, and 16% this quarter, it was 5% in the latter part -- third quarter of '18.","So you can kind of go backwards and pick your own standard there on those kinds of things. The other thing that, and Brian alluded to it and Kevin alluded to it, if you go into the assumption that where the interest rates are now, stays at this level with natural maturities and natural turnover in fixed income, you're going to be reinvesting in lower yielding fixed income securities.","That could put some downward pressure on it, latter half and then into 2016. So all those things taken into account, we still think that the original guidance we had given coming into the year was $13 billion. And through that stuff that I mentioned, you could really get to about $13.5 billion, in that range and that's, for the reasons we just mentioned, that's pretty much where we still are.","Yaron Kinar","Okay.","Brian Duperreault","The other question Yaron?","Yaron Kinar","Yes. My next question is going back to the AIG 200 initiatives. Is that something that you would expect to complete by the 2021 -- the end of 2021 when you're targeting the double-digit ROE? And also with the costs associated with this program will those be included in adjusted operating income or not?","Brian Duperreault","Yes, well, I would say, yes. I put it as a probably a three plus year program, but once that period ends, this constant improvement should never end and I -- so I think there will be continuous improvement after that, but let's say the -- a project name will probably end in that period of time. And yes, we would include the cost and benefits net-net in the -- in our belief that we'll get to that double-digit position at that point.","Did you want to add anything, Mark?","Mark Lyons","Yes, just one thing, that the second part of your question was, of course, you will see that in net income, but that kind of restructuring charges is generally is excluded from operating income.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. Thank you.","Brian Duperreault","Okay. You're welcome. Next question please.","Operator","And now we'll take a question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning.","Brian Duperreault","Hey, Tom.","Tom Gallagher","Hey, guys. So, Mark, just a follow-up on the NII question, so if I followed your $13.5 billion expectation for the year, that implies per quarter, NII will be running around $3 billion or so for the next couple of quarters if we stay in the current rate environment is that approximately right?","Mark Lyons","Yes, if you're linear on it.","Tom Gallagher","Got it. And then my follow-up is just from Slide 5, there is a footnote that says about 20% of your fixed maturities are in variable rate securities, are those -- I think that's -- I would sulfur [ph] like $50 billion of variable rate securities, are those traditional floaters? And is that -- is that the main source of pressure on NII from a base spread standpoint?","Mark Lyons","First off, your mix is right. It's about 80:20 and -- notional sounds approximately right as well. So, I mean, yes with floating that's going to be a natural impact on it, which, yes, what have you got, it's not like you just let it go, I mean, there is risk management and hedge aspects associated with it. But, Doug, do you want to?","Douglas Dachille","Hi, good morning. When you look at that, that's the holdings of the floating-rate assets, but there are a couple of factors you have to think about with respect to the impact to net investment income. First of all, the reason we hold those floating-rate assets, it provides diversification.","But the other reason we hold them as we have a lot of liabilities that reprice frequency frequently during the course of the year. So there is some asset liability management that's associated with holding floaters. So we hold floating-rate assets against liabilities that have a floating rate repricing characteristic.","To the extent there is any excess floaters that we invest in because we thought there was value to the extent there is an asset liability mismatch, we typically swap those floating-rate assets into fixed. So while we're telling you what percentage of the portfolio actually has floating rate as a component of the available for sale, that's not necessarily the exact amount of exposure we have to the repricing of the floating rate.","Tom Gallagher","Understood, thanks.","Brian Duperreault","Okay, next question.","Operator","One moment please. We will now take a question from Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Thanks and good morning, I appreciate it.","Brian Duperreault","Good morning, Jay.","Jay Gelb","With regard to capital management, you had some discussion in prepared remarks about why the Company did not repurchase shares in the first half in terms of taking down the leverage ratio and at the same time free cash flow seems quite strong and the stock is currently trading at 80% of book value. Can you talk about what your expectations might be for the second half in terms of buybacks?","Brian Duperreault","I think Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're going to, and I said the same thing. We're going to -- we're going to continue to look at our leverage, so let's not forget that, but my bias has always been to invest in the business and in this situation where we've got a market that's improving daily, and also an effort in the Company to self-improve through the AIG 200, I think that there will be plenty of opportunities for us to invest in the Company itself, and I think that's the long-term best use of the funds and that's where we're going, Jay.","Jay Gelb","That sounds good. I do have a follow-up. This one is for Peter. I was wondering if you can give us any indications of what you're seeing in terms of the pricing environment so far through the third quarter, if the positive trends are accelerating?","Peter Zaffino","It's too early, Jay, really to comment, but I would expect just based on sort of qualitative commentary that the third quarter early reactions are similar to what we've seen in the second quarter.","Jay Gelb","Thank you.","Brian Duperreault","Good. Terrific. Let's take another question.","Operator","We'll now hear from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","Well, thank you for fitting me in, I appreciate it. Good morning.","Brian Duperreault","Good morning, Josh. it's good to hear from you.","Joshua Shanker","Thank you. So, you talked about rate, everyone's talking about rate and whatnot, but in some ways, AIG is writing its own ticket. There is an overhaul of the portfolio going on. It's ongoing. When you talk about rate, is that pricing only or is that joined with an overhaul how AIG underwrites its P&C business?","Brian Duperreault","Well, I'm going to start and Mike and Peter can finish. So, these rates that we refer to are really like same store sales rate, kind of thing, right. So we're matching apples with apples. But as you point out there is another thing going on, which is the sharing of business that was either poorly selected or under price limits under price limits that we didn't think we were getting paid for. So there is another underlying improvement taking place in addition to this rate comparison. Mark, do you want to add?","Mark Lyons","Yes, thank you. First off, Josh, I appreciate that one opening comment you made that in terms of writing your own ticket, I think clear point of differentiation is in a lot of sectors, AIG is pushing the market, it's not like we're benefiting from the results of others, we are pushing it and that's contributory to our view on a lot of different things.","In terms of the rate changes as Peter quoted for, they are effective rate changes, taken into account as much as you can, to the examples that Brian mentioned, limits in contraction and the cash flow point movements and so forth. But there is a broader lift that does not reflect. I mean that's the explicit rate change, the implicit rate change is that portfolio quality differential.","So when you non-renew or get rid of business of rate adequacy of X and you're bringing in new business that's much stronger than that X, it has beneficial lift as well. That will find its way into the ultimate loss ratio, but that's in addition to the individual rate changes that we are covering up.","Brian Duperreault","Peter, have you got anything you want to add?","Peter Zaffino","I just want to build on what both of you had commented on, which is the most important thing we're making sure that the underwriters are doing is risk selection, how to recalibrate the portfolio, making disciplined decisions around limit deployment, understanding their aggregations, understanding what's actually happening with loss cost and underlying trends.","We're very pleased with the rate that we've been driving. But that's become an outcome of the discipline that we've been driving over the last five or six quarters.","Brian Duperreault","Josh, we got maybe time for follow-up and no other question.","Joshua Shanker","It is absolutely a follow-up, right on it. And so next year, as I think about the shape of the portfolio and your purchase of reinsurance over the past 12 months, can we imagine that the shaping of the same, that you have the same reliance on reinsurance for the next 12 months or is that going to change over time?","Mark Lyons","Well, I think we've been addressing our reinsurance to the portfolio that we had, as that portfolio changes, right, so we get rid of the large limit strategy, you don't have to buy as much in terms of protecting the Company from those very large limits, portfolio mix, but I'd say the basis of our philosophy of around the reinsurance that it is -- it's geared to addressing exposures that we feel we should share because of accumulations or because of volatility, that's going to continue. But yes, as the portfolio evolves, we'll adjust our total program accordingly.","Joshua Shanker","Thank you.","Brian Duperreault","Thanks Josh. And I'm going to call this to an end, and thank you. And I just want to just thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions. And before we end the call, of course, I do want to acknowledge our colleagues around the world for their tireless efforts and dedication to the journey that we're on here at AIG, and I am proud of what we're accomplishing and appreciate everybody's hard work.","I also want to thank our business partners, shareholders and stakeholders for their support. It's meant a lot to me and my leadership team and we remain committed to making AIG the leading insurance Company in the world. Have a great day.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Elizabeth A.

Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events.

Peter?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Liz. Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for joining us. Last night we announced significant actions to further transform AIG into a more streamlined organization, positioned to serve our clients with ever greater agility. I look forward to providing more details on our strategy and progress.","But before I do I'd like to comment on the recent letter we received from Carl Icahn. The letter outlines a plan that includes separation of Life and P&C. Management and the board have carefully reviewed such a separation on many occasions including in the recent past and have concluded it did not make financial sense. We of course will meet with him to further share our conclusions and give him an opportunity to elaborate on his views.","The views expressed suggest that AIG should be split into three businesses. That those businesses would no longer be subject to non-bank SIFI regulation. The assumed outcome is the ability to increase capital return to shareholders, and the elimination of what are perceived to be excessive costs associated with non-bank SIFI regulation.","We see tremendous benefit from combining Life and P&C activities, while we are continuing our efforts to reduce costs and complexities. As additional context AIG has been aggressively reshaping the company and has sold over 30 businesses for over $90 billion. There are no sacred cows. And we consider all avenues to improve shareholder returns.","Having said that there are a number of issues associated with a separation of our Life and Property Casualty businesses. And this morning I'll touch on four key considerations.","Number one, our non-bank SIFI status has not limited our ability to return capital. And since the beginning of 2012 we have returned over $26 billion to shareholders by repurchasing 35% of our outstanding shares.","Number two, rating agencies are the key determinant of how much capital is available for distribution, and they have given AIG significant credit for our scale and diversified business model. Rating agencies have noted the existing diversification benefit from our multi-line structure, thus we believe that less capital would be available for distribution to shareholders if we separated these businesses.","Number three, AIG is highly regulated throughout the world, independent from our regulation as a non-bank SIFI. The amount we spend on non-bank SIFI compliance is a fraction of our total regulatory compliance costs.","Number four, breaking up the company would result in a loss of at least one-third of our DTA of more than $15 billion. The amount lost would depend on the scenario of which business or businesses may be spun out and their respective income projections.","In addition to the issues I just reviewed, including that a separation would result in less capital being available for distribution, separating AIG would increase certain expenses and would be a distraction from our cost-cutting initiatives.","Now let me discuss the quarter, our four main priorities, and our focus on AIG's financial targets. In the quarter you saw that operating income was negatively affected by volatile capital markets. Even excluding the impact of the markets, our underlying results were mixed. We saw deterioration in certain U.S. Casualty Lines, which John will speak to. But we were pleased with the growth in Global Property in Japan Personal Auto.","As you saw in our press release our four priorities are to narrow our focus on businesses where we can grow profitably, drive for efficiency, grow through innovation, and optimizing our data assets and return excess capital to shareholders. These actions are all consistent with our core objectives of improving ROE and increasing shareholder value.","In my shareholder letter I stated that we would sculpt AIG's businesses to maximize return on our resource allocation and position the company for future growth opportunities. The announcements this quarter were part of a continuous transformation to streamline our businesses and exit subscale and low-return businesses and geographies. We're ceasing to offer certain products like Personal Auto in countries where we lack the necessary scale, some 17 countries to date including Russia and China.","In the third quarter we entered in agreement to sell our Central American operations and entered a partnership with a local buyer. Those geographies were not core to our targeted emerging growth countries, which are concentrated in larger markets where we have existing scale.","Managing expenses and reduced structural costs are of critical focus as they are within our control and a key driver of improving profitability. This quarter's announcement is targeted at reducing 23% of employees among the top 1,400 members of senior management. We believe these actions will also increase our speed of decision making and agility.","In the quarter we also announced actions to manage pension expense. We've been gathering momentum on our expense reduction, as evidenced by the almost 6% of general operating expense reductions year to date or 3% on an underlying basis. These expense initiatives have been in flight for some time and require careful planning and execution. David will go through the numbers in greater detail. And we expect to deliver continued improvements that allow us to reach our 3% to 5% annual net expense reduction target.","To be clear we're targeting net expense reductions. We've been investing, and we'll continue to make investments that will give us a competitive advantage in an ever changing landscape. The current mega trend that we see in artificial intelligence, digital, the Internet of Things, and Big Data require us to make these investments with a constant eye on innovation in order to be relevant.","As you know we believe investment in technology and innovation will give us a sustainable, competitive advantage to deliver greater value to our customers. While we're rationalizing existing businesses, we are at the same time building capabilities through engineering services, technology, and shared service centers. These investments allow us to deepen our customer relationships and operate with greater efficiency. They allow us to win business and retain clients and are evident in the numerous awards we've received globally.","We remain committed to an active capital management strategy that prioritizes return of capital to shareholders. Year to date share repurchases have totaled more than $8 billion and will continue at current prices and below our estimate of intrinsic value.","Our capital management actions and operational improvements support our book value and ROE targets. Through the first 9 months of this year we have achieved 6.6% growth in book value per share, excluding AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth. Dividends are one component of our capital return to shareholders.","And I mentioned last quarter that we would account for this year's 124% growth in our quarterly dividend as part of our book value per share growth target. While we may fall a bit short this year, we continue to target a 10% growth rate in annual book value, excluding AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth through 2017.","Through the 9 months our 6.9% normalized ROE reflect 30 basis points of lost AerCap earnings, as well as narrowing improvements in our commercial underwriting results. Despite this year's challenging comparisons, we believe that through 2017 we will reach our target of 50 basis points in annual ROE improvements, adjusting for AerCap's full year 2015 contribution of 50 basis points. You can expect that the sense of urgency in this quarter's actions will continue so that we reach our targets.","The scale and diversity of AIG provides great flexibility and opportunity, and there's no one business or geography that determines our success. We have a clear alignment with our board, management, and employees on our strategy. And you can expect that our focus will be on execution with urgency. I look forward to providing future updates on our actions and our progress of delivering sustainable value to our shareholders.","With that I'd like to turn it over to David.","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, the details of our restructuring charge and expense initiatives, and our capital management activity. Turning to slide 4. You can see that our third quarter operating earnings per share was $0.52, down $0.67 per share from the same period in 2014.","As shown on slide 5, market volatility impacts on investment returns primarily drove the comparison, a sharply lower hedge fund performance, PICC mark-to-market losses, and a decline in the fair value of asset backed securities largely resulted in a reduction of about $0.64 per share compared to the third quarter last year. As a reminder we report hedge fund returns on a one-month lag and private equity returns on a one-quarter lag.","In the quarter in addition to our restructuring charge there were three noteworthy adjustments to GAAP net income that contributed to the GAAP net loss of $231 million, compared to after-tax operating income of just shy of $700 million. These adjustments include net after-tax realized capital losses of about $260 million, principally related to other than temporary impairments on energy and emerging market investments, a FIN 48 tax provision of a little over $200 million associated with legacy cross-border financing transactions, and a $225 million after-tax loss on extinguishment of debt, as we executed on economically attractive debt repurchases. Our reported operating tax rate for the quarter was just shy of 20%, driven by a lower level of income and tax audit settlements during the quarter. The 9-month tax rate of 32% is in line with our expectations for the full year.","Turning to slide 7. Total company general operating expenses were $2.7 billion in the third quarter and $8.4 billion year to date, down just over 10% for the quarter and 6% for the year. The reported comparisons reflect the benefits of the pension plan freeze, as well as the effects of the strengthening U.S. dollar. But they also include expenses associated with the acquisitions of about $100 million year to date.","In the third quarter we froze our defined benefit plan, while increasing our 401(k) contributions somewhat. These changes are effective January 1, 2016, as part of our efforts to better align our benefits offering to the market. The combination of these actions are expected to reduce our annual benefits expense by approximately $100 million on a pre-tax basis. We expect roughly 75% of the run rate savings to be reported in our Commercial and our Consumer Lines of business, split fairly evenly, and the balance to be reported in parent.","Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the non-recurring portion of the pension benefit, and expenses from recent acquisitions, general operating expenses declined roughly 3% both for the quarter and year to date compared to 2014.","As Peter mentioned, we remain highly focused on our objectives of improving operating efficiencies in a sustainable way that will deliver earnings and ROE improvements and will enhance shareholder value.","To that end, this quarter we have incurred an initial pre-tax restructuring charge of $274 million pre-tax with an additional $225 million of restructuring charges to be recognized through 2017. We expect that the annual run rate general operating expense savings from these actions to amount to between $500 million and $600 million per year once the initiatives are fully executed. This includes the $100 million of pension benefits I referenced earlier.","As you can see on slide 8, we are executing on a plan to deliver $1 billion to $1.5 billion of reductions in net general operating expenses over the 3-year period ending December 2017. This would represent approximately 10% to 15% reduction to our total company general operating expenses based on the full year of 2014.","The body of work to accomplish these savings is quite broad and can be broken down into three major categories, organizational simplification, operational efficiency, and business rationalization, each of which are detailed on slides 8 and 9.","While a fair amount of work has been completed to date against these initiatives, particularly as it rates to moving certain functions to lower cost locations, simplifying our organizational structure, and optimizing benefits, more work remains to be done.","Slide 10 represents our current capital structure. During the quarter we deployed over $3.7 billion towards the purchase of approximately 61 million shares, and we also purchased an additional $600 million worth of shares in October, leaving right at $2.9 billion of unused authorization.","We also continue to manage the cost and maturity profile of our debt. In July we repurchased in cash tender offers roughly $3.7 billion in aggregate purchase price of the debt. During the third quarter we also issued a total of about $3.2 billion in senior debt to fund the tender. We continue to be opportunistic in our debt capital management, which is focused on the cost and maturity profile of the debt.","Cash flow to the holding company remained strong, as you can see on slide 11. The company received total distributions from insurance subsidiaries of about $2.8 billion during the quarter, including over $500 million of tax sharing payments. We expect the insurance company dividends and distributions to be roughly $1 billion in the fourth quarter.","Now with that I'd like to turn the call over to John.","John Q. Doyle - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer-Commercial Insurance","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today I will discuss our Commercial Insurance segment's third quarter results, market trends, and our strategic outlook.","Pre-tax operating income in the third quarter was $815 million, a decrease from $1.2 billion in the same period last year. As David highlighted earlier, the decrease in investment returns was the primary driver in the decline in Commercial's operating income.","In Property Casualty, as noted on page 13, our underwriting results benefited from modest catastrophe losses in the quarter but were offset by an increase in current accident year losses driven by higher loss expectations in Commercial Auto, Healthcare, and Environmental, higher-than-expected attritional losses in Property, and increased severe losses. For the 9 months severe losses were comparable to last year. However, they were approximately $100 million higher than expected.","About a quarter of the period's severe losses were related to the Tianjin, China explosion. We expect modest accident year loss ratio improvement in the fourth quarter, which should continue into 2016. While short-tail results can be volatile in any given quarter, we remain confident that our strategies will drive sustainable improvement in the accident year loss ratio.","Our actuarial review work this quarter resulted in $186 million of net adverse prior year reserve development associated with Healthcare and Environmental reserves. The change in loss picks had an outsized impact on the third quarter accident year loss ratio, as it fully reflects the year-to-date change in those loss picks. As a result we have taken remediation action, including exiting certain classes of these businesses.","We also had favorable prior year reserve development of approximately $100 million in Property. Going forward you can expect us to continue our value-based management approach and reduce exposure to certain poorer performing segments of U.S. Casualty, which as you can see shrunk by 10% in the third quarter.","Net premiums written declined just over 1% excluding FX. And as a result of our continuing strategy to optimize the portfolio and maintain underwriting discipline in overly competitive markets. We continue to have strong growth and focused lines of business, where we see good returns and greater opportunity, such as large limit and middle market property, cyber risk, and M&A insurance.","I would expect continued pressure on the top-line growth, given the overall rate environment. However, diversification and new sources of distribution such as AIG-Ascot Re in Bermuda and the NSM acquisition are now contributing to our top line.","General operating expenses declined from the year ago quarter, but the GOE ratio increased as a result of lower net premiums earned and the impact of the NSM acquisition. The increase in acquisition costs was primarily driven by the impact of NSM.","Overall, rates declined by 1.4% in the quarter, driven by rate pressure in Property and across all lines in Asia Pacific and EMEA. Average rate change was positive in Casualty and essentially flat in Specialty and Financial Lines.","If you turn to slide 14, Mortgage Guaranty's third quarter operating results were excellent, benefiting from improved loss experience due to lower expectation of delinquencies and higher cure rates. As you can also see production volume was also strong in the quarter.","Although certain of our underwriting results in the quarter were disappointing, we remain confident in the underwriting improvements underway. And we expect to benefit from our further cost reduction efforts and capital efficiency initiatives. While there is a lot of work to do, it is clear to me that our investment in underwriting excellence, the application of science, and new technologies will improve client experience and make us a more efficient commercial insurer. Thank you. And I'd now like to turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin T. Hogan - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer-Consumer Insurance","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll discuss the trends in our Consumer Insurance businesses and comments on our strategic initiatives, including our ongoing work in Japan.","In the third quarter our Consumer Insurance businesses generated pre-tax operating income of $657 million. Turning to slide 16. Pre-tax operating income for Retirement was $635 million for the quarter, reflecting the lower alternative investment income that David highlighted, a decline in base portfolio income, and a lower net positive adjustment from the annual update of actuarial assumptions.","Base portfolio income for retirement decreased as a result of lower reinvestment rates and lower invested assets, principally driven by significant dividends to AIG parent over the last 12 months. We continue to expect base yields to decline 2 basis points to 4 basis points per quarter given current interest rates.","Retirement saw good overall sales growth, both sequentially and year over year, particularly in fixed annuities. The key growth drivers were broader distribution of new product offerings with fixed deferred annuity bank channel sales also benefiting from higher market interest rates as a result of widening credit spreads.","We have continued to see good growth in index annuities, which we began breaking out on page 31 of the financial supplement this quarter. Net flows improved by almost $1.2 billion compared to the year ago quarter across our businesses, due to continued strong net flows in Retirement income solutions and improvements in net flows and Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement.","Slide 18 presents results for our Global Life business. Life reported a pre-tax operating loss this quarter from lower alternative returns, mortality experience that was within pricing expectations but less favorable than the year-ago quarter, and a higher net negative adjustment from the update of actuarial assumptions.","Life premiums and deposits grew 8% from the same quarter a year ago, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, reflecting the continued growth in Japan and the acquisition of AIG Life Limited. The AIG Life Limited and Laya Healthcare acquisitions were also the primary driver of growth in Life general operating expenses.","Turning to slide 19. Personal Insurance results this quarter were impacted by lower net investment income and modestly lower underwriting income, which included higher catastrophe losses offset by favorable prior year development.","Net premiums written grew 3.5% from the same quarter a year ago excluding the effects of foreign exchange, driven by growth across all products with the exception of warranty service programs in the U.S., where new premiums reflect the increased deductible structure we instituted to improve performance in this portfolio.","The overall expense ratio declined 0.2 points as a decrease in the general operating expense ratio was partially offset by an increase in the acquisition ratio. The acquisition ratio increased primarily due to a profit-sharing arrangement in warranty service programs and higher acquisition costs in Automobile, partially offset by lower accidents and health direct marketing expenses.","The general operating expense ratio decreased, primarily reflecting the timing of investment and strategic initiatives, together with an ongoing focus on cost efficiency.","In Japan we continue to accelerate growth in our target markets, while making significant progress in preparation for the legal merger. We have determined that work we have completed to date enables cost benefits even before legal merger, including realignment of our marketing activities and simplification of our structure, leading to our decision to reduce emphasis on the actual merger date and extend the timeline.","By doing this we can continue to enhance current performance, take actions to meet new regulatory requirements, and reduce the amount of immediate investment required without jeopardizing the eventual merger.","To close for our Consumer businesses we remain focused on achieving profitable growth and effectively managing risk by executing on our customer focused strategies, maintaining a prudent risk profile, and targeting capital efficient growth opportunities.","Now I'd like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President - Investor Relations","Operator, can we open up our lines for Q&A please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. And we'll take our first question from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Peter, just following up on your commentary about the Icahn proposal and a three-way breakup. You commented on the Life Insurance and Property Casualty, but not United Guaranty. Can you give us an update on your thoughts there? Whether that's a business that you would consider divesting?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Tom, thank you for the question. So UGC is a business which was for sale for virtually nothing back in the crisis days. And since then we've invested in it, modernized it, and taken it from number five to number one in its industry, and it's performing very well today. We've kept it as a very modular unit, so it gives us strategic flexibility. But today it is a core business making a significant contribution to the company.","But over time we are always flexible if the right opportunity to monetize assets was to come along. But today it's core, contributing, and we enjoy certain operational synergies with it. It originates whole loans for our investment portfolio and gives us I think a source of attractive returns in the mortgage market. So we don't announce or pre-announce any strategic actions. And so no further comment on the topic.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got you. And then just a follow-up related to that business I guess for David. In terms of your capital framework are you currently holding a significant capital buffer related to the ownership of United Guaranty? Can you comment as to how that overall works into your capital position?","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Tom, the capital that we hold for that business is much more manageable by AIG, given our broad balance sheet, our ability to fund the capital need through internal reinsurance. And likewise we did a recent cap bond that was also a very capital efficient transaction for us.","So I wouldn't characterize it as a buffer. We're holding adequate capital, and we have adequate capital flexibility with respect to that business.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","And I think the important capital constraint on this is the PMIERs capital constraint. So that's really the right lens to view the capital adequacy for UGC's current book of business and future growth prospects.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Operator","You have reached the maximum time permitted for recording your message.","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President - Investor Relations","Operator? Operator, do we have a problem with the line?","Operator","It looks like \u2013 I do not know. Let me try my....","Operator","...time permitted for recording...","Operator","We'll go ahead to our next question with Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President - Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Just two questions. First for John. John, at the beginning of the year I seem to recall you thinking that you would have a pretty decent improvement in the underlying loss ratio in the Commercial business, and you really haven't seen that. I'm wondering why? Has it been pricing? Has it been loss activity? What's the reasons behind the lack of improvement?","John Q. Doyle - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer-Commercial Insurance","Sure, Jay. As you know over the course of the last several years we've had meaningful improvement in our accident year loss ratio. I think since the beginning of 2011 about 8.5 points of accident year loss ratio improvement. So we've done well over time.","But it has flattened out this year. And I think really driven by two different things. One is higher than expected short-tail losses. I commented briefly on the severe losses in the quarter. And then we saw generally higher severity than we had expected in Transportation, Commercial Auto, in Environmental, and in Healthcare. So as you saw we took action in the quarter, put remediation plans in place from the underwriting point of view, moved some segments of those lines into run-off as well. But took the opportunity to strengthen current accident year reserve.","So as I said I do expect some modest improvement, not what we had expected earlier in the year, given what has happened in those markets, those segments. But we do expect a bit of loss ratio improvement in the fourth quarter and again next year. Costs will in this market become increasingly important as well. So that remains an important lever for us as we go forward.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. And, I guess, next one for...","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Jay, I would \u2013 this is David. I would just add \u2013 and, John, you may want to comment, we \u2013 with respect to the current accident year loss pick catch-up, so there was some of that in the quarter as well. You may want to talk...","John Q. Doyle - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer-Commercial Insurance","Yeah. I commented that on my earlier remarks. But in Healthcare and in Commercial Auto, when we strengthen the loss picks in the quarter it goes back to 1:1 (31:31). So it has got an outsized impact on the current quarter reported results.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. I was looking at the 9 months. Probably better to look at that I imagine.","John Q. Doyle - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer-Commercial Insurance","Right.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Other question for Peter. Peter, you mentioned that being designated as SIFI has not held you back from repurchasing shares. At the same time I would suspect that that designation has caused AIG to hold excess capital, simply because you don't understand what the actual rules are going to be, as they haven't been fully announced yet. Is that the case? Are you holding some excess capital than you normally would have because of the SIFI designation?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","The answer is definitively no. I think that the right way to look at this if you \u2013 we are among about 30 SIFIs, banks and non-banks. And we anticipated this designation before we exited the government's cradle. And therefore executed massive deleveraging and divestitures of precisely the activities which the SIFI regulations were designed to eliminate.","So whether it's ILFC, whether it's American General Finance, or other activities, our Consumer finance businesses, which required short-term funding. So we don't have run risk in terms of short-term obli's(32:56). We eliminated the derivatives book.","So unlike other SIFIs that are today in a deleveraging and divestiture mode, we got that done by the end of 2011. So it's simply not the binding constraint. The rating agencies are the critical binding constraint that governs our buyback pace. And the longer they get comfortable with the stability of our operating model and our ability to execute on it, the more and more they will give us capacity to use capital more efficiently than we have in the past. But it's definitively not either current or anticipated SIFI capital rules.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for the answer.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you very much. So, Peter, can we talk a little bit about head count and understanding the roles that the people, who are technically positioned at the holdco, have relative to what their functions would be allocated to the subs. I mean, and not to say that we're trying to take those positions down, but rather understanding the nature of the hiring of people who are holdco personnel.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","So very few people are actually employed in the holdco per se. So I think that just sort of read more into your question perhaps, how do we view shared services? We have a number of very sizeable shared service centers, which perform a range of services from operations, technology, claims, and other activities, and finance that are in low-cost locations both in the United States and overseas. And we've been moving roughly 2,000 jobs to those low-cost centers per year.","And so this is a very substantial shift in the head count mix and the cost per unit of head count. You had an increase in the total head count during this transition period, because you have to mirror the jobs. You can't just flip the switch overnight. And so you have a doubling up of a number of these jobs.","The pace of that migration, which started about 3.5 years ago, has gone from about 1,600 migrations in 2014 to about 2,000 this year. So it's a very substantial shift in the way the company has provided services to create scale and rationalization of a very diffused operational environment, and has improved controls and provides the platform for future automation of what were very manual processes that were decentralized and had a lot of redundancy.","So I don't know whether that helps answer your question, but that's sort of the basic head count story.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","It's a good answer. And if we think 3 years out, how does the head count look at AIG compared to where it looks today?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think that there will be fewer people, because a lot of those jobs will eventually be replaced by automation. We also, beyond the head count numbers that you see, have a very substantial number of contractors. And that number will also decline.","So between contractors and head count in total we'd expect that number to be substantially lower. And our technology would be a bigger part of the spend and the scalable infrastructure that gives us, will lower our unit costs substantially.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well thank you and good luck.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. First for John, if I could. Can you quantify the true-ups on the current accident year? So maybe give us a current accident quarter loss ratio in Commercial.","John Q. Doyle - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer-Commercial Insurance","If I understand your question, I think it was about a 2-point impact, the loss pick impact in the quarter relating to Healthcare, Auto, and Environmental as well.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then you talked about NSM in the release as well. How much of an impact did that have on the expense ratio in Commercial?","John Q. Doyle - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer-Commercial Insurance","Modest. But I think \u2013 are you talking about acquisition or geo?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. That acquisition is the one that bumped up, and I think you'd mentioned that in the release.","John Q. Doyle - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer-Commercial Insurance","Yes. So a combination of growth in programs at a higher acquisition rate and then writing less Casualty business in the U.S., much of which is net of commission, drove the increase in acquisition cost.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And so is the NSM piece \u2013 is that going to be a permanent increase in the acquisition expense? Or does that somehow \u2013 is there something one-time-ish, because of the acquisition timing that caused that?","John Q. Doyle - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer-Commercial Insurance","No, there was nothing one-time-ish about it. We've had a long history of being a leader in the program business in the United States. It's consistent with our strategy on how we go down market in the U.S. and focus on niche classes with unique products. NSM gives us access to distribution, to agency distribution, that we otherwise don't have.","And our program strategy does the same thing. We've done business with them for a long time. So there was nothing kind of one-off-ish about the results in the quarter. It's a higher value, a greater risk adjusted profitability in that segment relative to the U.S. Casualty business. So the trade-offs are about risk adjusted bottom-line results between those two units.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And I guess \u2013 and then sort of shifting over to Japan for a second. Kevin, you mentioned extending the timeline on the merger. I guess that's the integration of the brands there. Can you just remind us how much is that impacting the expense ratio in Consumer? And when should we start to see that come through on the expense side?","Kevin T. Hogan - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer-Consumer Insurance","Thanks, Mike. As we've consistently said with respect to the merger in Japan, the timeline is something that is determined by external as well as our own events.","And the reality is that recently there has been a new regulatory requirement to change the earthquake rates on certain of the property products. And in anticipation of that we've really been focusing on trying to understand, how can we extract benefits from the investments that we've made to date? Even before the actual legal merger date, we've invested quite a lot in a series of common products and a front end that serves both the agency businesses and also our footprint strategy across the businesses.","And so even though the actual merger date itself may have to be pushed out a little bit because of this regulatory requirement, we do expect some of the early benefits to start emerging as early as next year.","We recently announced that we're refocusing our direct marketing activities of supplemental health insurance in Fuji Life, which is really something that is facilitated by this. And that we'll start winding down activities at American Home. And this is a good example of the type of simplification of our organizational structure and our marketing activities that the investments that we have made in preparation for the merger will allow.","So this allows us to reduce a little bit the emphasis on expenses in the preparation for the merger itself, as well as extracting benefits earlier. So we anticipate that the benefits \u2013 we're still investing in preparation for the legal merger. So we're not going to be at the run rate we expect to be in 3 years to 5 years immediately, but we'll start to see less pressure on expenses as of next year.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then I mean just generally looking across the two, I guess it looks like you're seeing \u2013 you've talked a lot about improvements on the general operating side. We've seen some of that come through a little bit, but it's being more than offset by a higher acquisition expense ratio.","And so I'm just trying to figure out when \u2013 what should those be? What should the expense line look like? What are you internally going to be happy with? And I would just generally say I think it would be helpful instead of just looking at the expenses and profitability on a year-over-year basis when discussing results, thinking about them relative to where you want them to be and kind of what your plan is to get there over a reasonable period of time. I mean that would be helpful. Thanks.","Kevin T. Hogan - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer-Consumer Insurance","So I understand the point, Mike. And we have loss ratios in the various businesses that we believe are competitive and sustainable. And it is the expense and the acquisition costs that we're focusing on. As Peter mentioned \u2013 and in fact if you go back to the Investor Day we held last year, we introduced the market maturity model, where essentially we're identifying what are the appropriate products and channels to be in, in which territories. And we've taken action. We've actually moved away from writing new business in 17 territories for Automobile as an example, where we just didn't have scale.","We're doing the same thing with respect to Personal Property and focusing our investments in the places where we can generate scale. And we recognize that we have to match that world-class loss ratio with an appropriate expense structure. And we are taking steps to do so.","On the acquisition costs I'll just add that really what's driving the acquisition cost is the change in the warranty services structure in the States, where we did introduce a substantial deductible change to the program as we explained a year or so ago. And that is bringing down the loss ratio, which then has the effect of increasing of profit sharing arrangements. And that's what's really driving the specific acquisition ratio.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you so much. And I apologize for that earlier. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start on DIB and GCM. Given the volatility this quarter \u2013 and I know a couple of quarters ago you collapsed DIB and GCM into a single-line item. But I was hoping that you could give us a sense for what its actual contribution was in the quarter? I know you articulated what the shortfall was versus your expectation. And then can you also update us on where the NAV of DIB and GCM was at the end of the quarter? Thank you.","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We're \u2013 Gary (sic) [John], thanks. It's David. We haven't updated the NAV disclosure at this time. You might \u2013 we also did not \u2013 during the quarter did not free up any additional capital from it. So it wouldn't be materially different than it was in prior disclosure. So I would just point you to that.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","And in the actual quarter, David. What was the \u2013 was it a negative contribution?","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Hold on one second. (44:58 \u2013 45:06) Yeah. It was just call it breakeven for the quarter.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the $500 million to $600 million expense save run rate by the end of 2017. Is that a \u2013 should we be thinking about 100% of that being a bottom line impact? Or is there some level of reinvestment that we should be expecting against that number?","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","It'll \u2013 that'll be a net number obviously. There could be some additional reinvestments that we do along the way. But the way to think about the $500 million to $600 million, again along the themes that Peter talked about earlier about driving efficiency, about half of the savings will come from an efficiency play as well as the business rationalization. And there could be some \u2013 Peter, you want to add?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No. I think that we made the decision to talk about the 3% to 5% or $1 billion to $1.5 billion expense number target as a net number. So it's inclusive of substantial and growing investment in technology and growth initiatives. So the number that was cited earlier, the $300 million to $500 million, ebbed into the $500 million, $600 million is related to the specific actions in our announced restructuring charge. So it's really a component of the broader net target.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Understood. Thank you. And then one last one. And that's just on the Fed and SIFI and capital standards and how you're being governed today. I mean for a number of years \u2013 and Bob [Benmosche] used to talk about the embracement of the Fed and their involvement in effectively everything you guys do.","I'm just trying to understand what is it at this point? Do they give tacit approval of your capital actions? And if they do, Peter, what is it based off of? What's the \u2013 what are the primary couple of metrics that we can look at, at least today, that give us a sense for what the Fed is looking at?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well as I mentioned earlier the Fed and any anticipated rules that they may come up with from a capital perspective have absolutely no bearing on our capital returns. The one area where I'd say that they are watching very carefully is to make sure that our internal governance process is up to the highest possible standards.","So that when we do decide to take capital actions that that is not management shooting from the hip, it's management documenting why they decided to do what they do, getting the board fully onboard with that decision, and documenting their board's approval. So it's our own true north of what we think makes sense.","And as I mentioned in the earlier question the binding constraint today is the attitude of the rating agencies. And so where we have incurred additional compliance costs as a result of the Fed's involvement, it's around improving governance and operational risk as opposed to capital.","As I mentioned earlier we de-levered the company and simplified the risk profile so much.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yeah.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","In order to exit early from the government's assistance program, that it just simply, not an issue for us. It's a huge issue for others, and that's why this issue gets so much public discussion. They haven't de-levered their balance sheets yet.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And then lastly I know \u2013 just following up on the rating agency as sort of the primary governor. Obviously one quarter doesn't necessarily change things too dramatically. But do you think the rating agencies buy into a bunch of the adjustments that you guys are citing here when it comes to thinking about interest coverage?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think that interest coverage has been an issue in the past. I think that we've done a lot to change the debt profile by replacing high coupon debt with fresh low coupon debt. But most importantly replacing short term debt with very long term debt. So today we have very little exposure to refinancing risk at all.","And the other thing is that we make less and less of a distinction between financial and operating leverage. Some of our key competitors have perhaps better interest coverage ratio, but a whole lot more leverage in their operating companies than we do.","So I think that there's no single ratio that the rating agencies fixate on. It's a broader set of issues that they look at in terms of our risk management governance and our commitment to using the right kind of criteria for prioritizing business in terms of looking at risk adjusted returns as opposed to simply volume. So the value versus volume is starting to take root in the culture of the company in a way that I think is being noticed by the rating agencies.","But the biggest issue with the rating agencies is seeing a longer track record of stability in the group structure. We had to massively overcapitalize the company in the immediate emergence from the Fed assistance, as a result of the fact that there was no track record of the group as it stood. We had sold so many companies in the immediate aftermath that they wanted to see some stability.","And so that's why it's very important that we maintain a steady process of simplification, as opposed to any radical abruptness, which is simply attract more capital against the uncertainties.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you so much. That's really helpful. And your point on operating versus financial debt is definitely not lost on me. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning. I had a question on UGC. You mentioned PMIERs as being the constraint on capital. But the IAIS has come out with new capital or possible per capital requirements on the HLA that seem to be higher than PMIERs. And I understand that this is not done yet. It still would need to be adopted. But does that higher capital constraint potentially make you think differently about UGC, its capital requirements, and what its long-term future is at AIG?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","No, it's interesting. On the one hand what you say is correct. But the other hand they present value reserves. And so it actually becomes a more benign regime than the PMIERs. So PMIERs is the binding constraint, because it does not present value reserves.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And just a question on Fuji also. I think the way we thought about Fuji and the expenses reduction has been in essence a cliff reduction when the merger actually happens. Are you telling us now that that's more a gradual improvement? And there's still a cliff somewhere out there? Or how would we expect to see that ultimately?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Kevin take that.","Kevin T. Hogan - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer-Consumer Insurance","Yeah. Thanks, Gary. The answer is yes. We have previously characterized the benefits emergence as essentially a cliff after the legal merger date. But we did recognize that our responsibility is to try to extract benefits as early as possible. And we consistently review how it is that we can benefit from the investments that we're making. And we have identified that we can take steps now to begin to extract benefits earlier than what we had previously anticipated.","After the legal merger, of course, there will be further benefits, because we will be able to wind down duplication of systems and product ranges. But, in the meantime, we are able to make progress on combining certain marketing activities and management activities.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And just if I could sneak in one more. On the restructuring charge, is this reaching down into Commercial, Property Casualty people? I mean, is this kind of higher level services that are being affected or is this somehow reorganizing what's going on in the trenches, so to speak?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","So as I mentioned earlier, this is really targeting senior leaders, the top 1,400 of the firm. No area of the firm is left untouched. But it's certainly not just simply a pro rata. It's a thoughtful and selective, very targeted approach, which has been worked on for over 9 months with great attention to how the future mix of business will require leaders.","I'd like to add that these are leaders that have contributed hugely to the transition of the company. And we just \u2013 with a more focused, narrower strategy going forward, we just need fewer generals on the field. And so these are quite talented and highly paid individuals. We just simply need fewer cooks in the kitchen.","Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","All right. Thank you very much for the answers.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. David or Peter, I wonder if you could quantify what the covariance benefit is that the rating agencies give you from the diversification? Or give us some perspective so we can kind of think about it?","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hang on one second. (55:45 \u2013 55:50) I think it's the S&P \u2013 the explicit diversification benefits, I don't know that we have disclosed publicly, but it is quite substantial. It's north of $5 billion in diversification benefits.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Wow. Okay.","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Classified that way.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And then the second question is, Peter, if I look at your corporate expenses, call it around $1 billion a year, and I think you've kind of referred \u2013 you said there's not a lot of people at the holding company. What is that corporate expense? I know some of it's the incentive comp program. So I guess that directly relates down to the subsidiaries. How much of it is truly corporate versus stuff that kind of could be pushed down?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","David, why don't you take that?","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'm sorry. Could you clarify that question again?","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Yeah. So if I look at \u2013 when you disclose a corporate expense number.","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Right? Not including interest. Right? And if I look at that, I know you've run some incentive comp adjustments within that number. I'm just curious what of that is actually true corporate kind of expenses, regulatory, whatever versus stuff that's really related to the operating units?","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","That is primarily a corporate-related, governance-related activity. There's some amount of regulatory in there, obviously. And there's a portion of finance in there. But we do push down quite a bit of expenses. The IT expenses are on a consumption basis. So it is a mixture. It's not one or the other.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you, guys.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think that \u2013 yes. I think philosophically we want to move to a consumption-based transfer pricing mechanism throughout the company. But we are still in a hybrid of historical legacy approaches of allocated cost and historical cost approaches.","So it's a transition to a much more market-driven approach internally to provide appropriate incentives to outsource where it makes sense and insource where it makes sense. But I think that's hopefully helpful for you to see where we are.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. And so I guess you're saying that corporate expense line, there is some that could theoretically, when you do go to a consumption-based approach, that would be pushed down to the operating segments?","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","On a consumption basis but it is also subject to the same expense reduction initiatives that we've outlined.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","David L. Herzog - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And some of what we did this quarter will in fact be evident in that line.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","And generally speaking we've tried very hard to make sure that our frontline businesses are focused on growing marginal profitability and not confusing marginal with fully loaded, where fixed costs are just arbitrarily allocated.","So we've tried to keep fixed cost in more centralized pools, where we have accountable executives to reduce those fixed costs to lower the break-even point for businesses that are subscale but need to grow. We don't want to confuse the strategic signals as to whether it's a unit cost problem or whether there's a lack of scale problem. And that's one of the reasons why we don't just do arbitrary allocation. So that's our approach.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President - Investor Relations","Operator, I think we're at the top of the hour. So I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. And we will certainly get back to anyone who still has questions and was remaining in the queue. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Please go ahead, Ma'am.","Elizabeth Werner","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to AIG's discussion of our second quarter 2013 results. Speaking this morning will be Bob Benmosche, President and CEO, David Herzog, Chief Financial Officer, Peter Hancock, CEO of AIG Property Casualty and Jay Wintrob, CEO of AIG Life and Retirement. Other members of senior management are also in the room and will be available for the question-and-answer period.","Before we get started this morning, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events.","Actual performance and events may differ possibly materially from such forward-looking statements.

The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement, which is available on AIG's website, www.aig.com.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Benmosche","Good morning, everybody and thank you, Liz. I am slide three. Clearly, as you can see, another, and I will underline word, another strong quarter for AIG. We continue to show consistency and we show very strong, across the board, earnings and fundamentals for all of our businesses. So two things that I know that you are focusing on that are not in the strong numbers and that is what's going on with ILFC. So let me deal with that right upfront.","We are continuing to negotiate with the consortium and, keep in mind, we don't have a buyer but we have a group that is buying ILFC. So this is a very complicated transaction based on the nature of the transaction and who are the people that we are negotiating with and expecting to sell to. So we are continuing that dialog. We are continuing those discussions. We did not receive the money on time and now both sides are working on whether we, and how we continue to do this but we are focused on an IPO at this stage of the game, so that if they can come together and the money comes in, then we will proceed. If not, we are preparing ourselves for late of this year, for an IPO where we hope to be able to a deconsolidating trade with ILFC.","We also renamed the SIFI during the quarter which allows us to now deal with the AIG Bank. We had retain the bank and not because we wanted to keep the bank as a business. It's less than $1 billion. So we felt, at this time, to close it but we kept it such as that we would be able to continue having the Federal Reserve in and getting started early with the Federal Reserve so that we are well prepared for when the SIFI designation comes in.","It has come in but we are not under CCAR until late next year possibly or even the first quarter of 2015. So we are still being regulated as a savings and loan holding company and that's how it's proceeding. Although the auditing and the efforts working with the Federal Reserve is about getting ready for our SIFI period of time when we were regulated by those rules and regulations.","We have also named the G-SIFI again by being regulated by the Federal Reserve. We are assuming that will be the lead in this effort as we think about global regulation and we are going to continue to operate that way looking at the fed as the lead regulator working with the others and hopefully that will simplify this very complex regulatory world that we are now facing as the company.","As a result of the strong results of this quarter, and quite frankly all the preceding quarters, we had recommended to the board of directors, and after we review with the rating agencies, who were require to give us their green flag, if you will, on capital management. The board has approved a $0.10 dividend per share as you saw and also allow us just to begin to buy back shares with an authorization of $1 billion.","In addition to that, we said that those are priorities, but capital management on debt is also important, so we reduced our debt. In fact, we have reduced our expense, interest expense by about half the dividend that we are going to be paying out, so we got about $300 million savings and interest and we are talking about if the dividend continues at the rate we are talking about, we are talking about $600 million basically per year, and we are continuing to see strong dividends from our subsidiaries with $1.3 billion of dividends and repayments of insurance company.","Our parent liquidity absent the bank lines, which is on top of this, we have almost $11 billion of cash, so we are really very strong both, from a cash and capital point of view as well as operating results.","Pete is going to about in just a minute the Property Casualty business. It is continuing s strong turnaround. You can see that in the accident year losses, the ability to get rate where it makes sense. We are still growing the topline in very strong way and you can see that our reserve is continuing to be maintained at roughly the levels we think is necessary. The only exception Peter will talk about this is the add to the reserve for storm Sandy, which as you know was a very, very serious storm and a very complicated storm to deal with.","On the Mortgage Guaranty front, we have talked about reengineering business, we have said that we are now on our way with our new approach to risk selection. We think we have got a very good, well thought, state-of-the-art process. In fact, that's in the numbers that you see now it's emerging because about half of our premiums are coming from our performance premium risk selection capability.","You also see new business coming in, so we have the strong reselection model. We are continuing to show a strong growth. And, of course in the legacy book, we still seeing modest decline in our delinquency rates. AIG Life and Retirement, again, a very strong performer over time and for the quarter, variable annuity sales continued to be strong as others struggled with what do with that business. Our mutual funds also are very positive, assets under management continue to grow which is a key measure as you think about this business because you earn piece on assets under management and so it's really very simple method to say that if those are going down dramatically, eventually your piece will start to go down. Here we are seeing good growth and good net flows from our businesses.","Lot of questions about low interest rate, isn't that a problem? Isn't that a problem? It must be a problem? Oh sure it's problem. We have said to you quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter, I guess it sounds like I am repeating myself and I apologize, but I do that once a while. Clearly, the way that Jay's organization is dealing with this and way the investment department is dealing with it, we felt that it was within the realm of being able to manage it without severe problems and you can see again in this quarter, looking at our crediting rates Jay and his team has done an outstanding job of keeping our spreads pretty much what we need them to be.","In addition to that, of course, we have low interest rates putting some pressure on us. You also get the opportunity with the well designed book. You have the earnings benefiting from investment income during this quarter to offset some of that drag. So, bottom line is we are having another great quarter. We are continuing to see strong fundamentals and we are optimistic about our future.","So what I am going to do now is turn it over to David, who will take you through the details of the quarter. David?","David Herzog","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we did deliver another strong operating quarter and we importantly continue to execute on our capital management objectives. With respect to ILFC, I would add that we continue to think of ILFC as a non-core asset. It remains as a held-for-sale asset given our intent and our plans to monetize it through either sale or an IPO as Bob referenced.","On the operating front, we saw solid premium growth and positive pricing in our property casualty business along with continued improvement in accident year loss ratio. Peter will talk about that in a moment. Life and retirement continued to accurately manage spread and it also benefited from strong investment returns.","On the capital management front, we continue to optimize our capital structure and through the first half of the year, we have retired little over $5.5 billion in debt including $2.9 billion in face amount of debt in hybrids that we buy their tender for call or repurchase. Of the total debt that we have retired year-to-date, approximately $1.2 billion of that was associated with the direct investment book.","Going forward, we will opportunistically execute on our share repurchases as well as debt-to-capital management. As Bob mentioned, we reinstituted a dividend and have a further share buyback authorization, both of which point to our positive view of future profitability and capital generation.","Turning to slide four, second quarter operating earnings per share were $1.12, up 17% from a year ago. Operating ROE which excludes AOCI from equity was about 7.4% for the quarter. On a basis consistent with our long-term aspirational goals, which also excludes the deferred tax asset from equity, as we tax effect our operating earnings, the operating ROE was about a 150 basis points higher.","Net income for the quarter was $2.7 billion and includes net realized capital gains and the related DAC and loss recognition effects on those gains, certain legacy legal settlement gains of roughly $260 million net of tax and a deferred income tax valuation allowance release of approximately $700 million associated with our capital loss carry forwards. Inception-to-date, we have been able to recognize a little over 50% of the deferred tax assets on our capital loss carry forwards. Book value per share excluding AOCI was $61.25, up almost 11% from a year ago. Reported book value per share declined during the quarter to just over $66 reflecting the impact from the recent rise in interest rates.","Operating results begin on the slide five. Each of our insurance operating business reported operating income improvements over a year ago driven by favorable fundamentals, and again Peter and Jay will go into further detail. The direct investment booking global capital markets benefited from positive marks in the quarter. The direct investment book earnings were driven by positive, non-agency RMBS marks reflecting housing price appreciation, pre-payments on the underlying collateral and spread tightening.","Global capital markets also benefited from amortizations and market appreciation on the underlying covered security in the legacy multi-sector CDS portfolio. This appreciation reduces the liability we carry on the related CDS. Interest expense for the prior year declined reflecting the interest savings from our liability management actions we have completed thus far. The corporate expenses including the impact incurred during the quarter for continued infrastructure build out were modestly higher than our expected run rate of about $225 million a quarter. There was roughly 20 million or so of corporate expenses related to our data center consolidation that winds down going in to 2014.","Operating results for the quarter included a higher compensation expense related to share-based legacy programs that are tied to changes in AIG stock price. AIG stock price has improved about $6 a share which translates into above $100 million of total compensation expense for the company. The effective operating tax rate was almost 32%, slightly higher than our expected run rate, reflecting certain discrete items in the quarter.","We continue to expect that the operating tax rate will be roughly in the 31% range for the second half of 2013. As you may recall, we will not be paying any U.S. income taxes for some time, given our NOLs which we expect could provide annual liquidity to the parent of approximately $1 billion in 2014 and beyond. Our capital position remains solid and on slide six you can see the current debt levels reflect the nearly $950 million in liability management actions completed in the quarter.","During the quarter, we called our $750 million of our 6.45% hybrids. We call them at par and we purchased nearly $200 million of debt in the open market. Annualized interest savings from the debt we retired this quarter is little over $60 million. And, as Bob referenced, the total savings were the annual activities that we will have completed either through scheduled maturities and the active debt capital management completed for the full year will be about $300 million. We received dividends from our insurance subsidiaries of $1.3 billion in the quarter or $2.7 billion year-to-date, as shown on slide 7. We continue to expect $4 billion, $5 billion in annual dividends and distributions from our insurance subsidiaries, parent company cash and unencumbered securities of approximately $11 billion at the end of the quarter, reflect these distributions and liability management that I referenced earlier.","This liquidity includes about $5.4 billion related to the direct investments book and capital, global capital markets which is currently allocated towards future maturities and liabilities and also contingent liquidity stress needs. Nearly 80% of the direct investment books debt matures by the end of 2018.","And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Peter, to comment further on our Property Casualty business. Peter?","Peter Hancock","Thank you, David. Morning, everybody. AIG Property Casualty results in the second quarter reflect continued progress towards achieving our goals. Our second quarter results were driven by continued underwriting improvements and better than expected alternative investment returns.","Turning to slide 8, net premiums written grew 4%, excluding the effect of movements in the yen and the accounting changes for the excess of loss reinsurance premiums. Price increases and organic growth initiatives, both contributed to this growth. We continue to expect modest net premium growth for the remainder of 2013, as we continue to write profitable new business.","Our accident year loss ratio, as adjusted of 61.9% for the quarter, improved by 2.9 points from the second quarter of 2012 and was slightly better than trend. The improvement is due to business mix shift, continued enhanced risk selection, loss mitigation initiatives and positive pricing. Importantly, we see no signs that the trend is changing.","Operating income was nearly $1.1 billion and included catastrophe losses of $316 million from flooding in Europe and the Americas as well as U.S. tornadoes and hail storms. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development for the quarter totaled $154 million net of premium adjustments largely from additional losses on storm Sandy of a $142 million. These losses resulted from higher severities on a small number of existing large and complex commercial claim notification. The increased severity was driven by a number of factors, including the extensive damage caused to properties in the downtown Manhattan Metropolitan area. On a year-to-date basis, net prior year development was favorable by $40 million if you exclude development related to Storm Sandy and was unfavorable by a $102 million including it.","Turning to slide nine, commercials net premium written on a reported basis grew by 5.5% from a year ago, or 3.6% excluding foreign exchange and the accounting change for excess of loss reinsurance. We saw growth in property, financial lines and specialty, which all benefited from improved retentions, new business and pricing.","In the U.S., we saw rate increases of 7.3% for the quarter led by U.S. casualty with 9.4%. Property and financial lines in the U.S. reported positive rates of 5.7% and 6.8%, respectively. The market remains modestly more competitive outside of the U.S., but we continue to be encouraged by casualty pricing in the U.S. where rate is most needed. Our efforts to optimize mix, enhanced, risk selection, claims handing improvements and increased pricing have lowered the accident year loss ratio for commercial to 62.2%, down over five points from the year ago quarter.","Turning to slide 10, consumer net premiums written grew about 5% excluding foreign exchange and the excess of loss reinsurance accounting change. Accidents and health experienced growth outside the U.S. particularly in individual A&H in Asia-Pacific as well as in direct marketing. Net premiums written for our direct marketing business grew 5% for the second quarter of 2012 and accounted for 16% of total consumer net premiums written.","Consumer acquisition ratios increased a little over two points from last year and reflected our investment in the profitable direct marketing channel and other channels. The bulk of these costs are non-deferrable under U.S. GAAP accounting rules. Personal lines benefited from improved margins related to our Japanese auto business and should continue to improve through the remainder of the year.","Slide 11 illustrates our investment portfolio mix. Second quarter net investment increased 14% reflecting strong performance of equity partnership investments and fair value increases associated with PICC Property Casualty shares that were purchased during the second quarter and for which we elected the fair value option. As a result of our strong alternative investment return and the PICC gain, net investment income was about a $150 million above our expected return.","We made $792 million in dividend payments to AIG parent in the second quarter and look forward to contributing our planned dividends to the holding company during the remainder of the year. The second quarter marked continued progress towards increasing the intrinsic value of AIG Property Casualty. Our shift to high value business combined with underwriting and claims practice improvements, exemplified how our focus on balancing growth, profitability and risk is helping to produce better margins. We maintain our commitment to capital efficiency and optimizing our risk profile.","As part of our continuing legal entity and capital restructuring efforts, we recently announced the planned merger of AIU and Fuji Fire and Marine companies in Japan. We expect synergies from merging these large companies and will result in improved customer service, greater management efficiency as well as to provide us with greater capital flexibility and expense savings. In closing, I am satisfied with our positive momentum and I am confident that the progress we made this quarter will continue.","Turning to slide 12, our mortgage guarantee business reported operating income of $73 million, which represented another quarter of improved profitability and growth in new business. Delinquency counts continued to fall, and in the second quarter, half of earned premiums related to high quality business written after 2008. Mortgage guarantee results for the quarter also benefited from $49 million of income associated with commutations, settlements and reserve releases. We believe UGC is well positioned to take advantage of the mortgage insurance market. The quality of the business written since 2008, improvements in home pricing and increasing home sales should drive future profitability and allow UGC to capitalize on its unique underwriting approach, risk based pricing and strong capital position.","Now I would like to turn it over to Jay.","Jay Wintrob","Thank you, Peter and good morning everyone. I am going to begin on slide 13 where you can see that AIG Life and Retirement delivered solid results this quarter with operating income of $1.2 billion up 23% from a year ago. This increase reflects growth in variable annuity fee income, effective spread management and higher investment returns. Premiums and deposits grew 24% from a year ago largely due to individual variable annuity sales which exceeded $2 billion in the quarter.","Net investment income increased 5% from the year ago period driven primarily by higher returns in our alternative investment portfolio. Now this was partially offset by $84 million fair value loss we reported on our investment in PICC Group shares this quarter which we now hold slightly above cost.","We continued our strategy of actively managing spreads in our interest-sensitive businesses. Our strong results this quarter enabled us to provide additional liquidity to AIG parent. And, as David mentioned, Life and Retirement paid $545 million in distributions to AIG in the quarter and $1.9 billion during the first half of the year.","We are on track to meet our expected dividend payments for the full year. Assets under management grew 10% from a year ago, driven by increases across our business lines with strong account value growth in individual variable annuities and group retirement as well as additional institutional assets accumulated to our Stable Value Wrap business.","Net flows increased substantially from the prior quarter and the year ago period, reflecting robust sales of variable annuities and retail mutual funds. With the recent rise in interest rates, we saw the unrealized gain position and our general account partially erode, dampening the increase in AUM in the quarter. Rising interest rates, however, have a positive impact on sales and earnings in our interest-sensitive businesses in particular, which I will elaborate on later in my comments.","To provide additional insight in into the diversity of our businesses, this quarter on page 13, we added disclosure on our assets under management by product line. Our scale and highly diverse business mix provide a strong platform for growth and enable us to perform well in various market environments.","Slide 14, further illustrates the diversity of our businesses based on earnings contribution. The solid performance this quarter reflects favorable trends across both, the Retail and Institutional segments. The growth of our retirement Income Solutions business is a good example of our ability to be opportunistic while maintaining our pricing and risk management discipline. After significant de-risking of living benefit features beginning back in 2010, we continue to benefit from strong demand for a variable annuity product and remain comfortable with the current trajectory of our sales run rate.","At quarter end, our variable annuity account value including both, fixed and separate accounts was $32 billion in our retail or individual variable annuity business and $52 billion in our group variable annuity business. Because of our large presence in qualified plans in the group business, 69% of our total variable annuity AUM provide only a guaranteed minimum debt benefit with no guaranteed lifetime benefits. In addition, 77% of our GMDB by account value is in the lower risk return of premium or roll ups that revert to return of premium at age 70.","Of our $22 billion of variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, 59% are in benefits with strong de-risking features, such as VIX Index fees, volatility control fund requirements and required minimum allocations to fixed accounts, so the combination of a relatively small legacy block and enhanced risk control in our current features has allowed us to capitalize on opportunities when competitors have chosen or have been forced to pull back from the market.","Now in addition, this quarter we introduced a new suite of fixed index annuities with living benefits to further diversify and enhance our guarantee income offerings. In our interest-sensitive businesses in both, the retail and institutional segments, we continued our strategy of active spread management to enhance profitability. And with the recent rise in interest rates, we are seeing an acceleration in sales of our fixed annuities, which we re-price weekly and we are encouraged by these initial indications as it remains our view that a moderately rising rate environment will be positive for our operating fundamentals.","Slide 15 and 16 depict our investment portfolio, composition, returns and yields. Overall, base yield improved slightly in the quarter benefiting from mortgage loan prepayments and increased accretion income principally from structured securities. These were partially offset by the impact of investment purchases made at yields lower than the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio. Our total or reported yield reflects strong alternative investment returns partially offset by the fair value loss in PICC Group shares, which I mentioned earlier.","Net spreads benefited from our active spread management actions principally the lowering of renewal crediting rates and maintaining disciplined new business pricing. At the end of the second quarter, approximately 74% of our fixed annuity and Universal Life account values were at minimum guarantee crediting rates and we remained focused on managing spreads actively.","To sum up, we are pleased with our solid earnings and distributions to parent through the first half of the year. We will remain focused on executing our growth strategies by leveraging our strong relationships with distribution partners to increase profitable sales of our broad product portfolio across all channels while continuing to look for opportunities to grow our businesses, where we can achieve the most attractive risk adjusted returns.","And now, I will turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.","Elizabeth Werner","Thank you, Jay. Operator, can we please open the line for questions now?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Mr. Shankar your line is open, sir. If the line is muted, please unmute the phone line.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities","Sorry, hello. Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. As the capital return story unfolds and you get dividends from your subs, maybe ILFC closes, I am wondering in the conversations you have had with the rating agencies. What kind of mix of a debt retirement versus share repurchase are you thinking to keep in good stead with them?","Robert Benmosche","We have not had that level of conservation. We go to the rating agencies when we have something specific to say we want to do but as overarching, we continue to focus on. We are taking care of the dividend doesn't mean we might want to increase that but our focus is on debt and share buybacks. But, Dave, do you want to comment?","David Herzog","Yes. Thanks, Bob, and good morning, Josh. As we think about our capital management where we have discussed in the past, a targeted capital structure and where we are nearing that optimal mix of debt and capital. We still do have some expensive hybrids out that are of interest to us but that will occur overtime. We have taken an approach with the agencies, with the other various stakeholders with respect to our capital management that we first raise the deployable capital, get it to the holding company, we then run through a rigorous set of internal stress tests and analytics and then we consider the best way to deploy the capital. So we do not get up in front of ourselves with respect to spending it before we get it.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities","Understandable, and Peter, can you talk a little bit about where you are in Sandy in terms of approaching the full limit of your deductible for the reinsurance?","Peter Hancock","We haven't disclosed the attachment point on the reinsurance but suffice it to say that we don't expect to pierce it. But on the other hand, we are not too far from it when you actually look at what we expect the ultimate to be. But where we are in terms of the remaining tail, we are about 50% settled and about a third paid, cash out the door and on the Sandy claims. But there is a still a number of repairs underway, as we speak. So it will be probably another quarter before we really get to a final number.","Operator","We will take our next question from with Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","I was wondering if you could go in just a little bit more detail in to the steps that allowed you to announce the dividend and the repurchase ? I guess I am surprised that you were able to do this before the ILFC transaction. So may be you could just talk little bit more about how that process worked in terms of discussions with the regulators as well as your own thinking? And what's left is, that's contingent if anything on capital management given the ILFC transaction?","Robert Benmosche","I am not sure I understand the last question. You want to know how much more I am going to do, but I am not sure I would give you a specific answer, so let me give you a general answer. The way you look at we did it, I know you are going to think I am being pride, but I am not. The fact is, you first get your fundamentals right, make sure the company is operating well, make sure all of the buckets of risks have been accounted for and we have a very or we need to improve our stress testing, we have to improve the systems, improve the process, improve the automation to be much more industrial strength in terms of what we do. We have a process that we know works well and so you really need to satisfy yourselves as a management team that we can afford to do a capital management. That's number one.","Number two, we then sit down with the rating agencies and walk through what we want to do and they give us their opinion based upon the information we provided them and the track record we are showing them and then we spend considerable time with our board of directors who want to make sure that we are not being premature and some of the things we want to do as the management team and we spend a great deal of time with the board in detail taking them through our whole capital planning process, taking them through our stress testing. For example, our stress testing is basically modeled using a lot of the information from the Federal Reserve, but as I have said before when you think about, I think it's a shame that America doesn't understand the amount of stress testing that is done at financial institutions to make sure thinking about being too big to fail. They can't fail, because what they are required to maintain on their book.","So, for AIG, we go through a process over the planning period of 2013 and 2014, what would happen if we underperformed our profit budget by $23 billion, what happens during that same time if the S&P is down close to 700? What happens if the credit aspect of credit spread non-interest rate-sensitive, but what happens if we have a period of [in line] and you pick any other periods, so credit spreads widened dramatically about 400 basis points. At the same time, what happens if unemployment doesn't go in the 10s, but goes to 12.5%?","By the way if that's not enough, what would happen to AIG if in fact housing prices were to drop 20% from here knowing the amount of mortgages we have on our books positive mortgage insurance businesses as well. And, by the way since you are an insurance company, why don't you throw a storm Sandy in there and make sure that you got enough money to cover that storm at the same time. That's in English what a stress bust is and I have given it to you a 10,000 feet and we show the board that after all of that, we could maintain our CMA levels, maintain the risk based capital in this company at those levels which are required for our ratings.","I would think if that kind of scenario occurred, the states would be really pleased that we could at least meet our minimum regulatory requirements and work our way back up. We are not talking about minimums. We are talking about the CMA levels, so based upon that the board said, we think it's down for you to at this time proceed with your dividend and proceed with a $1 billion share buyback. If ILFC closes or when ILFC closes, the board and we will look at what we prepare, we will then update our stress test, update the information we will share with the board, we will share with the rating agencies. And based upon all of that, the board will make a decision and so that's how the process works.","I know people are asking about did the Fed approve. The fed does not approve these things. The Fed oversees what we are doing. And if the fed felt at any point in time that we are doing something as the savings and loan holding company, they would go and say, look I think you are being imprudent, but they don't approve things.","Once we get under the CCAR test, however, then they will in fact look at our CCAR, look at the amount of capital we have and look at the process we have in place to calculate that information and based upon the quality of our systems, we have a runway to get there and we are working hard alone that runway and that's why we wanted actually people thought \"Are you nuts? Why would you want to start early?\"","It is because you want to get prepared so that you have an acceptable process and it's a repeatable process such that the Fed is very comfortable that not only do you have numbers that say you are okay but you have a process that says that your numbers are okay. That's all what we are working towards and that's something at the end of '14, into early '15.","Our effort is now making sure we live with the first half of what I said and that is we run the company the right way and we will be prudent. Long-winded answer, I apologize, but I know lot of you are trying to figure out what happened here and it's what we said all along, when we are ready, we will.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","No. that was the terrific answer. Thank you very much. It's very helpful.","Operator","We will take our next question from with Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A couple of questions. I guess, just a follow up on that last one. So while the Fed didn't explicitly approve this, you obviously had discussions with them prior to making this announcement.","Robert Benmosche","We informed the Fed of everything we are doing of any consequence, so that they are aware of any issues we have. So they don't read about it in the paper. So yes, there are our regulator. They are in many of our meetings. They are in my of leadership meetings, attending. So this is important that you keep your regulator understanding what you are doing and you are very transparent with that regulator. So they are aware of not only this, but everything else we are doing.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great.","Robert Benmosche","And by the way, Jay, the key is the rating agencies and right now, that's where we go and if the rating agencies said we are having some concerns with what you are doing, I can assure you, we would not have done it.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Exactly. Second question. I know the details of any prior year development will come out in the Cuba. Peter, I am wondering if you can talk excluding the Sandy development, what you saw? Were there any particular lines where there was material adverse development.","Peter Hancock","No, it's very benign. Everything was immaterial in the context of our reserves. So I don't know, Jay, if you have any bigger comments.","Jay Wintrob","Yes, I certainly agree with the way Peter described it. We had some movement up and down or I guess within casualty some loss sensitive adjustments that were offset by premium accruals but outside of that, we had bit of a adverse development in a construction defect related claims out of the program that's been in run off for a number of years, largely around legal expenses but inconsequential and immaterial relative to the total.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great. Thank you.","Peter Hancock","And yes, we have had a slight favorable in Japan consumer.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Can you give us a sense as how long you think it would take to complete the $1 billion buyback authorization?","Robert Benmosche","I would appreciate giving you all advanced notice but we will continue to do what's prudent, and we will continue to evaluate different options and different techniques and we will let you know when we are done and we will keep you posted as we are buying back what the average price per share is.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","In terms of future buybacks on top of this authorization, does the sale or IPO of ILFC need to be complete before we can expect additional buybacks through this authorization?","Robert Benmosche","What I have said on one of the other question, we look at our capital, we look at our results, we look at how we are faring, we do our stress testing, we update our stress testing throughout the year and we would continue to do what we think is prudent and for AIG. So if ILFC were to close and depending upon what kind of transaction we do, we would factor it into our thinking?","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Okay, and then for Peter, based on the first half results, it still appears that there is five points to 10 points of combined ratio improvement that's needed to get to that 90% to 95% calendar year goal by 2015. What's your confidence level in achieving that?","Peter Hancock","Well, I think that I listed out the various initiatives that have led to the trend in accident year loss ratio improvement that we have had now for ten quarters and I think there is no that any of those initiatives are sort of experiencing diminishing return. So, eventually, obviously, we will experience diminishing returns, but we are making a good progress on all of them.","The actuaries take time to recognize initiatives that are emerging in the loss triangles, but may not be confirmed with enough statistical significance yet, so we have sort of some line of sight into the sort of future momentum. Obviously, pricing is outside of our control, but again as I mentioned, where we felt there was the greatest pricing inadequacy in the U.S. casualty lines, we have seen quite good pricing trends. And in Europe, where the pricing has been a bit softer, we already had pretty decent adequacies, so I see no change in my level of confidence that we will accomplish that target.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Great. Then in the meantime, does that also mean you have confidence in the adequacy of AIG's overall property casualty reserve position?","Peter Hancock","Yes.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","Hi. Good morning. The first question is on the P&C business. Your expense ratio picked up a little bit, sequentially, and I think you talked in the past about expenses being elevated in the near-term as you are investing in the business, but then starting to improve sometime in 2014 and beyond. Are you still comfortable with that?","Then on the ILFC transaction, I don't think there is a breakup fee. And, when you talk about deconsolidating trade, I am assuming you are implying over a 50% sale, but I just wanted to make sure that that's correct.","The last question is, on the fixed annuity business. We have seen industry sale improve as rates have gone up. Your sales sequentially were actually down and your surrenders were up, not sure that's because the lock is aging or what's going on there?","Peter Hancock","As I have said before on the expenses, yes we are spending on infrastructure and a number of analytical resources, data improvements that are integral to our improved risk selection and claims handling, so we are seeing benefits in the loss ratio offset by increases in the GOE ratio and we continue to invest in acquisition costs. So, the overall expense ratio remains elevated. I would expect the GOE Ratio to come down as you point out in the sort of mid-2014 period, so a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of the investments will start to tail off.","The one area though I would point out where there may be slightly more delayed expense benefits is what I announced in the comments earlier, which is the merger savings between AIU and Fuji Fire and Marine, which is a very substantial merger integration effort that will take some time to execute because of the sheer scale of it. It's between the two companies almost 6,000 people, so it's very substantial.","Peter Hancock","Jay, why don't you cover the fixed annuity comment and then turn it over to David, who will finish up with a question on ILFC?","Jay Wintrob","Great. Thanks. Jimmy I think your presumption is correct. Being the largest in the fixed annuities, we probably have the biggest block is aging, and that's as expected leading to higher surrenders which because of the vast majority of those surrenders are from contracts with high guaranteed minimum interest rates, 3% and above in some cases, that's actually a very good thing from a profitability standpoint.","We did see some interesting competitors come in early in the quarter and increase their sales. We stuck with our pricing discipline as we always do. Having said that, late in the quarter and through the month of July as I mentioned earlier, we have begun to see an acceleration in sales of fixed annuities now that rates have spiked up, so the block is behaving as expected, and again the vast majority what's surrendering is at high guaranteed minimum interest rates.","Peter Hancock","I would just follow up and we have said this I believe on our previous call and that is, Jay and his team are holding through a very strong discipline. Because, when you think about rising interest rates and I don't need to if you look at book values this quarter, you all understand it clearly of what can happen with rising interest rates. You don't want to have a very tightly priced fixed annuity books at these rates right now. If you do see a couple of 100 basis points rise, that will be very helpful for AIG and for Jay's business but if you have a large block of low interest rate annuities, fixed annuities in that kind of environment, you could see some expenses disintermediation. So a part of our hedging strategy is to make sure we don't have an oversized book at these levels that we have to worry about rates going up and what happened to that block. So I think right now we see rising interest rates at least for the first couple of hundred basis points is a big positive for the company.","David Herzog","And Jimmy, it's David, with respect to your ILFC question. As I said in my remarks, ILFC is a non core asset and we will pursue our plan to dispose of it, either through a sale or through an IPO. With respect to the sale, again you would ask about the breakup fee, the deposit is not a break up fee but we will protect our rights through that deposit. So that's all I would say with respect to that.","Then, with respect to the 51%, yes, that is the level at which we see deconsolidate it and we, of course, would evaluate market conditions and valuations, et cetera, at the time of an idea to optimize the value of that monetization for the benefit of AIG and our stakeholders. So we haven't set any term in notion, but we will optimize the value.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","Then protecting, I don't understand what protecting the rights on the deposit means. Maybe you could discuss?","David Herzog","Well, we just said, that is not as any more than that. This will protect them. It's not a breakup fee, which was your question and we will pursue our rights under the terms of the contract.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","Alright, that's what I thought. Maybe if I could just ask one more. I think Peter mentioned that the actuaries are being somewhat conservative in their loss fix. So I am assuming that that's implying that there is some level of cushion in your reserving. Is that the right read? If that is the case, then how do you reconcile that with the fact that if we look at the last six quarters, you have had, I think, four of those quarters, where you had actually adverse reserve development?","David Herzog","What he said was, let me be really clear, that in total you see the emergence of a pattern that the actuaries are comfortable with is not a short-term lift but in fact but that's what we call vectors in math but you tend to look at it over an extended period of time, then you have a clear pattern. Until that emerges, they are not going to make some early judgments. The judgments they make or what they believe is the best estimate and the most accurate estimate based on the data that they are seeing. So they want to see more of a measurable period before they make any judgment. So that's what he said and so don't misinterpret it.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","Alright, thank you.","Peter Hancock","And I would also add that the reserve adjustments that you witnessed in the last two and a half years have been largely related to older accident years and I have been talking about accident year loss ratios and the impact of new underwriting guidelines and risk selection techniques. So they will take longer to emerge. So I think they are really separate issues.","Operator","We will take our next question from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks for having us on the call and congratulations on a good quarter and exciting news. So a question on capital returns. When you began this journey, you guided to $25 billion to $30 billion of capital management. So rough math, I think you are somewhere around $9 billion to $14 billion remaining by 2015. As you are now finally being allowed act like a normal company, should investors expect measured regular and recurring buybacks like we see at your peers or is this something where we should expect this to be very opportunistic and episodic as we have seen over the past couple of years?","Robert Benmosche","I am going to turn it over to David but I would say that first, really we said dividends, capital management but our first priority is to find businesses that maybe strategic and make sense for AIG and are not close closed blocks, but growing blocks. So we like to continue to invest our money in those businesses.","We are going to continue to look at the best way to deploy our capital with the stock price as you saw last night, we are at that and you have our book value and you see what's going on. Obviously as you get closer and closer to book, you want to think more carefully about what you are doing. As you get order book, you think a lot about what you want to do, so I think all of that is an over arching concept which is not new.","David, wants to talk about the particulars on our aspirational goals.","David Herzog","Thanks, Josh. Again to recap, we have done a total to-date of about little over $18 billion. With the $13 billion of equity we did last year equity buyback, little over $3 billion of debt capital management going after some of the callable, very expensive hybrids the recent share buyback we just announced on the authorization and then the couple of years worth of the dividend they sort of add up to $18 billion. And you are right, so we have got 7 to 12 to go and I think with the fundamental foundation as we said is we have raised the deployable capital to the holding company and a very important part of that is the dividend flows that both Jay and Peter referred to is, raise the deployable capital.","In addition to that, we have the ILFC proceeds that are unencumbered of the holding company and I also referenced in my comments about the tax sharing payments that in '14 should be in the $1 billion range and they grow from there and they are annual after that, so as you can see a path and we can see a path to raising the deployable capital on the net debt is input to the framework that Bob laid out in terms of how we and how the board and the various stakeholders think about how we go about deploying it. It's likely. Again, it's going to be opportunistic as we have done in the past. [It is going]. We will be prudent and I think Bob laid out a very clear framework for how we think about it and how you should think about it.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities","Thank you. If I might switch to Peter, as you have made a really relatively dramatic progress in accident year loss ratios and combined ratios in P&C commercial and it's great to see that playing out. The question I would ask is, as you sort of continue the journey to get to low 90s combined ratio, the consumer lines don't seem to be sort of go in the same direction and looks like maybe there is some noise in the quarter, but just generally I wonder if you can give us some more color on the relative magnitude of some of the key levers and sort of how you think about the status of the initiatives on that side of the house?","Peter Hancock","Sure. So the big noise in the quarter is the yen exchange rate, so there is a very, very portion of our consumer business in Japan, so you need to strip that out before you even think about it. There's I think some significant opportunities in Japan to improve profitability as we talked about in terms of both, the expenses but also as we reinvigorate the brand in Japan.","Outside of Japan, there's another sort of one-off item that came through the loss ratio, but not net income which is in one very large extended warranty program where there is an offsetting profit sharing agreement that is not in this. It's an issue geography on the income statement, so that's a one-off adjustment you need to make when you look at the loss ratio in second quarter. Beyond that, I think that the emerging market story is very positive in terms of long-term profitability and growth, but the start up costs of that are quite substantial so that adds to the expense ratio.","We have talked many times about the direct marketing business, which we feel has excellent lifetime profitability over customer relationships, but has pretty unfavorable GAAP accounting, so we want to take a measured approach to how much of that we do, but we like it from a marginal ROE point of view over the lifetime of the customer relations based on the persistency that we have been seeing in that book. So we will be doing that in a number of additional countries. So I think, in general, we see continued growth in consumer. I think we have opportunities to focus more than we do today. We operate in 90 countries. So I think that that will bring some efficiency gains and the conversions to common technology platforms will make it also more efficient.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","Great, thank you. Keep up the good work.","Elizabeth Werner","Operator, I think since we are getting close to 9:00, we will only be able to take one more question but please reach out after the call with your additional questions and we will certainly do our best to follow up as soon as possible.","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. We will take our final question from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","Good morning everybody. Maybe I will start with Peter on international commercial. The numbers were just a little bit lighter than I had expected, maybe user error. But I guess the way I would frame up the question is, and I get the point about less need for rate than you have in North America, but are you satisfied with these margins? And do you feel like you need to improve them on a core basis in terms of achieving your overall targets?","Jay Wintrob","I think that, again a little bit of a foreign exchange element in terms of the topline there. There is continued opportunities for streamlining technology and reaping the full benefits of legal entity consolidation. As you may know, at the end of last year we consolidated our 25 European countries in to one legal entity and that's starting to give us efficiencies but on the capital efficiency that hasn't fully come through. But in general, the international business has a better ROE because it's shorter tail, less dependent on investment income. I would say that the success of our commercial property business internationally has been very pleasing. We have seen a good take up rate about large and highly engineered property activities, further diversifying our book away from overconcentration in U.S. commercial property. So I don't know whether, Jon, you want to elaborate on your level of satisfaction with international operations?","John Doyle","Yes, I see an opportunity for us to continue to grow that business. Peter mentioned the FX pressure from Japan. That obviously had an impact on the topline in the quarter but we saw, outside of Japan, the rest of Asia, 18% growth in the quarter, Middle East and Africa 19% growth, 27% growth in Latin America. Obviously those are smaller parts of our overall commercial insurance franchise. In terms of pricing or rate adequacy on a major line basis, right, so if you think of it from a property casualty financial lines and specialty point of view, all of our major regions outside of the United States in those major lines cover their cost of capital currently. There are some opportunities for margin improvement and obviously there are some smaller lines that, in any given jurisdiction, have some profitability challenges that we will always be dealing with. There were some caps in the quarter, right, as well. Argentina, a modest amount in Australia, and then the flooding in Europe as well. So all those events had an impact on the bottomline in the quarter, but we think we are very well positioned outside of the United States and inside of the United States, but we see good opportunities for profitable growth throughout the rest of the world.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","Okay, maybe a question on the div. I think every quarter I look at my model and what you guys produced in at least for the four or five, I feel like the div has beaten my expectations pretty widely in a lot of cases. I guess you have got 80% of the maturities coming within 2018, I think you said. Maybe the way to ask a question is, how far do you think we are from that so called intrinsic value and is there any framework for how to think about div earnings, going forward?","Robert Benmosche","Brian, do you want to cover that for us as we close down the call.","Brian Schreiber","Sure, I would be happy to, and again the performance of the div is not going to be linear. We have had more conditions that have us to recognize the gains you have seen over the last few quarters. As we talked about, we gave some rough ideas of what we think to pull to intrinsic is. At the end of the last quarter, we said it was around $5 billion, little under $5 billion. We had approximately 750 or so of gain and we have also sold some assets and did to the operating companies. So those, the gains and the sales of assets reduced that future upside, so if you think about it now at around $4.1 billion, $4.2 billion, that's probably where we are.","But another way to think about it is, if you look at the debt capital, the NAV of the debt and you look composition of the assets, you could think about it as having roughly a 10% return on that capital over time. Again, that's probably the simplest way to think about if you are trying to model and this will come in again over time. We could have down quarters. Again, a lot of it depends on the market, but I think from the sort of 2018 period forward, you are probably looking at six to eight years before you see a bulk of that capital start freeing up and coming through.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Elizabeth Werner","Thank you again for joining us this morning. Certainly, if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to ask and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Our Chief Investment Officer, Doug Dachille, is also joining us this morning in the room.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Hancock.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter call. In today's call, I'll highlight unusual items in the quarter. And importantly, I'll provide an update on our progress in executing on our strategic plan, which we presented on January 26. We and the board feel that our plan maximizes franchise value for all stakeholders and is based on achievable goals. This quarter is a further step in providing additional transparency to assess our progress towards our goals.","Before I comment on the quarter, I want to mention yesterday's news that our Board of Directors agreed to expand the size of AIG's board from 14 to 16 seats. We believe this resolution is in the best interests of all our stakeholders, and most importantly allows us to focus on executing our strategic plan.","Our fourth quarter results were impacted by our actions to strengthen reserves and the lower returns on alternative investments. As we have previously disclosed, we completed a number of in-depth reserve reviews of our long-tail lines, and we responded quickly to new information. As part of our strategic plan, we announced our intentions to reduce and narrow our hedge fund allocation, which we believe will lead to greater risk-adjusted returns and contribute to our $25 billion return of capital through 2017.","During the fourth quarter we took a number of actions towards our goal of being a more streamlined, focused insurer. Importantly, I announced a smaller executive leadership team, a management structure that has already resulted in increased accountability across our businesses and accelerated our decision-making. This team is already executing on our strategic plan, and today you'll hear from some of them directly.","Core to our strategic plan are the organizational changes, strategic actions, and operating improvements which we presented on January 26. On the organizational front, the adoption of a modular approach to our business and the creation of our legacy portfolio are important steps to improving transparency into the performance of our operating portfolio.","In the quarter, we announced the sale of PICC shares and took additional actions to monetize legacy portfolio assets, which Sid will speak to. We're well on our way to achieving the targeted $9 billion in legacy capital release by 2017. The fourth quarter strategic actions are the foundations for the $25 billion of capital return that we expect over the next two years.","For the full year 2015, we returned approximately $12 billion to shareholders, and we expect a similar pace to continue. Yesterday's announced additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization and 14% increase in our dividend is consistent with the path towards returning the $25 billion over two years, or over a third of our market capitalization.","We also announced the sale of our advisor group, which we expect to close in the second quarter, and plans for an IPO of a portion of our interest in UGC. UGC is the market leader in the mortgage insurance industry.","Finally, we are aggressively pursuing operating performance improvements, and you'll see that our progress on operating expense reduction supports our conviction in achieving $1.6 billion in gross operating expense reductions through the end of 2017.","Today, we will also provide additional insight into our actions to improve our Commercial Property and Casualty accident year loss ratio. On slide four, we reaffirm the targets that we discussed in January and a year ago. We stand by our plan and look forward to sharing our progress with you on an ongoing basis.","Before Sid begins his remarks on the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the great contribution that David Herzog has made to AIG. David has devoted the last 16 years to the company and was essential to our emerging from the financial crisis and positioned the company for its continued future success. His guidance and stewardship of our financials continues to be highly valued, and he'll be missed by many here at the company.","Sid will now provide you with the financial highlights of the quarter.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will speak to our quarterly financial results, progress made on our expense initiatives, our continued active capital management, and certain strategic actions impacting 2016 results.","Turning to slide five, as Peter stated, the fourth quarter operating loss per share of $1.10 was primarily due to the reserve strengthening and weaker alternative returns in both the Commercial and Consumer segments. As I stated on the January 26 call, we believe our reserving actions this quarter will help mitigate the risk of future volatility around our best estimate.","The reserve strengthening in accident years 2011 through 2014 was driven by greater actual versus expected loss emergence for primary and excess auto liability, healthcare, and financial lines. The impact of revised tail factors based on emergence in earlier accident years also contributed to the adverse development for excess casualty and financial lines. Of note, financial lines remain well above our current profitability targets.","Our reported operating tax rate for the quarter was just shy of 39% due to the pre-tax operating loss and the impact of other discrete tax items reducing our tax expense. We expect our operating effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 32%.","Turning to slide six, total general operating expenses declined 6% in the quarter and 3% for the full year on a constant dollar basis, a rate that is expected to accelerate under our current strategic plan. Included in our 2015 results are approximately $145 million of expenses related to the acquisition of four companies in the calendar year, offset by approximately $125 million representing the non-recurring portion of the pension curtailment gain.","In addition, we recognized another $222 million in pre-tax non-operating restructuring charges in the quarter, $123 million of which relates to the restructuring charge we announced in the third quarter of this year. The remaining $99 million relates to new actions, primarily for additional staff reductions that will result in at least another $200 million reduction in our annual expense run rate.","Taken together, the actions announced in the third and fourth quarters of this year will reduce our annual expense run rate by approximately $700 million to $800 million. We anticipate that we will achieve the majority of these savings by the second half of 2016. These actions, along with other initiatives we are undertaking, give us confidence we will achieve our $1.4 billion net reduction by 2017.","Slide seven shows our continued execution against our capital management targets. During the quarter we deployed over $3.2 billion towards the purchase of approximately 53 million common shares. This year we have purchased an additional $2.5 billion of common shares through February 11. This leaves about $800 million unused under the $3 billion authorization that we announced in December plus an additional $5 billion from the new authorization that Peter referenced.","We also announced an increase in our dividend of 14%, which is consistent with our positive view of sustainable profitability. From the standpoint of total capital return to shareholders, our annual dividend payment is approximately $1.5 billion based on our current outstanding shares, and that amount is included in the $25 billion in capital return we discussed in our strategic update.","At year end, we had $9.2 billion of parent liquidity, as you can see on slide eight. While we manage our liquidity within a target range of $6 billion to $8 billion, we may be slightly higher or lower from this range from time to time.","Cash inflows from the insurance subsidiaries during the quarter were approximately $400 million, reflecting our annual fourth quarter true-up of tax-sharing payments. As we said at the strategy update call, we expect $7 billion to $10 billion in dividends and tax-sharing payments over the next two years, which are net of parent and interest expense and the $2.9 billion capital contribution made to the PC subsidiaries in January.","Slide nine depicts the composition of our legacy portfolio. As we said in our strategic update call, we are creating a legacy portfolio which contains roughly a quarter of the company's total equity. Legacy will consist of actively-managed runoff businesses or non-core assets and liabilities that we are targeting for maximum value. Our actions as they pertain to the legacy portfolio focus on how quickly we can extract capital by either divestitures, reinsurance, or other efficient runoff methods without giving away too much value. In the fourth quarter we monetized $2.1 billion of legacy portfolio assets, including a portion of our stake in PICC, which we previously disclosed, and certain DIB assets as well as some internal sales of assets to our insurance businesses.","Legacy portfolio capital declined $5 billion in the quarter to approximately $17 billion, driven by the $3.6 billion of buybacks and dividends in the quarter, which were partially funded by the monetization of legacy assets. The reduction in the legacy portfolio capital was also impacted by the additional NOLs created during the quarter, largely as a result of the reserve strengthening we previously announced.","Slide 10 presents the composition of our deferred tax assets. During the year we utilized about $600 million of foreign tax credits. NOLs increased by roughly $1 billion, also primarily as a result of the reserve strengthening we mentioned before.","Finally, I would like to cover two of the strategic actions that will impact our earnings in 2016. The first is our planned life reinsurance transactions, which are intended to address the approximately 40% of redundant reserves in our U.S. life companies that have not already been financed. We expect these transactions will optimize our capital and generate $4 billion to $5 billion of additional liquidity to the parent through a combination of dividends and tax-sharing payments. This will also result in annual reduction in net investment income of approximately $200 million to $250 million beginning in 2017. There will be only a modest impact to net investment income in 2016 as transactions are being finalized.","Secondly, we are reallocating roughly 50% of our hedge fund portfolio, as Peter mentioned, primarily into investment-grade bonds and commercial mortgage loans, which we believe will free up about $2 billion in additional capital from the allocation to lower capital charge assets. If you assumed a 9% normalized return, this would result in approximately $200 million decline in annual net investment income in 2016 net of our reinvestments. This would occur over the course of several quarters. The net investment income reductions from both of these transactions were reflected in the commercial and consumer PTOI targets that we provided in our January 26 strategy update presentation.","We look forward to delivering on our strategic plan that we outlined in January and providing you with additional disclosure by 2016 year end. We remain confident in our plan to deliver $25 billion to shareholders over the next two years and our continued operating improvements.","Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Sid. Today I will discuss the Commercial Insurance segment's quarterly results, our strategic priorities, and the actions we're taking to improve operating performance.","On slide 12, the fourth quarter commercial property casualty accident year loss ratio as adjusted was 66.4%, an increase of 0.5 point from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher severe losses in property. Increased loss picture in the U.S., including in E&S, trucking, and other segments of commercial auto also contributed to the higher adjusted accident year loss ratio.","The fourth quarter expense ratio of 28.6% reflected an increase in commission rates in property, partially offset by net improvements in general operating expenses. Net premiums written grew 1.5% after adjusting for foreign exchange. We continue to improve our portfolio mix and grow in areas that meet our targeted ROE.","In the quarter, large-limit and middle market property and segments of our program business continued to grow. We also benefited from fee income from NSM, a leading U.S. managing general agent acquired by AIG in April of 2015.","Overall rate change declined by nearly one point in the quarter, driven by continued pressure in property, particularly in the U.S. E&S business. U.S. casualty rates increased by 3%, reflecting margin improvement in lines subject to remediation. Rates were essentially flat in specialty and financial lines.","We see profitable growth opportunities in multinational, financial lines, property upper middle market and major account segments that utilize our risk engineering capabilities, international casualty, and areas of emerging risk, such as cyber and M&A insurance.","We're also excited about providing clients with best-in-class claims expertise, risk services, and analytic capabilities that will strengthen our relationships. These include expanded teams of engineers to analyze and mitigate risk, innovations from our partnership with Clemson University, and investments in companies like Human Condition Safety, whose wearable devices can help workers avoid serious injury. The breadth of the AIG franchise and the strength of our client relationships position us well to capitalize on new opportunities and current market disruption from some of our competitors.","With respect to UGC, our CEO, Donna DeMaio, and her team delivered another quarter of increasing profitability. The strength of UGC's business is evident in a default rate that was last seen in 2006. For the full year, UGC had a record first-lien new insurance written of over $50 billion and pre-tax operating income of $644 million. The private mortgage insurer eligibility rules asset test came into effect in December 2015, and I'm pleased to report that UGC will exceed the requirement by approximately 20%.","During our January 26 strategy update call, we announced specific actions to improve commercial performance that will reduce the accident year loss ratio as adjusted by six points. On slide 13, the green line shows an accident year loss ratio improvement of almost 11 points since 2011, including the effective prior-year development for all of those accident years.","Following significant progress between 2011 and 2013, our trend rate slowed in 2014 and 2015. But during that time, we made some important advancements in our underwriting tools and analytics. The bars in the chart highlight the change in business mix as we reduced writings in poorer performing areas of U.S. casualty from 39% of our portfolio in 2011 to 27% in 2015. In 2016 and 2017, we will continue to focus on improving the portfolio mix, and we will accelerate the use of underwriting tools and analytics capabilities developed over the past few years. One of the benefits of AIG's recent organizational changes will be to increase agility and speed the adoption of these tools.","Slide 14 shows the dispersion of the adjusted accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes of each sub-segment that comprises our $20 billion of net premiums earned in 2015. The loss ratio has ranged from as low at 30% to above 100% for a handful of sub-segments. This illustrates a very important point. We do not need to improve each and every sub-segment of our $20 billion portfolio by six points in order to achieve our target. Rather, focusing on our best and worst performing areas will significantly contribute to improved performance.","We intend to grow the 15% of the commercial portfolio included within product set 1. It includes the lowest loss ratio businesses, which ran at an average of approximately 41%. We will focus our resources on expanding our presence in the many products and geographies within this product set, where we have strong competitive advantages and offer a compelling value proposition.","We will maintain or improve the business captured in product set 2, which represents 70% of total premiums, with an average accident year loss ratio of approximately 66%. This is the product set that will benefit the most from the underwriting tools and data analytics I mentioned earlier. For the highest loss ratio sub-segments, which are predominantly in U.S. Casualty, we intend to expand our use of quota share reinsurance. The effect will be an improved commercial loss ratio, release of statutory capital, and a higher return on equity.","We will remediate product set 3, where the remaining 15% of the commercial portfolio ran at an average accident year loss ratio of approximately 91%. This is where we will narrow our focus through strategic exits and remediation. We already began taking actions on some of these sub-segments in the second half of 2015 and expect to be seeing the benefits from these actions in the first half of 2016. Earlier this month we announced and communicated to our distribution partners the exit of four specific high-loss ratio areas within U.S. casualty, which include certain sub-segments of healthcare and commercial auto that Sid mentioned earlier following our fourth quarter reserve study. We expect to see these benefits beginning in the second half of 2016 and extending through 2017.","I would note that the majority of the businesses we're remediating in the U.S. will renew relatively evenly throughout the remainder of the year. We will, of course, provide proper notice and compliance with the relevant regulatory rules and communicate with our clients well in advance of these actions.","We believe these levers provide a clearer path for achieving the targeted accident year loss ratio by year-end 2017. Our strategy is to be targeted using micro-segmentation tools, narrowing our focus to significantly differentiate between products, geographies, clients, and distribution channels based on value. With respect to underperforming one or two product accounts, you can expect to see dramatic reductions as we move forward. Our goal is to be our clients' most valued insurer, and we're focused on clients where we can deliver the most value and grow profitably.","In closing, the Commercial strategy is clear, focused, and on pace, but there's a lot of work to do. I'm confident in our strategic plan and our ability to execute it. Finally, the Commercial leadership team and I are 100% committed to achieving the plan we've outlined.","Thank you and now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin T. Hogan - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Consumer","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss our Consumer business's operating performance, provide an update on the DOL's proposed regulations, and provide an update on Japan.","Beginning with retirement on slide 17, as Sid highlighted earlier, lower alternative investment returns combined with lower base portfolio income contributed to the decline in pre-tax operating income. We continue to expect base yields to decline two to four basis points per quarter on a normalized basis in 2016 based on the current interest rate environment.","Sales growth was strong from a year ago, particularly in index annuities and fixed annuities. We are seeing index annuity growth through all of our channels, particularly with independent agents and expanded wholesaling in banks, broker dealers, and advisors. Fixed annuities growth was driven by higher interest rates and credit spreads in the latter portion of 2015. Retirement net flows improved both sequentially and versus a year ago, due largely to continued positive flows for retirement income solutions and a decline in fixed annuity and group retirement surrenders. Despite a challenging environment, we believe our product and distribution diversity allow for continued positive net flows overall.","I would like to provide an update on the Department of Labor's fiduciary regulations with respect to ERISA plans and IRAs. The version of the proposed regulations which was advanced to the Office of Management and Budget at the end of January has not been made public. The final regulations could be issued as early as March or April.","We remain focused on preparing for its implementation with respect to product development, distribution support, compliance, service, and administration. We are in active discussions with our distribution partners to be in the best position possible to meet the evolving needs of retirement savers. Through group retirement, fixed annuities, index annuities, and variable annuities, we will offer a broad product portfolio to meet the growing needs of consumers for guaranteed lifetime income and other savings solutions.","Slide 19 presents results for our Global Life business. In Life, our new business is already priced to achieve our targeted returns. As Sid mentioned, we are executing on plans to finance our remaining redundant reserves with a series of reinsurance transactions that will improve the returns in that portfolio and allow for increased distributions to parent.","We are also executing on a plan for our Life business to narrow our distribution and product focus, including greater specialization, which will result in reduced distribution expenses. Examples of this enhanced emphasis include a greater focus on independent distribution channels with the significant reduction we made in January to our Life career agency force and a narrowing of our product focus in our group benefits business to profitable lines where we have a competitive advantage.","Turning to slide 20, Personal Insurance delivered strong growth in new business in the Private Client group in Japan property and automobile across all regions. However, there were a number of items that resulted in an increase in accident year losses. During the fourth quarter, we strengthened reserves for accident and health as a result of our normal annual review. We saw unsatisfactory performance in some European warranty service programs, leading to remedial actions, including contract cancellations. And we realized higher auto losses in a number of European countries that are already targeted for exit.","We continue to move forward with our work in Japan and are preparing for the merger of Fuji Fire and Marine and AIU legal entities. At the same time, we have successfully grown our Personal Auto business, which grew year over year for the first time in over 10 years. Our one-time merger-related expenses were roughly $100 million this year, largely comparable to last year. And we further expect one-time expenses to peak in 2016 at a slightly higher level as we prepare to enter pre-merger status. The subsequent legal merger, where approved by the authorities, will bring to a close the integration of Fuji Fire and Marine, which we acquired in 2011.","I would like to briefly comment as well on our plan to deliver $800 million of pre-tax operating income improvement by 2017. We expect that much of this improvement will be achieved through significant expense reductions for each of the Consumer businesses which are part of AIG's firm-wide GOE targets. The largest reductions will be in the personal insurance business and U.S. distribution. We expect that these benefits will be partially offset by lower net investment income from hedge fund reallocations as well as from a lower invested asset base resulting from the distributions to the parent company.","To close, we remain focused on achieving profitable growth across our Consumer businesses and effectively managing risk by executing our customer-focused strategies, maintaining a prudent risk profile, and targeting capital-efficient growth opportunities.","Now, I'd like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President, Investor Relations","Anthony, could we start our Q&A session, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And it appears our first question comes from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Sid, I just wanted to ask you a question on your comment on the impact from the life reinsurance deals. So the $5 billion you're going to free up, you said you would lose $250 million of NII. If you look at that from a after-tax standpoint, you're only giving up a 3% to 4% return on that capital. Are there any other lost earnings associated with that or is that it, and is that a third-party reinsurance deal?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Obviously, we are reinsuring the life reserves with external parties, but there also are internal parties and internal reinsurance in the structure. What I would say is your estimates on the ROE give-up are roughly accurate. And just a reminder is that the additional liquidity to the parent comes both from freed-up capital as well as from the acceleration of tax-sharing payments from the subsidiaries.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, so it's not the full, the $5 billion capital release. There are some tax benefits in addition to that.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, that's correct. And so the costs on the transaction are economically attractive for us when we look at the additional liquidity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg with Janney.","Lawrence D. Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you and good morning. I guess this would be for Rob. Rob, it just seems very challenging to take 4 points off the loss ratio for 2016, particularly given that probably a third of the earned premiums for the year had already been written last year. So on the reinsurance piece, which appears that it probably plays a pretty significant role here, you mentioned the quota share for I guess the worst performing part of product set 2. Will reinsurance also be used for product set 3? And then I guess the quota share is mostly designed to just change the mix and get more high loss ratio business out of the portfolio. Is that correct? And then finally -","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President, Investor Relations","Hey, Larry, it's Liz. I think you went over the one question and one follow-up. So let's just start with your first two.","Lawrence D. Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay.","Elizabeth A. Werner - Vice President, Investor Relations","And I actually think we'll be able to get to the rest of them if you just get back in queue.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","All right. Hi, Larry, thanks for your question. The first thing I want to say to you is we're not starting flat footed on any of our actions here. So actions were being taken in 2015 which we'll see beginning in the first part of 2016. The second thing I want to say is, regarding use of reinsurance, I know there is a lot of questions about that. The first thing I want to say is we don't think it's a long-term sustainable strategy to be looking to arbitrage our reinsurers. That's not the strategy here. We're partners with our reinsurers and we see many opportunities for our reinsurance strategy to benefit AIG as well as the reinsurers.","I think there's three key points I'd like to make regarding how this worked with the reinsurers. First, you should know I think the reinsurers have an increasingly favorable view about the quality of the data and the quality of our underwriting. Second, the reinsurers themselves receive significant diversification benefits in their capital models, which make business like our U.S. casualty business more attractive for them. And third, the long-tail nature of our U.S. casualty business, for example, gives the reinsurers a significant deal of flexibility in their investment allocation decisions, which might differ from the way AIG might choose to structure its investment portfolio.","I would say most of our actions will be with the reinsurers in product set 2. And it will be on the higher end of the loss ratios of product set 2, which is where the U.S. casualty business sits. The reinsurance will change of course our mix of business because if you reduce the amount of business in product set 2 that is U.S. casualty, the range in loss ratios in product set 2 is pretty wide. It ranges from as low as the low 50s to as high as the 80s. And so therefore, you'll get a lot of benefit from reinsuring the U.S. casualty business, which is higher loss ratio business in product set 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Peter, on the January 26 call, you were pretty explicit that the 6 points of accident year improvement were actually for all of 2017. Can you talk about what's changed from then till now so that it's a run rate at the end of the year?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Well I just want to be clear. Obviously, it is our intention to drive all 6 points of the improvement in the accident year loss ratio by the end of 2017.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Right, I understand that. So what is the goal for the 2017 accident year loss ratio?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Close to 60% on an adjusted basis.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Ex-cats.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Ex-cats, that's what the adjustment is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Clayton Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, Peter and the rest of the team. Listen, I want to applaud you for taking shareholders on the board. I think it's refreshing and it's great to see you guys are so willing to take shareholders' views into consideration, and I appreciate you putting shareholders first.","But everybody here at home today is trying to figure out what the impact actually is likely to be from your expansion of the board, what the impact on your strategy and performance is likely to prove out. And I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of the conversations you've had on the board and with your new likely board members so that we can have a better sense of how you expect this to go. At a minimum, is it going to be business-as-usual with those two new members, or ultimately are you going to have a different approach to making decisions? And could you even go so far as to have a strategic review committee created with some of these independent board members to pursue a review? Thank you.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","So as we've said publicly, we are pleased that we have reached a solution that averts a very distracting proxy fight, and that the inclusion of two new board members will add an extra degree of scrutiny on the way in which we execute our strategic plan. And so we would not want to comment on any future dynamics between management and the board, but the process to date is that the existing board of 14 and management have developed this strategy in close collaboration. And so we expect continued close collaboration between management and the board going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America.","Jay Arman Cohen - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thank you. While we'd like to see the overhead expense ratios improving, I think in every area within Property Casualty, the acquisition expense ratios rose, and some of that may be business mix change. But can you talk more specifically what's going on there? Maybe that's for Rob.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Jay, I think you're right. As we continue to work on our mix of business, in general what you should think is the higher loss ratio more complex business simply carries a lower acquisition cost. And the business mix that we've been shifting to will carry a somewhat higher acquisition cost. The net effect of that we think is a net positive in our overall ROE and a positive in the overall combined ratio.","Jay Arman Cohen - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","It's offset to some extent by lower loss ratios then.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","That's right, significantly offset by lower loss ratios.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I'm wondering if you could talk about just pricing trends in the P&C market and how they might have changed in the last few months or so, and related to that, what your expectations are for premium growth in this environment, especially as you raise prices and pull back from certain lines in the P&C market.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","Jimmy, first of all, I always try to remind people we deal in a lot of countries and in a lot of products. So when people ask about the market, there's no simple single answer to that. And so we experience different results with pricing in different parts of our portfolio. Maybe the bigger change that we would have seen in the fourth quarter is an improvement in the U.S. Casualty pricing environment, as we've driven a bunch of our remediation activities, as I said earlier, in 2015, which will benefit us more in 2016. I think our competitors are also seeing many of the same things we're seeing, and so I think there's pretty good discipline with respect to U.S. Casualty at this point.","With that said, the U.S. property market, in particular the excess and surplus lines property market, has been and continues to be highly competitive. It's why you see AIG shifting its strategy to an increase in the level of engineers that we've added onto our team and seeking to use capabilities and expertise outside of our capital as the primary advantage and the primary thing we offer in the marketplace. So we do expect it to continue to be a mixed bag product by product and geography by geography.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just on premium growth, your expectations over the next two to three years as you're trying to improve your margin, should we assume a dramatic decline in the premiums?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","I mentioned on the January 26 call, Jimmy, I believe, we do expect our premium volume to go down in 2016. It will go down partly because of our remediation efforts with respect to exits and remediation in that Product Group 3, partly because of the use of reinsurance. But it will be offset by the fact that we continue to see opportunities to grow in places where we have a sustainable competitive advantage anywhere in the world and with various products.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I had a question on the normalized return on equity target. I'm having a little trouble getting to your ranges, primarily due to the sharp drop-off in partnership income. So in the first half of 2015, there was $1.4 billion of partnership income, and that dropped off to almost zero in the fourth quarter. I'm just trying to get a perspective of how much your ROE targets take into account expectations of a normalized maybe high single-digit return in alternative investments relative to basically zero that we saw in the fourth quarter.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Jay, it's Sid here. No, we factored that in entirely in our two-year strategic plan. And so we've accounted for the change between a normalized return from the hedge funds and alternatives and the reinvestment strategies that I referred to in my remarks.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But, Sid, this is entirely related to essentially zero returns or maybe more of a headwind in the first half of 2016. What are you assuming in your ROE target for 2016 for alternative returns?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","We normalize for performance, not volume, and so we're normalizing here. As I said in my remarks, if you assume 9%, that has been the normalized performance that we've assumed. And obviously, as we shift out of the hedge fund portfolio, we are shifting to a normalized return on fixed income and commercial mortgage loans.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Let's talk a bit about commercial insurance here. But in Consumer, where we haven't got a lot of detail, international has consistently been a problem. When does that get better, and what exactly are we doing there in order to try to fix that business and get it to a better place? I understand Japan, but I feel like that merger has been sitting in front of us now for some time with the carrot of lower expenses. Could we get some color on that? And any granularity would really be helpful.","Kevin T. Hogan - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Consumer","Yes, sure, Mike. First with respect to Japan, the merger is progressing. We're proceeding right now through the integration and regression testing of about 110 systems. And there has been a new regulatory requirement for a change in the earthquake property rates. And as you can imagine, whilst we're trying to do this integration and regression testing, to have to stop, open up the systems, introduce those new earthquake rates, and then go back to integration and regression testing, that's essentially what has pushed us back six months or so in terms of the expectation of the integration date. And our strategy is in fact to try to advance as many benefits from the work we've already in recognition of the fact that we can do so. And examples of that are our ability to recently change our direct marketing strategy and move that away from the American Home legal entity and into Fuji Life and the other companies, which will generate further savings that we can now realize.","And so outside of Japan, what I can say is when we did the strategic update, we did mention about the footprint strategy. And many of our Consumer businesses are vestiges from the days when AIG had a multiple financial services presence. For example, in Poland, a number of years ago we had a consumer finance company, we had a life business, we had a credit card company, and it's a natural extension of those customer bases and distribution channels to build the Consumer Property Casualty business. But as we've divested away from those, we now have expense overhangs and we have subscale operations in quite a few territories. And the reason why we're moving to a focus on our individual business and 15 territories in our group business and our multinational clients in 35 territories going forward is to address that expense overhang, and that's primarily been the performance issue and much of the non-Japan part of the international portfolio.","We do of course have some other portfolio issues like the European warranty business, which we address from time to time. But our loss ratios are generally sustainable and competitive. It's the expense ratio in the international property casualty business we need to address.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But can you provide some more granularity? I appreciate all of that context, but in the Commercial we're talking about specific targets for profitability improvement. It sounds like you've got a lot of things that you could ring-fence and talk about areas that are subscale areas or are at scale. What does the run-rate in Japan look like after this? It seems like all of those are estimable, but we're still here talking very qualitatively about things happening. When can we get some more granularity there?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","So this is the very much the thinking behind the modular business reporting, where Japan will be one of the first of the nine modular business units that will be shown in the financial supplement and will give you clear transparency around ROE and capital and so on. So we are very committed to giving you more granular disclosures, and the team is working hard to be delivering those on a schedule that's consistent with the high-quality control over financial disclosures that we obviously want to stick to.","But in terms of prospective ROE, perhaps I should just mention that we have in our risk-adjusted profit framework elevated the hurdle rate for all businesses and all territories to a minimum of 10%, which is a shift from where we were a year ago where territories with low nominal interest rates and with low beta we rewarded with a lower hurdle rate. And we have in great discussions with several of our large shareholders agreed that we should have a minimum hurdle rate of 10%, and that applies to Japan as well as elsewhere.","Operator","Our next question comes John Nadel from Piper Jaffray.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you, good morning. I have one question on rating agency reactions to your strategic update. And the other, I just wanted to talk about the parent company cash as we roll forward here into January or February.","Peter, I think I was pretty surprised, and I know a number of folks were surprised by the rating agencies' negative outlooks and maybe even one or two ratings being cut following the strategic update. And I guess I'm just \u2013 Peter, I just want to gauge your confidence level that these negative outlooks will not turn into downgrades, all else equal, as a result of the $25 billion return of capital.","And then separately, just with the parent company ending the year at $9.2 billion of liquid assets, if we roll forward here into the first part of the first quarter, you've already used $5.4 billion. So you've got under $4 billion in cash or liquid assets at the parent. How quickly does that recover?","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","So let me just start, and I'll hand it over to Sid to complete. We've been extremely consistent in saying that we manage the AIG enterprise in a way that factors in all stakeholders. We use that word very deliberately. And our policyholders in particular are very mindful of our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet and the ability to deliver our large long-term promises. And to the extent that they look at the rating agencies as a guide, we are very mindful of their reactions to our plans and our specific actions.","And as we developed this two-year strategic plan, we've worked very closely with all the rating agencies to pressure-test different assumptions. And so the actions they took were not a surprise, but I've been saying consistently that the rating agencies were more of a binding constraint than any kind of Fed oversight of AIG. And the guide to our own thinking here is very much our own internal assessment of risk. And we are very pleased, especially in the light of recent market volatility, that we've done so much over the last four years to derisk the balance sheet of the company, the vulnerability to contingent liquidity. And so we are confident that once we execute on the goals in this plan, the ratings outlook will become positive again. But, Sid, maybe you can answer the specific liquidity questions and elaborate, if you like, on the rating agencies.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, the only elaboration, Peter, I'd say is just a reminder, John. We continue to have strong ratings on our core life and property casualty operating companies, most of those with stable outlooks. So we believe our planned operating improvements are going to support maintaining those strong ratings and actually improving them over time.","On liquidity, I'd point you to my comments around our target. You've obviously referenced some of the outflows. But just a quick reminder, in the first quarter we have an assortment of inflows that are coming from dividends, tax-sharing payments, as well as further liquidations of asset sales, some of which that we've already executed. So again, as I said, we target $6 billion to $8 billion. We may be higher or lower than that from time to time. But we're very confident in the balance sheet, and obviously that was core to this entire strategic plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. Rob, I was hoping you could give us maybe a breakdown of how much of the 400 basis point improvement in the adjusted loss ratio by year-end 2016 comes from the reinsurance, maybe shifting assets to the legacy portfolio, and normalization in the severe loss ratio and in pricing and underwriting actions. And then lastly also, how are you going to manage not losing good business with the bad business as you go through this process?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","All right, Brian, thanks for the questions. So let me say that I think it's reasonably easy for me to tell you regarding legacy that we've already informed the market of the exits that we have, and the only thing moving into legacy is the businesses we have exited. With respect to the drivers, I would say to you first that each part of our business, Property, casualty, specialty and financial lines plays a part. Obviously, the remediation role for property and casualty are the most significant, whereas I see the opportunity for growth in strategic areas, particularly for financial lines and for some of our specialty products.","With respect to which actions will drive it, it's reasonably evenly mixed between what I would call reinsurance and business mix, strategic growth in some of the lines I just described where we have opportunities and our loss ratios and our competitive advantages allow us to succeed in the marketplace, and then a contribution of course from exits that have already been announced and our work on risk selection and client selection. So I might just say as think of it as three basic buckets, strategic growth, reinsurance and business mix, exits slash clients and risk selection as being reasonably equal in terms of their relative contributions.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I would like a general question about the property casualty reserves and how core are they to the capital that you expect to pull out of the company over time. It seems to me that the rating agencies' concerns are primarily focused on whether or not the $3.6 billion was enough. And so if you could, perhaps talk about either how, first, how comfortable you are with those reserve levels. And then how sensitive are the capital amounts you're going to pull out of the company to issues over reserve development?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah Paul, I'd really point you to the comments I made on the January 26 call as well as the information we've released in our 8-K. We believe after applying enhanced methods and assumptions and strengthening our reserves that we are going to help mitigate the risk of future quarterly reserve volatility around the selected best estimate reserve. And as a result, I think our plans are confident in our level of capital for our PC operating subsidiaries.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","And I think as a reminder, remember the $25 billion capital return walk that we disclosed on January 26, the first bar of that chart includes the injection of holding company cash into the subsidiary to fund the reserve strengthening, so it starts off with a fully funded reserve.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I guess my question is if we have more unfavorable reserve development, does that mean we have to pull more capital into the property casualty business, which means less to the parent?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Look, Paul, I think obviously capital is going to be sensitive to our future projections. So as I said, our future projections on reserve mitigate the risk of future quarterly reserve volatility, and we don't comment on hypotheticals.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, just wanted to follow up first on the commercial P&C accident loss ratio. On both slides four and 13, you added a footnote about year end, that the improvement is 4 points and then 2 points is year end, and I guess that's a change from the January 26 presentation. And I wanted to know what the expectation for those actual full years are versus the year-end run rate.","And then additionally, Sid, on the $9 billion of capital freed from legacy portfolios that's in the presentation, I don't see where that is highlighted in the January 26 bridge to $25 billion. And I'm wondering, is that new capital, or was that incorporated somewhere in that bridge to $25 billion? Thank you.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","So I'll start by just clarifying. Again, our view is that the decrease in the Commercial adjusted accident year loss ratio will be approximately 6 points in total by the end of 2017. And just a reminder, and 4 points at the end of 2016. But it's just, it's not a linear process, and we can only make the changes if policies come up for renewal with proper notification to our policyholders. So market conditions, renewal, timing, et cetera will impact the way you'll see that emerge. But it is our belief that we have enough levers at our disposal that should enable us to be able to deliver four points in 2016 and two points additional in 2017.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Charles, it's Sid here. On your second question, I would point you to slide five in the strategic update. Just a reminder, the legacy capital is a capital projection. Page five illustrates our funding lock for our share repurchase. So what you're going to see is that $9 billion that you're referring to on capital is return to shareholders via various funding sources in this walk. So I'd point you to page five in the footnotes there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg with Janney.","Lawrence D. Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi, thanks. I guess back to Rob and reinsurance, I'm curious if you will also utilize excess of loss structures in the plan. And you've mentioned lost and net investment income from other sources of the plan. Will there be lost investment income in the future associated with the PC reinsurance?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","So first of all, regarding excess of loss, yes, we'll use all types of reinsurance that are available at our disposal. And I just wanted to highlight that maybe one of the bigger changes was our use of proportional or excess of loss reinsurance. But we currently use and will continue to use excess of loss. With respect to how it flows through in investment results, let me let Sid comment.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, there will be a reduction in net investment income from lower premiums and reinsurance, and that's been factored into the January 26 strategic update figures for Rob and his PTOI walk.","Lawrence D. Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Can that be quantified?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","We're not disclosing that right now. Obviously, as we execute on our strategies, we'll comment on reinsurance transactions and the impact of associated net investment income.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, just a quick follow-up here. Rob, on the actions taken in Commercial, most of the changes are implying a reduction in premium. You said in your comments that there will be some premium reduction from the actions you're taking, but there will be premium growth from other opportunities. Can you give us just some context? What are you thinking about what premiums will be? What's going to happen to that top line on a net basis? And can you give us the gross reductions just so we can understand what actions are being taken and the magnitude of those actions at higher \u2013 or I should say lower profitability, just to understand what that template looks like?","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","All right, so let me see if I can help you out with this, Michael. I disclosed again some of this on the January 26 call. I expect that they'll be something like $1 billion of lower premium as it relates to reinsurance transactions. Now that will depend on actual deals we get done, the timing we get them done, et cetera, but that gives you a basic idea of relative size.","With respect to exits and remediation and other actions we'll take, you should expect something like about the same amount of reduction in premium which would be about another $1 billion, so you're talking about $2 billion of both in the reduction direction. With that said, we have changes in mix of business and very attractive opportunities in more strategic parts of our business that we think currently meet our ROE target hurdles, and we will grow. And that number you should think of as being something in the vicinity of $600 million. So we think our reduction in net premiums in 2016 is approximately $1.4 billion \u2013 $1.5 billion. Again, it will depend on what happens in the market, market conditions, et cetera, but that gives you a basic idea of what we're expecting.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you.","Robert S. Schimek - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Commercial, American International Group, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Sid, you mentioned something about additional disclosures by year-end 2016, and I'm not sure what you're referencing.","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","I think that was just in response to questions about modular business units and the operating ROE versus legacy.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. Just quickly. Sid, could you remind us where you need your fixed charge coverage ratio to be to maintain your ratings level and where it is right now? And what's the best way to track that?","Siddhartha Sankaran - Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President","First of all, it just depends agency by agency, so I'd point you to their guidance. And what I'd say in all of our operating projections, we meet their expectations and continue to target strong fixed charge coverage. But it will depend, it differs between S&P, Moody's, and others.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, guys, again. I guess a question on the Consumer business and particularly Japan. Peter, you talked about the improvement or the higher hurdle rate of a 10% ROE for the Japanese business relative to how you had it before. What would be the expectation of contraction in that business? I guess to me, a higher hurdle of 10% ROE would mean that some Japanese insurers might be able to suffice with less.","Kevin T. Hogan - Executive Vice President; Chief Executive Officer, Consumer","Hi, Charles. I'll take that. First of all, we are already pricing our Life business at IRRs that are above the hurdle rate, even peers' new hurdle rate and has been some time in the low double digits, and that has been a fast-growing business for us. We made a decision a couple of years ago to consume those GAAP earnings at the rate of growth. So that has been masking our results in Japan a little bit.","The other thing I think that's important to point out is if we take away the one-time project expenses associated with the merger and integration of Fuji Fire and Marine, the underlying business portfolio is generating returns we believe in that low-double-digit area. And since we've acquired Fuji Fire and Marine, we've brought their loss ratio on personal accident business down by nine full points and on automobile down by five full points. And as I mentioned in my comments, we actually grew that business for the first time in quite a long time this year. So we believe that \u2013 we're hoping that with the modular reporting, you'll be able to understand better the components of the Japanese results in the context of the hurdles that we've set.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So the new hurdle has no change in the business planning? I guess to me, a new hurdle would mean that that's a change from what's currently going on. And you're basically saying that you're already at that hurdle, so no change is necessary.","Peter D. Hancock - President and Chief Executive Officer","Charles, this is Peter. I think that at an aggregate level, you can see that you're over the hurdle. But within the subcomponent parts, the mix changes when you raise the hurdle rate on everything. So I think that you'll see greater selectivity of business, so that the very high ROE business subsidizes in a sense the stuff that's 8% to 10%, and there will be less of the 8% to 10%, and so there's a tradeoff there.","But I believe that our risk-adjusted profit framework by targeting the spread between ROE and the hurdle rate, which we call a wrap spread, times the equity employed and maximizing that risk-adjusted profit is a way to make the volume margin tradeoff in a value-accretive way for shareholders.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session.

Joining us on the room are others in senior management, including our Chief Investment Officer, Doug Dachille.","This morning, we\u2019ll allow a few extra minutes at the end of the prepared remarks for Q&A. We\u2019ll continue to follow the same format of asking one question and one follow-up and ask that you then get back into queue for additional questions.","Thank you. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. In addition to reviewing our 2018 fourth quarter and full year financial results, I\u2019ve planned to spend a good part of my remarks, reflecting on my first full year as CEO of AIG. Throughout 2018, we uncovered many issues and challenges and took actions on a number of fronts to lay the foundation for long term sustainable and profitable growth. We reorganized and repositioned our businesses, significantly reducing risk and volatility, recruited industry leading talent and fostered a culture of underwriting excellence and accountability. ","The problems at AIG were deeper and more pervasive than I originally anticipated, but we have put the right people and the right strategies in place that will allow us to accelerate our progress in 2019. As Mark will discuss in more detail, our fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by a decrease in net investment income, due to volatility in both equity and credit markets, particularly in the latter part of December, which impacted the operating results across our businesses. ","Our results were also impacted by cats, however, these losses came within our previously disclosed range. In addition, we reported 365 million of unfavorable prior year loss reserve development, driven mostly by underwriting decisions from 2016 and prior years. We are pleased that the fourth quarter also showed positive improvements in general insurance, reflecting actions we took in 2018 that demonstrate that we are on the right path to restoring this business to profitability. ","For example, the accident year combined ratio ex-cats for the fourth quarter was 98.8%, a 140 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2017, largely driven by an improved loss ratio of 63.9%. The expense ratio of 34.9% was 90 basis points better than the third quarter of 2018 and we continue to work on reducing our overall expense base. ","The foundational work we did over the course of 2018, particularly in general insurance has positioned us well for the future and we are reaffirming the guidance we gave in mid-December, including achieving a double digit ROE, excluding AOCI and DTA in the next three years as well as a combined ratio including AALs and general insurance below 100 in 2019. To be clear, a combined ratio below 100 is an inflection point. It is by no means where we expect to be longer term. The crossing over into profitability for the first time in over a decade is an important milestone we will achieve in repositioning AIG for the future.","Now, I want to step back to when I joined AIG in mid-2017. One of the first things I did was suspend guidance. I know that made it difficult for all of you to recalibrate your models and predict our earnings, but I had to do it because I knew I needed time to get a handle on the issues at the company before I could speak confidently about its future performance. So let me give you some insight into what I learned and more importantly what we've been doing about it, what we discovered.","I knew coming into the job that the organizational structure of the company and the split between commercial and consumer was different from our peers. In September 2017, I announced the reorganization of our business units to create general insurance and life and retirement and made investments a separate business unit. I also restored greater accountability within the leadership team for business performance. It was also clear to me that AIG experienced a major talent drain, dating back to the financial crises, but more acutely in recent years. ","I knew I needed to bring in the best people in the industry to help me fully understand the extent of the company's issues and fix them. Shortly after my arrival, I added several new members to my leadership team, including my first hire, Peter Zaffino who joined as AIG\u2019s Global Chief Operating Officer and later in 2017 also took on the additional role of CEO of the newly constituted General Insurance business unit. The caliber of people who joined AIG over the last 18 months has been a significant highlight and exceeded my expectations. ","The combination of AIG's iconic status coupled with a professional and intellectual challenge this turnaround provides is a compelling proposition and I am incredibly pleased that so many want to be part of it. And great talent attracts more great talent. We continue to fill key positions with a combination of elevating internal talent and recruiting new hires, all of whom have proven track records of success and are committed to our mission and are energized by what the future holds for AIG. ","I also needed to make sure our people were focused on the right issues. By the fall of 2017, we shifted the company's focus from principally capital management back to insurance fundamentals. This shift in focus allowed us to concentrate on uncovering the underlying issues in our core insurance operations that have contributed to the unpredictability and volatility in AIG's financial results. Our main priority in 2018 was to return general insurance to profitability as soon as possible and restore its position as an industry leader. We knew that any remediation efforts would need to be concentrated on critical foundational elements of insurance. ","With Tom Bolt\u2019s arrival in January 2018, Tom and Peter moved quickly to overhaul our risk appetite and redesigned our underwriting philosophy. Not only have we made significant progress in that regard, but the discipline now being applied through revised underwriting guidelines for every underwriter in the world along with new assessment tools allows us to better measure our underwriting performance. In addition, our [limit] [ph] management coupled with improved underwriting discipline has helped us overall our reinsurance program, which had been deemphasized. ","The support we are receiving from broker and reinsurance partners and feedback regarding the changes we are making to our underwriting standards provides independent validation and endorsement of the actions we are taking and the strategy that we've laid out for the future. As additional industry veterans stepped into key positions and focused on fixing the fundamentals, we discovered issues and unintended consequences of prior strategies, particularly as a result of what was referred to as the Go Large strategy. ","This approach to the market created outsized risk and volatility for AIG. By expanding its risk appetite to encompass very large limits on a gross and net basis, AIG added significant risk to its earnings pattern and balance sheet. Additionally, certain of these issues were exacerbated by risks being written on a multi-year basis and record cat losses and 30 billion in stock buybacks, which reduced AIG\u2019s capital, making the outsized limits more risky.","Another example of an unexpected trouble area that started to emerge in early 2018 but really manifested itself in the second half of the year is personal insurance, particularly our private client group, PCG. Problem areas that were discovered included geographic zones with disproportionately large and dense accumulations of total insured values in cat prone areas and inadequate pricing of the book. As these and other issues in PCG emerged, we quickly began to reposition the portfolio as well as reduce risk and volatility. ","In 2019, we will continue to work to reduce aggregate exposures and rightsize risks in this business, but it will take some time to fully execute on our ongoing remediation plan. We also brought focus and clarity at mission to various businesses, such as [indiscernible] Lexington, again adding world class talent in leadership positions. I could go on at length with other examples because with very few exceptions, almost every business suffered from underperformance and while I had some understanding of the Go Large strategy before I arrived at AIG, I had not appreciated the extent of the issues it created or that it had been deployed throughout the company. ","The prior strategies coupled with the loss of underwriting discipline helps to explain the magnitude of the PYD recorded over the last few years. I do want to emphasize that our team has been digging into every aspect of general insurance and it has made significant progress on transforming the business. Peter is going to give you more detail on what we accomplished in general insurance in year one, which you will see is both impressive and more importantly, sustainable. ","While I\u2019ve spent most of the past few quarters speaking about general insurance, I've also been focused on our life and retirement business. Life and retirement has been stable considering almost five years of a low rate environment combined with uncertainty related to rule making on best interest and suitability standards. It has delivered consistent low to middle double digit ROE, including in 2018. However, like the rest of AIG, this business suffered from inadequate investment in developing technologies, which is critical for a business expected to deliver a high standard of care. ","Kevin will go into more detail about the actions we are taking in this business. We've also made progress in legacy by moving most of our run-off portfolios into a new entity, Fortitude Re, bring up management to concentrate on our in-force business. We continued to receive a significant amount of investor interest in this business, since we announced the sale of a minority interest to Carlyle and are focused on fully de-consolidating this business, while ensuring we meet our commitments to our policyholders and regulators. ","In 2018, we also completed acquisitions, including Validus and Glatfelter which deepened our talent bench and will help to accelerate improvements in our core underwriting fundamentals. In addition, we repurchased $1.8 billion of shares and warrants over the course of the year, including 750 million in the fourth quarter. We also announced last night that AIG\u2019s Board of Directors has approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2 billion, including the 512 million that was remaining under the previous authorization. I've done turn around work throughout my career and remain committed to completing this one. ","As I said earlier, I am more confident today than I was a year ago that AIG is on the right path. We continue to focus on making sustainable changes that will yield long term profitable results, which means we are not taking shortcuts, we\u2019re settling on easy fixes. Instead, we are doing this the right way. We have the best talent in the insurance industry at AIG, we have the right strategies in place and we will restore AIG as a leading insurance company in the world.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark who will then be followed by Peter and Kevin.","Mark Lyons","Thank you, Brian and good morning, all. This morning, I\u2019ve planned to go over the key financial impacts for the quarter as well as an actuarial discussion around prior year loss reserve development. I'll begin with some of the largest or in some cases, most notable financial impacts occurred, namely investments in legacy, then turn to general insurance and life and retirement. Despite volatile financial markets and their impact on investment returns and by consequence business segment results, there are clear green shoots that bode well for the future and I will highlight them as well.","Turning to slide 4, on December 5, AIG provide some guidance at the Goldman Sachs Conference in New York and I'll now provide some color on the actual variances from that guidance. Consensus fourth quarter adjusted after tax earnings per share was $0.42, post the Goldman Conference whereas AIG reported a $0.63 per share adjusted after-tax loss, representing a $1.05 variance. All per share variances comments that I will make will be utilizing the consensus tax rate of 25.4%. This permits each variance discussed to be a pure impact without any tax interaction.","Instead, I will isolate the pure tax impact for consensus separately later in these comments. So, the major items comprising $1.05 per share variance are as follows. First, a $0.38 per share difference associated with capital markets volatility and by this we mean, net investment income differences for general insurance and legacy and differences above credit and interest for life and retirement, along with policyholder and advisor fee reductions, net of associated offsets like DAC and advisory fee expenses.","Included within this is an $86 million pretax impact or $0.07 per share after tax impact associated with hedge funds and Japanese equity marks, usually recorded on a one month lag that were recognized in the fourth quarter due to materiality. Secondly, since the loss reserve reviews at the time of the Goldman conference were still underway, it was December 5, we gave no explicit guidance other than to indicate that we preliminary saw no major issues at that time. ","Having said that, the consensus estimate of prior year reserve development seemed to only reflect the amortization associated with the adverse following cover. As we will explore in more depth later in my comments, AIG reported 365 million of pre-tax net unfavorable development, so the variance from post guidance consensus was $26 per share.","Thirdly and fourthly, legacy represents $0.17 per share variance and general insurance\u2019s accident year underwriting income represents $0.08 per share variance, both of which we will delve into during these remarks. Now, the pure tax difference between consensus and actual represents $0.05 per share. Therefore, the remaining $0.11 per share is a combination of corporate operations and miscellaneous items.","Now shifting gears to slide 5 into investor results, as you are all aware and as Brian mentioned, the fourth quarter saw significant volatility in both equity and credit markets. Consequently, net investment income for the quarter across all segments on an adjusted pre-tax income basis was 2.8 billion compared to 3.4 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, and 3.4 million sequentially in the third quarter of 2018. This net investment income pretax reduction of 600 million was driven by an approximate $300 million decline in the quarter from hedge funds and roughly 120 million quarter decline in equities, acknowledging that some of the hedge fund declines stems from targeted redemptions. These reductions were partially offset by positive returns, primarily in private equity and were aided by the balance of relatively flat level of interest income from non-FVO fixed income securities.","With respect to hedge funds, this has been a profitable asset class historically and this quarter was the first loss since the first quarter of 2016. The biggest financial recognition from the widening credit spreads however was reflected in equity as approximately 1.1 billion of realized pretax OCI losses, relative to a fixed income carrying value of about 230 billion. As for the impact on segment reporting, due to differing asset composition, the impact was not felt proportionately across the various segments with general insurance and legacy taking the brunt of the market downturn impact, general insurance net investment income for example declined 510 million, relative to the fourth quarter of 2017.","Moving on to legacy on slide 6, the fourth quarter adjusted pretax income\/loss of 150 million was driven by 105 million pretax charge or $0.13 a share after tax, resulting from loss recognition testing on certain A&H cancer and disability blocks within the legacy life and retirement subset run off lines, with an $83 million sequential decline of net investment income, primarily due to hedge fund declines, relative to sequentially last quarter. General insurance component of the legacy runoff was also negatively affected by an increase to underwritten premium reserves related to the earnings pattern of certain environmental and cost containment policies, amounting to roughly 50 million pretax, which we will earn through in future periods.","Turning to General Insurance on Slide 7. The accident quarter combined ratio ex-cats for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 98.8%, which represents 140 basis point improvement over the corresponding quarter of 2017, virtually all driven by an improved loss ratio of 63.9%, also much. The expense ratio of 34.9% is 10 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2017 and 90 points better sequentially. Expense ratio reduction was a key objective that management previously identified and the material progress made on this objective is worth commenting on further.","Moving to slide 8, there has been a 260 basis point improvement in the GOE component of the expense ratio, moving from 15.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017 down to 12.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018. On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding Validus and Glatfelter that were acquired during the year, the dollar reduction is nearly 16% or $152 million. Although net earned premiums increased approximately 4%, the GOE ratio would have reduced 240 basis points, even if the premiums were flat, relative to the fourth quarter of 2017.","Before moving on to the acquisition ratio component of the expense ratio, it's important to note that the GOE ratio improvement emanates from all areas of the general insurance operation, including North America and international, commercial and personal line and furthermore, it declined even with the broad amount of talent brought into the organization throughout 2018. Now, the acquisition ratio had a nearly offsetting quarter-over-quarter increase of 250 basis points, driven primarily by a few high acquisition ratio transactions within our personal lines travel units, mostly domestically.","The travel transactions come with a lower loss ratio expectation, which has contributed to the 130 basis point reduced accident quarter loss ratio referred to earlier. The loss ratio also approved due to a materially better international commercial loss ratio quarter-over-quarter of about 1500 basis points. Now, this segment represents about 25% of the worldwide general insurance net earned premiums, so it influences material. The fourth quarter of last year reflected severe loss activity, but even adjusting for this, the international commercial accident quarter loss ratio, excluding cats, still improved materially quarter-over-quarter.","Lastly, there's been a lot of focus on 2018\u2019s catastrophe losses this year, largely within our various personal lines operations that masks the improvement made within the North American commercial segment, which historically has been a recurring pain point. The North America commercial accident quarter combined ratios ex-cats for the last two quarters have been 99% and 102.2% respectively. On an absolute basis, they need to improve, but the underwriting actions and reinsurance protections implemented during 2018 are expected to reduce them further going forward.","Most importantly, these commercial -- these North American commercial accident quarter ex-cat loss ratios are materially lower when compared to those in the first half of 2018, largely due to the decreasing influence of the prior management\u2019s Go Large underwriting approach, which produced significant quarterly volatility. That influence has been decreasing but is not quite yet fully implemented due to multi-year policies that were bound in 2017 and prior in conjunction with those large limits.","Now, turning to catastrophe losses for the quarter, the company recorded 798 million, including legacy for the quarter, which is in line with the guidance previously provided. General insurance recorded 826 million of 2018 event catastrophic losses split as follows. 520 million into North America, 116 million internationally and 190 million from Validus. Hurricane Michael remains within the guidance range previously provided and together with the California Woolsey wildfire event constitutes the vast majority of the quarter\u2019s cat losses. Severe losses for the quarter at 1.3% of net earned premium represents the lowest severe ratio quarter of 2018, and further evidences the continuing favorable impact of underwriting and reinsurance actions that have taken place to reduce limits employed within our various property and energy areas.","Moving on to slide 9, the fourth quarter reserve review focused primarily on the remaining 25% of the reserves not yet examined in the third quarter. These areas were US financial lines, worker's compensation buffer excess policies, international casualty and financial lines other than the UK and Europe and personal lines exposures. Net prior year development ignoring associated premium adjustments, was unfavorable by 365 million for the quarter, which includes legacy within this discussion or $0.31 per share after tax.","Unpacking that for you and referencing slide 10, the PYD was unfavorable by 445 million on a pre-ADC basis, 422 million on a post-ADC basis and 365 million quoted earlier, which is net of 57 million of ADC amortization. On a pre ADC basis, US financial lines accounted for 362 million of net unfavorable development, emanating from our primary D&O facilities, employment practice liability insurance, mostly in the private not-for-profit segment and excess D&O. This was partially offset by 60 million of favorable development, emanating from various professional E&O exposures. International financial lines also experienced some unfavorable development of $87 million, but this emanated from independent large claims from various countries around the globe. Therefore, as you can see, worldwide financial lines accounted for 389 million of unfavorable development, which really means that all the balance of the other lines had a combined unfavorable development of only 55 million, most of which stem from an overall ULAE reserve strength and the adjustment.","Now, I want to address the key differences I see it between this prior year development and the current accident year. The reserve strengthening in US financial lines centered primarily in the 2016 and 2017 accident years, which are not subject to the ADC, as can be evidenced by the small 23 million ADC recovery this quarter. More importantly, the issues in these years stem from an influx of security class action claims, mostly impacting our primary D&O operations in those same two accident years. ","The frequency of these claims reduced in our book from 2016 to 2017 and more dramatically so from 2017 to 2018, reflecting a concerted underwriting effort to reduce writing primary IPOs and primary life science and healthcare risks, along with an approximate one-third reduction in total gross limits across various primary D&O units. Additionally, in the private D&O sector, bankruptcies also fell off dramatically from 2016 through 2018. As a result of these actions and observations, I view the issues as being largely limited to the 2016 and 2017 accident years and having no material roll forward impact on accident year 2018.","I have now reviewed all the worldwide general insurance loss reserves and feel that AIG is within a reasonable range, which dovetails with the opinion of our outside actuarial consultants for the group of segments that they have in the penalty review. The ADC, as of 12\/31\/2018 has approximately 7.6 billion of limit remaining at the 100% level and given the 80% session, has nearly 6.1 billion of remaining limits still available to AIG. ","During 2019, we will be working to have a more expansive view of reserves each quarter rather than focusing -- mostly focusing on pre-determined schedule lines of business. This should help reduce volatility and provide interim views of any trends that may be arising throughout the year. ","Given the earlier discussion on investment performance, let's now turn to the life and retirement segment. The L&R segment recorded 623 million of adjusted pretax income, which represents a $90 million reduction sequentially from last quarter and there are many drivers of the sequential difference and Kevin Holden will discuss both the quarter and the year in detail during his comments. ","Although the L&R segment\u2019s fixed income was largely stable, the results reflect the impacts of the December equity market decline and widening credit spreads on certain assets, affecting net spreads, fee income and amortization which Kevin will also go into. Sequentially however, including the impact of the annual subs review, actuarial assumption review, independent retirement was down 66 million of adjusted pretax income, group retirement was down 83 million, institutional markets by 12 million, while life insurance was up 71 million sequentially.","As respect to tax, we finished the year at a 24.9% effective tax rate, excluding discrete items or ETR on adjusted pretax income. As you know, the ETR is updated each quarter using actual results than supplemented by re-forecast of the remaining quarters. The fourth quarter incremental tax rate, inclusive of discrete items, was 18.5%.","Moving on to capital management, we repurchased 745 million of our stock during the quarter at $41.22 per share, along with another 5 million of warrants. The shares outstanding, as of 12\/31\/2018 for book value per share purposes is approximately 867 million, whereas the average diluted shares outstanding used for EPS purposes is approximately 888 million shares. As Brian already commented, we secured a board share repurchase authorization that now puts the available amount at $2 billion.","Book value per share and adjusted book value per share, excluding OCI and DTA was $65.04 and $54.95 respectively, which represent reductions of 1.8% and 1.1% relative sequentially to 09\/30\/2018. Our total capital at 12\/31\/2018 stands at 81 billion, comprises 71% equity inclusive of OCI and DTA, 2% hybrids and 27% debt, which is up from last year end, primarily as a result of the Validus acquisition.","After the first quarter, we expect to begin discussing a more industry consistent view towards PML that centers around measurements against our established risk tolerance and a stated return level rather than discussing AAL, which is merely an expected value. More importantly, we consider catastrophic risk to be primarily a balance sheet issue rather than the income statement view that AAL provides.","Given the way underwriting and reinsurance actions burn into calendar quarter results, we expect net improvements in cat exposure and overall results, as we cascade throughout the year. Finally, with now two months under my belt as CFO, I\u2019m very appreciative of the support I've received from all my colleagues and I\u2019m extremely excited to see and have committed to reap the fruits of our hard labor in 2019.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.","Peter Zaffino","Thank you and good morning. Since Mark provided a detailed financial information for general insurance, I will expand on Brian's prepared remarks and highlight some of our more significant accomplishments in 2018. This will include inside on the progress we have made to overhaul our core underwriting capabilities and reinsurance program. I will then give a brief overview of market conditions and summarize our view, entering 2019.","As Brian noted, a significant amount of foundational work was completed in 2018, as we repositioned general insurance and worked towards creating a culture of underwriting excellence. Our principal focus was to outline a new underwriting risk appetite, improve underwriting capabilities and create business units that can positively distinguish themselves in the market. ","Key components of this work included a rigorous review of the entire portfolio, an aggressive limit reduction effort and embedding an enhanced governance and control framework. Detailed portfolio reviews uncovered significant complexity and exposures, resulting from the prior large limit deployment strategy that made AIG an outlier in the industry.","I'd like to provide you with more detail on our key areas of focus. First, with respect to the general insurance organizational structure, we established or reestablished numerous business units, focused on the strategic positioning for each business within the portfolio and empowered our leaders with end to end accountability to drive results. We also filled critical positions, including Chief Underwriting Officer, Chief Actuary, Head of International, Head of Claims and the CEO of Lexington.","Our new leadership team is working to lead the company closer together and we're building a strong bench to execute on improving our underwriting performance. The new organizational structure was designed to better position us to serve our brokers and clients and allowed us to outline a more coherent risk appetite and underwriting strategy. Throughout 2018, we prioritized the reduction of gross and net limits to reduce risk and volatility in our portfolio.","Let me provide a few examples. In property, gross limits deployed in the field were reduced from 2.5 billion to 750 million. Net limits were reduced from 611 million at the end of 2017 to a range of 5 million to 50 million as we entered 2019, depending on the nature of the business. In casualty, gross limits were reduced from 250 million to 100 million and net limits were reduced significantly.","I will provide more detail when I discuss 2019 reinsurance. Primary D&O gross limits at January 1, 2018 were reduced by over $8 billion in the aggregate throughout the year. In our Caribbean business, we moved away from PML and instead shifted to managing our exposures using PIV. And on this basis, reduced gross limits over 50% and reduced net exposure by over 75%, again through aggressive limit management and thoughtful execution on reinsurance.","With respect to Lexington, our new leadership team led by Dave McElroy shifted its focus to the E&S market and reduced maximum property limit deployment from 2.5 billion to approximately 100 million. In 2019, we will continue to shift the property and casualty lines to have greater balance in risk selection, account size, attachment points and geographic spread. Our program business had combined ratios well north of 100% and we've eliminated 20 programs that no longer fit our risk appetite or did not meet profitability thresholds.","We are committed to maintaining the programs business and in the second half of 2018 acquired Glatfelter, a company with talented leadership and a deep bench, a long track record of profitability, investing class underwriting, technology and systems capabilities. Our progress and achievements from a risk management and underwriting perspective have already improved our portfolio and have been critical to our ability to execute on our reinsurance strategy.","Taking a step back, our work relating to reinsurance started in late 2017 when we quickly evaluated the legacy reinsurance strategy and discovered it had a large -- had largely been based on an assessment of capital benefits. We found that the reinsurance programs had substantial shortcomings when it came to relevance and support in the prior Go Large underwriting strategy and managing volatility across return periods.","Those programs did not adequately protect against tail risk limits. Our approach to reinsurance has dramatically shifted in line with our belief that there is strategic value in utilizing reinsurance to strengthen and enhance our portfolio, ensure a balanced book of business with appropriate management of net volatility and protect against extreme risk events.","Heading into January 2018, we made initial decisions to reduce the significant net risk in the portfolio. This was most notable in the North American catastrophe tree, which provided us with meaningful recoveries in the second half of the year. Throughout 2018, we undertook a much deeper review of all treaties and identified additional notable gaps. The new general insurance reinsurance team worked with our reinsurance partners and outlined a revised and more sophisticated approach to underwriting, while designing a global reinsurance program for the January 2019 renewal season.","This past renewal season was challenging and complicated by the following. The increased frequency of catastrophes over the last couple of years reduced supply in the retro market and market contraction in the ILS market and seeded losses to our reinsurance partners in late 2018.","Having said that, we were extremely pleased with the outcome and with the strong support we received from the reinsurance market. We believe the strong support provides independent validation of the progress we're making to enhance our core underwriting capabilities and is evidence of the confidence the industry has in this leadership team and its ability to execute on the turnaround taking place at AIG.","A lot have been said and written about our reinsurance programs, so I'd like to give you more detail on what we've achieved. AIG\u2019s legacy property per risk coverage was developed to support gross limits and property coverage of up to 2.5 billion. In light of our underwriting actions in 2018 to reduce gross limits, we were able to redesign this aspect of our reinsurance program and purchased at lower attach rates. This new property per risk reinsurance dovetails with the continued re-underwriting of our overall portfolio and reduces volatility across our worldwide property business with the per risk attachment points now having a net retention of between 5 million and 50 million, depending on the class and location of the risk.","With respect to property catastrophe, we now have a worldwide occurrence and aggregate covers reducing risk for both our North American and international businesses. Overall, we have reduced the model standard deviation of our property portfolio by 40% and have put in place programs that provide capital and earnings volatility protection. For example, we reduced the modeled volatility on the worldwide all perils of currency exceeding probability by approximately 75% in the one in 100 return period.","Since 2017, the one in 100 US hurricane occurrence exceeding probability has reduced by 45% on a net basis, excluding Validus and in 2019, our models expected worldwide all peril one in 100 occurrence exceeding probability decrease in excess of 15% and that includes Validus. Recent enhancements to the worldwide catastrophe program resulted in significantly reduced Japanese net exposures, which contributed towards the purchase of one combined commercial and personal lines Japanese tower.","In addition, we have much lower attachment points on our global catastrophe treaties, particularly in international and personal insurance. Attachment points for international catastrophe outside of Japan range from 50 million to 75 million. In addition, we recently completed the purchase of a 275 million cap cover design specifically for our personalized business in the US, which provides additional coverage with variable attachment points in peak zones ranging from 40 million to 170 million.","We also made substantial enhancements to our casualties programs. This included expanding the international 75 million excess of 25 million, excess of loss program to North America, which is now a global program and adding a new 50% quota share for the first 25 million for our US primary and excess casualty lines. Together, these treaties reduce our net limits in US casualty on a risk attaching basis and contribute to a rebalancing of our overall net portfolio.","Before concluding, I also want to provide an update on market conditions in the 4th quarter of 2018. On a global basis, General Insurance achieved a weighted average 4% rate increase, both in North America and in international. Rate increases were higher in certain lines of business, such as North America primary public D&O, which achieved low double digit rate increases. Commercial auto, which also experienced rate increases in the low double digits. US excess casualty, which achieved double digit rate increases in most units and commercial property, which saw mid-single digit increases.","In international, Asia Pacific achieved approximately 3% rate increases led by property and financial lines, which achieved a mid-single digit increases. UK and Europe also achieved roughly 3% rate increases, led by motor business, which achieved upper single digit increases and D&O which achieved mid-single digit increases. While rate is an important area of focus for us, the work we're doing to improve risk selection in our core underwriting capabilities as well as the overall repositioning of our portfolio will be the primary drivers of our future performance and profitability.","As Brian noted, 2018 was a year of heavy lifting. While a tremendous amount of foundational work was done, we still have more work to do. The general insurance leadership team is fully committed and aligned with our strategic direction. We continue to be laser focused on repositioning our portfolio, instilling underwriting discipline across general insurance, improving profitability and continuing to evolve our reinsurance program.","In addition, examining our expense base to identify additional efficiencies and cost savings opportunities remains a priority. We continue to expect that these actions together with benefits from the acquisitions of Validus and Glatfelter will allow us to achieve an underwriting profit in general insurance in 2019. We have momentum, a clear vision for the future, an improved risk profile and a culture that is evolving in general insurance into a business that strives for underwriting excellence. I'm proud of what our colleagues around the world accomplished in 2018 and I'm confident we're well positioned to continue our journey.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Hogan","Thank you, Peter and good morning, everyone. As you can see on slide 12, life and retirement recorded full year adjusted ROE of 12.6%, consistent with our long term expectations. The year-over-year change from the annual actuarial assumption update unfavorably impacted ROE by 156 basis points, which was more than offset by the favorable impact of tax reform and reductions in attributed equity consistent with our ongoing de-risking.","Adjusted pretax income of 3.19 billion represents a $641 million reduction from the prior year. The primary drivers of the year-over-year difference were the annual actuarial assumption update, which accounted for 382 million of the decrease, lower returns on fair value option securities of 114 million, higher deferred acquisition cost amortization of 31 million, higher new business expenses of 33 million, 17 million for modernization investments and 39 million for miscellaneous other items that lowered 2017 expenses.","Looking ahead to earnings in 2019, having largely completed our portfolio repositioning, we expect adjusted pretax income to be essentially flat with full year 2018 with a consistent adjusted ROE. These expectations assume a modest improvement in equity markets from year end. In addition, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, our current expectation is that base net spreads will decline by approximately 0 to 2 basis points per quarter at least through 2019.","We also expect lower yield enhancements as interest rates rise. Our 2018 results reflect strong growth from our ongoing strategy to leverage our broad product portfolio and diversified distribution network to satisfy customer needs. As pricing conditions improve in the second half of the year, we significantly increased sales at indexed and fixed annuities. With growth in individual retirement, group retirement and life insurance, we increased total premiums and deposits for the year.","We maintained our disciplined opportunistic approach in institutional markets and closed a number of pension risk transfer deals in the fourth quarter. We are well positioned in 2019 to continue to serve a growing market, enabling us to continue to deploy capital, at or above our targeted economic returns while recognizing we will incur some additional new business expenses associated with such growth.","The investments we have made over the last few years and continue to make to modernize our operating platforms and enhance digital capabilities are already demonstrating benefits in each of our businesses. In group retirement, where we have invested in enhancing the participant web experience, DALBAR recognized our efforts by awarding us the ranking of number one behavior centric planned participant website.","We followed this in 2018 by launching a web based platform to also modernize the planned sponsor experience. In individual retirement, we continued to enhance our award winning platform that is consistently recognized by DALBAR for excellence across multiple customers, ranking number one for variable annuity statements 17 years in a row, receiving an annuity service award for 12 consecutive years and being the only recipient of the communication seal of excellence for 2018.","Further enhancements for 2018 included a redesigned mobile friendly website and the implementation of the new administration system for our fast growing index annuity new business. We continued to enhance our digital capabilities for our life business, while planning the necessary infrastructure changes to completely separate our operating model from there. Finally, for our institutional markets business, we converted the administrative system for pension risk transfers to a new platform to enhance our competitiveness in this growing market.","Our modernization effort of fixed the core is broad, mostly bringing immediate benefits in the form of automation, use of robotics and digitization, all of which improve our efficiency, quality and customer experience.","Turning to the fourth quarter, against the backdrop of a quarter marked by attractive new business margins and growth in total premiums and deposits, our results reflected the impact of sharply declining equity markets and widening credit spreads over the last month of the year. For the quarter, we reported adjusted pretax income of 623 million, which represents 159 million deductions in the prior year quarter.","The primary drivers of the quarter-over-quarter difference were market driven, including lower returns on fair value option securities of 94 million, lower net policy fee and advisory fee income of 44 million and lower base investment spreads of 33 million, due in large part to reduced accretion income. Finally, despite the significant equity market and credit spread volatility during the quarter, I'm pleased to report that our hedging program for living benefit guarantees once again performed as expected, resulting in a modest hedging gain.","Turning to individual retirement on slide 13, premiums on deposits grew by over 35% with particularly strong growth in fixed and indexed annuities. With these strong sales levels, we achieved positive net flows for the quarter, excluding retail mutual funds. Retail mutual funds, which is a comparatively small part of our earnings is a defensibly positioned portfolio that is countercyclical to our individual annuities and may continue to face headwinds in the current rate environment.","Assets under management declined along with the markets, impacting fee income with net spreads also pressured by the market impact on yield enhancements as well as lower accretion income for fixed annuities. ","Turning to group retirement on slide 14, premiums and deposits grew by approximately 14% for the quarter with continued growth in individual product sales, resulting in record high premiums and deposits for the full year. Our surrenders and other withdraw also increased for the year and quarter periods, driven by the loss of some large groups due to the competitive factors which I've talked about on previous calls and higher individual surrenders and other withdrawals. We expect higher surrenders and other withdrawals to continue negatively impact net flows in 2019.","However, we continue to believe that our differentiated model, which focuses on the value of the advisor positions us well as a leader in attractive segments of the growing not-for-profit contribution market. In addition to decreased assets under administration and fee income due to declining equity markets, net that spreads were pressured primarily by the market impact on yield enhancements and lower accretion income. Adjusting for lower accretion income and specific non-recurring items, these net investment spread was in line with the prior year quarter.","Across the retirement portfolio, new money rates are still below portfolio yields, resulting in reduced but still attractive spreads in many products. Also in a rising rate environment, it may be appropriate for us to reflect this and crediting rates for certain of our in-force business.","Let's now move to life insurance on slide 15. Total premiums and deposits increased for the quarter and we continued to produce healthy sales in the US and strong new business growth in the UK. Our adjusted pretax income reflects a material impact of non-recoverable acquisition costs associated with new business, masking an underlying contribution consistent with our long term low to mid double digit return targets. Lastly, our overall mortality experience for the quarter and full year were favorable to pricing assumptions and the prior year periods.","Turning to institutional markets on slide 16, we executed several opportunistic pension risk transfer transactions in the fourth quarter at attractive economic, statutory and accounting returns. The market pipeline for pension risk transfer transactions over the next 12 to 18 months continues to be robust. Overall, our institutional markets business continues to be well positioned to capitalize on available growth across its product lines while remaining focused on achieving targeted returns.","To close, as we enter 2019 with a sustainable business model, well positioned to continue to leverage our broad product expertise and distribution footprint to deploy capital to the most attractive opportunities, as we repositioned the portfolio and prepare to return to overall growth.","Now, I would like to turn it back to Brian to open up for Q&A.","Brian Duperreault","Thanks, Kevin. We gave you a lot of content, which used up a lot of the first hour. So we will, as Liz said, we will go a little long on the Q&A. So operator, let\u2019s go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","You guys have reaffirmed the guidance for 2019. I just want to make sure, like including the underwriting probability in the first quarter of 2019, from the 98.8% underlying combined ratio, you need more than 3 point improvements, assuming a 4.5% of AAL to get to that level in the first quarter. I just wondered, how do you bridge the gap, the 3 point improvement in one quarter? Is that mostly from expense evenings or from the underlying loss ratio?","Brian Duperreault","Well, I think it's going to come from a variety of sources. We thought you might ask this question. So Mark is going to answer and Peter just probably on the supplement.","Mark Lyons","Yeah. We can tag team that. Hi, Kai. So let me address that in kind of two ways, a conceptual approach so you kind of -- you get it and a partial numerical approach. So, first off, if you look at how the book has changed and you look at some of the issues, all areas of the book have gotten a lot of focus. Now, North American commercial is a book that, as I said before, a lot of recurring pain points, it\u2019s probably got a little more focus on it. But good kind of improvements. ","So when you look at fourth quarter of last year to fourth quarter of this year, North American commercial was 31% of the earned premium, now it's 36% of the earned premium where all the focus has been. And with Validus and Glatfelter coming into play, that's going to be pushing a little bit more and they've got very good, Glatfelter in particular, very good program results and the program unit terminated about 20 programs. So you can see loss ratio improvement, because of what\u2019s left and new business coming in with Glatfelter that\u2019s going to help that [skew] [ph].","Secondly, we've talked about rate changes that we've gotten on the book that overall average like 4%, 4% really belies mixtures by unit. And when you get into North American commercial, first, rate changes are on a gross basis and what's going to happen in 2019 is going to be a little different [skew] [ph] to where the rate increases are a little bit higher and therefore there's more distance between loss trend and achieved rate change, so keep that in mind.","Next is think about that with all the reinsurance that Peter described, you're going to have a changing mix more so on a net basis that we believe is to our favor. So that's important I think to recognize. So on top of that, when you think about portfolio construction, it's just as important. I mean, we focus on rate change, but rate change is just a piece of the pie, it's just as important to understand the impacts on the book by what left.","So what got non renewed and what was the economics associated with that versus what stayed on the books and what got on to the books and that's a pretty material incremental improvement and as Peter highlighted, when you change your underwriting risk appetite to make them clear to the outside and you start -- you get more lasered and focused to the kinds of risks that you want and therefore the quality of the average flow into the business is superior.","By doing nothing else, you've increased the rate adequacy, by doing nothing else, so you've got all that. So we, on the portfolio construction, all that aspect is a little more conceptual. So let's get back into some of the numbers. So we just had a 98.8 and you can throw on whatever cat, load you choose for that. So that was a 63.9 and a 34.9. So okay, you asked a sequential question, so we got 22 points roughly of X. Let's assume that doesn't change, even though there will be a lot of actions taken place to improve that.","Let's assume that doesn't change. You get the fixed expenses, which we demonstrably show massive improvement on. So rate changes are going to help that, because you're going to -- everything else being equal, you're going to get a bigger premium base, it's going to help the loss ratio. So just on the margin expansion, without giving any credit to the portfolio change, you're going to be in my view in the middle 96s on that regard without cat or AAL.","So even if everything else I talked about from the rate changes growth, how it's better on a net basis, the fact that there's effective rate changes on the book by what left, not just what we report, let\u2019s just say that's worth a point and there's no way, it's only a point. Let's just say it's a point, you're at 95.5, so pick your cat load, you want to pick 4, you want to pick 3, you want to pick 4.5, we\u2019re there. So that's how I view it.","Brian Duperreault","Peter, do you want to just say anything about the expenses.","Peter Zaffino","Yeah. I think as Mark said, I mean, when we looked at it in terms of looking at how we're going to be below 100, it was the mix of the business, it was going to be how we were reducing the volatility in the portfolio and we ended up having a forecasted better accident year loss ratio, the reinsurance then reduced volatility, but also shifted that balance as Mark said on the overall loss ratio. So we'll see casualty business in the US having a bigger [session] [ph], so therefore a better balance. And then I don't want to lose sight again of Validus and what Glatfelter will contribute.","And as Brian said, on the expense side, we saw a lot of ramping up of the acquisition expenses this year. That was from a portfolio shift in addition, when you looked at the comparisons in \u201917, there were some onetime anomalies, so it looked like it was growing a little bit more and we've been addressing the general operating expenses in the back half of the year, so while you didn't see perhaps a lot of material impact in the first half of \u201918, you saw it in the back half of \u201818 and we believe that that will continue to not only sustain, but we're going to be focused on it throughout the year.","So I think when you look at all those different components, you get to below 100.","Brian Duperreault","And I'm just -- let me just add two things. One, [indiscernible] AAL, the AALs, we haven't given you one, but one can assume they're not going up, they're going down either through a combination of efforts, reducing our gross and net risk, reducing concentrations, and of course reinsurance structures that we put in to place, which are all reducing the AAL, I'd say that.","So the only other thing I'd say, a little caveat, so give me a break here, is and we talked about volatility. So volatility in this book is diminishing, but it's not -- we haven't gotten it all out of the system yet. We've got risk attaching covers and things like that. So there's still a few of the multi-year policies left and the [unearned] [ph] bleeding in, is we still have some stuff with larger per risk limits. So the volatility in the first quarter should be greater than the volatility by the end of the year.","So, you can't -- you got to just recognize that volatility thing is there, but I think Mark and Peter outlined why we've said entering 2019.","Kai Pan","My follow-up is on net investment income, the $13 billion annual run rate you guided to, what's the base assumption for market return in that $13 billion. I'm wondering what's the sensitivity around that, for example, this quarter, market up 10%, how much of \u2013 so better than the run rate you\u2019re going to realize in net investment income.","Doug Dachille","So, we're making the assumptions consistent with what we made in the financial supplement last year. I mean to give you a sense of the volatility from our perspective of return on assets, I mean, we're managing 313 billion of assets. The volatility of net investment income, which is a function of both the economic risk and the accounting mechanisms by which we account for these things is roughly 25 basis points of return volatility on assets.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","I fear all these questions are going to be about how to get to 100%, but I'm going to also try and dovetail on Kai. In the quarter, we saw a big increase in the acquisition expense ratio, offsetting the improvements you guys have made on the GOE expenses. Going forward, where should we see the acquisition, you\u2019re buying more reinsurance and what not that's taking up, is that going to offset the improvements you're making on the operations in terms of people and proper allocation of expenses?","Brian Duperreault","Well, I think, let me start by saying that increase in the acquisition expense was really related to personal insurance in particular. That book of business runs at a high combined ratio, but one under 100. So it actually is additive to the portfolio, particularly when you think about the volatility of it. What was masked was the PCG business deteriorating, so you didn't see the loss ratio improvement. So, the acquisition will stabilize, we don't see that growing. I think there's reason to believe we would get that down. And we will be working on that -- the fact that the offset didn't happen because of the PCG loss ratio deterioration.","Peter, do you have anything you want to add to that?","Peter Zaffino","No. I think it's fair and we don't see acquisition expenses increasing in 2019. We just had, like you, said the ramp up of shift in portfolio and then again having some tough comparables year-over-year and believe that we will continue to focus on the GOE and don't expect to see expenses go up in acquisition.","Josh Shanker","And one related question, I guess maybe unrelated, you are not responsible for the decisions made by the previous management team, but trying to understand what this Go Big strategy meant. There was also a strategy called rapport where they were trying to minimize I guess the capital consumption of various underwriting decisions. Were the two things in conflict with each other, did one of them not exist, was the company trying to minimize its underwriting action order return capital, how did those two things dovetailed with each other and were there conflicting messages, I guess, given the underwriters, what -- explain what was going on before a little better so we can understand how it can improve?","Brian Duperreault","Sometimes, you can\u2019t explain things. I'm not sure I can, but let me try and answer those things. So, I think there was a belief in the balance sheet, starts with a belief in the balance sheet and that's okay, we need a balance sheet, we need a balance sheet to take risk. And it's got -- your risk has got to be matching that balance sheet, but if you tell underwriter, it's okay to write 2.5 billion and by the way, who else is going to do it, so you think you'd corner the market, right. So if you don't get paid for it, you've got a problem. So you put out an extra $1 billion of limits with almost no payment, because it's impossible to get value for that kind of additional limit. ","So when you add that to, let's say, underwriting where the underwriters were not selecting properly or they were adversely selecting against, being selected against and you go large, you go large on risk, you shouldn't be writing, it just exacerbates everything and then you try to -- then as an actuary, you try to reserve this stuff where the volatility is impossible, how much risk can you put into your reserve levels to try to recognize the extreme volatility that might occur. So look, I don't -- all I know is, I wouldn\u2019t have done it and I know we're not doing it. That's about all I could say. Hope that helps.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question, so in response to Kai\u2019s question, Brian, I think you said that sometimes there are some volatility, given some multi-year policies potentially in the first quarter. I just want to reaffirm that based on how you see your book running that you do expect to come in below 100 in general insurance in the first quarter, and then a couple of Q4 numbers that might help us think through that, was there any kind of current accident year adjustment that would have impacted the fourth quarter, chewing up earlier quarters and can you let us know what valid, if it was additive to margins in the fourth quarter?","Brian Duperreault","Those are three different questions. [Technical Difficulty] Yes. I did -- I just put a little copy out that there's volatility, but yes, I'm reaffirming that we\u2019re entering 2019 expecting to make an underwriting profit, including AAL. So that's answer number one.","Then there was a question about whether or not there were things that occurred in the fourth quarter. Mark, you want to take that?","Mark Lyons","Yeah. I also applaud you, Elyse. I think that\u2019s like three question, part A through H. So the question about accident year 18, were there any movements, there were some ups and downs, but the net was 30 basis points on basically $7 billion for the whole year, so it\u2019s $40 million. So it\u2019s nothing to get excited about. And there was one other one, right. Validus","Peter Zaffino","This is Peter. Is it with or without cat, because if it\u2019s with cat, it was not accretive because the one that if you look at \u201917, they're very good at how they buy reinsurance, but \u201917, if you look at the comparables, was more active in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. So if you look at both quarters together, it was roughly the same in terms of what contributes to net cat, if you take out cat, it was in the range of where we were as general insurance. So it wasn't terribly far off, but.","Brian Duperreault","Do you have a follow up series of questions, Elyse?","Elyse Greenspan","Yeah. I mean the one other thing that I think just stood out to me, Mark, maybe you can give a little bit more color, Peter, the international margins, I know you made the year over year compare that they got better relative to the fourth quarter, they didn't get better relative to the third quarter, did you guys see any one-off kind, were you guys on any large property losses or something that might have impacted the numbers or was it seasonality that you're not necessarily comparing international Q4 to Q3.","Mark Lyons","Yeah. It's a good question. If you look at history, you're going to see it\u2019s bounced all over the place, it\u2019s a lot of different lines of business, it\u2019s 80 countries, reflecting kind of like what my prepared comments on FL, internationally get a poppier out of India, then you get one out of APAC, and then let\u2019s break the next quarter, but if you look back to the full accident year of \u201818 and the full accident year of \u201917, they're basically mirror images of each other. One was 65.2%, one was 65% even. So, you're going to get pop. So sequentially, I don't think gives you any information content.","Operator","We will take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","Mark, I thought your walk to mid-90s accident year combined ratio was very helpful. And I think I understand the math around the impact of rate improvement, but ultimately there must be some assumption around loss trends there as well, right. So I just want to make sure that the way I'm thinking about, the way you guys are thinking about are roughly the same namely that to get to this mid-90s, you're assuming that the rate improvements are in excess of loss trends, even in line that where you're getting both the rates clearly, those are lines that are also facing steeper loss trends.","Mark Lyons","I think, yes, the answer is yes, but let me -- I just want to emphasize something here and that is rate alone would not have improved this portfolio. Okay? Even if it was above the loss trend, because if the portfolio is a collection of risk, you shouldn't be writing, you can't get enough money for that stuff. So there is, the untold story is the improvement of the portfolio, which really affects the loss ratios and combined ratios and that's an important thing to keep in mind. Do you have anything else you want to ask, Yaron?","Yaron Kinar","Yes. I do. Actually maybe shifting gears to the investment portfolio, so you guys have clearly spent a lot of time and effort to de-risk the liability portfolio, especially in general insurance, what are your thoughts around the investment portfolio today broadly and in general insurance specifically?","Doug Dachille","Well actually, we've had three years to do the de-risking of the investment portfolio. So if you look out over the past three years, we've dramatically reduced all the fair value option equities, we eliminated a whole host of legacy investments that we took over in 2015, things like life settlements, which were both illiquid and had modest returns for the risks that we were getting, we reduced our hedge fund exposures by over $7 billion. We reduced our private equity exposures, we changed where the investment -- risk investments were held. We reduced the amount of those exposures in the life and retirement business because there's so much more capital markets exposures to the underlying core business that it didn't make sense to include those types of asset classes in those books of business. If you look at the exposures that we have to equity markets, let's understand when you look at our overall investment portfolio, it's still an ALM based book of business designed to match our liabilities. ","So we -- all the alternatives are really allocated to the surplus of the general insurance books and it's very modest and what we try to do is manage liquidity, economic and accounting volatility and also try to get excess risk adjusted returns. So in looking at that portfolio, we're very comfortable with what we currently have in our alternatives, which is a mix of private equity and hedge funds, but we're always tweaking it, but the absolute holdings that we have in scale, we're very comfortable with, we'll continue to make ongoing rebalancing of how we allocate that risk bucket, but I think the size of it will continue on going forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","Two questions on life and retirement. First, can you talk about how much impact the markets had on DAC amortization in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, you've talked about expecting a couple of basis points of core spread compression per quarter. I think the decline was much greater this quarter due to higher crediting rates and you mentioned some unusual items, but how should we think about the rate base level of this for 2019.","Brian Duperreault","Thanks, Eric. First of all, in terms of the fourth quarter impact, the impact on DAC from the market was -- versus the prior year just over 80 million. And of course, it's a combination of where the equity markets levels are, an impact from the credit spread widening, et cetera. And so, if you look at the overall fourth quarter, the sharp decline in the AUM in the last four weeks impacted not just the DAC, but also fee income, which is a reflection generally of where the equity markets are and also the impact of the spread widening on mostly the fair value options and the impact of the markets on yield enhancements and accretion income is also something to keep in mind. ","So, as we look at the whole question of the cost of funds and base spreads, I think what's important is there were some anomalous items, mostly in group retirements in the fourth quarter, but year over year, cost of funds was 2.73, which is just 3 basis points from the 2.76 in the prior year. So it's not actually about the prior year, fixed annuities year-over-year was flat at 2.65 and variable and index almost flat at 1.24 versus 1.26. So really the cost of funds is not something other than that one-off item in the fourth quarter, significant concerns. And as we look at the base spreads, obviously, in particular some of the market effects were primarily what you saw in the effect in the fourth quarter. And assuming where the markets were at the end of the year and where we believe interest rates are going to be, our interest rates were, we are still confident of that maximum negative spread compression of the two basis points in 2019.","Erik Bass","Just want to clarify further -- your guidance, you talked about life and retirement earnings being flat in 2019. Just to be sure, that's off of the adjusted 2018 number you show in the supplement and then what are you assuming for the equity market return?","Kevin Hogan","Yes. That is correct. We are assuming that comparable also on the ROE, \u201819 versus \u201918. In terms of equity markets, we're assuming a modest improvement in the equity markets from where they were as of the end of the year.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","First question goes on Mark. Last quarter on the call, late November, you talked about how you had reviewed much of the book and saw no material red flags upon that material review. So Mark, I'm wondering, I think you mentioned a little earlier something about amortization. I'd like a little clarity on what you saw subsequent to that November call and what your confidence is with regard to prior year development goings into 2019.","Mark Lyons","So with respect to November, so when we looked in for the fourth quarter effectively backwards, there's really no adjustments of note on anything prior reviewed. So, as far as I'm concerned, those numbers are stable, like the reallocation between couple of lines, but in the average, nothing moved. So if you're -- by end of November, you're really talking about Goldman's December 5th conference, which I assume you're referring to December 5th already.","Andrew Kligerman","They didn't invite me.","Mark Lyons","Okay. Well, I'm sure you might have read about it. But what's our responsibility as an insurer, it\u2019s setting reserves for all occurrences that have happened 12\/31 and prior and this was December 5. So 3 weeks of losses to emerge, but so at the time, everything was still in flight, but I'm not making excuses. The point is that when you get into the depth, you didn't hear us talk about personal lines problems, you really didn't hear us talk about rest of world casualty in any material way and you didn't really hear us talk about the buffer or comp excess on it. So, it was financial lines, that was the center issue, mostly US issue, some scattered pop. So back to the reasonable range we're comfortable with that.","To your question about, well, I think that really was the net of your question is how do we feel about things, how we've been through a whole cycle. I feel pretty good about it. [indiscernible] Let me say something the confidence in reserves starts with the confidence in the underwriting this -- producing those reserves. So the more and more comfort we have about what we're doing as a company and the work around taking the volatility out to make the results more predictable just adds to our confidence.","You want to add something else Andrew?","Andrew Kligerman","So, I understand the business mix and the pricing increases, but where I'm not getting the math is, if I make an estimate of Validus and Glatfelter premium, I still see 2019 over \u201818 getting a premium increase and even with the rate increases, which you say are about 4%, if I subtract that out, maybe premium were about flat. And so I guess, how are you going to get this loss ratio improvement, what business are you departing that would get this improvement, if premium is so flat, it's just hard to see what the moving parts are that are going to get you this this loss ratio improvement, so maybe you could give me a little math on what's going away and what's coming in and still being able to maintain flat premium.","Peter Zaffino","Well, thank you for the question and it's a complicated answer, because the portfolio has been shifting across the world, as we outlined in terms of going from a large limit strategy to using limits a little bit more discretely, but also Brian keeps emphasizing, it's also the risk selection and rebalancing the portfolio. So within every business and every geography, we have been looking very hard at getting the appropriate returns once we make good risk selections, we have the right coverage and that has happened in a dramatic way. ","So the one, I will highlight because it's happening across many of the portfolios would be the Lexington, the Lexington was doing admitted and non-admitted, it was doing business from wholesale and retail, it was doing large limits on property and casualty as well as having a very large program business and so it has been recalibrating its risk appetite to substantially play in a role where it has very strong expertise. ","We have brought in industry leaders, focusing on the E&S space, focusing through wholesale, making sure we're using tighter limits when we do the risk selection, going into having a better balance with not only large accounts, but in the middle market and so the portfolio has been starting to move in a direction where we're recalibrating and reconstituting what the portfolio looks like, at the same time, there are some businesses that are further along some that are not and with that, you're going to have the general insurance excluding Validus and Glatfelter, will decrease year-over-year on a premium basis, then the complexity of the reinsurance, so I know it's hard to do the math, but we believe that we are repositioning the portfolio with a better risk selection and that will be reflected in the accident year loss ratios as we earn into 2019.","Mark, do you want to add anything to that?","Mark Lyons","Yeah. Just the fact that, I think what we said on last quarter's call that we don't need a hard market to improve this book. It comes back to the composition and what we\u2019re letting go if we can't get rate and structure that we want and what's coming in and everybody focuses on price, I get it, because it's measurable and it\u2019s something you can compare, but a whole flow of business, a whole understanding of the cat exposures, the whole structure, price is last and that's what we measure.","Brian Duperreault","Andrew, let me just \u2013 you have a risk that comes in the door, right and we've been writing it for some time, we've been attaching too low, so it's either deductibles, it\u2019s an access placement, we've been attaching too low and we've been giving way too much one that it's at the top. Okay. So you get rid of the limited copy that we're getting paid for, it just improved your portfolio immediately. You raise up from where you were to a higher limit where the risks diminish, right. Now, that'll cause you to get less premium, you've got a much better risk on your hands and that doesn't even count getting [indiscernible] So, you've got to trust this, I\u2019m telling you, the premium is flat and we don't need a hard market to make this thing better, as Mark said.","Andrew Kligerman","Yeah. Just very broadly then, I mean, because what your strategy makes impeccable sense bluntly, it would sound to me with these reinsurance issues and lower limits, that at least 25% of your portfolio is turning over the good stuff in, the bad stuff out, is that a good assessment. ","Kevin Hogan","Getting back to, some stuff is going clearly, but we're not like getting wholesale out of a lot of business, but what Brian said is key. You can stay -- we could \u2013 if we have 100 risks, we could still stay on the 100 risk, but on a different place on the structure where the risk reward trade-off is better, 100% renewal retention on the account and the volume is down 33%, but it's a better loss ratio expectation. That's what you've got to internalize.","Operator","The next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore.","Tom Gallagher","Brian, so your description of the Go Large strategy, large limits and de-riskiness, can you talk about where we are on this de-risking process, would you say it's largely done or is 2019 going to continue to be a risk reduction year? And the point of my question is usually when you materially reduce risk, normalized earnings go down, absolute ROE goes down. I understand risk adjusted earnings should be getting better and cost of capital should be lower, but I guess broadly speaking where are we on that risk reduction journey, what does that really mean for ROE about 2019. I know you've really given out like 3 year forward ROE, does it mean near term ROE is going to be more depressed, you're going to get more of a back end loaded improvement, anyways, pretty broad question there, but what are your thoughts?","Brian Duperreault","Yes. So, is the process done? Well, as we described, Peter and I, Tom Bolt\u2019s work with all our underwriters has been distributed, so we've set the tone of what we want to do. Okay. So the strategy, yeah, I think the strategy is done. The implementation is being done and risk by risk, as they come up for renewal, you make adjustments and things bleed off. So that's what I was saying, the first quarter is going to be riskier in terms of volatility and the fourth quarter just as the portfolio earns in at the strategy that we've been deploying. So strategy is done, implementation is weaving its way through the book this year. This ROE, de-risking ROE thing, well, that just presupposes that you're getting paid for the risk, but if you don't get paid for the risk and you stop taking it, you are pretty close up. And that is not even risk adjusted, so when I said 8 travels to double digit, a lot of that has to do with a continuing effort on our expenses, which is a significant task for us over the next several years and that's why it's that journey is a little longer, hope that helps.","Tom Gallagher","That does. And when I think about, to your point, to me, the clearest expression of what risk reduction is going to mean is AAL, but I know previously, it was 4.5 points and I guess you're not giving specific guidance on that, why not give specific guidance on that because that's the one tangible thing we can point to to describe the actual earnings benefits from the risk reduction program?","Brian Duperreault","Well first of all, the AAL is one measure, right, but it's not the only measure of risk, right, so you've got a lot of risk kinds of measurements that you should deploy. Well, let's see, this AAL number is a moving, it's moving, right. Obviously, it's moving for a lot of reasons, we're reducing concentrations as I said earlier, we're changing risk profile in terms of per risk size, the per risk limits that are being deployed out there and the reinsurance is being put into effect. So you have to understand that the AAL is a moving number right now, getting better. So when we feel we've got a good number, I would not have any problem, tell me what it is, so I'm not hung up about it, but I can tell you it's moving south. And it's not the only measure though.","Mark Lyons","Tom, just one thing on your preface on that AAL. AAL is explosive, the underlying risk associated with AAL, right. So it's just that that's in your face. Cat occurs, earthquake occurs, front page of The Journal where everybody can focus on it, that\u2019s why with cat bonds, everyone thinks they understand the model risk and all that. Now look at the history of AIG, look at the history of any large company. It's the deferred risk, not immediate risk associated with casualty business. So primary casually, excess comp, I mean look at it at the past of the industry. That risk is simply deferred, but it's as big and real and more capital exposed as property, but everybody gives a short shrift, but that's what you have to focus on and that's what Peter and his team has done.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","So looking forward to 2020 if I can, is it fair to assume that the impact of multi-year P&C contracts and the expenses associated with 2019 life and retirement growth that both of those will be sources of improvement in 2020.","Peter Zaffino","Well, certainly the multi-year should have bled off by that, no question about that. I\u2019ll let Kevin talk about.","Kevin Hogan","Yeah. So Meyer, on the expenses, I think I mean if you look year-over-year right, \u201818 versus \u201917, we had a reported increase in GOE of about 110 million, 40 million of which were one-time items in \u201817 that helped \u201817 and don't repeat. So, the expense increase base is about 70 million. Around half of that is actually directly associated with new business growth. Obviously, our premiums and deposits are way up, serving those policies, et cetera, has its additional burden. So relative to the projects, we're certainly getting an immediate benefit from those and we'll continue to invest what we need to in order to keep up with the increasing regulatory demands and customer expectations, but a part of that increase in GOE is related to new business and so to the extent that our new business continues to grow, then, we're going to continue to see new business expenses associated with that growth.","Brian Duperreault","Meyer, do you have a follow-up if you have one, and then I'm going to cut this off. So, do you have anything else?","Meyer Shields","I do. Just looking within casualty, is the mix of business between the four lines of business you report, property, special risks, liability, financial lines, is that going to shift dramatically when we take into account all of the things that have been done on gross and net writings.","Brian Duperreault","Yeah. Peter, you want to do that?","Peter Zaffino","Thanks, Meyer. The portfolio will continue to shrink on a net premium earned basis because we just placed a 50% quota share of the first 25 million and life property, we have been reducing the gross limits substantially, so that portfolio will continue to be recalibrated and again you'll have the impact of the reinsurance in 2019 and 2020.","Brian Duperreault","Okay. So let me just close here. Thanks, Meyer. Let me just close here and I \u2013 first of all, I want to thank you for participating on our extended call today and bearing with us. We had a lot that we wanted to talk about. I hope we gave you a good sense of the hard work we've been doing and continue to do it here at AIG. You know maybe it's a clich\u00e9, but it's absolutely true, our greatest strength is our colleagues and I want to thank them all for all they're doing, not just for the company but for our clients and our stakeholders.

While our focus has been on share buyback up until now, our focus going forward in capital management working closely with the Fed in terms of what we\u2019re able to do. We\u2019re going to now focus on our coverage ratio and that\u2019s going to be looking at our debt and our ability to cover the debt with earnings.","On the property, casualty side, again we\u2019re seeing good progress in terms of reshaping that business, Peter will give you more color in just a moment. We are seeing rate increases and we should focus on our accident year, because that\u2019s where we\u2019re making progress in terms of the changes we\u2019re making you see some gradual improvement which we said would occur. And we\u2019re continuing to focus on making sure that our reserves stay strong and we\u2019re working through making sure any development is dealt with very conservatively.","On the AIG, Life and Retirement business we had again a good quarter. The market\u2019s helped us a little bit. We did have some adverse impact and Jay will take you through couple of the items from the past that we dealt within this quarter. Our variable annuity sales and we\u2019ve talked before about, how we designed that product, we think we have a very good risk management product, just as its design alone and so our sales continue to grow. And Jay will talk a little bit about our base yields and what\u2019s happening in this low interest rate environment.","Last but not least, on the mortgage guarantee, we continue to see great progress in that business as the market begins to turn and we\u2019re having huge success with the way we\u2019re now underwriting mortgages. So that will be an add for us. One thing that Dave will talk about is ILFC in terms of where we are in terms of managing that business, but more importantly, we still are commitment to an IPO of that business once the markets are receptive.","So let me turn it over to David, who will start giving us more color on the things I have just talked about, David?","David Herzog","Thank you Bob, and good morning everyone. As evidenced from our results, it\u2019s been another busy quarter here at the AIG as we continue to execute both on the capital management and on the operating fronts. As we look towards the remainder of the year and 2013 and beyond, capital management will remain a focus and core competency at AIG.","We remain committed to our goal of $25 to $30 billion in capital management by 2015 and we\u2019re over half way there or roughly half way there at this point. We\u2019ve described capital management to include more than just share buyback and this is a good time to remind you that we will consider acquisitions, investment in organic growth, debt capital management and certainly maintaining strong capital at our operating companies, all aimed at effectively utilizing our deployable capital, increasing enterprise value while also improving our interest coverage ratio that Bob just mentioned.","All of the above options would be considered in the event of a sale of our AIA shares. As Bob said, we do not know what will be required under Fed regulations and we view this as being, will be prudent, given our expectations of becoming a non-bank SIFI. With respect to AIG's capacity for capital management, we believe again, if we were to sell, hypothetically sell our AIA shares that we'd have approximately 2.5 billion of deployable capital now and subject, of course to discussions with the Fed reserves as well as rating agencies in terms of the actual deployment. As for potential actions in the fourth quarter, we have about 1.1 billion of hybrids that become callable in December and we may consider calling those bonds.","Turning to slide four for the financials, you can see that after tax operating earnings per share grew to a $1 a share from a $1.58 loss, a year ago. Growth was driven by increased earnings from both the property casualty and life and retirement segments. Book value per share was $68.79. Excluding AOCI book value per share was $61.41, up 10% sequentially. Share buyback contributed nearly $5 to this quarter's book value growth. The effective operating tax rate increased during the quarter to just over 35%, due in part to a shift in the investments to taxable securities in our property casualty group and a third quarter of what I'll call, catch up, reflecting higher, full year income projections, as well as what I would refer to as a return of provision true-up in the normal course that added a couple of points to the tax rate in the quarter. Going forward we would expect our tax rates to be in the 30%, 31% range over time. As you know we will not be paying, actually be paying any taxes for some time, given the availability of our NOLs.","On slide five, provides a breakdown of the statement operating earnings which reflects the 87% growth in operating income from our insurance operations and Peter and Jay will provide additional insights in a moment. This quarter the gains in the direct investment book benefited from credit spread tightening and gains recognized from winding down positions. As we have said in the past, our strategy has been to maximize the value during the run off of this book. We may decide from time to time to terminate trades opportunistically for a variety of reasons including de-risking. We expect over half of the direct investment book liabilities to run off by 2017. To date, we have realized significant value from an orderly and opportunistic wind down.","ILFC\u2019s results for the quarter reflected a $98 million in impairment charges on aircraft, largely from the completion of our annual detailed portfolio review. While this is significant decline from the prior two years, it\u2019s a good time to remind you that there were significant industry trends driving those impairments, including the introduction of more fuel efficient aircraft like the NEO. Also, as a reminder with respect to ILFC Aeroturbine, our product company gives us another end of aircraft life opportunity to optimize value.","Slide six and seven, highlight our capital structure and liquidity. We remained well capitalized with debt to total capital ratio of 20% while leverage ratio is appropriate. We as a management team, as Bob said, are focused on improving our coverage ratios. The rating agencies have given us indications of expected improvements for an incremental increase in our coverage ratios over the next 12 to 18 months. And we intend to achieve these improvements through a combination of liability management and improvements in operating earnings in our core businesses.","Cash flows from our insurance companies remain strong. We\u2019ve already received roughly 5.3 billion in dividends from our insurance operations through the end of October, exceeding our annual target of 4 to 5 billion in dividends. This dividend of 5.3 includes a 1.3 we received post quarter end.","So at this time, I would like to turn it over to Peter for discussion of AIG property casualty, Peter?","Peter Hancock","Thank you David, good morning everyone. First I\u2019d like to make a brief comment regarding Hurricane Sandy. Right now our immediate goals are obviously to safeguard our employees and to assist our customers, but it\u2019s too early to conclude how severe the storm is going to be from an insurance standpoint. So reaching out to customers, making sure our claims reporting information is available to them and standing by to assist them.","But turning to our results, AIG property casualty continued to make progress in the third quarter. While I prefer the pace of change to be quicker, we remain on track with our strategic initiatives.","As slide eight of the earnings presentation indicates, we reported operating income of 786 million in the third quarter, compared to 492 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase was driven by lower catastrophe losses, current accident year, underwriting improvements and higher net investment income, partially offset by increased expenses.","We recorded 261 million in catastrophe losses in the quarter, largely from crop losses related to the drugs in the U.S. Midwest and Hurricane Isaac. We believe that losses related to Hurricane Isaac were left severe than our business would have experienced in prior years, due to our focused efforts to carefully manage exposures to U.S. catastrophes.","Third quarter net prior year adverse development was $145 million or 0.2% of our total reserves. The result was primarily driven by adverse development in environmental and primary casualty and the impact of changes in New York state benefit reforms on our workers\u2019 compensation business.","The accident year loss ratio as adjusted was 66.5%, nearly a 2 point improvement over the comparable prior year period, despite an unusual increase in non-catastrophe property severe losses. We view the improvement in accident year loss ratio over the past several quarters as a strong indicator that our strategies to optimize business mix, pricing and risk selection through enhanced underwriting tools are succeeding.","We continue to balance growth, profitability and risk measuring the success of our initiatives based on overall risk-adjusted profitability. However, we maintain the capital and resource flexibility to respond to changes in market conditions.","Our organizational structure promotes underwriting excellence as we\u2019ve consolidated our underwriters into global teams versus the silo structure that existed in the past. We\u2019ve empowered our employees to implement state-of-the-art underwriting tools and hire new talent to supplement our bench of existing talent.","Partially offsetting the loss ratio improvement was an increase in the expense ratio. As we have communicated in prior quarters, the expense increase was largely due to higher acquisition cost as we focus on higher value lines and from greater investment in direct marketing.","General operating expenses also increased from investments in people and infrastructure. Expenses will continue to remain elevated over the next year as we invest in these priorities.","We expect to start to realize efficiencies and to experience a gradual decline in net expenses beginning in 2014. Property casualty\u2019s net premiums were up 2.4% compared to prior year after adjusting for foreign exchange.","Turning to slide nine, commercial insurance net premiums were down slightly excluding foreign exchange. We completed the restructuring of our loss sensitive business in U.S. casualty which reduced premiums written by almost 1% in the quarter but improved capital efficiency. The remainder of the decline reflected risk selection and rate discipline strategies particularly in U.S. casualty.","U.S. commercial insurance rates increased 8.4% while property and workers compensation rates in the U.S. increased 12.1% and 8.9% respectively. We are encouraged by the rate environment overall, but some lines and regions remain under pressure and we have not characterized this as a hard market.","Consumer insurance continued to experience growth across its major lines of business. As you can see from slide 10, this attractive segment which includes the direct marketing channel represents over 40% of net premiums year-to-date. We also continued to expand in targeted growth economy nations, which contributed over $1 billion in premiums. Notably, we grew by approximately 14% in Latin America and 10% in Asia Pacific excluding Japan during the third quarter.","Slide 11, demonstrates our investment portfolio mix. Third quarter net investment income increased 20% as a result of positive marks on recently acquired structure securities. AIG property casualty is tailoring its strategic asset allocation to optimize profitability in the current low interest rate environment while remaining aligned with AIG\u2019s overall risk appetite and tax position. We continued to diversify our portfolio into higher yielding securities and reducing our concentration in municipal bonds during the third quarter.","Reflecting our emphasis on capital management, we have made $2.4 billion in dividend payments to the holding company year-to-date, which includes 75 million in cash paid during the third quarter and an additional 800 million in cash paid in October. The commitment to capital efficiency places 2012 on track to be our largest dividend paying year in recent history.","Our capital adequacy levels remain in line with rating agency requirements and we maintain strong financial strength for ratings that carry a stable outlook with the four major rating agencies. Our legal entity simplification efforts have enabled greater capital efficiency particularly in Europe, where the majority of our operations will be executed through one Pan-European insurance company beginning in December, subject to final U.K. court approval.","In closing, I would like to note that we have had several consecutive quarters of positive trends and business performance, and execution of our strategic plans. I am pleased to continue to make progress while recognizing that we have much more work to do, so let\u2019s turn over to Jay.","Jay Wintrob","Thanks a lot Peter. And good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to start on slide 12, AIG Life and Retirement delivered another solid quarter with pre-tax operating income up 75% over the same quarter last year reflecting a positive impact from equity markets this quarter, higher net investment income and increased net income.","There were three items that we highlighted in the press release that are worth mentioning when analyzing our results this quarter. One is the previously announced resolution of the multistate examination related to the handling of unclaimed property and the use of the social security administration\u2019s debt master file.","In the quarter, the total earnings impact was negative 66 million. We also took $20 million restructuring charge this quarter relating to the upcoming merger of six of our life insurance legal entities into American General Life Insurance Company at the end of this year, as well as for project we call One Life, that provides for the consolidation of all of our life insurance platforms, operations and systems. We expect these actions to result in an improved service delivery model and importantly, to generate significant annual expense savings beginning next year as we continue to focus on disciplined expense management.","And finally, AIG Life and Retirement results were negatively impacted by $110 million interest credited adjustment for a runoff block of guaranteed investment contracts. That adjustment represented the cumulative impact of increased interest credited dating back to the yearly 2000s, and therefore the annual earnings impacted this item was not a material amount over the individual years.","Excluding these three items, our pre-tax operating income was very strong at slightly more than $1 billion in the quarter. Also as David mentioned, AIG Life and Retirement has been a significant contributor to capital management providing $2.9 billion in dividends and distributions to date. Our risk-based capital ratio, which we currently estimate to be in excess of 475% remains well above our capital maintenance agreement threshold of 435% and stat earnings, remains strong providing capacity for dividends going forward.","In this quarter, sales results once again reflect the value of our diversified business model, variable annuity and retain mutual fund sales were strong in the quarter while fixed annuity sales declined as expected given the unprecedented low interest rate environment. Total life insurance sales were up from the year ago quarter, although down modestly sequentially.","Variable annuity sales have exceeded $1 billion in very quarter this year and while still relatively a small percentage of total sales, our 39% variable annuity sales growth year-to-date reflects a re-established position with core distributors, in core distribution channels and a competitive and appropriately designed and priced product for the current market conditions.","During the steep decline in fixed annuity sales, net flows which we define as sales less all surrenders, debt benefits withdrawal and all other benefit payments. We are negative for the first time in seven quarters. We continue to make progress on implementing our new distribution organization structure, which is designed to fully leverage our distribution relationships and increase sales of multiple products across all of our distributions channels.","Moving on to slides 13 and 14. We have provided additional information on our asset allocation and on our portfolio yields. In the quarter, our annualized base investment yield declined sequentially as a result of lower accretion income on structured securities, lower income on certain equity method investments and lower yields on new purchases in the quarter due the lower interest rates, credit spread tightening and higher credit quality purchases. It\u2019s important to distinguish between total and base investment yields. And while investment yields excludes income from alternative investments; call and tender activity and other enhancements, total investment yield is based on the total reported net investment income. And total investment yield didn\u2019t remained strong for the quarter at 5.86% and 6.03% year-to-date, an increase over both the prior year and the prior quarter.","We do not expect any material changes in our asset allocation in the near future and we will continue to actively manage interesting crediting rates. At the end of the quarter, approximately 61% of our account values were at minimum crediting rates and consistent with declining market interest rates, we saw the fullest sequential decline, in our cost of funds this quarter for all our retirement services businesses.","Turning on to slide 15, we have updated our disclosure regarding the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment. Assuming the current interest rate and credit spread environment remain static, we do expect pressure on operating earnings going forward. To date, redeployment of our cash, including opportunistic investments and structured securities and disciplined management of interest crediting rates have mitigated the impact. At this time, we do not foresee a significant DAC or stat capital impact, as a result of the sustained low interest rate environment.","Our projections refer a steady decline in base portfolio yields and in new money yields, which we are currently assuming to be between 3.75% and 4.25%, consistent with our actual base new money yield in the third quarter. We\u2019ll continue to monitor reinvestment activity, credit spreads and overall new money yields closely and assess future impacts as appropriate.","In the quarter, we continued to execute on a program to utilize capital tax loss carry forwards. Year-to-date we sold approximately $5.9 billion of investments at a book yield of 6.3% and that generated realized gains of about $1.2 billion. With these sales and subsequent reinvestment of proceeds at lower yields, that impacted our operating income, but we captured real after tax economic benefits. The program is now substantially complete and the impact on 2013 pre-tax operating income compared to this year will be a reduction of about $33 million from the program.","In closing, we've positioned ourselves very well for the challenges of the low interest rate environment and our earnings capacity remains solid. Continued focus on product innovation, disciplined product pricing, expense management and fully leveraging our resources in distribution relationships remain core to our strategy.","So this time I want to turn it back over to David.","David Herzog","Thank you, Jay. And turning to slide 16, for just a quick summary of United Guaranty. UGC continues to see growth in its new business volumes and it's continuing its leadership position in their mortgage insurance industry and UGC is generating returns in excess of 20% on new business and we continue to experience declines in delinquency.","At this point, I'd like to turn it back to Liz to tee up the Q&A. Thanks.","Liz Werner","Operator, could we begin the Q&A now?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We'll take our first question from Josh Stirling, Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","So listen, I think we all appreciate the substantial clarity, I\u2019d say on your near term plans for capital management and how debt is going to fit in.  I am wondering David, if you could give us a sense of, in the near term what sort of coverage ratios you might be trying to target. How much more beyond the hybrids that you\u2019ve identified, you would sort of see us toward to get there? And as when you think about you know a firm\u2019s total capital generation, obviously I think people sort of have a handle it seems like operating earnings and tax benefits monetizing. I wonder if you can give us some of the color around what the impact of the things you have been doing, restructuring your life insurance companies, consolidating legal entities in Europe and then per sense of prospectively moving assets from the DIB or liabilities from FP into the regulated entities that we should be thinking about as a future capital impact?","David Herzog ","I\u2019ll start on the capital management and then kick it over to Jay, for a commentary on those life legal entity restructuring and then may be Peter can comment further on the property casualty legal entity and then we\u2019ll circle shuffle back to Brian for maybe a word or two on the, some color on the direct investment book. With respect to the coverage ratio improvement, I think the agencies have been pretty clear that while our leverage is in a very strong position, they\u2019d like to see a couple returns improvement over that period of time 12 to 18 months. So again, there is lot of ways to accomplish that. One is with a reduction in the interest expense and again targeting a financial leverage or the securities that count towards financial leverage that includes senior debt, it includes some of the hybrids. So I think again, that\u2019s one way and obviously the continued improvement in the operating earnings of our core insurance operations is clearly the other lever and that\u2019s consistent with our plans and expectations with respect to, again, the continued improvement. So those are the general direction that we\u2019re going. We haven't specifically identified any specific transactions. Again, that is under consideration. So Jay, why don\u2019t you maybe comment on the life and retirement legal entity structure?","Jay Wintrob","We put in context, in terms of directly answering your question, in terms of increased capital efficiency; we see that as modest, probably somewhere between a $150 and $250 million of less lower capital with the same amount of liabilities, principally due to the covariance of risk. But more importantly, the legal entity consolidation is going to diversify our risks to a greater extent. That\u2019s going to allow us both on an economic basis and also under all of our stress testing to withstand far greater stresses within our largest life entity American General Life Insurance Company.","Also, there will be some modest, but not an important expense savings from the consolidation and as importantly from the standpoint of our distribution partners and others that we do business with, it will make doing business with us easier as will be more of a single life company with whom agents and financial advisors can be licensed to access a much broader range of our products. So, there are several different benefits and capital efficiency is one of many.","Peter Hancock","Similar story in our Pan-European legal entity consolidation. We are talking about going from four legal entities operating in 26 countries into one starting 1st December and that has benefits both in terms of stat capital as well as operating cost efficiencies and better controls. The stat capital benefit right off the bat is about $300 million but will be greater over time, but dependent on a number of factors, including how we organize our internal reinsurance, pooling arrangements and the extent to which we use Europe versus North America as a hub for internal reinsurance, as well as how we optimize our holdings in the investment portfolio, because right now our European investment portfolio has very, very high quality assets relative to our North American ones. So, there is room to optimize where we hold what types of securities to increase our capital efficiency. So, I think that taken as a whole, very substantial efficiency benefits both in terms of OpEx as well as capital usage.","Brian Schreiber","As we have said in the past we managed the DIB to again maximize its profitability overtime while maintaining adequate capital and liquidity to cover any risk. The DIB over time has generated several billion dollars of income and gains. As David said, we expected to reach its half-life by that 2017 and again, the significant NAV in that business will free up over time. As you heard in prior quarters, we have been able to move excess capital out of the DIB, so we do have some flexibility there and we\u2019ll continue to operate it prudently, I don\u2019t know if there is a lot more to say on that at the moment.","Bob Benmosche","And Josh just keep in mind that buying back DIB would be just one of the options. In capital management, David went through a whole list and I think it\u2019s important that we focus on the operating earnings within the insurance companies and where we can do more of that as well as deal with the actual interest expense. Next question.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","The one of the big question related to capital and I\u2019ll pass it forth, is when you think about the Fed and the prospects for you guys to be sort of held to a (inaudible) type process, are the rules on either for the savings one holding companies which you are, but where rules are yet established and then the fact that your is not yet a SIFI, both of those lead one to say that it doesn\u2019t feel as they would be required at the moment to participate in 2013(inaudible). Is that the right read or should we be expecting...","Bob Benmosche","I think that\u2019s true what you said; however we are working with the Fed because we are in a hurry. We want to make sure that we know where we stand and so we\u2019re doing our best to understand the requirements, run those requirements to our risk models and see what we can do to determine just where we stand. So while there is no requirements, we\u2019re still working informally to see we can do something to assess where we are as we go forward, so we just have to wait and see how the federal reserve works with us and how they want to proceed with various tests. We are open to it and welcoming it because we think it makes sense to get clarity now rather than later.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","And you don\u2019t think that the Fed would feel I mean they would prefer to have clarity sooner\u2026","Bob Benmosche","I can\u2019t speak for the Fed. I can only tell you they\u2019re in. They are just trying to work with us. We\u2019re a big company and they\u2019re working it through it and as soon as they are able to make some assessment, I am sure they will work with us. I think everybody wants to get clarity. It\u2019s just a matter of time and working through a schedule that makes sense for them.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","My question mostly relates Peter on the P&C side. I want to touch upon detail about how much these one-off large non-catastrophe losses impacted the various international and U.S. segments in a former charges. And to talk about the persistency of prior year unfavourable reserve development, I realize a lot of your competitors also take rather semi-frequent charges for environmental losses, but given the size of your book, sometimes you should be adjusting up, sometimes you should be adjusting down. It seem likes reserves are always being adjusted upward?","Bob Benmosche","Before I turn over to Peter, I think Peter should respond to the first part of your question. Second, but I would like maybe Peter and Charlie because you raised a very important point on environmental and the way we are doing it and quite frankly we at AIG are working really hard to do a bottoms up analysis of all our reserves starting with the claims themselves. And so maybe Peter if you could pick this up and then pass it to Charlie and go through that. It\u2019s a little bit more in detail than some of you may want, but I think you need to understand the thoroughness of what we\u2019re doing here and this is not just a pattern of actuarial assumptions. Peter?","Peter Hancock","Yes, well, let\u2019s start with the first part of the question which is just, that the steady improvement and accident year loss ratio has been somewhat slowed in this quarter by some unusual non-cat but large losses in the international property side. And so we view those as an outlier, the number of the them were named losses where we were just below the thresholds that we use to designated as a cat. So, definitely, what we believe to be one-off anomalies. But on the reserves let me just talk about that\u2026","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Can you give a percent on that by the way? What percent giving that impact of your loss ratio there?","John Doyle","Josh, its John Doyle, a about a little less than 2 points, so about 1.8 points. So as Peter mentioned, we had three storms in Asia that were named events but didn\u2019t meet our $20 million threshold to call it a cat. And then we had a number of larger losses, about two times kind of our average number of [Audio Disturbance] in quarter, big fire losses in the quarter that impacted it as well. And we had a failed satellite launch as kind of another example.","So, double-digit severe losses again about two times kind of an average number, obviously it\u2019s going to be some lumpiness to two large losses in property, but it was a bit of an unusual quarter for us and as I said, it had close to a 2 point impact on the current accident year loss ratio.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","2 points on international commercial.","John Doyle","Yes, 1.8 points overall globally and most of it was on the international side.","Jeff Hayman","Yes, Jeff Hayman jumping in for consumer, there is about $24 million in losses for consumer exactly as John described and Peter named storms that were under our threshold Typhoon, Jelawat some torrential rains in the Kinki region of Japan and that's about 0.7 on our accident year loss ratio.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Jeff Hayman","Can we go to Charlie now on the environmental?","Charles Shamieh","So, a few things on environmental, we've now concluded a very detailed study of the environmental impairment liability portfolio and that's the portfolio made up of five distinct fairly heterogeneous books that we described in the 10-Q and we've reviewed claim-by-claim 2,150 odd files on the most complex claims that we focused on those with the highest policy limits. Many of these were written in the period prior to 2004 and we did not do this prompted by any actuarial indications and in fact the actuarial third party reviews we had would have suggested the environmental portfolio as redundant.","We did it more because we think that the characteristics of those claims, such that you really need other experts, engineering firms, toxicologists and litigation experts and in this quarter, roughly 60 million of the 77 million that you see, that we've posted as prior year development, came from a very detailed analysis that we did on (inaudible) claims and we felt that the characteristics of those claims were sufficiently different to warrant a more conservative stance on from their severity in particular.","And on the other part, I would say about the persistency of prior year development. In the quarter we had 114 million of large commercial offers, of that, 70 million roughly related to loss and legal on a few construction defect claims and we also had large losses in the healthcare division this quarter and also last quarter and that's shown as primary casualty in the all other component of the 10-Q and I would say the healthcare ones unusual. The healthcare division has actually posted very favourable development over many years and the industry as a whole has witnessed that, but these two claims are very peculiar and they really have the unique characteristics that we don't think are indicative of a trend.","Bob Benmosche","Thanks Charlie. And, so I think as you can see even on environmental, it\u2019s been a year of going through this and so we are in probably in the $500 to $600 million addition to reserve, but we think it\u2019s completely remind us now and we\u2019re continuing to do these reviews, to continually build confidence in this reserve and make sure we have it right. So a lot of work has gone on to it. But I don\u2019t think the trend is something that\u2019s just a trend but it\u2019s actually our cleaning up to make sure, if everything is right.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","So Bob, the initiative is complete on toxic waste?","Bob Benmosche","Well we\u2019ve gone through the whole reserve. This is one area that was very complex and one that we really had to put a lot more time on.","Operator","Moving on to our next question from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Sure, just to follow-up on Josh\u2019s question on international commercial, so if it\u2019s 2 points of unusual large losses on total that would be, if my math is right, that would be like 10 points on international, commercial if its 2 points on international it would be 5 points. Just trying to get an understanding of what when you\u2019ve kind of back out these sort of lumpy losses, how do that segment perform and if there is anything outside of those large losses that were abnormal; can you talk about what those trends were?","Bob Benmosche","Let\u2019s turn it to Peter and John, if you would?","Peter Hancock","Michael, it was close to 2 points, globally, is 1.8 points globally. James do you have the number for the international side? I am not sure with number is exactly on the international side.","John Fitzpatrick","There was overall a 12 point increase in the accident year loss ratio for international commercial. And over half of the driver of that change was due to the severe losses flowing through the P&L, to a larger extent than in normal quarters.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then the rest of it is just\u2026","James Bracken","The rest of it, there is a variety of events that flow through the P&L this quarter which I think if you look at the historic trend in the Q1 and Q2 that would be more indicative of our go forward run rate within international commercial. So we just had a number of unusual things popping up this quarter, the largest driver of which were the severe losses within international.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Great. And then, maybe switching gears a little bit at other operating expenses, it looks like you had a reversal of an accrual. If you include that, it looks like the other expenses were up a bit compared to where you were last quarter and over the past of couple of quarters. Just trying to get an understanding, what is that and how should we think about that line relative to the $1 billion in expense reduction that you have been talking about","Bob Benmosche","Sure, let me turn this over to David who will take you through some of that, but we are feeling very confident in the direction of 2015, our aspirational goals, but you are going to see some ups and down in any given quarter, but David?","David Herzog","With respect to the guide post that we had set out in terms of from quarter to quarter, the general range of 200 to 250 million of operating expenses of the holding company that are not allocated out to the OpCos, I think that\u2019s still a reasonable set of guide post. This particular quarter, there were a number of what I\u2019ll call infrastructure and transformation activities going on across the parent, the corporate centre, including things like our data center, consolidation et cetera, and it\u2019s investments like that that help us deal effectively with catastrophes like the one we have just incurred. Over time, I would expect Michael for the corporate expense not to a glide path down towards the low end of that range and then certainly below that as the $1 billion expense target is realized over the period up to 2015.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Great. And then last one, just U.S. commercial, clearly the underlying loss ratio has improved, if my model is right, I mean this is the lowest underlying loss ratio we\u2019ve seen in U.S. commercial since the back-out of 2010. Can you kind of talk about how that is occurring? What actions you are taking and where do you expect that to get to in order, kind of, reach your overall goals by 2015 and\u2026","Bob Benmosche","John, do you want to pick that up?","John Fitzpatrick","Sure. We have talked about the various levers like the mix of the business tools, claim initiatives and expenses as David just covered and Peter talked about in his prepared remarks, expenses are on income, if you will, but we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in terms of the mix of business, you have seen, pretty aggressive action we have taken. In fact in the presentation there is a breakdown of U.S. casualty and the aggressive action that we have taken there. We\u2019ve obviously have been pressing on rate side and I would say that the rate environment continues to improve. You know, that flows through more quickly obviously in our property results. We\u2019ve not been aggressive about changing the current accident year loss picks, we\u2019re in process of bridging exercise with Charlie, as we look about our loss picks as we go forward, but we expect continued current accident year improvement in various lines and really in all lines in the United States.","On the underwriting tool side, with our science team and our underwriting resources, we\u2019ve made some really exciting progress on some reselection models that we\u2019re excited about as well. And then lastly, I would say we\u2019re about halfway through a multi-year program on the claim side and we\u2019ve seen some improvement in the United States and we\u2019ve got actually some exciting results we\u2019ve seen in Europe as Eric Martin and his team are executing on our global claims initiatives. So we expect to see continued current accident year improvement in the U.S. commercial loss ratios.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Brian Meredith, UBS.","Brian Meredith -- UBS","I was wondering, could you give some perspective, just I know it\u2019s quite early on kind of potential exposures here to Hurricane Sandy. How should we think about it with respect to AIG\u2019s exposure? And then may be as a part of that, is it possible to get what your retention is on your domestic property cat insurance program?","Bob Benmosche","I\u2019ll let John answer the second part and then as far as color, Peter, you might want to add to it, not that there is much to say, we\u2019re just going through this on a claim by claim basis, we\u2019re working with clients right now and it\u2019s hard for me to give you a scope of it because of some of the flooding and water damage that was done especially in the New York area and Manhattan. But I can only say that we don\u2019t see this as being any kind of huge issue for us financially other than just dealing with the issues at hand. So I don\u2019t know if I can give you anymore color at this point, but let me turn it over to Peter.","Peter Hancock","Yes, I think that usually we get about 80% of our claim notices within about 90 days. So obviously at the very beginning of that whole process and I think to comment beyond the fact that the property damage comes in quicker than the business interruption and that we\u2019re looking at a broad range of commercial properties across sectors in affected areas. It\u2019s a big broad area and we\u2019re getting new information every day. So, it\u2019s just way too early to comment intelligently about it, so we\u2019d rather not.","But on the retention policies and more generally our approach to deductibles and flood supplements, we\u2019ve made changes over the last three years which we think helped us with Isaac last year and will also help us here relative to the exposures we\u2019ve had previously. And we\u2019ve made some pretty major changes in our global reinsurance strategy in terms of risk appetite internationally. And so John may be you want to just elaborate on the retention.","John Doyle","Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve disclosed where our cat reinsurance attach is, but non-cat we\u2019re in the middle, there has been some press about our non-cat kind of pro risk if you will, reinsurance program and as Peter said, really the by-product of our new global view. Previously we had structured reinsurance around legal entities around the world and a regional view and so we\u2019re taking a more consistent risk appetite around the world. So it\u2019s an opportunity for us primarily on the property side to again take more risk back net.","Simultaneously, though we have actually just commenced the deal on the excess casualty side in the U.S. to actually see it out some of our U.S. excess casualty business. So we\u2019ve got a kind of a global restructuring if you will of our overall reinsurance program, pretty significant changes, but again, again to drive a more consistent risk appetite and shift the mix of business to a better balance really around the world.","Brian Meredith - UBS","Great. And Bob just quickly, you mentioned that M&A is a possible use of capital here; I am just curious what areas would be intriguing to you?","Bob Benmosche","Anything in the answers what we already have anywhere in the world. So it\u2019s hard to say, I could give you some names that I am not sure that that would be a good idea.","Operator","Moving on, we will take our next question from Lee Cooperman from Omega Advisors.","Lee Cooperman - Omega Advisors","All of us almost talk for a bunch of reasons one of which is we see a big book value and we expect the company to achieve a reasonable return on that book over time. So, my first question is, what do you guys think is a reasonable return given the regulatory environment that now exists post 2008? And what\u2019s a reasonable time period for that return to be achieved? And secondly, if you had to had guess about 2013, is 2013 going to be a year with cash dividends or additional significant buy back, if you had to guess. Thank you very much.","Bob Benmosche ","One is I think we're absolutely on target from everything we feel right now to the 2015 getting to an ROE of north of 10%. So we feel that that's achievable. We have a lot of wood to chop to get there and a lot of things we're building today and that's the investments of infrastructure and so on that we're building within AIG, so we feel that that's still attainable. There are still questions about what would be the capital required over time. There is a bias in the regulatory environment to want to put more and more capital restrictions on financial services companies, but I think that sooner or later, people are going to realize that you could just go too far with all of that, but from what we know and see, we still think it's realistic to shoot for north of 10% or north.","And as far as 2013, we are working very closely with the Federal Reserve. We feel we're in excellent shape. We've run what we believe to be our understanding of the c-car and so we're looking at by the constraints. And if I were to think about 2013, we're focused on the coverage ratio, which is important, because our credit ratings are important because we want to show not only stable but positive or even an uptick is important because we make guaranties and our companies look forward to having strong guaranties behind AIG, they stuck with us during the crisis, but we want to give them better reassurances going forward.","And I would think that a dividend on the stock probably would be something that if in fact we're able to do that, I would see that as something we'd like to do in 2013 if our capital position is strong enough, that we can do that. And we won\u2019t know that until the Fed has more time to review where we are.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Adam Klauber from William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","You've done a lot of work in the last two years in the U.S., U.S. commercial P&C segment. As we go into next year, I guess two questions, one, do you think that business still needs more","Rate and two, do you think you'll start growing that business?","Bob Benmosche","Let me turn that over to Peter and then you and John can work that through.","Peter Hancock","Adam the second part of that question was, I'm sorry?","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Do you think you'll start growing that business going forward?","Peter Hancock","You know obviously we have a broad range of products in the U.S. commercial space and so all are not created equal. We've highlighted how we've reduced our overall exposure to U.S. casualty. And so broadly I think the greatest rate need, if you think of it on a major line basis, we think is in the casualty space. Our property book in the U.S., or specialty lines including financial lines, performing better on a risk adjusted basis than our view as casualty market. Obviously interest rate environment there creates more pressure on that segment of the book than other segments. So in terms of rate need, I would say it\u2019s there, that\u2019s where we are getting the largest rate improvement at the moment. And it\u2019s where we have a lot of our science resources focused on improving our risk selection. So, I mentioned earlier that, we do expect current accident year improvement in those lines of business. So, in terms of growth, we have modest mid-single digit growth for commercial overall plan now through 2015 performance period. We\u2019ll see more aggressive growth outside of the U.S. but we do expect some low single digit growth in our U.S. portfolio over the next couple of years.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question then from Mark Finkelstein from Evercore Partners.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","I wanted to go back to the coverage ratio calculations. I think you mentioned that the intent is to get two turns of improvement over the next 12 to 18 months. I guess that\u2019s a little bit faster than I would have expected and maybe a little bit more dramatic than I would have expected. I think that kind of, if my numbers are right, would probably put you at about five times coverage? Correct me if I am wrong on that. But I guess can you just clarify that that\u2019s the correct interpretation of what the aim is? And then I guess, when I look at the maturities, obviously you have some hybrids that are coming or callable, maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the strategy of getting there if that is the in fact, objective?","David Herzog","I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll ask Brian to elaborate a little bit further. Again a one to two, closer to two, but somewhere in the one to two times coverage improvement is what we\u2019re aiming at and again, the exact calculation that each of the agencies performs is not precisely the same. So it is not a simple formula to plug-in to. But I think you\u2019ve generally, you\u2019ve got it about right. We think it\u2019s around to existing as around before times or little less than four, but again it just depends on the particular agency. And again, I think it\u2019s a combination of the two levers. One is on interest expense, certainly and again the monetization of our non-core assets and further capital generation at both at the insurance companies which gives us the deployable capital of the holding company and Brian can talk a little bit more about that in terms of what are our plans and expectations are along those lines. But I think those are the two levers that really gets back to improving the operating earnings and you\u2019ve heard from Peter and Jay on their core business and the trajectory that they are on and then a focus on selected and targeted debt reduction and interest reduction. Brian, do you want to jump in here?","Brian Schreiber","Thanks, David and I think you\u2019ve now nailed all salient points, it will be a combination of interest expense reduction as well as improvement in operating earnings and as you noted, we do have some bonds that are callable that I think make a lot of sense for us to go after and when you think about our flexibility on an on-going basis to go after this. As we said in the past, we expect 4 to 5 billion of subsidiary dividends coming up to parent every year. This year, we\u2019re already of 5 billion as of today and expect a bit more in the fourth quarter. You take out the parent expenses and interest and you are sort of in a situation where we are going to have around 2 billion a year, give or take a little, four things like liability management and dealing with opportunistically reducing our outstanding expense of debt. And that excludes the additional excess capital that will be generated from sales of non-core assets as well as capital free up overtime from the DIB.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","Okay. May be just one quick question on the DIB. I guess, I have been a little surprised at how strong the DIB earnings have been over the last few quarters. I think Brian you talked about this concept of pulling to intrinsic quite a bit on the last quarter call. I am just curious if you have a view on kind of comparison where the assets are currently marked versus your own view of what that intrinsic value is?","Brian Schreiber","What we said in the past and where we still feel pretty strongly about is that, there is probably close to 4 to 5 billion I think we said in the past, of pull to intrinsic over the life of the portfolio. And what you\u2019re seeing now in a quarter like this is again, the combination of net investment income as well as the CVA where the impact is spread tightening on the assets slightly offset by our own spread tightening because most of the assets and liabilities in the favourable or substantial portion of which have been swapped, really what you\u2019re going to see coming through the P&L and when we think about pull to intrinsic is effectively CVA. And it will not be consistent over time, it\u2019s going to be somewhat market driven, but we still feel pretty strongly about what we\u2019ve indicated in the past as what the potential of this portfolio is.","Bob Benmosche","Okay. Thank you all for, I think any other issues, please let us know, talk to Liz. But I thank you all and good luck for those of you who in the New York area. You know we\u2019ve got lot of work to just get back to normal. So I thank you all very much this morning.","Operator","Thank you. That will conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Liz Werner, head of investor relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Elizabeth Werner","Good morning and thank you for joining us everyone. Welcome to AIG\u2019s discussion of our first quarter 2013 results. Speaking today will be Bob Benmosche, our President and CEO; David Herzog, our Chief Financial Officer; Peter Hancock, CEO of AIG Property & Casualty; and Jay Wintrob, CEO of AIG Life and Retirement. Other members of senior management are also in the room and available for the question and answer period.","Before we get started this morning, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain certain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events.","Actual performance and events may differ possibly materially from such forward-looking statements.

The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement, which is available on AIG\u2019s website, www.aig.com.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn our call over to Bob.","Robert Benmosche","Thanks Liz and good morning everybody. And as I\u2019ve said since mid-2011, the focus of our Company and all the people of AIG has been fix the foundation to get the fundamentals right. And while we\u2019ve seen noises we dealt with some of our non-core assets and so on mark--to-markets of ML II, III and so on AIA. We\u2019ve been focusing on the core and I think what you see is the first quarter is another strong quarter of the fundamentals. This is a quarter we had some positives. Last quarter we had Sandy which was a negative, but if you look at the core and we\u2019re going to talk about that this morning, we continue to fundamentally do very well here. ","Now you look at our liquidity at the end of the quarter, we\u2019re at $15 million. That includes dividends from Life and Retirement and also liability management which included some of the cash from the prior quarter. Peter is going to talk to you about our Property Casualty business that we\u2019ve seen good improvement in the underwriting. Good returns from the investment side as well, but what\u2019s most important, if you look at the trend over this period of time from mid-2011, you can see that there\u2019s a gradual improvement of the current action year loss ratio which is now down to 63.2, again a strong improvement.","And if you look at the growth of the topline, we continued to grow that this quarter. It is growing nicely at about 4%. If you take out some of the accounting charges and the Yen issue that we\u2019re dealing with in terms of conversion now. So strong performance in Property Casualty and mortgage guarantee business we\u2019ve said we\u2019ve seen that business turn about two years ago. We\u2019re working through the legacy book. Again a strong quarter for that business and about half of the premiums are now coming from our new underwriting model which is performing much better than we had in the past. And our Life and Retirement business, again great distribution numbers in a very tough climate. We are continuing to hold the line on our ability to get the returns we need for that business. And so success for us, as [Bill] and Jay will take you through that, so I don\u2019t want to belabor at this point. I look forward to taking your questions at the end of our comments. What I would like to do now is turn over to David who will highlight some of the financials for you. David?","David Herzog","Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned, our core operations delivered strong operating results this quarter. Up 28% over a year ago and we executed on $2.1 billion in liability management actions during the quarter. We remain committed to our aspirational goals including $25 billion to $30 billion in capital management and 10% ROE by 2015.","Turning to Slide 4. First quarter operating earnings per share was $1.34. As you might recall, first quarter of 2012 had over $3 billion pretax gains related to non-core holdings in AIA and ML3. So the quarter-over-quarter EPS comparison isn\u2019t straight forward. Operating ROE which excludes AOCI from equity, was 9.2% for the quarter, on a basis consistent with our long-term aspirational goals which excluded the deferred tax assets from equity for purposes of calculating ROE, ROE would have been roughly 200 basis points higher this quarter.","Book value per share excluding AOCI was $59.39, up 12% from a year ago and 3% from year-end. Operating results began on slide five. Property casualty delivered an underwriting profit in the quarter driven by continued improvement in the accident year loss ratio. Both our property casualty and life and retirement businesses benefitted from stronger alternative investment returns than we expected. Property casualty has modest cat losses of around $40 million less than we expected in the quarter.","We realigned our life and retirement segment presentation this quarter to provide product segments consistent with our new management structure which Jay will discuss in more detail in his remarks. The direct investment book and global capital markets benefitted from positive marks in the quarter, driven by largely by tighter credit spreads. Operating income from the wind down legacy multi-sector CDS book, which is reported in global capital markets, improved by roughly $150 million from market appreciation of the underlying coverage securities which then reduces the liability we carry on the related CDS.","The direct investment book also benefitted from asset appreciation consistent with our objective to capture the pull to intrinsic over time. These market movements will vary from period to period and could be negative in a reporting period. Interest expense increased modestly from prior year and reflected only a partial quarter of interest savings from our liability management actions that we completed in March. Corporate expenses including the impact of cost incurred during the quarter for continued infrastructure build out, were in line with our near term expected run rate of about $225 million per quarter.","There is roughly $35 million or so per quarter of corporate expenses related to our data center consolidation which begins to wind down going into 2014. The effective operating tax rate came in at almost 30%. Looking ahead for the rest of the year, we continue to expect an operating tax rate to be roughly in this range. As you may recall, we will not be paying any U.S. income taxes for some time given our NOL. We also had a couple of largely offsetting tax adjustments that are not reported as part of operating income. We increased our reserve for uncertain tax positions under FIN-48 by approximately $600 million related to some legacy matters as a result of current period developments.","We also determined that recently identified tax planning strategy met the prudent and feasible criteria and we released through income, a little over $750 million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to our capital loss carry-forwards. Our capital decision remains solid and on slide six, you can see our current debt levels reflect over $2 billion in parent company debt that we called and repurchased in cash tender offers this quarter. In March, we called our $1.1 billion 7.7% hybrids at par and we purchased $1 billion in debt in cash tender offers with an average coupon of around 7.8%. ","Annualized interest savings on this retired debt is about $165 million. We also have $750 million in callable hybrids with a coupon of 6.45%. Exercising that call would further reduce annual interest expense by almost $50 million. At this time we do not have any plans in place for further 2013 liability management outside exercising the hybrid call that is available to us. If we do exercise that call, then between our maturities, the debt we have already proactively, we could pair our annual interest expense run rate by roughly $290 million.","Our yearend RBC ratios are also presented on Slide 6 and were 443% for Property Casualty and 532% for Life and Retirement. These are higher than the preliminary estimates that we reported last quarter. Our insurance subsidiaries remain capitalized well above their CMA threshold and our position to deliver sustained dividends and distributions to the holding Company. We received distributions from Life and Retirement of over $1.3 billion during the quarter as shown on Slide 7. ","Property Casualty is on track to deliver its full year targeted dividend payments later this year. We continue to expect $4 to $5 billion in total in annual dividends and distributions from our insurance companies. Parent Company available liquidity is over $15 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting these distributions and the liability management actions that I mentioned earlier. The parent liquidity balance includes $5.5 billion related to the direct investment book and global capital markets which is currently allocated towards future maturities of liabilities and contingent liquidity stress needs. Nearly 60% of the DIB\u2019s debt matures over the next five years.","During the quarter we initiated an investment program at the holding Company whereby we invested $2.3 billion of available cash into high quality fixed maturity securities with duration of just over three years and a deals rate of just over 1%. We expect this portfolio to grow to around $3 billion this year. Additionally, the ILFC divestiture continues through the regulatory approval process as expected. Upon closing, the net proceeds that we receive on that transaction will be unencumbered as the holding Company.","And at this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Peter for greater detail on the Property Casualty results. Peter?","Peter Hancock","Thank you, David. Good morning everyone. During the quarter, AIG Property Casualty made good progress towards achieving our goals. We improved our underwriting results and experienced strong investment performance while expenses remained largely stable. ","Turning to Slide 8. Operating income was nearly $1.6 billion, which included moderate catastrophe losses of $41 million, favorable net prior year reserve development of $52 million and better than expected net investment income. Continued enhanced risk selection, technical pricing, shifts in our business mix and advances in claims practices contributed to that profitability. ","Our accident year loss ratio, as adjusted of 63.2%, is slightly better than trend which has been improving at an average 3 points annually. We expect to continue to see a decline in the accident year loss ratio as a result of our continued underwriting improvements. ","This quarter we began recognizing premiums on excess of loss reinsurance at contract inception rather than ratably over the contract term, which will have no effect on full year net premiums written or net premiums earned, but does impact first quarter comparisons. Changes in foreign exchange, driven by the weakening of the Yen and a first quarter catastrophe bond issuance also reduced reported net premiums. Excluding these effects, topline growth was 4%. We continue to expect modest net premium growth in 2013 as our underwriting actions take hold and we write profitable new business.","General operating expenses were up slightly on a gross basis and included moderate severance and other personnel charges.","Turning to Slide 9, commercials net premium written were up 4% excluding the effect of the immediate of recognition of ceded premiums on excess of loss reinsurance and the catastrophe bond issuance that I mentioned earlier. In addition, last quarter we entered into a new reinsurance program in U.S. excess casualty that reduced commercials first quarter premium by about 1%. That will improve overall profitability.","Maximizing risk adjusted profitability through optimization of business mix and underwriting excellence remains the focus of AIG property casualty. The results of these initiatives are most evident in commercial's accident year loss ratio as adjusted, which improved approximately 5 points compared to the prior year. An increase in new business and positive rate changes contributed significant to growth in property which improved 20% excluding the items mentioned above and in financial lines.","In the U.S., we saw pricing continue to decline particularly in property and workers compensation, where rates increased over 80%. Partially offsetting this was continued pressures in certain lines within specialty and in Europe, commercial business. Overall, retentions remained strong in those lines of business we wish to grow.","Turning to Slide 10. Consumer net premiums written increased over 4%, excluding foreign exchange and the other items mentioned earlier. Accidents and health experienced growth outside the U.S. particularly in individual A&H in Asia Pacific. Personal lines benefited from auto's market share gain in EMEA and expansion in high-value non-auto line. Consumers accident year loss ratio was up slightly from the prior year as 2012 included a $45 million benefit related to changes in actuarial assumptions in accidents and health.","Acquisition ratios reflected our investment in the profitable direct marketing channel, which grew approximately 8% and accounted for 16% of total consumer premiums. Slide 11 illustrates our investment portfolio mix. First quarter net investment income increased 11%, reflecting strong alternative investment returns, increased mark-to-market gains on structured securities, and redeployment of excess cash held at year-end. Alternative investment income was almost $120 million above our expected return. The first quarter marked another step on our part to increasing the intrinsic value of AIG property casualty. Our shift to high value business combined with underwriting and claims practice improvements, exemplifies how our focus on balancing growth, profitability and risk is helping to produce better margins.","We maintain our commitment to capital efficiency and optimizing our risk profile. In Japan, for example, we recently integrated the majority of our operations under one holding company, which will enable greater capital flexibility and create operating efficiencies. We look forward to contributing our planned full year dividend to the holding company during the remainder of the year. In closing, I am satisfied with our positive momentum. I am confident that this quarter is only the beginning of a successful year.","Turning to slide 12, I would like to comment on mortgage guarantees performance and our outlook for this core insurance holding. The first quarter was another quarter of improving profitability and growth in new business. Delinquency counts continued to fall and mortgage guarantee continues to see a growing portion of earned premiums, now almost 50% from high quality business written since 2009 and declining losses from legacy run-offs exposure. We expect UGC is very well positioned to take advantage of an expanding private mortgage insurance market. Profitability is expected to grow over the course of the year and we will continue to capitalize on our unique underwriting approach and strong capital position.","Now, I would like to turn it over to Jay.","Jay Wintrob"," Thanks, Peter and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 13, as you can see, this was another strong quarter for AIG's Life and Retirement business, with a 6% increase in operating income from a year ago to $1.4 billion. The year ago quarter included $246 million gain in the final Maiden Lane II distribution.","First quarter operating income growth was driven by the robust equity markets, which contributed to strong investment returns on our portfolios of alternative investments and mark-to-market securities. ","Combined with another positive quarter for our investment in PITC common stock, these portfolios contributed approximately $320 million in investment income, above our expected returns. Strong equity markets also contributed to our growth in assets under management, driving increased fee income. The quarter also benefited from lower mortality costs and our continued active management of crediting rates, which dampened the impact of the low interest rate environment.","In addition to strong earnings as David mentioned, AIG Life and Retirement provided $1.3 billion of liquidity to the holding Company to dividends and note repayments from our operating life companies. And we\u2019re on target to deliver on our expected dividends to the holding Company for 2013.","Total premiums and deposits this quarter were $5.6 billion, roughly flat with the year ago quarter and 7% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012. ","Net outflows, the sum of sales less all surrenders, debt claims and other benefit payments related to our retail investment products and group retirement businesses were $244 million, a marked improvement from the previous -- each of our business lines contributing to this favorable trend.","Variable annuities were the leading driver of inflows, while fixed annuity showed the greatest incremental improvement in net outflows due to improvement in sales and a decline in surrenders. We continue to see strong variable annuity sales growth and remain comfortable with our product offering, risk management and the overall environment with respect to the VA business.","We also remain disciplined at managing our fixed annuity sales and in-force blocks. Our cost efficient, flexible annuity platform based here in Amarillo, Texas and deep relationships with banks in particular, have allowed us to remain the number one provider of fixed annuities through the bank channel. The low interest rate environment, however, obviously continues to negatively impact product demand across the industry.","We are now reporting under our new segment presentation and our new segments and the underlying lines of businesses, which we illustrate on Slide 14, after recent organizational changes and how we manage the business and allocate resources. Our results are now broadly reported in two segments, Retail and Institutional. And we also provide profitability and additional supplemental information for certain key businesses.","The Retail segment includes our individual life and A&H business, fixed annuities, retirement income solutions, and retail mutual funds and broker-dealer services. Our Retirement Income Solutions business line now includes both variable and indexed annuities, reflecting the fact that (inaudible) of these products rather than focusing only on asset accumulation, are increasingly interested in guaranteed income and today the vast majority of each of these products now include a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit rider option.","The Institutional segment includes our Group Retirement business, which was previously reported as VALIC, Institutional markets and AIG Benefit Solutions, our Group Benefits joint venture with AIG Property Casualty, under which AIG Life and Retirement reports 50% of the results.","Our Institutional Markets business represents opportunistic offerings, including stable value wrap contracts, structured settlements and pension buyouts. Given our opportunistic approach to the institutional marketplace, combined results will fluctuate from period to period.","Slide 15 highlights the product diversity across our segments. The contribution of strong alternative investment returns benefited all product lines this quarter. In addition, active spread management benefited both our Retail and Institutional segments.","Total base portfolio yields shown on Slide 16 remain under pressure due to the continued low interest rate environment and total yield or reported yield reflects the strength of alternative investments and a gain on our investment in PICC stock.","We expect the base yields could see pressure for the rest of this year as we continue to take gains on certain portfolios of securities in order to utilize capital loss carry forwards that are available to us and due to prevailing low interest rates. ","Turning to slide 17, you can see the trend in base yields and net investment spreads, each of our leadings spread (inaudible) fixed annuities and group retirement. Fixed annuities have benefited from our active management of crediting rates and net investment spreads increased this quarter. Approximately 73% of our fixed annuity and universal life account values now are at minimum guaranteed crediting rates and we would expect to continue to actively manage spreads.","Group retirement also benefitted from reductions in crediting rates, which offset the impact of shifting into certain lower yielding, higher credit quality invested assets which we mentioned, we began last quarter. When considering our fixed product flows, it is important to note that close to half of our sales and deposits were into products that guarantee minimum interest rates of 1%, while the majority of surrenders, debt claims and other benefits, were paid from products with the guaranteed minimum interest rate of 3% or above.","In sum, we are off to a good start to the year with solid earnings and distribution to parent. We plan to continue to execute on our growth strategies by leveraging our strong relationships with distribution partners, to increase sales of our broad product portfolio across all channels, while continuing to look for opportunities to run our businesses in the most effective and efficient manner possible. And now I will turn it back to Liz to open up to Q&A.","Elizabeth Werner","Thank you. Operator, could we open up the lines now for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will take our first quarter from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","There has been a significant amount of news around the [lift] out of the team from AIG property casualty to Berkshire Hathaway. Could you address that and also give us a sense of whether we should anticipate that more of the leadership could depart? Thank you.","Robert Benmosche","Well, I guess I can only tell you that of the top 3300 executives of AIG, during 2012 of the top 30% performers of that group, we retained 94% of those people. So, I know you want to focus on four people in property casualty business. It's a very big and successful business. We are going to lose people to competitors from time to time. We have an outstanding team that is still here. You saw how quickly Peter was able to put new executives in charge. I think the reaction to this step has been very positive. So turn over occurs, but if you can retain 94% of your top 3300 people running this company -- and by the way, 45% of that group have been with AIG more than ten years, 15% of that group more than 20%. So we have experience. We have a deep bench. We have a talented group of people. Not everybody is going to be happy with the company as we go forward, and I can see that our competition is struggling a little bit with their flows and so they are getting in businesses they weren\u2019t in traditionally. So I think we are fine and we are moving on. So I think this is the only way I can answer the question.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thank you. And then switching gears, could you provide some insight as to when AIG could reinstate its common shareholder dividend and also resume the share buyback.","Robert Benmosche","What we said is that we are going to focus on our coverage ratio. We are going to continue to focus on liability management. We also want to make sure that we have completed the sale of ILFC, so that that non-core asset is now completed in terms of the sale so that we reduce our debt, for example even though it's not direct but about $25 billion. That\u2019s a key milestone we have to reach. We are continuing to look at our capital plan and doing our stress testing. And we are meeting with rating agencies to make sure that whatever we do does not cause them any concern. And then our second priority is for liability management we said will be a dividend. And after that we would still like to do stock buybacks but we will do it in a very slow and cautious way to make sure that we do nothing to affect our current ratings and that the rating agencies are satisfied with what we are doing to [address] the most important thing for AIG right now, it's to maintain and build on the confidence that we can make guarantees, [book] sometimes with people's lifetimes, and we will be here to live up to those guarantees. So that\u2019s our highest priority as we go forward. And so as the year progresses, you can see our numbers, you can see our performance. When we think it's prudent and everyone else feels it's prudent, we will make those decisions.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Just wanted to clarify the ROE goal. It's not inclusive of FAS 115 and the DTA. Is that correct from a book value perspective?","David Herzog","That's correct.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","So just to be clear, you take current stated book value of $67 subtract $20 a share and so we\u2019re really at a $47 book value number and then we grow off of that and we want to earn a 10 ROE against it?","David Herzog","I'm not quite sure I follow your math. Maybe we could do that offline. I think that's probably the best way to handle that.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay. It's just FAS 115 and DTA subtracted from current GAAP book value, but okay. So the goal is 10 ROE ex-FAS 115, ex DTA in 2015. Great. And then the other is just on the capital deployment side. You mentioned $25 billion to $30 billion. Can you update us on how much you have left to do to get to that goal, like how much has been completed and how much more can you do to meet that?","David Herzog","Yeah, sure. This is David. Through 2012 we did $13 billion of common equity share repurchase and thus far this year we've done a little over $2 billion of debt capital management. Again, I gave you the interest savings on that. We don't view maturities that are being funded through cash as part of that capital management. That's just part of the ongoing management of the Company. So the early calls on the hybrids, we do consider that part of our capital management goal. So if you think about it, through the end of this year we\u2019ll have done with what we've already done, plus the planned call on the hybrid, we\u2019ll have done close to $16 billion against that 25 to 30. ","So that's how you -- that's where we are to date. And then the Company continues to generate deployable capital. We said $4 billion to $5 billion per year of dividends and distributions from our operating companies. We have interest expense and some parent Company expenses of roughly $2 billion or so a year. And so therein lies the generation of deployable capital. And as Bob referenced earlier, the unencumbered proceeds from ILFC, which will be available at the holding Company for consideration.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Perfect. That\u2019s very clear. Thank you. And then last is just any update on the non-bank SIFI process, the timing. I'm wondering if that's slipping at all and when we might get clarity. And I know that's a bit unfair, but just any help there would be great. Thanks again a good quarter.","Robert Benmosche","I think on the SIFI part of it, we\u2019re working -- remember we are now being regulated by the Federal Reserve. We've been working through a lot of things with them since they arrived in September. We have a very good working relationship. They have dug into understand a lot about our businesses. They are now in the process of fully examining the way we stress test this organization. So the SIFI process is going to be something we'll have to go through. But I think the biggest issue there probably would be what amounts of additional cushion you may have to have. But as far as the basics, you've got to make sure that you're running these companies, insurance companies, the banks and so on in a sound way. ","There is a huge public outcry of making sure that these institutions don't eat taxpayer money. And unfortunately we have not done a very good job as an industry explaining how much has been done in the last four years with over $400 billion of additional capital being raised to strengthen these institutions. So it's very difficult for them to payout based upon the stress test that everyone is going through today. So a lot of progress has been made. People have still not declared victory unfortunately. So I think that's the bigger crowd, but I'm pretty confident that SIFI or not SIFI, at the end we are going to be able to demonstrate financial strength of this Company, that our stress tests are very well done, that we understand risk management, that we've dealt with the non-core assets and that AIG has the financial strength to do its capital management on a go forward basis in a prudent way. ","So that's pretty much where we are at and when SIFI comes, it comes, but it will be more about the ratios than the quality of our numbers.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Nadel with Sterne, Agee.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee","I guess either for Bob or for David, you opened the call with commentary about focusing on the core. And my question is when on an internal basis when you strip out some of the noise in the quarter, obviously very favorable overall, I am hoping you can help us discern what you view as the true core underlying earnings and ROE? I know David mentioned ROE on a reported basis was about 11% on equity excluding the DTA but I am interests in your view as to the core results.","Robert Benmosche","I think I will David answer to it. You know we normalize for things that are pluses and minuses and we have gone through some of that. And you got to decide, all of you, I can't give you the answer, John. You guys think about how you want to deal with partnerships and we may want to budget it at 8% or 10%, you guys decide now it's getting to 11%-12%, still core. But I would say that if you look at our accident year information, that\u2019s a key indicator. You look at the flows in Jay's business, in that flows, and understand that our losses in terms of surrenders in the fixed annuity [bucket] are at minimum. So therefore that\u2019s actually improving the spread. So all of that, I don\u2019t know how you would do that but you have to look at, I would say, just his flows, his spread and looking at the mortgage guarantee in the new book of business coming in. And I think in property casualty, the accident year combined ratio is a hell of an indicator. So those are some of the things I would suggest you want to think about as you examine our ability going forward. David?","David Herzog","Bob, I think you have laid that out very well. The items that give rise to variability. Things like the alternative investments or the direct investment book, that will, again, over time pull to a level of intrinsic value that will ultimately be monetized. Again the path from here to there is not a straight line. So again, we give you some broad parameters around what's on the balance sheet vis-\u00e0-vis the direct investment book in terms of the total assets and total liabilities. We also in the financial supplement give you some parameters around what the alternative investments are for each of our core businesses that again you can make some reasonable assumptions based upon the prior performance and your expectations about what the equity markets and the like will do over time. So what we try to do for you is give you a sense of what those underlying variable items are so you can make your own determination and assessment about them again.","We are making risk returns tradeoffs in terms of maintaining and holding those assets as we did with, for example, the global capital markets and some of the wind down portfolios in the legacy financial products book. Again, over time, we believe there is intrinsic value that\u2019s appropriate for us to hang on to, given the risk return and as it will pull through intrinsic, again over time. So there are some pages in the supplement that give you the underlying balance sheets that you can make those assumptions.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee","I guess, maybe suffice to ask it this way. I assume you believe that the core underlying results are right on track or on track with your overall objective, looking out the next couple of years.","David Herzog","I think we remain committed to our long term aspirational goals and the results of the company, the progress that Peter and Jay are making, are the basis that give us confidence to remain committed to those goals.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee","Thank you. And just a quick follow up on Peter's comments. I may have missed it, he made a comment about commercial property and I wasn\u2019t clear on whether it was a 20 point improvement in the accident year loss ratio. It seems like too much or maybe it was a comment on pricing. Could you just clarify that?","John Doyle","Hey, John, it's John Doyle. When you normalize for the accounting changes and some of the reinsurance activity in the quarter, it was a 20% increase in net written premiums in the quarter.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","You gave some new disclosures on the cash and committed to the DIB at the holding Company, which is very helpful. If you work back from on balance sheet resources adding the unencumbered fixed income investments, you get to a number of around $6 billion, which obviously excludes future proceeds from ILFC or the MetLife escrow, et cetera, but the number is around $6 billion if my math is right. I\u2019m just curious, if you put SIFI to the side, what is the right number to hold at the holding company in terms of cash and investment resources knowing you\u2019ve got CMAs and the way the whole structure works?","David Herzog","Hi Mark, it's David. Thank you. Yeah, your math is correct. If you look at Page 7 of the call deck, you get -- in that zip code, its $5.96 billion as of the end of the quarter. Then again what I said earlier was that again at the holding company we have at the end of the \u2013 when we exit 2013, the run rate interest expense will reflect our cash funded maturities and the active or proactive debt capital management that we have undertaken this year. So the interest expense will come down accordingly. But nonetheless we\u2019ll have roughly $2 billion plus -- $2.2 billion, $2 billion something like that in terms of annual expenses at the holding company to be funded. Again, from that -- again, we've not given a specific amount or an algorithm, or a formula, or a stated amount to hold, but that gives you a sense of what prudent financial management would call for. So in any event then you can go from there in terms of how we\u2019re generating deployable capital for consideration once the SIFI designations are known and we understand the requirements of the stress test, et cetera.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","And then I think you emphasized the $750 million hybrid as the liability management through '13, but you emphasized through '13 and you emphasized liability management generally in talking about the capital position. How should we think about liability management beyond '13?","David Herzog","Well, I think you should think about it as opportunistic, and we will assess the progress that we've made vis-\u00e0-vis our coverage ratios that Bob spoke about earlier and we'll evaluate again all facts and circumstances at that time. So again we've made very good progress in 2013 on the goals we set out to improve our coverage ratio. And, again, I think that as we have done in the past, we will look to optimize returns for all the various stakeholders. And obviously capital management is an important part of that. ","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","And then just one quick final question, please. I don\u2019t know if Brian is there. I assume he is, but how much is the remaining -- what's the update on the remaining pull through intrinsic in the DIB that you estimate currently?","Brian Schreiber","As we said in prior quarters, the pull through intrinsic is holding strong. It's approximately $5 billion, consistent with what we had talked about last quarter. That will obviously be realized over a longer period of time. And again, you're seeing the results coming through in the earnings. As David mentioned, the DIB reaches its half-life in 2017 as another big slug of maturities in '18. So it would be after that point that we'd see a fair amount of that pull through intrinsic, as well as at that point some release of the capital in that business.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","So $5 billion from this point?","Brian Schreiber","That is correct. That also includes not just DIB, but also the Legacy FP.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets","So I have a question about the yen. And I think about 20% the P&C consolidated premiums come in the form of yen premiums, and I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s it'd hedged from an earnings perspective. So I understand the [cost] that you gave on, how that effected the top line production, but it didn\u2019t seem like there was much bottom line impact this quarter. And so, one, I wanted to clarify that there was not a lot of impact from the yen, and that maybe related to the fact that the combined ratio is relatively close to 100. But then also to ask if you have plans to potentially hedge that more actively going forward if you plan to have profitability improvement.","Peter Hancock","The issue is that Japan, unlike the U.S. is heavily a consumer business and is our largest direct marketing operation which has substantial upfront marketing costs which are expensed in the current period. So from a GAAP net income point of view, you are absolutely right. The bottom line in yen is actually quite small. But the value of new business that we originate, if you were to capitalize that acquisition cost over the expected life of the, persistency of these policies, which are annual policies but have a very high renewal percentage, makes it a very attractive business from a lifetime customer value perspective. So from a value point of view, we are hurt by the weaker yen because that value of new business is reduced, but from a GAAP reported bottom line, we are pretty indifferent.","So that does present some hedging dilemmas in terms of GAAP reported volatility. But I think your way of observing the top line impact is where the visible effect of the yen is most notable but that the GAAP volatility as a result of yen volatility is negligible. But from a value point of view that franchise is valuable but it will be realized over the life of these customer relationships.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets","I guess, is it correct though that there is not an active hedging program on that value? I guess is there anything about what's going on with the movement in the yen that would make you rethink that?","Peter Hancock","We have currency exposures in all 90 countries we operate in. We manage our currency exposures in a top down way because we have positives and negatives all over the place. We do not do micro-hedging of each line item. So that\u2019s all I think I would say about the hedging approach.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. And there is one more if I could. Just on very good underlying combined ratio on property casualty. Is there more, in business mix, kind of higher value business are phrases that you have used to describe the result. And I think, like John Nadel, I am just kind of wondering what we can run rate going forward. Is there more property business being written here, so it kind of over earns a little bit in a quarter like the first quarter but it could get hit if there is higher cat activity as the year goes on. Is that a major feature of what we saw on an underlying basis in the first quarter?","Robert Benmosche","Well, I will have John elaborate, but I think we made it very clear that we think the first quarter was a light cat quarter. So, yes, the cat quarter needs to be normalized for the normal run rate of cat. We have seen a growth in our property business, especially international property, especially our large limit property. But our aggregate PMLs have been coming down steadily as we manage our aggregations more and more. So I think it's an inherently volatile line and so you need to normalize for cat activity. But, John, you want to elaborate on that.","John Doyle","I would just add that the exposure growth in property -- I mentioned John that the premium growth, net written growth in the quarter was about 20%. But the exposure growth was less than that. We saw about 8%, 9% of price improvement in our portfolio, property portfolio. And as Peter mentioned, our P&L are on now a modest decline year-over-year, so the exposure growth will come outside of cat and really outside of our peak zones in the United States.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On the alternatives, I know some of these are reported with a one quarter lag. Based on the movements in the markets in the first quarter, do you have any visibility into the 2Q reported numbers? I mean it seems like it's setting up to be a better-than-expected quarter again. Can you just talk about that?","William Dooley","Bill Dooley. Well, Jay, you see the same results for the quarter as I do as far as the general market is concerned and the one quarter lag is only to do with the private equity portfolio. The other one is just a one-month lag on the hedge funds. So I don't want to assume where the markets is going to go, but I\u2019m not going agree or disagree with what you just said.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fair enough. And I guess a follow-up to the last question, Peter you mentioned obviously we need to adjust for catastrophe losses. Do you have sense that excluding catastrophe losses, if loss activity in general was in line or lighter than normal?","John Doyle","Jay, it's John. Our property losses were in line with what we expect, including shock losses in the quarter. I would say that the shock losses are the more than $10 million losses in property were in line with what our expectations were, but higher than a year ago and higher than the fourth quarter.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","First a numbers question. I want to know if you could walk through how much the DT was used during the quarter and how much the valuation allowance came off?","David Herzog","On the valuation allowance, Josh, we took on the DTA -- on the capital loss carry forwards, took down by about $750 million. That was through income and there was about another $50 million or so that came off through OCI. So in total, strategies that produced prudent and feasible transactions were about $800 million or so. And then on the DTA utilization, Jeff Farber.","Jeffrey Farber","Well, it's essentially the same thing, right? We only do our tax return once a year. So when we do the tax return, but you could kind of think about the earnings for the quarter as a surrogate for usage. So we continue to use the NOLs actively and we continue to utilize the life capital as carry forwards as we\u2019ve disclosed in the quarter.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","I'm not trying to begrudge, Peter or John, or James, anything. I'm trying to understand the long-term compensation plan a little bit and some of the specific targets. When it says on long-term comp plan, there were specific targets to receive 50% of the bonus, how do those specific targets in the P&C division relate to the aspirational goal of 90% to 95% in 2015?","Peter Hancock","This is Peter. The aspirational goals are laid out in different components. There is a combined number. There is an ROE number. And the one that -- if you want to pick any one of them that is the most important one that we focus on is the ROE one. So we, as you know, gave a range for the combined and if you want to be at the lower end of that range, if interest rates are high and you're getting your results flattened by high investment income and you'd be -- so I think that what we view as the alignment between the compensation plan is effectively an ROE goal. And so if we are on the ROE walk that delivers the 2015 goal, then people will feel pleased. So it's I think a very strong alignment. We set fairly broad goals. ","We don't break up the Company into little silos and that's a big change and I think culturally has people working together across boundaries, whether its geographic boundaries or business line boundaries so that everybody wins if we all win as a team. And I think that that's a really showing up in the culture of the Company and our customers are giving us feedback on that. So I think we want to align interest with the shareholders as well as making sure that our units work together across boundary as well. So it is a pool approach of how the property casualty business as a whole achieves its ROE goal, which then drives the ROE goal of AIG.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Peter, did you think it\u2019s feasible -- look, I\u2019d like you to get paid and make a lot of money, but if you don\u2019t hit that 95% or below target, do you think it\u2019s feasible that the ROE goal will be achieved?","Peter Hancock","Yes, absolutely.","Robert Benmosche","Yes, absolutely, you could. It's a question of capital intense products. It's a whole other series of factors that go on here. And what's important is that it's the quality of what we do. Peter has said numerous times that the combined ratio is a consequence of what we do, it's not what we manage. And when you get involved in managing that combined ratio, you could do some dumb things. There are things you can do to reduce your expense ratio, which is reducing your expenses and there are other techniques you could do in financial engineering. We want people to focus on the fundamentals, focus on accident year loss ratios, run this thing in the right way, and in the end we believe the combined will get into that range of 90%, 95%. But most important is you want to continue to grow the quality of the earnings and you want to have a better ROE. And if you continue to grow earnings and improve your ROE and shareholder return continues to get better, and total shareholder return plus earnings per share, those are the key indicators for us, and if that all moves in the right direction then I think people should be paid and they will be paid. So I think their senses are very aligned to doing what's right for the shareholders and they\u2019re in there with the shareholders with the stock-based compensation long-term.","Peter Hancock","I think, I mentioned earlier in the context of discussing yen exposure, direct marketing hurts our combined ratio but creates extremely good value. We've talked many times about the marginal ROE over the lifetime of those customer relationships as being in the 20s, 20%, based on very reliable actuarial histories. And so we wouldn't want to underspend on direct marketing simply to get under the wire on a combined target. We want to do good, valuable business and build long-term customer relationships that make sense. And for the skeptics, we will publish greater and greater detail about those actuarial assumptions so that you don't think that we are foolishly wasting money on growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Jay, you mentioned monetizing some capital gains in the life sub. Just curious, how much of the $25 billion in gross unrealized gains is there and how much do you think you can monetize? And I don\u2019t know, David, if you can remind us what the timeline for expiration is on those capital losses?","David Herzog","Jay, I will go first, and then maybe you comment, and Bill, if you want to add to it. A very substantial portion, Mike, of the capital loss carryforward DTA expires at the end of 2013. We have, there's about $1 billion or so that spills over into '14 but the bulk of the carryforward expires at the end of this year. Now, the NOLs, just to be clear, the NOLs go out through 2028 and '29. So there's a very ample time there. And then the foreign tax credits are more in the 2020, '21, '22 range. So that gives you a sense of the expiries.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Right. No, this is unrelated to the NOL, DTA, but just purely the capital gains.","David Herzog","Right. And that's why the focus is on 2013. So the harvesting etcetera will, again, will be more opportunistic beyond 2013 and 2014. Bill, you want to comment?","William Dooley","Sure. When you look at just the capital gains by itself, there is other programs that we look at too on harvesting gains for tax reasons. And the gain process itself has been going on now last year and it was restarted in the month of March and it will continue for the next couple of months. But we're using the gain mechanism also to readjust and reposition the portfolio. So the portfolio from a duration standpoint is probably short duration at this time and we're using this as an opportunity to let in the portfolio a little bit. And also better balance against some of the products that are in the life companies. And then another example of this is that we're looking at ways to raise liquidity over the period of time for the life companies and for the other companies of AIG and one of the strategies we've employed is a modified securities lending program and that gives liquidity to the underlying insurance companies. But at the same time, it generates certain types of tax benefits to us on a simultaneous basis. These other transactions and structures that we're using, but the bottom line of everything is its repositioning some of these portfolios that really haven't been repositioned in many, many years.","Jay Wintrob","Mike, this is Jay. I guess I\u2019d just add one comment to what's already been said which is obviously it's very economically efficient for us to realize capital gains given the tax loss carry forward position, but we also very carefully focus on what we can do in terms of reinvestment at any given point in time and what the friction costs are including lost investment income if you are not able to reinvest promptly the proceeds of any sales. So we\u2019ve targeted certain assets for potential sale, but it\u2019s all subject to what we see in the market in terms of potential purchases and as a practical matter how quickly we can make those purchases.","David Herzog","Just to add to that. Thanks Jay. The amount that we have actually utilized is actually ahead of what we thought we would do originally when we first set forth our aspirational goals back in early 2011. So we will have utilized about half of the amount in which exceeded the 20% to 25% level we were expecting that we could at the time. So, Liz, back to you.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Can I ask one quick follow-up to Peter? Peter, I guess you guys have mentioned before $1 billion run rate or $1 billion savings on expenses in some investments as well. I'm just trying to understand, we saw the expense ratio fall in U.S. commercial. We saw a rise a bit in international consumer and then consumer in North America was a bit lower than we had. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile those movements. In particular the G&A expense ratio in U.S. commercial or in North American commercial was really low. Can you help me line those dots up a little bit? Thanks.","Peter Hancock","I\u2019ll help you out. I think the basic comment we've made is we have a $1 billion of savings for all of AIG. We have said a good piece of it comes from the fact that we\u2019re doing this whole technology improvement, rebuilding our platform. We\u2019ve gone from 28 data centers down to two. We are moving from 12,500 servers to roughly 2,000 to 3,000, all moved into high secure locations. All of that will give us a lot more cost savings and benefits. We are rolling out a new one claim system for example throughout the Property Casualty business. That\u2019s a huge investment. Our financial architecture, where we have almost 6,000 people at AIG today and working in various aspects of finance. We are rolling our common ledgers and so on, building new processes around that. So this is a fundamental change in how we do business and it's at the highest level. We keep track of those benefits. We're well on our way to achieve that $1 billion goal. So it's not just a focus on Property Casualty. It\u2019s really about the overall of AIG. At this point, I think we\u2019re out of time.","Elizabeth Werner","Thank you, operator. Please, if you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to reach out. We\u2019ll be here all day and thank you very much for dialing in.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth A. Werner - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Paul. Before we get started this morning, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events.","Actual performance and events may differ possibly materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause this include the factors described in our first, second and third 2017 Form 10-Q and our 2016 Form 10-K under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and under Risk Factors.","AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Today's presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in the slides for today's presentation and our financial supplement, which are available on our website.","This morning, we'll have the opportunity to hear from our CEO, Brian Duperreault; our CFO, Sid Sankaran; our CEO of General Insurance, Peter Zaffino; and our CEO of Life and Retirement, Kevin Hogan.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll speak to our fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 financial results, our recent actions and my views on our strategic direction. We had a busy end to 2017 and 2018 is off to a strong start. Our fourth quarter operating earnings showed solid results across the majority of our businesses. In General Insurance, I'm pleased with the stability of our reserves and the outcome of our fourth quarter reserve review.","That development for the quarter was modest and we took decisive actions where needed, which were mostly in Europe. Importantly, our efforts to stabilize and improve our U.S. Commercial business are reflected in the fourth quarter accident year underwriting improvement. Across our Personal Insurance and Life and Retirement business, we continued to see solid results and the benefits of diversification.","The fourth quarter and full year were meaningfully impacted by catastrophes. California wildfires were largely in line with our third quarter estimate and the greatest contributor to our fourth quarter CAT losses. Despite full-year CAT losses of $4.2 billion, our highest ever, AIG delivered $3.2 billion on adjusted pre-tax operating income. As I mentioned in past calls, my philosophy on reinsurance is that it is an important tool for AIG to best manage its portfolio of risks.","It provides another set of eyes on our underwriting, helps to manage volatility and control loss exposure. Going forward, you can expect us to be a predictable buyer of reinsurance. You will hear more from Peter about our insurance strategy and the overall market environment in General Insurance, where we see rate improvement across a number of lines.","With respect to the International side of General Insurance, we took a hard look at our European Commercial portfolio and similar to our U.S. approach, we have acted decisively and prudently. International Personal Insurance had a very strong year and in fourth quarter, we completed the Japan merger that we've assessed with you on our prior calls.","Peter will talk more about our focused approach to managing our International business in his remarks. As we closed out the year, I view 2017 as a starting point where we laid the foundation with respect to people, structure and underwriting. We have completed our internal structural changes in both General Insurance and Life and Retirement. These changes better position our people in the market and simplify our structure, allowing for greater efficiencies.","While the company has made a lot of progress on reducing expenses over the last couple of years, an organization of our size and scale needs to be a top-quartile performer in both underwriting and expense management. We are committed to continuing to make meaningful progress in that direction in a prudent and thoughtful manner.","In 2017, our reserve and underwriting action set a baseline for General Insurance. As I've said before, 2018 is The Year of the Underwriter at AIG and I'm committed to empowering underwriters and holding them accountable for driving profitable growth.","A couple of weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Validus, a significant step forward in our strategy to deliver profitable growth. Validus shares our underwriting philosophy of taking prudent risks across products and distribution. As we stated when we announced the transaction, the talent and diversification Validus brings to AIG is financially accretive and value enhancing.","The company's business mix includes well-positioned companies providing new sources of growth for AIG. This year, we're also taking another important step forward in our legacy strategy with the formation of DSA Re, a Bermuda company that will manage the majority of our runoff reserves. You'll hear more from Sid on DSA's priorities.","Lastly, our 2017 results reflect the impact of the tax bill on the re-measurement of our deferred tax asset, which was in line with previous expectations. We believe the tax bill will be an overall net positive for AIG over the long term and look forward to the benefits of additional economic growth.","Last quarter, I spoke to the urgency this management team has to execute on our strategic priorities. I'm confident in the changes that are taking place at AIG. They are providing positive momentum for the company and its performance going forward.","With that, I'll turn it over to Sid.","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll comment on our fourth quarter financial results, the impact of tax reform, our progress with regards to our Legacy Portfolio and capital and liquidity.","Turning to slide 4, you can see our results presented under our new organizational structure, which became effective during the fourth quarter. Personal Insurance is now being reported with Commercial Insurance as part of the General Insurance segment and Institutional Markets is included with Life and Retirement.","As shown in our recast financial supplement, we no longer present normalized ROE as a reporting metric. However, we continue to include the quarterly noteworthy items that you can use to derive normalized earnings and they are shown on slide 5. We reported adjusted after-tax earnings per share of $0.57, which reflected total General Insurance catastrophe losses of $762 million and included $572 million for the Northern and Southern California wildfires as well as losses from U.S. storms.","As a reminder, we provided a preliminary estimate of $500 million for the Northern California wildfires on our third quarter earnings call and actual claims came in modestly lower than we expected. Our third quarter estimates for Harvey, Irma and Maria are holding up well overall relative to our initial estimates. The total catastrophe losses for the fourth quarter were split between $300 million in Commercial and $462 million in Personal Insurance.","Our Life and Retirement businesses delivered another solid quarter of results with an adjusted ROE of 10.2% in the quarter and 12.4% for the full year, benefiting from better-than-expected full year investment returns. Our Legacy Portfolio also delivered solid returns for the quarter and full year.","Turning to slide 6, we completed our detailed valuation reviews or DVRs on our reserves in the fourth quarter and recorded net adverse prior-year reserve development of $76 million. Our DVRs on long-tail lines were largely as expected and we saw favorable net development in North America of $97 million, including the amortization of the ADC. International had unfavorable development of $177 million, primarily related to large individual claims development in Property and Special Risks business and U.K. Financial Lines.","Turning to slide 7, our General Insurance ultimate accident year loss ratio as adjusted was 63.0% for the full year or 1.4 points lower than last year on an ultimate basis. With respect to underlying progress in our portfolio, we see North America Commercial Insurance ultimate accident year loss ratios having improved by approximately 2 points year-on-year, which has been partially offset by deterioration in International Commercial Insurance loss ratios by 1 point.","I would note that our fourth quarter International Commercial loss ratios include a catch-up adjustment for the full year associated with our fourth quarter DVRs and claims review. Our full year loss ratios for International Commercial are more representative of the starting point for profitability going forward. Our Personal Insurance loss ratios are now at our expectation and we believe they are sustainable. Peter will comment more on pricing, underwriting and trends in his remarks.","Turning to slide 8, the GAAP net loss per share of $7.33 for the fourth quarter includes a charge of $6.7 billion to re-measure our U.S. net operating losses and other balance sheet deferred tax assets at the new U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%. This re-measurement does not alter the amount of taxable earnings that can be sheltered by our net operating losses.","The reduction in the tax rate also does not impact our foreign tax credits, which we expect to fully utilize before they expire. These credits will now shelter a larger amount of taxable income. We expect that our adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 21% to 22% for the full year of 2018 and our after-tax ROE should improve by approximately 150 basis points. The tax rate is slightly higher than the statutory rate, largely reflecting a higher blended rate on foreign earnings. We continue to believe that the overall impact from tax reform is a long-term net positive to our intrinsic value.","Our balance sheet and free cash flow remained strong. As shown on slide 9, parent liquidity at quarter-end was $7.3 billion. During the quarter, we received approximately $300 million of dividends from our Life Insurance companies as well as $2 billion from Legacy Investments, including $1.1 billion from the sale of remaining life settlements contracts, which we disclosed last quarter.","Outflows during the quarter included approximately $1.2 billion related to year-to-date true-up for tax sharing payments to our P&C companies. With respect to our acquisition of Validus, we remain on track for an expected closing in mid-2018. As to our view of expected returns on the Validus acquisition, we see cash returns in the high-single-digit range, which takes into account our outlook for expense and capital synergies as well as the additional usage of our existing net operating losses.","We evaluate transactions based on economic value and accretion to our franchise value. I would note, as a result of the reduction of the statutory tax rate that I mentioned earlier, we reduced committed deferred tax assets by approximately $400 million for our U.S. non-life companies and about $500 million for our U.S. life companies. This reduced the RBC ratios shows for each group by about 10 points to 20 points.","Our regulatory capital ratios remained strong and tax reform did not require us to downstream capital to any of our insurance subsidiaries. We expect approximately $5 billion in dividends and $1 billion of tax sharing payments from our insurance subsidiaries in 2018, that is before any potential legacy-related activity and subject to our customary approvals.","We have continued to successfully execute on our legacy strategy. As Brian noted earlier, we formed a Bermuda-domiciled legal entity, named DSA Reinsurance Company Limited or DSA Re, to re-insure our legacy life and non-life runoff lines. By combining these runoff lines into a single well-capitalized legal entity, we were able to achieve operating synergies and strong diversification in assets. Legacy remains non-core and will be managed by a team with extensive runoff expertise.","DSA Re will be a licensed re-insurer with approximately $37 billion or over 80% of legacy total insurance reserves and will be backed by approximately $40 billion of invested assets managed by AIG Investments. Our objective with respect to DSA Re remains to efficiently manage our legacy liabilities, honor our policy and service obligations and maximize AIG's financial flexibility. The formation of this entity will allow us to accelerate these objectives.","Additionally, as shown on page 7 of the financial supplement, we had another strong quarter and full year of earnings from securities carried at fair value. Earnings on these assets totaled $524 million in the quarter and $1.5 billion for the full year for a full-year return of over 11.5%. Our expectation is for these returns to more closely resemble long-term historical returns that we estimate are in the range of 6% to 8%.","Assuming these returns, we expect total 2018 net investment income for our core insurance businesses and legacy insurance portfolios to be approximately $13 billion. The greatest variable to our estimate remains projected market returns. Kevin will comment further on the impacts for Life and Retirement.","To sum up, we continue to execute on plans to improve our results. We've demonstrated the value of maintaining a strong balance sheet and free cash flow profile, which gives us flexibility to execute on our strategic options.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter.","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss the General Insurance fourth quarter and full year underwriting results, our efforts to manage risk and volatility, actions to improve the performance of our core business and our new organizational structure and leadership team, which I had commented on last quarter.","Turning to slide 11, as you've heard, CAT losses significantly impacted our 2017 performance. However, going forward, you can expect us to more thoughtfully manage frequency and severity of CAT exposure through our reinsurance strategy and the management of our gross exposures.","Turning to the fourth quarter, the adjusted accident year combined ratio improved 3.1 points over the prior-year quarter. As Sid mentioned, we've seen improvement across portions of our portfolio, but we're not satisfied with our current accident year results and are making the necessary changes to drive better financial performance.","With respect to expenses, while our overall expenses declined 12% for the year, our expense ratio has remained flat as we've continued to reduce premiums as part of our remediation efforts. In 2018, we've identified additional opportunities to improve efficiency as we transition to a more decentralized model, while we further invest in talent within General Insurance.","Total net premiums written declined 9% for the quarter and 10% for the year, excluding FX. Divestitures accounted for 6 points of a full-year decline, while the remainder primarily reflects remediation of underperforming lines.","Going forward, in light of our reinsurance strategy and actions to manage the overall portfolio, we expect 2018 premium volume to be relatively flat with 2017 levels. While the General Insurance underlying accident year loss ratio improved year-over-year, we still have work that needs to be done across the Commercial Lines.","Slides 12 and 13 provide additional insights into North America and International 2017 results. Last year, you saw the greatest impact from our remediation efforts in the North America Commercial, where accident year loss ratios began improving. In addition, in aggregate, fourth quarter North America Commercial claim trends have been favorable relative to our expectations. North America Personal Insurance net premiums written reflected growth in new travel business, which was offset by strategic divestitures and lower volumes and warranty.","Our European Commercial business was impacted by reserve strengthening, adverse loss emergence and certain catch-up adjustments in the fourth quarter, which Sid discussed. We took underwriting actions in late-2016 and the 2017 accident year has seen an early improvement in trend, but rate and risk selection important is still required in these portfolios. We continue to work on remediating our book.","Transitioning to market conditions, as Brian said, we are getting rate across multiple lines of business and U.S. Property is showing the greatest improvement. The fourth quarter is seasonally our lowest quarter for U.S. Property and the rate increases have varied based on exposure, geography and the impact of recent events.","However, we saw rate strengthening each month during the quarter, which averaged in the high-single digits and appears to be sustaining in the first quarter. Our primary objectives are to partner with our clients, provide solutions at renewal and offer alternatives for our new clients. As a result, recent retention has improved year-over-year.","Moving to other parts of the portfolio, in U.S. Casualty, we observed rate increases in the mid-single digits, which had a wide range depending on line of business, attachment point and experience. We are maintaining a view on loss cost trends and taking rate to be responsive to our observations.","Turning to slide 14, last quarter, we stated that one of our main priorities is to take a more strategic approach to reinsurance, building long-term relationships with our partners to manage future volatility. Our reinsurance philosophy is to take smaller net lines in property and casualty, reduce volatility and be consistent buyers of reinsurance.","During the January 1 reinsurance renewals, we began to execute on our strategy by reducing severity and frequency exposures to North American CAT and net retention on our property per risk and also obtaining a new catastrophe cover for international CAT.","We expect these enhancements and anticipated changes for the remainder of the year will substantially reduce our risk of future volatility. Year-over-year, our PMLs are down 30% for the 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 events and on a pro forma basis when we include the acquisition of the Validus, our PMLs will be approximately 20% lower than the prior year, positioning us to pursue other opportunities as they may arise.","Our recently announced acquisition of Validus is another example of a strong start to 2018. The acquisition brings valuable complementary businesses and allows us to expand our capabilities in treaty reinsurance, including access to the ILS market throughout the CAT, a Lloyd's platform, a commercial E&S surplus business and a crop insurer. I've known the Validus leadership team for many years and their underwriting expertise and track record speaks for itself.","Given AIG's diversity and capital strength, I believe we'll be able to seek unique opportunities for profitable growth with Validus. Last quarter, I said that I intend to run to our problems. We recently announced our organizational design and additions to leadership that will provide the foundation for improving our financial business results. Our new structure is composed of distinct end-to-end businesses that support transparency, accountability and process efficiencies.","Our core underwriting businesses will be led by Lex Baugh for North America, Chris Townsend for International and Gaurav Garg for Personal Insurance. Chris joins us in early March and will implement our new operating model across our International businesses to drive local decision-making and increased accountability. Tom Bolt recently joined us as Chief Underwriting Officer in January and he will play a critical role in bringing quality and consistency to our underwriting guidelines and process and assisting us in advancing our analytical capabilities.","In closing, the modifications we've made to our structure, coupled with our talented leadership team, will enable us to improve strategic, financial and operational performance.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on slide 16, Life and Retirement produced solid results for the quarter with $782 million in adjusted pre-tax income despite approximately $90 million in adjustments, primarily for fixed and variable annuity products within Individual and Group Retirement due to ongoing modernization of our actuarial systems and related model refinements. Our results for the year was strong with over $3.8 billion in adjusted pre-tax income and adjusted ROE of 12.4%.","Total yields for our spread-based products benefited from significant increases in alternative and yield enhancement income for the year. It is important to note, however, that our base yields continued to be compressed due to the reinvestment environment. Additionally, asset growth, driven by strong equity markets, continued to help partially mitigate the impact of the low rate environment on our results.","One of Life and Retirement's greatest strength is the breadth of our product portfolio across our businesses, which served us particularly well in a year marked by industry sales challenges, especially in the individual annuity market. We emphasized growth in Life Insurance and Institutional Markets sales and continued to maintain steady sales results for our Group Retirement business. Results for Institutional Markets are now reported as part of Life and Retirement, which is consistent with many of our peers.","Our diversified position in Institutional Markets further emphasizes the breadth of our product portfolio and market presence. This business is well positioned to capitalize on available growth opportunities, but we remain focused on achieving targeted economic returns.","Now, I will briefly discuss our results for the fourth quarter. Turning to Individual Retirement on slide 17, regulatory uncertainties and disruption have continued to significantly affect distributors, negatively impacting industry sales, particularly our variable annuity products. Although our sales of Fixed and Index Annuities increased for the quarter, overall Individual Retirement net flows remained negative.","Individual Retirement's assets under administration were at historical highs at quarter-end, driven by equity market performance and positive Index Annuity net flows, which resulted in increased fee income. We continued our practice of active spread management, but as expected, we saw continued compression, reflecting current reinvestment conditions. This quarter, base net investment spreads benefited from unexpected accretion income for Fixed Annuities and growth in Index Annuities.","Turning to Group Retirement on page 18, our investments in VALIC to transform the plan sponsor and participant experience continued to pay off. New group acquisitions increased significantly for the year. Despite strong sales for the year, net flows declined as individual surrenders increased. Similar to Individual Retirement, Group Retirement achieved record assets under administration and despite disciplined rate management experienced expected base yields compression.","This quarter, base net investment spread benefited from unexpected accretion income and a cumulative update to cost of funds. While we have seen recent increases in risk-free rates, spreads continued to be at historically tight levels.","Looking forward, across Individual and Group Retirement, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our base net spreads will decline by approximately 1 basis point to 3 basis points per quarter. And as Sid mentioned, we would also expect returns in alternatives and securities carried at fair value to moderate to more historical levels, noting this impacts total yields, but not base yields nor spreads.","Let's now move to Life Insurance on slide 19, our Life Insurance business continued to make progress. In the U.S., our new modern administrative platform, distribution simplification efforts and narrowed product focus are supporting strong topline growth. Our premiums and deposits increased and we had a strong growth in both term and universal life insurance sales for the quarter and the year. While mortality experience was elevated for the quarter, for the year, it was better than the prior year and within pricing expectations.","Turning to slide 20, Institutional Markets benefited from opportunistic transactions in a number of its product lines, including pension risk transfers. Our strong capabilities in the pension risk transfer business as well as our disciplined pricing and strong balance sheet position us well to selectively participate in this growing market.","Overall sales growth in Institutional Markets over the last year has increased assets under management, resulting in higher net investment income. To close, our results reflect our strong diversification and focus on writing profitable business, which we believe positions us well for the future.","Now, I would like to turn it back to Brian to open up to Q&A.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. Operator, let's go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. My first question is on the General Insurance accident year loss ratio that you referenced in the slides. How much more improvement do you feel would be needed to achieve your target returns?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Should I do this? You want to do that, Peter?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Well, I think it's going to be a combination of things, because that accident year loss ratio is a mix in the portfolio, you've got casualty, you've got property, you've got different combined ratios, you mix it together, maybe you want more property, probably push your loss ratio down a bit and more cash that goes up and I think you got to add the expense issue that I mentioned earlier, we've got to continue to work on our expense levels too.","So, it isn't just the loss ratio that's going to get us to our level that we want to get to in terms of returns. It's going to be a mix of business and it's going to be an expense and loss combination. But we still have ways to go. I mean we're not there yet. And I think we can clearly improve that. And we've got a bit of a tailwind, which is helping us in that effort. So, that tells us we can get there a little faster. Hope that answers the question.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","It does. Thank you. And then my follow-up is on capital management. With $6 billion plus potentially coming in for additional deployable cash in 2018, can you update us on your perspective on the dividend and buybacks? I noticed there wasn't any buy backs in the fourth quarter, but that was also the same quarter where it probably took into account Validus being announced. So, if you can update us on your views there, that'd will be helpful. Thank you.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. Well, capital management is a key thing in what one does. We're blessed with having the kind of capital built-out that we have and how you deploy it. I've said earlier that, to me, the buybacks are capital management tool, we'll use those that management tool when we think it's appropriate, but I would rather deal with our portfolio and the fact that there are pieces of it that I'd like to fill in, we have white space there.","So, that would be my priority. Our dividend process should be long-term in nature, consistent with the kind of business we do and that would be a more steady move, right? That I wouldn't think you'd make large scale changes in your dividend approach. So, it really gets down to can I find opportunities to use the capital in a way that's accretive and structurally improving? And if I can't, we have the stock buyback as a tool.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, yeah. Can we go to next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks. Two here quickly. First one, just, Peter, I'm just curious, where are we in the process? I mean you got the senior leadership in place in the General Insurance business, Commercial, but where are we as far as kind of the next level down and kind of building out your teams and kind of upgrading underwriting talent?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Well, I mentioned that Tom recently arrived and Chris will be joining us in early March. So, we have the foundation for our core underwriting leadership. We actually have been hiring actually some significant talent at that next layer and the layer below. Ken Riegler, who just recently joined us, has taken a very prominent position within North America. Tim DeSett joined us to run our North America field.","And so, we have been continuing to add very strong talent at the next layer, but we also have some really strong talents in the organization that now that we've announced the org structure, we've been putting people in positions where they can start to drive influence and improve on the accident year loss ratios in 2018 and 2019.","So, I'm really very encouraged by the number of people that have shown interest and want to join and I'm really pleased with the progress that we've made to-date.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","You got a follow-up, Brian?","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, yeah. And I'm just curious with the changes in the reinsurance program, the AALs that you guys have been providing, any change that we should think about going into 2018?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Well, we're taking a look at \u2013 as I said, we're really pleased with where the PMLs have gone in all the return periods on our new reinsurance structure and that coupled also with reducing gross exposures in North America and different parts of the rest of the world. And I think we're going to take a hard look at AALs. I don't think it'll be commensurate to the decrease you see in the PMLs and we think we should have some benefit in 2018 from AALs and we'll give more guidance as to we get into 2018.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the answers.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Good. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. This isn't a new issue, but one that I want to better understand. There's two different numbers that the DTA on the balance sheet and the DTA you use for calculating book value per share. I know you guys took a big write-down related to the change in U.S. tax law, but there's a different change to both, $7 billion on the balance sheet and $4 billion on the calculation of book value per share. Can you explain a little bit the difference between those two?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah. Sid?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Well, Josh, Liz will be happy to walk you through all the details off line, but you've got the NOLs and the FTCs, the foreign tax credit, so the items that I referred to with respect to my script. So, we can obviously follow up with more detail, but it's relatively straightforward in terms of the calculations.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Got a follow-up?","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. And in terms of \u2013 there's a little bit of a reserve deficiency on recent years offset by better results in prior years. Where do you stand on terms of the confidence in the end of your loss picks for this year? And do you feel those \u2013 your predecessor said, sometimes we're going to be deficient, sometimes we're going to be redundant, we have a very large book, do you take that tax as well?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, I can't comment on what my predecessor said, but I said 2017, to me, is a start point. I feel confident that we have a good handle on where the issues are line-by-line, country-by-country. And so, yeah, I think we're poised now and we've got the structure and we've got the understanding. Now, we just got to execute.","Okay. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning. My first question is on the International Commercial. Could you give me more detail about what kind of remediation efforts you're taking and what's the timeline of that relative to the North America Commercial? Just try to figure out what we see the turnaround soon as we have seen in North America.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, let me start. I think Peter can give you a lot more color, but I think if you look at the portfolio, usually you round up the usual suspects. It's combination of things like selection and maybe some deterioration on a particular portfolio. There wasn't one single line. It was a combination of things. And I think the issues around our gross limits and net limits exacerbated any issues that would pop up in a portfolio, but the question is, what we do going forward and Peter?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Yes. As Sid mentioned in his opening comments, we took a really hard look at the fourth quarter within International with a little bit more of a focus in Europe. And so, some of the trends \u2013 again, I don't need to get back thorough it, but the Financial Lines, Property, Special Risks, we had some development, but I would ask you to take a look at the full year. If you look at the accident year loss ratio of the full year, that's more reflecting the overall performance. I think we will continue to try to take volatility out and not take as large of net and gross lines within our International portfolio.","But, overall, the accident years, if we look at the full 2017, we know we have improvement, but you look at the delta between that and North America, we still need to focus on improving our accident year loss ratios in North America as well.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. My follow-up is on reinsurance and we see new programs, if 2017 CAT losses were repeat, what's your net loss and could you also give update on the Commercial quota share renewals?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Looks like it's yours, Peter.","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Okay. Well, we've restructured the CAT reinsurance to include more aggregate cover. So, the attachment point dropped from $1.5 billion to $750 million with a corridor deductible, but that's an aggregate versus an occurrence. And so you would take a lot of the frequency of events out and we have around \u2013 I don't want to give a specific number, but it'd be in the 40% to 60% less range for if we had the same exact CATs in 2017 reoccur in 2018. So, we've taken out a lot of the volatility of frequency, but also have a vertical cover in the event that we have a single large loss that we are protected at different return periods.","In terms of the quota share, Brian mentioned, I mentioned, we're taking a full-year look at all of our reinsurance placements and so we've begun with property at 1\/1. We are not going to continue with quota share in the U.S. We're going to look at a variety of different alternatives in terms of how we want to structure reinsurance in our International portfolio in casualty as well as in North America. So, we'll continue to give you updates as we revisit all of our reinsurance placements throughout the year.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Next question, please?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","You are welcome.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi good morning. My first question, pretty good \u2013 you guys had a pretty good improvement in the North America Commercial Lines underlying loss ratio in the quarter. I know within the International book, you kind of pointed to the full year as the starting point for 2018. Was there anything one-off in that number or is that something that we should use as kind of a base to model off of for the Commercial Lines results as we think about 2018 in North America?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Look, there's always a one-off in there, but I'd say, use it as a baseline.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And my second question, you guys set up this DSA Re vehicle. Is there any thoughts around that, that could potentially free up more capital for you guys, if you could just share some thoughts around that.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Sid?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Sure. Obviously, as we said, we're pleased with the transaction, because we think having a single strong entity here to manage our runoff portfolios is going to give us a better optionality to manage the risk. And so, what I'd say to you is we're going to evaluate all our options and like all our major entities, we'll evaluate the business plans and capital targets as we go forward, but we do think that it gives us some financial flexibility going forward to better manage risk.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Hi. Thank you. In Life and Retirement, you now have several charges related to systems enhancements leading to reserve refinements. Can you update us where you are in the systems investment process and if we should anticipate more refinements in the future?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Kevin?","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Yes, thanks, Erik. We've been in the process of modernizing our actuarial systems in the retirement business and also the life business the last two to three years. We're essentially moving from one very modern platform to an even better platform. And as we are able to upgrade the detail of the models from time-to-time, there are some movements in the reserves. And so, while this shows up in earnings in the fourth quarter, relative to the size of the balance sheet, these are relatively modest adjustments.","I think what's important is, is that there's no change in our outlook to the profitability or attractiveness of this business and these are very sophisticated platforms. So, like I said, we're two to three years in. We have another year or two to go. We're constantly trying to improve our modeling and management of this business. And at this point in time, we can't suggest that there's anything else to come. We're continuing to work through the process.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Thank you.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Anything else, Erik?","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Yeah. In Group Retirement specifically, I mean you've made a number of investments there on the VALIC platform and are seeing a pick-up in new group acquisitions, but the flows remain negative. I guess what are the remaining hurdles you see to getting back to positive flows in that business?","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","So, I think that there's two things. You have to recall that there was a period of time where we were not engaging in aggressive plan acquisition. We've reengaged in new plan acquisitions starting three, four years ago. And as you pointed out, we have made some significant digital investments, which are really paying off and improving both the plan sponsor and the participant experience.","So, I think that at the levels of plan acquisitions where we are now, we're continuing to see improvement year-on-year. We're continuing to expand our advisor force and expect that to grow. We will have little ways to go before we make up for the fact that we weren't acquiring plans for a while. So, our outlook for this business is very profitable business. We're still managing the yield compression and the margins remain strong.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Thank you.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay. You're welcome. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning. You mentioned high-single-digit cash returns for Validus. How does that compare to your cost of capital as you calculated?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","Well, I guess, we can always have a debate on all the methods to calculate cost of capital. I'd say, when we look at it, it would be above our weighted average cost of capital in terms of equity cost of capital, I can do all the fancy math I want, but generally my investors tell me it's 10%. So, we think it's a reasonable return here for our surplus cash and capital.","And certainly, those assumptions, as we said, we think we've been cautious. And so, if we do any better than that, which certainly we're targeting, we think it's going to be something that people will be very pleased with in terms of overall return.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I want to ask a question about the net flows, particularly in the Individual Retirement with all the regulatory changes. Is it your view that or do you have a particular strategy that you think that the regulatory issues will moderate or \u2013 clearly, we've had a lot of adjustments from a marketing perspective in that business and I'd just like to have your perspective on it.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Kevin?","Kevin T. Hogan - American International Group, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So, let's remember the fourth quarter was still a period where the distribution environment \u2013 we work with independent distribution across the U.S. within the relatively earlier stages of embracing the DOL. And third quarter was the low point, but fourth quarter still sort of suffered from that. And rates were improving a bit. At the time, the equity markets were very strong.","And so, VAs really were under pressure. We're actually pleased with the VAs is that almost half of our sales right now or last quarter were a new product that we introduced with the daily income benefits, which is something that is targeted for the new distribution environment. So, whilst we're continuing to see a reduction in the new business there, we feel good about where we are positioned with the VA product branch.","We also introduced an advisory product. We're seeing improvements where we're focused on Index Annuities and Fixed Annuities. And Index Annuities, in particular, have kind of taken a place of the role that Variable played in some advisers' platform. And we've been working closely with our distribution partners relative to that.","I mean as the rate environment improves and as investors' outlook may evolve relative to attractive investments and these products versus unbridled equity markets is what will predict the future environment. We think that what's most important is, is that we have a common standard of care relative to the fiduciary standard and suitability between investment and insurance products. And so, we believe that the future regulatory environment will move in that direction and that investors will respond to that and the distribution environment, most importantly, is stabilizing relative to their practices.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg from Janney.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning and thank you. Peter, I think you said that we should expect General Insurance premium volume to be flat for 2018. Would you differentiate between domestic and International or is that a pretty good assumption for both of those?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Larry, I would just assume that will be remaining flat across the globe and I wouldn't differentiate much between North America and International. The only thing I would say to that is that we're getting more rate in North America as I look from pivoting from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So, the rate seems to be sustaining. Some of the peak zone renewals that we have, those are coming up. So, again, I can't really forecast what's going to happen in the second and third quarter.","But if rate continues to improve and we have some of our bigger quarters in property with those type of rate increases, you could see a little bit more in North America.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great. Thank you. And then, Brian, in terms of getting your expense ratios to top quartile, is that something that we should expect could be achieved in the next year or so or is that a multi-year process?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, it's been a multi-year process so far.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Right.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","And I've got to give \u2013 say give credit. I mean this is all mostly happened before I arrived. And you've got to give him credit. I think when you go to a multi-year process, the harder nut is the one in front of you and I think it's probably more structural now and we have to think about it in a more structural way, which we will do. We've taken steps as you heard earlier and in putting our structure in a more intelligent position with General and Life being separate and then we'll go from there. But I can't tell you I'm going to get it done in a year.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. You said you're getting some good rate in the property book. Did that momentum continue into this year? And also, do you think the casualty rate environment is better today than it was a year ago in the U.S.?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Peter?","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","For the U.S. Property, what I had mentioned in my comments sequentially got better every month within the fourth quarter. January looks to be very consistent with that pattern. Don't have too much guidance beyond January. So, we are continuing to see rate increase. We are seeing rate increase within the casualty lines. It really just does vary. I mean certainly auto is the one that would be driving the most increase on a primary and excess basis.","But want to make sure that we're spending a lot of time thinking through like loss cost trends for the casualty lines, because rate increases required across most casualty lines just to stay constant with loss cost increases. So, we are seeing rate increase. I want to make sure that we're very conscientious of why that increase has to happen for loss cost increases, but we are seeing rate on the casualty book. And, again, early indications in the first quarter, that's consistent with what we saw at the end of the year.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And one follow-up to that, have you seen a pick-up in the legal or is it a tougher legal environment today than it was say, three, four years ago, particularly in the casualty side?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","We're looking to each other like, I'm not sure. I don't think it's any worse. I mean, I think if you look at D&O, we've seen some different actions that have taken place. And you might say that there perhaps, it's a little worse, but with that \u2013 having said that, I can't really describe it that way, no.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Very good.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning. Hey, Brian, in terms of releasing reserves for North American Commercial P&C, should we take that more of a function of the less challenged lines being reviewed this quarter? And so, could we still see some volatility as you'd review more challenged lines in 2Q and 3Q of 2018 or do you expect less volatility than we saw in 2017?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, yeah, we look at all of the reserves, I mean really, I mean it's not \u2013 I mean we have a detailed review of \u2013 in the scheduled way, if we see a problem, we pull it forward. We look at everything. So, I wouldn't characterize this as these were the easy ones. We look at all. I said earlier, I think 2017, to me, is a good starting point. I feel confident and I said that before in the reserve process in the way we look at the business.","So, you never can predict what's going to happen next year. I'm not going to do that, but I feel confident in our understanding of what this portfolio is all about, where the issues are and what we need to address.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. And then, just a follow-up. Is there anything different about the process you're going to implement to review reserves, if you think about when you first joined, presumably you'd want to do a deeper dive or is it exactly the same process in terms of whether you're doing it all internally, using any outside consultants and anything different about the process as we think about 2018?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","That's another good \u2013 interesting question. So, we do use outside consultants or actuarial firms. So, we have several looks at it and that always gives you comfort, particularly if you are within kind of their tolerances and ranges. And I think we've gotten closer to the mean in that regard or maybe even above it a little bit, so we've \u2013 that's a standard process for us. Reserves are a lot easier when you make money. It's a lot easier.","And I think ours \u2013 I tell everybody, how are we going to our reserves to improve? Make money. Make money. And that, I think attention to the portfolio, addressing the issues and addressing them early, so you nip things in the bud, reducing the volatility, so that you don't have a lot of business that just out-of-line premium to exposures. So, if it goes wrong, it can exacerbate. So, those are the things. It's a portfolio management. And I guess, in that regard, yeah, there's been some changes there, but not in the technique of actually looking at the reserves.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. On a high level, I guess, between the purchase of much more reinsurance on property and the non-renewal of the casualty quota share, it seems like casualty is going to represent a much higher percentage of earned premiums in 2018 than it did in 2017. Can you walk us through conceptually what that implies for the underlying loss ratio?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","You cut off at that last piece. I didn't hear that last statement, the last question. Could you just repeat that last sentence?","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","I'm just trying to understand what that anticipated mix shift implies for the underlying, the accident year ex-CAT loss ratio?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Well, let me start. I think Peter can add to it. When we look at reinsurance, I mean we're looking at a lot of different things with respect to reinsurance. Some of it is \u2013 is it -- are we doing it for volatility reasons? Are we doing it for capital reasons? Are we doing it for issues around analysis, et cetera? So, we looked at our entire portfolio and is the relationship between us and the reinsurer, one, where we are truly providing benefits to both? And so, those are the decisions around all the lines of business, whether it's casualty or property.","Obviously, our casualty loss ratios tend to be a little higher, but \u2013 because they have less volatility. So, you're going to have a mix change in the loss ratio just naturally between the two. The more important question is, do we feel that the portfolio itself, whether it's casualty or property producing the kind of returns? And that doesn't change. If that doesn't change, we have to deal with the profitability of that book on a gross basis and so, we're not changing our approach to improvement. We know we've got more to do in casualty and we're going to do it.","But \u2013 and the property has had issues, particularly in Europe where we have to address those as well. So, it's a mix of the business question, but underlying all that is are we attacking the portfolio intelligently? And I think we are.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. Second question, can you give us a sense, I know it varies tremendously, but an overall sense of the loss trends that are embedded in your casualty reserves that you're on?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Sense of loss trends, well, I guess, that's Peter.","Peter Zaffino - American International Group, Inc.","Well, I can tell you in terms of how we're looking at the pricing. When we look at some of the loss cost trends in pricing again, I had mentioned before that we contemplate that on the primary and then the excess. And so, on the primary, it ranges from 3% or 4% up to 8% and again, auto being at the upper-end. And from an excess basis, looking at the same lines of business, it can go up to almost 10% on the loss cost trends, again auto being one at the upper-end, but there's other lines of business that fall within that.","And so, we make sure that as we're looking to pricing and looking at some of our historical experience, we contemplate all of that in terms of looking at how we're going to position the portfolio throughout 2018. As I say, we're getting ready and we're looking at loss cost trends. So, I don't see anything dramatically changing based on our observations.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Okay. Next and last question?","Operator","Our last question comes from Jay Cohen.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Jay, I guess, you're our last guy, so fire away.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Let's just say (56:55) saving the best for last, right?","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","Absolutely.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Question for Sid actually. Financial leverage, are you near where you want to be at this point or do you need to take some action on the debt side?","Siddhartha Sankaran - American International Group, Inc.","No, I think if you look at our balance sheet, our cash flow profile, we're roughly comfortable with where we are in financial leverage. We're obviously going to keep evaluating that as we go through the year, but I think if you look at the balance sheet, it's extremely strong from a capital liquidity and leverage standpoint.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, great. No other question. Thanks.","Brian Duperreault - American International Group, Inc.","All right, Jay.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Sabra Purtill Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today's call will cover AIG's fourth quarter and year-end 2019 financial results announced earlier this morning. The news release financial results presentation and financial supplement were posted on our website at www.aig.com and the 10-K for the year will be filed next week.","Our speakers today include Brian Duperreault, CEO; Peter Zaffino, President and Chief Operating Officer of AIG and CEO of General Insurance; Kevin Hogan CEO Life and Retirement; and Mark Lyons CFO. Following their prepared remarks we will have time for Q&A.","I would also like to note that Peter and Mark will be hosting a fireside chat at the Bank of America Insurance Conference today at 12:35 p.m. Eastern Time. The link for the webcast can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website.","Before Brian begins please note that today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements including comments relating to company performance strategic priorities business mix and market conditions these statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. Actual performance and events may differ materially. Factors that could cause results to differ include the factors described in our first second and third quarter 2019 reports on Form 10-Q our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and our other recent filings made with the SEC.

The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are included in our earnings release financial supplement and presentation all of which are available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Good morning and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. For the fourth quarter adjusted after-tax income was $919 million or $1.03 per common share. For full year 2019 adjusted after-tax income was $4.1 billion or $4.59 per common share and return on common equity and adjusted return on common equity were 5.3% and 8.3% respectively.","These results reflect the significant progress we made over the course of 2019 on the execution of our strategy to position AIG for long-term sustainable and profitable growth. Our focus on fundamentals and the foundational work that we've done since late 2017 is becoming evident on our financial performance with our 2019 results reflecting broad-based improvement across all segments.","I will highlight some of the important milestones we achieved this past year most notable being in those in General Insurance business. GI produced a full year 2019 combined ratio of 99. six and an accident year combined ratio as adjusted of 96%. It's hard to say given all the issues at AIG over the last decade-plus but I honestly can't remember the last time AIG had a full year underwriting profit.","This inflection point is critical to achieve and reflects the tremendous efforts by our team in General Insurance led by Peter who affected the turnaround on the scale and timeline never be seen never before seen in our industry.","Beginning in late 2017 the GI was focused to design a strategy to improve underwriting fundamentals reposition our portfolio aggressively reduce limits judiciously deploy capital or capacity and discipline. Additionally the GI team designed an innovative reinsurance strategy to reduce risk and volatility and preserve capital. The disciplined execution and the leadership they demonstrated in the global marketplace throughout 2018 and 2019 not only dramatically reshaped our portfolio it stimulated the global market cycle that I believe is improving and sustainable.","A great testament to this leadership is that throughout the last couple of years our clients distribution and reinsurance partners as well as other stakeholders actively supported our action and placed their trust and confidence in AIG as we continue to provide solutions for current and emerging risks. While there is so much work to be done our strategy is clearly working and the team of General Insurance will continue to make progress over the coming year.","In 2019 we also saw significant improvements in other areas of our business. Life and Retirement delivered consistent solid results in the face of continued headwinds from sustained low interest rates and tightening credit spreads; due to Kevin and his team's proactive strategy to develop a diversified portfolio and broad distribution network ended the year with an adjusted return on common equity of 13.7% ahead of our guidance.","Full year 2019 net investment income was $14.4 billion versus $12.7 billion in 2018 helped by a strong alternative returns favorable equity markets and tightening spreads in the credit markets. We also made significant progress in derisking our legacy portfolio with the announcement of an agreement to sell our majority interest in Fortitude. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals that is currently expected to close mid-year.","I'm very pleased that with all we accomplished in 2019 and our progress reflects our hard work and commitment of our workforce across all of AIG and we remain committed to achieving a 10% return on adjusted common equity by the end of 2021.","Mark will provide more detail on our 2020 financial outlook. As we look ahead to 2020 we continue to be laser-focused on the execution of our strategy the position AIG both a leading insurance franchise and a top-performing company AIG 200 which Peter is leading and will discuss in more detail during his remarks. Will be a significant body of work this year and over the next several years.","Like our approach in General Insurance back in 2017 the foundation work for AIG 200 started in earnest in 2019 and will accelerate in 2020. We will continue to build out a world-class team of professionals with significant transformation experience who will drive this working across our global organization.","The team is identifying issues and pain points and creating plans that will redefine how we do business and how we create value for our stakeholders. This is not about band aids or temporary fixes to simply kick the can down the road. This work will address underlying problems and position us for sustainable long-term profitability. AIG 200 is a program with multiple work streams that require intense focus and disciplined execution.","The sustainable improvements AIG 200 will deliver require significant investment and will ultimately lead to reduced expense base over time. When you consider the scope and complexity I've not seen the transformation of scale in my career much like the GI turnaround we will have some surprises and perhaps setbacks along the way but we will look we will work through them and in the end we will be vastly improved and a stronger company.","AIG 200 is a marathon not a sprint. While results will not be linear we will be fully transparent as this work progresses. My confidence continues to grow that we are on the right path at AIG. I'm very proud of what our colleagues have accomplished. The hard work dedication and commitment is delivering results and we are energized by what 2020 holds for us.","With that I will turn the call over to Peter who will provide more information on fourth quarter and full year financial results in General Insurance as well as AIG 200. ","Peter Zaffino","Thank you, Brian and good morning, everyone. Today I will review 2019 financial performance for General Insurance update you on major reinsurance basements completed as part of the January renewal season share observations regarding current market conditions and outline notable business unit accomplishments and General Insurance. I will also provide an overview of AIG 200.","As Brian mentioned we are very pleased that in 2019 general insurance achieved and underwriting costs. This was an important milestone for our team and reflects the significant work that was done in 2018 and 2019 to build a world-class leadership team establish a new comprehensive underwriting strategy for general insurance clearly outlined a defined risk appetite for our distribution partners and clients and complete critical foundational work to improve our portfolio while meaningfully reducing volatility through underwriting actions and a comprehensive reinsurance strategy.","Our improved financial results provide clear being accepted in the marketplace. We are reestablishing AIG as a market leader which could have not happened without the great support and strong relationships we have with our distribution partners relationships we have with our distribution partners and clients.","Turning to our financial results; the adjusted accident year combined ratio for the full year of 2019 was 96% a 370 basis point improvement year-over-year including a 240 basis point improvement in the loss ratio and 130 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. In North America the adjusted accident year loss ratio of 67.1% a 300 basis point improvement year-over-year. The disciplined execution of our strategy resulted in a better quality more profitable portfolio and North America also benefited from Validus and Glatfelter.","As noted on the third quarter call 2019 is a challenging year for crop industry-wide. In the fourth quarter as we did in the third quarter we increased loss estimates due to crop yield shortfalls resulting from poor growing conditions and increased reserves due to the preventive planting claims from the impact of wet weather conditions. As a result crop negatively impacted North America's full year 2019 adjusted accident year loss ratio by a 100 basis points.","North America personal insurance continued to perform as expected with an 80 basis point improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio for the full year as business mix improved across the portfolio. Private client group experienced lower severe attritional walkability and I'm pleased with the progress the new management team is making in that business.","Moving to international; the adjusted accident year loss ratio for the full year was 56.4%, a 270 basis point improvement year-over-year. This improvement was driven by strong results in Specialty and Talbot and significant remediation efforts taking hold in property all of which contributed to lower severe loss. International personal insurance performance was in line with expectations with a 70 basis point improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio for the full year driven by personal auto particularly in Japan.","From a top line perspective net premiums written and net premiums earned continued to reflect our disciplined underwriting and reinsurance decisions. Total net premiums written for the full year were $25. one billion a 4% reduction year-over-year excluding foreign exchange. Net premiums earned for the full year were $26.4 billion a 3% reduction year-over-year excluding foreign exchange.","Lastly during 2019 we instilled discipline and focus on expense management across general insurance reducing total operating expenses by over $500 million. The full year expense ratio was 34.4%. Turning to CAT activity. Fourth quarter net CAT losses were $411 million compared to $826 million in the prior year quarter. Typhoon Hagibis was the single largest driver of losses at $233 million of which $155 million was attributable to Validus Re net of the aggregate retrocessional program which responded in line with expectations.","In international personal and commercial insurance where AIG average market share in Japan is 6% in the region's most impacted by 2019 CAT events our reinsurance program responded as expected and limited net losses from Hagibis to $78 million before reinstatement premium. Remaining CAT activity in the fourth quarter included approximately $150 million of net losses from events in North America the largest of which were the Texas tornados and unrest in Chile.","For the full year 2019 total CAT losses were $1.3 billion net of reinsurance recoveries. This compares to CAT losses of $2.9 billion net of reinsurance recoveries in 2018 and $4. two billion net of reinsurance recoveries in 2017. We continue to refine and enhance our reinsurance purchasing strategy as our underwriting actions take hold.","Overall we are pleased with the outcome of the January one renewals. While there are signs of firming in the reinsurance market and significant relationships we established over the last 2.5 years enabled us to achieve favorable renewals of our major treats in line with our expectations. We continue to enhance both the aggregate and current structures for our global property CAT program which provides significant protection against both severity and frequency of events in addition to providing extreme tail protection against events in geographies where we have lower market.","For the 2020 aggregate protection we improved the expiring CAT program by combining the international and North American deductibles into a single worldwide deductible and reducing each and every event deductibles to be more tailored by geography and these enhancements increase the relevance of the aggregate protection particularly with respect to secondary and lesser model perils.","We also purchased two core occurrence towers. One tower covers North America commercial property and the other covers all international property including Japan. As with our expiring 2019 global CAT program the global aggregate protection also provides us with significant additional limit with losses arising from a single large occurrence.","In addition we purchased a separate occurrence tower for our U.S. private client group bifurcating it for North America commercial to have a dedicated tower as part of our initiative with Lloyd's to establish Syndicate 2019 which is focused on our U.S. high net worth business. This was the only substantial new program we entered into on January 1. With respect to property per risk through a combination of the significant reduction in gross limits deployed and enhanced reinsurance purchasing over the last two years we dramatically reduced our net retention to any one property loans.","As a result we renewed our 2020 cover with enhancements that reduced the maximum attaching point from $50 million to $25 million and we reduced our purchases for higher layers as our strategy to reduce gross limits continues to dramatically improve our risk profile. In the aggregate we were able to improve our overall cat reinsurance program including terms and conditions while reducing the overall cost by approximately 7% year-over-year. We will continue to refine and enhance our reinsurance program as the year progresses and expect to finalize syndicate 2019 in the first half of the year.","Turning to the overall rate environment and market conditions; during the fourth quarter we continued to see meaningful acceleration in rate increases and was the strongest quarter of rate improvement that we've seen over the last decade. Overall rate improvement for general insurance excluding Validus and Glatfelter within the low double digits in the fourth quarter and high single digits for the year. I'll give a few examples that provide more color on the rate environment.","North America commercial rates increased in the low double digits to mid-teens in the fourth quarter and high single low double digits for the full year. International commercial rates increased in the low double digits in the fourth quarter and mid- to high single digits for the full year on average across all geographies. North America admitted excess casualty rate increases trend in the mid-40% range in the fourth quarter and energy rates increased approximately 35%. International fourth quarter rate improvements were led by the U. K. where D& O rate increased approached 40% and marine and energy rates increased in the mid-20% range.","Now I'd like to provide additional insight into the progress we're making in certain lines of business and highlight noteworthy accomplishments. I will start with which I've spoken about before and it's a great case study on the disciplined execution of our strategy. 2019 represented the first full year of executing on our decision to be disciplined in underwriting excess and surplus bonds.","We shifted our focus to true E&S business emphasized the wholesale channel and began an effort to improve risk selection and bring better balance to the portfolio. The response from the market has been remarkable and our distribution partners have been very supportive of this reposition. Casualty and property new business with our wholesale partners more than doubled in 2019. In Lexington Casualty fourth quarter and full year 2019 submission volume increased 86% and 70% respectively.","We reduced limits on our most volatile accounts by 67% in the fourth quarter and 61% for the full year while rates increased 28% in the fourth quarter and 21% for the full year. In licensing property fourth quarter and full year 2019 submission volume increased 41% and 48% respectively. We reduced total in force limits by 19% in the fourth quarter and 52% for the full year while rates increased 32% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year. We also increased average deductible by over 50% in 2019.","We expect to see greater underwriting discipline and improving rate environment in the E&S market in the foreseeable future. North America retail property is a great example of bold actions we're executing on. This portfolio has taken more time to reposition because of the number of long-term policies that were in force. In 2019 we reduced total in force gross limits by $40 billion or 17% in the fourth quarter and over and by over $150 billion or 44% for the full year. We increased average deductibles by 21% in the fourth quarter and 31% for the full year.","Rate increases were in excess of 40% in the fourth quarter for both the total portfolio and when excluding the impact of long-term agreements. For the full year total rate increases were 19% and increases excluding the impact of long-term agreements were 25%. As you can see we have dramatically changed this portfolio. And in 2020 we expect to see further improvement in derisking as long-term agreements roll off.","In North America financial lines commercial D&O rates improved nearly 35% in the fourth quarter marking the second consecutive quarter of increases exceeding 30%. On a full year basis we achieved rate increases that exceeded 25%. This improvement was led by public D&O where rate increases were 38% in the fourth quarter and 29% for the full year. We continue to manage our exposure to D&O trends and reduce primary commercial D&O aggregate limits by 40% in the fourth quarter and over 35% for the full year.","Additionally we reduced policies with limits greater than $10 million and lead layers by 50% in the fourth quarter and over 40% for the full year. With respect to international we're very pleased with the performance of our Specialty business led by a significant improvement in our energy portfolio. The improvement in full year adjusted accident year combined ratio was as a result of limit reductions changes to underwriting guidelines and deductibles rate actions and selective class exits.","Finally our global A&H business produced a strong underwriting profit in 2019. We plan to accelerate investment in this growth business while maintaining focus on risk selection and portfolio optimization. General Insurance entered 2020 with great momentum. We will continue to execute on our underwriting and reinsurance strategies to further improve profitability. Next I'd like to spend time on AIG 200 which is our global multiyear effort to focus on the long-term strategic positioning of AIG and a top priority for us in 2020.","As Brian noted this work focuses on transformational change to our infrastructure and underwriting operations as well as developing a new data architecture as we focus on delivering value through scale and simplification. In 2019 we engaged colleagues across AIG for a robust diligent exercise that provided important perspective and insight into how we define who we are as a company how we differentiate ourselves in the global insurance marketplace; how we create value for clients policyholders distribution partners our colleagues and other stakeholders.","We conducted a careful analysis and evaluation of the output from its initial phase of work guided by the four core objectives for AIG 200 achieving underwriting excellence modernizing our operating infrastructure enhancing user and customer experiences and becoming a more unified company. Based on this analysis we identified 10 core operational programs that we will begin to execute on in 2020. We expect these programs will require $1.3 billion of investment over the next three years and deliver $1 billion of run rate benefits by the end of 2022.","We've been carefully planning execution road maps for each of these operational programs with a focus on resource and investment prioritization as well as disciplined execution. Let me provide a brief overview of the 10 operational programs. Three sit within General Insurance; building out a standard commercial underwriting platform enhancing digital workflow in our Japanese business and improving capabilities in private client group.","The standard commercial underwriting platform will modernize our global underwriting capabilities by simplifying and streamlining processes and tools to create a contemporary data architecture. This platform will enable improved underwriting analysis and allow us to drive better risk management pricing and portfolio decisions while improving user experience. With respect to Japan we will transform this business into a next-generation digital insurance company with the ability to offer anywhere anytime any device experience that our customers and agents expect.","To deliver on this digital-first approach we will modernize our underlying technology infrastructure. In our private client group business decision-making will improve primarily through modernizing our legacy technology and moving to digitized workloads.","As a result of this work PCG will be well positioned to offer brokers agents and clients an improved user experience. The other operational programs will transform shared services IT finance procurement and real estate across AIG. With respect to shared services we will expand our existing capabilities on a global basis to create AIG global operations a multifunctional fully integrated operating model digitally enabled end-to-end process and increased scope and scale. Our goal for AIG global operations a strong culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement that also unifies the company and delivers best-in-class capabilities.","In IT where we have two work streams we will transform the operating model to function itself and build a modern scalable and secure technology foundation to improve operational stability and enable faster business technology deployment. The key components of this program focused on materially eliminating legacy technology debt simplifying our business application portfolio and strategically moving to cloud services.","In finance where we also have two work streams we will transform the operating model of the function itself and modernize our infrastructure through technology solutions and simplified financing processes while materially improving our analytics capabilities. In procurement we are creating a highly efficient global procurement and sourcing organization to leverage our purchasing power maximize value minimize risk and support continuous and sustained profitable growth for AIG.","Lastly we're optimizing and consolidating AIG's real estate portfolio to ensure it is cost effective resilient and reflective of our global footprint. Each of these programs is complex and will require disciplined execution. In the end this work will materially improve how we do business and strategically position AIG to become a top-performing company. We will be fully transparent about the execution of AIG 200 and will provide quarterly updates on our progress.","Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin. ","Kevin Hogan","Thank you Peter and good morning everyone. Today I will discuss our full year results and outlook for 2020 and then briefly comment on our results for the fourth quarter. Life and Retirement recorded adjusted pretax income of $3.46 billion for the full year and delivered adjusted return on attributed common equity at 13.7%.","Adjusted pretax income increased by $268 million from the prior year. Solid underlying results were further supported by capital markets conditions and their effect on both assets and liabilities. Impacts from accretive equity market returns increased by $244 million including higher fee income lower deferred acquisition cost amortization and higher returns on alternative investments. Short-term positive impacts from lower interest rates and credit spreads increased by $154 million including higher returns on fair value option securities and gains on calls.","Our earnings also benefited from higher assets due to new business growth. These positive impacts were partially offset by a further impact from spread compression of approximately $112 million or seven basis points annually and investments to enhance our operating platforms. As to our top line 2019 was a good example of our strategy to accelerate or moderate new business depending on relative returns.","With very favorable pricing conditions during the first quarter we deployed significant capital in individual retirement and produced robust new business volume at attractive margins. As rates and spreads declined over the remaining three quarters we adjusted our pricing and reduced individual annuity sales levels as our view of margins became less attractive. At the same time we achieved record year for new group acquisitions and group retirement and continued to grow international sales for our life insurance business and focused on consistent profitable growth in institutional markets.","Looking ahead to full year 2020 we expect adjusted pretax income to be more in line with our 2018 results. These expectations assume equity market returns of 6. 5% and 10-year treasury rates around 1.7%. To give you an idea of market sensitivity of our adjusted earnings including impact of both assets and liabilities a 1% decrease in equity market returns would decreased adjusted pretax income by approximately $30 million to $40 million annually and there would be a corresponding increase in earnings from a 1% increase in equity market returns.","A 10 basis points decrease in 10-year treasury rates would decrease earnings by approximately $5 million to $15 million annually and there would be a corresponding increase in earnings from a 10 basis points increase in treasury rates. It is important to note that these market sensitivity ranges are not exact or linear since our earnings were also impacted by the timing and degree of interest rate movements as well as credit spreads and other factors.","Based on our interest rate level assumptions our expectation for full year 2020 is for base investment spreads across the whole portfolio to decline by approximately eight to 16 basis points annually with the middle of the range resulting in a headwind of approximately $200 million. Based on our expectations for rates and spreads we expect negative net flows for group retirement and individual retirement for the year with decreased levels of individual annuity sales particularly in fixed annuities.","Finally from a statutory perspective we expect to continue to generate solid earnings and maintain strong capitalization and broad operating entities. Now I will briefly discuss our results for the fourth quarter. Life and Retirement reported adjusted pretax income of $839 million for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income increased by $216 million from the prior year quarter. Impacts from accretive equity market returns increased by $176 million and short-term positive impacts from lower interest rates and credit spreads increased by $46 million.","These positive impacts were partially offset by spread compression and previously mentioned investments to enhance our operating platforms. Our Individual Retirement premiums and deposits decreased primarily due to lower fixed annuity sales reflecting low rates and reducing credit spreads. Lower sales resulted in decreased net flows for total individual annuities while total assets under administration grew driven by strong equity market performance and higher annuity net flows in the first half of the year.","For Group Retirement premiums and deposits increased by 10% from the prior year quarter driven by strong new group acquisition results. Net flows were below the prior year quarter due to higher group's Despite facing negative net flows for a period of time we've continued to produce solid earnings for this business as assets under administration have continued to grow.","For our Life Insurance business total premiums and deposits increased due to higher international sales. Our U.S. life sales declined as we continued to deemphasize guaranteed universal life sales in the current interest rate environment and indexed universal life sales remained under pressure. Lastly our overall mortality returned to trend and was once again favorable making this 10 out of the last 12 quarters where mortality was either at or favorable to pricing assumptions.","For institutional markets we have continued to grow our asset base and earnings and the business continues to be well positioned to capitalize on available growth while remaining focused on achieving targeted returns. Deposits decreased due to robust pension risk transfer activity in the fourth quarter of last year. Across our businesses we are continuing to invest as needed to prepare for the evolving regulatory and accounting landscape and to leverage these ongoing investments to further improve our efficiency and competitive position.","We are pleased with the comprehensive retirement reform provided by the passage of the Secure Act. In addition to the expected outcome of increasing the availability of income solutions for participants in defined contribution plans we believe that it will ultimately enhance the overall education and awareness of the need for protected lifetime income as part of a comprehensive diversified retirement plan. For our Group Retirement business we are evaluating several unique lifetime income options.","Other benefits of the Secure Act include raising the age for required minimum distributions 72 and eliminating the age limit for contributions to IRAs of which present opportunities for both our Group Retirement and Individual Retirement businesses. To close we remain committed to our ongoing strategy to leverage our broad product expertise and distribution footprint to deploy capital to the most attractive opportunities which we believe positions us well to help meet growing needs for protection retirement savings and lifetime income solutions.","Now I will turn it over to Mark.","Mark Lyons","Thank you, Kevin and good morning all. AIG's adjusted after-tax earnings per share was $1.03 in the fourth quarter compared to a negative $0. 63 per share in the prior quarter. AIG had adjusted pretax income of $1. two billion and adjusted after-tax income of $919 million for the fourth quarter. And for the full year adjusted after-tax earnings were approximately $4.1 billion or $4.59 per diluted share representing a $3.42 per share improvement over 2018.","Adjusted book value per share which excludes AOCI and DTA was $58.89 an increase of 2.2% from third quarter and 7.2% relative to year-end 2018. Return on adjusted common equity or ROCE was an annualized 7.3% for the quarter and 8.3% for the full year driven by General Insurance at 9% for the full year and Life and Retirement at 13.7% for the full year.","An important driver of earnings and ROCE improvements in the fourth quarter was our net investment income or NII which was $3. five billion on an adjusted pretax income basis almost the same as the third quarter of 2019 reflecting higher alternative investment income and prepayments and bond calls.","NII on an adjusted pretax income basis was up $649 million for the fourth quarter 2018 which was negatively impacted by higher rates lower equity markets and negative returns on alternatives last year. On a full year basis 2019 NII was nearly $14.4 billion on an adjusted pretax income basis well above our original expectations and up $1.7 billion from 2018 due to strong alternative returns impacted of lower rates and credit spreads on fair value option bonds and equity markets offset in part by the impact lower reinvestment rates.","Legacy contributed $2.5 billion of NII in 2019. I want to call your attention to additional investment income information on Page 46 of the financial comparables which provides information on the drivers of NII for both GI and Life and Retirement. This should help you refine your models including the impact of continued low rates on margins in L&R and elsewhere. I'll discuss our 2020 outlook later in my remarks.","Turning to General Insurance, the segment produced an underwriting profit with the calendar quarter combined ratio of 99.8% and current accident quarter excluding CAT combined ratio of 95.8%. The calendar quarter underwriting income was $12 million an increase of nearly $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter of 2018 with North America contributing $852 million of improvement and international operations contributing $231 million of improved. Also both commercial and personal lines including their exciting quarter underwriting margins in the fourth quarter versus the prior year quarter.","Moreover each reportable segment also saw improvements for the full accident year 2019 over 2018 both in North America and international commercial lines and personal lines. The full 2019 accident year combined ratio improved 370 basis points relative to 2018 and as Peter mentioned with a 240 basis point improvement in the loss ratio a 140 basis point reduction in the GEO ratio partially offset by a marginal 10 basis point increase in acquisition ratio.","Additionally as Peter referenced crop results for the year negatively impacted the full global 2019 accident year by a half loss ratio for it at a global level. It's also important to note that this improvement in the loss ratio represents the benefits from all the underwritten actions taken in 2018 and 2019 and 2020 and beyond should begin to see additional improvements finer points adjustments filter through our financial results.","The net CAT ratio for the fourth quarter was 6.5% versus 11.3% of fourth quarter 2018 despite a high level of gross CATs in both quarters as the combination of lost line reunderwriting together with the improved reinsurance program continues to reduce the general insurance net CAT ratio. Both quarters have losses from California wildfires in Japanese typhoons but our aggregate reinsurance program reduced our net exposure consistent with our commentary on the third quarter call.","Turning to prior year development or PYD as in prior quarters we'd like to unpack that for you. The reported $153 million of favorable development includes $58 million of favorable amortization from the ADC deferred gains or adverse development coverage preferred gains resulting in $95 million of favorable development excluding that influence which is on a post-ADC recoverable basis.","On a pre-ADC basis we had $118 million of favorable development with 2017 CAT rate leases and wildfire subrogation producing approximately $290 million of favorable development. Global Specialty providing $70 million of favorable development. $60 million of favorable development in international personal lines. $5 million of favorable development in U.S. primary casualty lines which include general liability and workers compensation and approximately $13 million from various other units.","On the other side we had unfavorable pre-ADC development of approximately $320 million stemming from our U.S. financial lines book. This unfavorable development emanates primarily from our private not-for-profit D&O book which represents about $130 million unfavorable and the mergers and acquisitions book which represented roughly $90 million of unfavorable. Other areas largely represented fine-tuning.","As Fidelity had $39 million unfavorable public primary and excess D&O to roughly $35 million unfavorable $16 million in cyber and $7 million unfavorable and this represented roughly a $210 million unfavorable on a post ADC basis which indicates that the strengthening was that the strengthening was mostly centered in accident years 2016 through 2018.","On a full year pre-ADC basis the company enjoyed $341 million of favorable development led by workers' compensation personal lines global specialty and commercial short-tail line with unfavorable development on the annual basis emanating from financial lines as just discussed and some in excess casualty. On an accident year and post-ADC basis and as shown in the financial supplement accident year 2018 increased by one loss ratio point over the year. The 2017 accident year decreased by 0.6 loss ratio points and accident year 2016 remained flat.","We reviewed the roll forward potential and the impact of accident year 2019 but it would not be material in some segments somewhat improved and others somewhat worse. Peter discussed the rate increases being achieved throughout General Insurance. And although they bode well towards 2020 the uptick in U.S. social inflation together with an increasing proportion of litigated claims and increased securities class action filings may cause slower recognition of any arithmetically implied margin expansion.","The book has undergone massively underwriting. So our historical experience is only moderately useful projecting forward. Given the changes in the external economic and legal climate coupled with AIG's material underwriting changes it's prudent and best practices that let the loss experience emerge for any accident year 2020 adjustments are contemplated.","Turning to the Life and Retirement segment, adjusted pretax income is nearly $3.5 billion. As Kevin noted an increase of $268 million in 2018. For the quarter adjusted pretax income was $839 million up $260 million over fourth quarter 2018 helped along in part by higher equity level. Premiums and deposits decreased 3.6% on a full year basis as we continued to be prudent on product pricing in this environment.","Regarding spread compression individual retirement variable and indexed annuities combined base net investment spreads fell off 28 basis points for 2019 versus last year whereas individual retirement fixed annuities base investment spreads fell off just nine basis points for 2019 versus 2018. On the group retirement side base net investment spreads actually increased four basis points versus last year.","Regarding net flows on a full year basis individual retirement across all products combined had negative net flows although these were cut in half relative to last year. Fixed annuities materially reduced their net outflow. Variable annuities were similar to last year. Whereas indexed annuities continue to exhibit material strength with positive net flows of $4.7 billion for the year. And retail mutual funds had a similar level of net negative outlook.","As respect, surrender rates for the year fixed annuities were 90 basis points lower than 2018 whereas the composite of variable and fixed annuity rates were effectively flat. On the Group Retirement side net flows were negative but marginally better than 2018 and the surrender rate decreased 60 basis points on a full year basis. Additionally as a measure of future earnings power assets under administration grew 14.5% during 2019 with similar growth experienced by both individual and group retirement.","The Life segment grew life insurance in force by nearly 10% during the year aided by the growth in international life. Institutional markets had $45 million more in adjusted pretax income with premiums and deposits double in 2019 and the pension were transfer space with guaranteed investment contracts down in volume.","As Kevin discussed the combination of reinvestment yields including low rates and tight spreads and minimum crediting rate pressure on 2019 earnings which were offset in part by very strong alternative returns including a large gain on a private equity investment as previously discussed.","Turning to Legacy, adjusted pretax income was $177 million compared with the fourth quarter 2018 loss which has reflected a $105 million charge from loss recognition on accident and health cancer and disability blocks. Legacy NII on a full year basis with nearly $2.5 billion slightly higher than last year and the annualized recurring on distributed common equity was 5.4% for the year driven by $501 million of adjusted pretax income.","As a reminder, legacy is largely driven by And in November we announced the agreement to sell with 76.6% interest in Fortitude which we expect to close mid-year subject to regulatory approval. With respect to tax the final effective tax rate was 22.1% for 2019 applicable to adjusted pretax income and 19.3% for the quarter inclusive of discrete items, which also includes a nine-month $14 million catch-up adjustment to reflect the lower full year tax rate.","As you know effective tax rates are updated each quarter using actually results remaining quarters are forecasted and integrated. And as always the tax rate is heavily influenced each quarter by the geographic distribution of income by tax jurisdiction. We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter so our Board authorization remains at $2 billion.","Moving to leverage, as compared to year-end 2018 our total debt and deferred to total capital ratio improved 310 basis points to 26.2% at the year-end 2019. Adjusted book value per share increased 7.2% from year-end 2018 and GAAP book value per share increased 15.2% since the year-end 2018 benefiting from approximately $6.4 billion of AOCI gains during the year.","Now I'd like to pivot providing some information on our outlook for 2020 all on an adjusted pretax income basis. First however recall that 2019 has very strong profit that aren't expected to recur in 2020. Net investment income or NII is a key example. The excess returns of our alternative portfolio together with credit compression not expected to repeat in 2020 together NII forecast for 2020.","NII is expected to be nearly $13.6 billion on a full year basis which represents an approximate 4.3% yield on investable assets with an associated range of plus or minus 25 basis points. The 2020 NII by segment from a point estimate perspective is expected to be $3.2 billion for General Insurance $8.2 billion for Life and Retirement and $2.2 billion for Legacy on the basis that order stays with AIG all year both the 100% level.","General Insurance is expected to achieve $45 billion for 2020 net written premiums virtually flat with 2019. And therefore a similar 2020 net earned premium outlook. However given what Peter discussed about the evolving structure of Syndicate 2019 our forecast for net written premium may decrease as this structure is finalized. We will provide an update on Syndicate 2019 on our first quarter call.","Moving on to underwriting profitability, the accident year combined ratio for 2020 is expected to be in the range of 93.8% to 94.8% ex CAT. Life and Retirement is expected to have adjusted pretax income between $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion for 2020 which is a level comparable to 2018. Legacy on a full year basis is expected to provide of roughly $100 million to $120 million.","Other operations -- well beginning with the first quarter 2020 we're going to provide more clarity and insight into other operations. However in total we expect that the adjusted pretax income for 2020 to be between $60 million to $75 million lower than 2019 meaning a bigger negative. This represents an amalgam of consolidation and elimination entry interest expense on direct AIG debt as well as interest on debt within consolidated investment entities blackboard and both GOE and other income that in some cases grossed up for internal service charge backs.","We've now given you the aggregate expected financial impact but this highlights the need to provide increased visibility into the components that we will do so. As Peter noted with respect to AIG 200 and we expect to invest $1.3 billion over the next three years and to realize a $1 billion of run rate GOE savings as we exit 2022. The anticipated impact to adjusted pretax income in 2020 is a $150 million APTI gain with roughly 75% of this to be reflected in general insurance with the balance evenly split between Life and Retirement and other operations.","Run rate GOE savings are expected to be on a cumulative basis $300 million $600 million and $1 billion in 2022 through 2020 through 2022. We currently estimate roughly $400 million of the $1.3 billion cost to achieve being capitalized as the assets are put into service. We anticipate establishing a restructuring charge in the first quarter and we'll provide more details at that time.","Regarding capital management and associated liquidity our options are primarily directed towards debt reduction and expected IRS payment of approximately $1.7 billion in the first half of 2020. AIG 200's $1.3 billion of investment beginning in 2020 and other possibilities to invest back into our core businesses. As for share repurchases we continually evaluate that option but we'll wait until the Fortitude sale of close review more fully. Lastly we expect to make additional progress reducing our year-end debt and preferred to total capital ratio lower than the current 26.2%.","And with that I'll turn it back over to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Thanks Mark. We had a lot of content. So we'll go to questions, but we'll stay on past 9:00 to take as many questions as we can. Can we start then operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Meyer Shields at KBW.","Meyer Shields","Two really quick questions. First in the accident year loss ratio excluding profit are there any other adjustments to the full year numbers to full year 2019 numbers? ","Brian Duperreault","From a full year aggregate it's nothing material. ","Meyer Shields","Okay perfect. And when we look forward I'm wondering how the planned reduction in earnings volatility aligns with what we see as much better pricing in the markets in particular as far as do we expect more exposure on a year-over-year basis capacity losses or recovery? ","Brian Duperreault","So it's really a question around retro's increasing costs. I guess Peter can answer that question. I think we've gone to our market with our reinsurance program you heard Peter describe it. So for 2020 I think we've established what the cost will be for us. But Peter do you want to answer that. ","Peter Zaffino","Yes. So thanks Meyer. Yes the retro costs have increased and I think it will be a little bit different than last year because believe as we enter into the April one and June one renewal dates for Japan and respectively we're going to see meaningful rate increases on same structures. And so while the reinsurance market has seen increased retro cost.","I believe that the reinsurance cost will be able to bear that cost in terms of how we are going to reinsure different portfolios. And we are not taking a lot more volatility in the portfolio. In other words because of the retro costs we're not looking to take a lot more net but consistent with our overall strategy on volatility and risk retention.","You might talk about that. Just a second. So in terms of Validus yes that's what I referring more on April one and June one they ought to be able to position themselves in the marketplace. But we're not looking to grow and take on more CAT exposure on a net basis throughout 2020.","Operator","Move next to Jimmy Bhullar at JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","Had one question on guidance and then also on Life and Retirement. On guidance you gave a lot of details on expectations for the year on margins and stuff. I don't know if you mentioned anything on the tax rate and also on sort of what type of capital you expect for the year if there is such a thing as a normal CAT load? ","Brian Duperreault","Mark?","Mark Lyons","Yes thanks for the question. No we gave guidance on an adjusted pretax basis at this point. And... ","Jimmy Bhullar","My point is what do you expect the tax rate to be if you are because it was very low in the fourth quarter and relatively low in 2019 as a whole? ","Mark Lyons","Yes. Actually the guidance around that is pretty similar to what we said last year so 22 23. And the gap question... ","Brian Duperreault","CAT load?","Mark Lyons","Oh well CAT load. I'm really glad you asked this question because you may recall that I think in the middle of the year we said we're going to start looking at this like every other company which is looking at return periods and looking at it on OEP and an AEP basis 10-K that will be coming out we'll provide that information for you. But AALs that we're getting away from we don't manage the company that way. We manage it on the return-period basis. And I'll leave with that. ","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then on the Life and Retirement business your spread declined more than I think the guidance you had given earlier this year around two to three basis points a quarter in both individual and group retirement so is it just rates that that's driving this or is it competition or flexibility to comment on what's really driving that deterioration spread? ","Brian Duperreault","Yes sure Jimmy thanks. There is a little bit of noise in the spread movement third quarter to fourth quarter and year-over-year. And frankly it's relative to just some of the specifics of the market conditions through the quarters. And plus the year-over-year trend is really I think much more relevant.","And so based on the environment that we're expecting we're sort of looking on an annualized basis at an eight to 16 basis points compression which is a little bit of an increase based on what we had before. But on the entire year basis our compression in 2019 was seven basis points collectively.","So I think that we're seeing a little bit of compression. It's largely within what we expected certainly market conditions are very challenging right now. There was a little bit of noise third quarter to fourth quarter but no impact on trend as far as we're concerned. And maybe most importantly we are still seeing very attractive spreads available. ","Operator","We'll go next to Tom Gallagher at Evercore.","Tom Gallagher","Just first question on the expense side. The restructuring charge that's coming in 1Q Mark that you referenced is that likely to be most of the or a sizable portion of the $1.3 billion investment? Are you going to take that all upfront? Or is that going to be far more modest? And how should we think about charge will charges be below the line or included in operating as you record some of these? ","Mark Lyons","Well yes good questions. Some of that will be giving you chapter when we go on our first quarter call as we alluded to. But you're going to have a mixture so what's above and below the line. You've then we'll give you all that detail. And as far as whether it's the major part of the restructuring are of the total cost of investment it's not going to be the major but we'll give you the details on that again in 1Q. ","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then just a follow-up sorry just a follow-up on Kevin for investment spreads. I just want to be clear I know what the message is here. I heard the year-over-year comment on spreads. Do you expect spreads to be down versus the 4Q level because it was kind of a sharp drop in 4Q would you expect them to be more stable versus 4Q or still compressed from 4Q levels? ","Kevin Hogan","Well I think that obviously it does depend on what the specifics of each quarter-to-quarter movements are. But we would expect spreads comparable to largely comparable to where we were at the 4Q depending upon ultimately the market conditions. There was a little bit of movement sort of the 3Q or the 4Q as a result of certain characteristics of the investments Tom.","Operator","We'll go next to Yaron Kinar at Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","My first question goes to the 10% adjusted ROCE target by the end of 2021. Does that incorporate sale of the majority stake in Fortitude Re and maybe the impact on from CECL? And if it does maybe you could help us think about the from the sale of Fortitude Re?","Brian Duperreault","So let me take it and then Mark and it in. So when I gave you that target some time ago we had not contemplated the sale. Of Fortitude. And so we believe that then now we have a fortitude sale impending expected it would close midyear. That helps that number but that number we believe was achievable in the case. But I'll let Mark talk about the rest of the stuff CECL. So yes thank you.","First off yes it contemplates both. So it contemplates the CECL which will have a shareholders heavily coming into the year for regulations. We had guided you last quarter that that was about $645 million. You'll see in our K that comes out the actual number but it's not materially different from that. So yes to that and as far as Fortitude it's all in. So the difficulty is that it's two things.","One we estimate closing. We don't know exactly when closing is. And we've been around long enough to those down. And secondly the interest rate environment will be fairly material to the ultimate impact of what it will do to book equity. So it's fairly hard to predict. But yes we're anticipating that's all in. ","Yaron Kinar","And then my second question is around the GOE cost-saving targets of the are those gross or not? ","Brian Duperreault","Mark?","Mark Lyons","What's your definition of that gross or net? ","Yaron Kinar","Well I guess do you expect the I'm sorry. ","Brian Duperreault","Okay. So just for clarifying. So the if I go back to the comments from 2020 to 2021 it was $300 million $600 million $1 billion pure GOE. But that if you mean tax that's goes to tax. ","Yaron Kinar","It sounds like you would expect a certain portion of that to be reinvested back in the business? ","Brian Duperreault","Well, so that's part of our conversation back in the first quarter when we laid things out. But Peter talked about the $1.3 billion of investment and that's going to be reflected. There's cash assets there's putting capitalized assets into service and the timing of those when they're ready and they depreciate that type. There's a lot of moving parts. So I don't mean to be vague but there's a lot of moving parts and we'll get back to you in the first quarter. ","Operator","We'll go next to Elyse Greenspan at Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question you guys still seeing your premiums drop in the fourth quarter and it sounds like you expect them to be flat in 2020 yet you're getting a real good amount of rate and it sounds like there wasn't that much material changes to your reinsurance purchases for 2020. So I'm just trying to understand can you give us a sense of what businesses you're still shedding? And how business mix is offsetting some of the impact of rate as we still look at kind of a flat premiums written in 2020? ","Brian Duperreault","Okay. We'll start Peter ","Peter Zaffino","Yes. Thanks Elyse. I mean I think it's going to be consistent but just a little bit more tailing off in 2020 when you compare it to 2019 which is going to be gross underwriting actions that continue. I talked a little bit about long-term agreements rolling off. It's a big part of our reunderwriting in the first quarter property. We're still working through the Lexington. And even those statistics are daunting for us in terms of the improvement of the portfolio and the repositioning that still is going to be work that's going to be done.","And then also the reinsurance think about the casualty quota share which was something that we felt really mitigated volatility. We entered into that in 2019 but that continues in 2020. So some of the discrete reinsurance purchases will have an impact on net premiums written not to the same extent it did in 2019 but certainly we'll carry over into '20 okay. And then my second question Mark... ","Brian Duperreault","Let me just add something here. When we started this turnaround so what do we basically we had businesses that were had limits that way. We weren't getting we had concentrations of risk where you just couldn't keep that concentration and we're taking it all net and we were getting price paid anything. So you start we've cut volatility out of this company by taking the limits down that takes premium out of the pit.","We raised retentions that takes premium out of the pipe. Yes we've that takes premium out of the pipe. Yes we've raised rates. We've also bought reinsurance premiums out of pod. So we have not been concentrating on the top line because we had to concentrate on the bottom line. That's so once you get a base that you believe is sustainable then you grow it. And so we want to grow the business but we're going to concentrate on making sure this portfolio is rock solid. That's the number one priority. Okay Elyse you got another question?","Elyse Greenspan","Yes. And then my second question Mark in your guidance commentary you pointed to an accident year combined ratio of 93.8% to 94.8% in General Insurance. I recognize some of the expense figures you gave or exit run rates of $300 million for 2020 but if I kind of do some rough math it seems like of that improvement that you'll see over the next 12 months about half should come from the underlying loss ratio and half on the expense ratio does that feel about right given the expense program and the guidance you laid out? ","Mark Lyons","Well I'd say probably skewed more and more to the loss ratio. And as we go from '20 to '21 you see probably see that flip a degree of improvement.","Operator","We'll go next to Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. ","Erik Bass","And I appreciate the additional guidance details. Just wanted to ask a bigger picture question if you could help us kind of bridge the gap to the 10% ROE by year-end '21 or it seems relative to 2019 life and retirement facing a little bit of pressure. So can you help us just think about the contribution from GI margin expansion in AIG 200 to get there? And are there any other major moving pieces to consider? ","Brian Duperreault","Go ahead Mark. ","Mark Lyons","Well to get I guess a couple of things you guys to think about is I think as I tried to lay out the 8.3% return in calendar 2019 had some extraordinary gains in it. So if you normalize for that and things of that nature. It's not quite the same. I also think in the prior quarter I've mentioned that get to 10% is not linear that we would expect more in the back half than the first half of that.","We have great expansion in GI on expected underwriting gain and although it a stronger marketplace environment. It's also a radically modified portfolio. So by the time 2021 we'll have a little more back of the window view of what 2020 looks like. And if we were lucky enough that the environment continues that's a great tailwind to help us out. AIG 200 is going to also help along the lines we just mentioned. So there should be incrementally better contributions from AIG 200 each year through 2021. ","Brian Duperreault","Stable in this environment. Maybe the ROEs have come down a little bit as we discussed. But we'd expect L&R to be stable and it wheels around the GI improvements it's loss ratio now. AIG 200 kicks in it will be expense ratios coming later. ","Erik Bass","Got it. And then just one follow-up on Life and Retirement guidance. I think you talked about $200 million or so drag from spread compression but based on the sensitivity Kevin that you gave on the equity markets I would think you would see some of that or much of it offset given the gains we saw last year. So are there other pieces to factor in that would kind of get you to the lower earnings next year? ","Peter Zaffino","Well Erik as I pointed out I mean our assumptions are for from the starting point of the year 6.5% on the equity markets. And that the 10-year will be around 1.7 and the sensitivities that we gave were relative to those assumptions. ","Operator","We'll move next to Brian Meredith at UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yes just two for me here quickly. On the GOE is some of that on the AIG 200 is some of that going to come from loss adjustment expenses? And then maybe you can frame it a little bit how much kind of corporate versus general insurance? ","Brian Duperreault","Peter do you want to take that?","Peter Zaffino","Yes. So now we do not contemplate an AIG 200 the loss adjustment expense Brian. And then in terms of the way we framed out the program. I think if I understand your question correctly Mark put it into his prepared remarks which is basically three quarters of it will come through General Insurance over the of it will come through General Insurance over the program and then the other quarter will come into Life Retirement and Corporate. And again in terms of the sequencing of that I think it will be fairly consistent throughout the three years. ","Mark Lyons","And then my second one just a little clarification and sorry to kind of go on this one, but if I look at your ROE in 2022 when we come out here. We know that legacy is going to cause call it over $3 billion hit to your equity. When we take a look at that return on equity will if I add back that $3.5 billion of equity while we still have a double-digit return on equity in 2022? ","Brian Duperreault","I'll take that one. I have two things that are kind of countervailing actually three things come to mind. First off when we originally said the 10% we had a completely different investment environment investment outlook. So from that point of view having the Fortitude sale the impact on that is very helpful to offset some of the investment income outlook differences.","And the other thing is the $3 billion number that's approximately that you talked about that's the impact on the impact from consolidation as opposed to the impact from sales an impact from sale is subfunction of whatever the market conditions are going to be on the day of closing. So it's pretty hard to come stay too hard to predict. I know it's complicated. Hopefully that helps. ","Operator","We'll take question from Suneet Kamath from Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Just a follow-up on Brian's question on the equity. As we think about kind of the half to the 10%. Is there a capital return or share buyback expectation that's built into that guidance? I know you talked about delevering but just want to get a sense of what we should think about in terms of getting that? ","Brian Duperreault","Well we're both looking at each other. Mark and I and I'd say look we'd expect that as we manage our capital we told you what our priorities are for this year. We're going to look at once we do close the fortitude we will relook at share buybacks which is probably about the second half of the year. It's still a management tool. We have an authorization so it's certainly possible.","Suneet Kamath","And then my follow-up is just on the first quarter call you mentioned a couple of times we're going to get some more detail. Can you just maybe give us a sense of what you're planning on disclosing in terms of AIG 200 in the first quarter call just the pieces? ","Brian Duperreault","Okay. Mark you want to go back over that back and forth? ","Mark Lyons","Yes I think what we're going to try to do in the first quarter is just give you a little bit more clarity on the sequencing. And so while we have 10 initiatives and they'll largely be launched in the first quarter there will be sequencing in terms of where we start. And giving you a little bit more insight as to how that program progresses. And then I think that will tie to where Mark said before which is what type of expense needs to be deployed with that sequencing to match expenditures and getting after this launch.","And so I think we'll be able to give you a little more clarity as to what you should expect on each of the programs and what it looks like for the rest of 2020. And I'll just -- Peter's comments. Do probably what you're inferring is someone else had add a lot more clarity on maybe perhaps the timing of capital being put in service you canalizing being put in service but clearly above and below the line aspect. So that will all be laid out.","Brian Duperreault","Okay. Thank you very much. Let me appreciate your staying a little longer and all the intention. I just want to make one last comment and that is that as I said at the beginning of the call I'm really pleased that we delivered a on our 2019 commitments and we ended the year strong with great for the support we received from the industry partners and their clients.","And we're really optimistic about what the future holds for AIG but last and certainly not least I want to thank our colleagues across the globe the resiliency they've shown over the last couple of years is tremendous and I'm proud to lead a group of such talent professionals who continue to go above and beyond to make AIG a better stronger company. So thank you all and have a good day.","Operator","And that does conclude today's And that does conclude today's conference.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Liz Werner","Thank you, and good morning everyone. Before we get started this morning, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events.","Actual performance and events may differ, possibly materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause this include the factors described in our first quarter Form 10-Q and our 2013 Form 10-K, under management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under risk factors. AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","Today\u2019s presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement, which is available on our website, www.aig.com.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our senior management team and we\u2019ll begin with comments from Bob Benmosche. ","Bob Benmosche","Thanks, Liz, and good morning to everybody. I want to start with ILFC, comment on the 8-K we filed yesterday and that is all regulatory approvals have now been received and so we\u2019re very confident that this transaction will in fact close in the second quarter as we\u2019ve talked to you previously. So that\u2019s a good -- for the company going forward. If you look at the quarter, you can see that our capital management continues to proceed and were measured by buyback shares and continuing to reduce our debt which obviously improves our coverage ratio.","Our property casualty had its second best quarter in the last 12 quarters. Unfortunately the best quarter was the first quarter of last year. So we\u2019re comparing the second best quarter to the best quarter. So you see some of it decline. However, if you look at the accident year loss ratios and the other fundamentals, that business is continuing to build a very strong foundations for the future.","Our mortgage guarantee business continues to do well with 62% of its premium now coming from our new underwriting capability which really gives us high degree of confidence that, if the market go soft in the future and I know maybe we\u2019ll never see another soft market in housing but if that day comes we\u2019re confident we have a very strong profile of risks we\u2019ve taken on a book and mortgage guarantee.","And life and retirement continues to show very strong premiums in deposits, $7.1 billion for the quarter, but also very strong in net flow. So it\u2019s not only what\u2019s coming in, it\u2019s what we\u2019re retaining. And so that business really is hitting on all cylinders.","So what I\u2019d like to do is turn it over to David who will take you through the financials.","David Herzog","Thank you Bob, and good morning everyone. As we disclosed yesterday in the 8-K that Bob referenced, we\u2019ve now received all regulatory approvals required with respect to the sale of ILFC to AerCap. We do expect the transaction to close in the second quarter and again, subject to satisfaction of customary posing conditions.","Upon closing, we expect receive approximately $2.4 billion of cash that is net of intercompany settlements plus 97.6 million shares of AerCap stock, all of which will be held at the parent holding company and subject to lock up another transfer provision. In the second quarter, we will update our stress test, our liquidity forecast as well as our annual capital plan and we\u2019ll discuss all of these with the rating agencies, the Federal Reserves and our Board of Directors to access what actions we will take.","Now, turning to our financials on Slide 4. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.8 billion with operating earnings per share of a $21. Our operating return on equity was 7.5%, since our earnings, our tax affected we are not paying tax to the U.S. government given our NOLs, our operating ROE excluding the DTA from average equity was about 180 basis points higher or about 9.3%. Book value per share excluding AOCI at the end of the quarter was $65.49, 10% higher than it was in the first quarter of 2013.","Our operating results begin on Slide 5. Peter and Jay will cover their respective businesses following my remarks. The direct investment book for the DIB delivered another solid quarter with over $400 million of operating earnings, reflecting the mark-to-market appreciation. That can create some volatility from period to period. As we had gains also from unwinding certain of our positions, we continue to expect these earnings to moderate overtime as the portfolio winds down and the investments approach their expected recovery values.","In addition, we may from time to time repackage certain of the DIB assets to be held at the parent company or in our operating companies. We continue to proactively and opportunistically reduce the DIB\u2019s footprint. In fact in the first quarter we settled the $2.2 billion of redemptions and repurchases previously announced, as well as initiated the make whole call for the March 2015 maturities, which was completed yesterday. We used cash allocated for the DIB and global capital markets that was set aside exactly for that purpose. At the end of the first quarter we had $7.9 billion of net asset value in the DIB and global capital markets. We expect this capital to be released to the parent over time as the maturities, the liabilities and the underlying assets and derivatives are monetized and settled.","Corporate expenses totaled approximately $243 million in the quarter, in line with our expectation of $225 million, $250 million quarterly run rate for 2014 and they were down from a year ago as expected. Our reported operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.7%, also in line with our outlook for 2014. Our strong capital position as of the end of the quarter is set forth on Slide 6.","Our capital structure remains straight forward and our leverage remains low. As I mentioned last quarter we made good progress on our coverage ratios which remains an area of focus for us that we continue to work on through opportunistic debt capital management and improving the earnings profile including the earnings profile of our core businesses.","From this strong capital position we distributed $182 million in dividends to our shareholders and deployed $867 million towards the repurchase of approximately 17.4 million shares of common stock, leaving roughly 537 million remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. We were opportunistic and orderly in our share repurchase activity.","We received dividends and loan repayments from life and retirement of about $1.7 billion during the quarter as shown on Slide 7. Included in this amount is roughly $300 million related to sub-prime. Property casualty is also on track to deliver its full year targeted dividend payments, although none was expected in the first quarter. We continue to expect $5 billion to $6 billion in dividends and distributions from our insurance subsidiaries this year.","In addition to these dividends and distributions we received tax sharing payments of about 300 million in the first quarter. We continue to expect to receive approximately $1 billion of tax sharing payments in 2014 and roughly 2 billion in 2015, as this comes from our insurance companies and they continue to utilize their DTAs. These dividends and tax sharing payments, combined with our capital management activity that I mentioned earlier resulted in parent cash, short-term investments and unencumbered securities of $11.2 billion as of the end of the quarter. Included in parental liquidity is 4.4 billion related to the DIB and global capital markets which is allocated for its future debt maturities and contingent liquidity stress needs. As we\u2019ve indicated in the past, nearly 80% of the DIB\u2019s debt matures by the end of 2018.","So with I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Peter for comments on property casualty.","Peter Hancock","","Thank you David and good morning everybody. Property casualty\u2019s first quarter results reflected our continued focus on underwriting discipline and risk selection. While we don\u2019t look at any one quarter as a trend, this was our second highest quarter of pretax operating income over the past three years. Our strategic initiatives and outlook remain unchanged and we continue to focus on driving profitable growth and increasing returns.","Turning to Slide 8; AIG Property Casualty reported first quarter operating income of $1.2 billion. Net premiums written grew 3% from a year ago excluding the effect of foreign exchange. We experienced strong new business growth across the majority of our commercial lines. However casualty written premium volumes declined from a year ago on lower exposures and slower payroll growth at our large accounts. Pricing discipline drove our rate actions and our willingness to walk away from business where appropriate.","Property Casualty\u2019s accident year loss ratio as adjusted was 63.2, flat from a year ago and higher than our long-term trend. Importantly, our view of a decline in the accident year loss ratio in 2014 has not changed. First quarter operating results were also impacted by three large consumer losses and strong alternative investment performance which I\u2019ll address in my remarks.","The quarter included $162 million of net prior year adverse development, primarily related to our international financial lines business, as well as certain specialty lines. We continue to review reserve quarterly and react quickly to any trends. The quarter also included a $105 million benefit from a previously announced change in the discount rate for worker\u2019s compensation. This change was associated with the merger of our internal polling arrangements effective January 1. Our expense ratio was essentially unchanged in the quarter as expected and we continue to progress with our Japan integration. Our investments in Japan and the benefits from the recent severance charges will emerge later in 2015.","Turning to Slide 9, we saw growth across commercial product lines outside of Casualty. Global Property led growth and net premiums written increased 12%, adjusted for changes in our corporate cat program. We saw new business growth in large limit and middle market business globally, particularly in Europe and we continue to leverage our in house engineering capabilities and execute on our global approach to capital allocation. We did see a more competitive market in the U.S. cat this quarter where there is overcapacity and we were disciplined in our renewals.","Commercial insurance pricing remained positive during the quarter and largely exceeded loss cost trends, though rate increases were slightly lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter. Global commercial rates increased 1.9% in the quarter. The U.S. market continued to lead in rate improvement with a 4.4% increase in the quarter. U.S. property, led with a 5.9% increase followed by the U.S. financial wines which was up 4.2%. U.S. Casualty and U.S. Specialty each had 4.1% rate increases.","The accident year loss ratio in commercial improved 0.3 points from the year ago to 65.1, even with the low severe losses of a year ago as a result of our pricing actions, enhanced low-risk selections, technical underwriting, and investments in claim handling. Notable improvement in casualty accident year losses reflected the impact of rate increases and continued improvement in business mix. Casualty had been a leading contributor to declining loss ratio and delivered a positive risk adjusted profit this quarter.","We remain focused on retaining our most profitable business and refining our account quality scoring tools at an increasingly granular level. Severe commercial losses accounted for a 2.9 point impact to commercial\u2019s loss ratio this quarter versus 1.2 points in the year ago quarter and were within a reasonable range of expectations.","Turning to Slide 10, net premiums written for consumer insurance increased 2%, excluding the effects of the yen exchange rate. In consumer we continue to focus on improved underwriting quality and targeted growth in key markets where we can achieve meaningful scale. As Kevin advances his strategy, you will hear more about our plans. Similar to learnings from a commercial transformation, consumer is being led to embrace transformation with an emphasis on value creation. Consumer continues to remain on track for modest improvements in both growth and profitability in 2014.","The consumer accident year loss ratio increased 0.5 point from a year ago to 59.3 including 1.2 points arising from three individual fire losses in North America personal property. These losses were geographically disbursed and were predominantly older policies. Our risk appetite and exposure to North American personal lines has been stable for some time. While large personal property losses are difficult to predict, this was the first time we experienced three personalized losses in excess of $10 million each in a quarter, or even in one year.","In each of the prior two years we experienced just one personalized loss of over $ 10 million. Across the remaining consumer business we saw improved results in automobile, warranty and A&H, driven by underwriting actions and rate increases taken in the current and prior year.","Turning to Slide 11, operating results reflected a modestly lower level of net investment income which resulted primarily from a lower invested asset base cost by the run-off of our reserve base which has fallen from 68 billion in 2010 to 63 billion today. As I mentioned earlier, alternative returns exceeded our expectation by over $100 million. With respect to capital management, as planned, we did not remit a dividend to the holding company during the quarter but we did make tax payments over $ 180 million. We look forward to contributing our planned dividends during the remainder of the year.","Turning to Slide 12, mortgage guarantees operating performance continues to improve with operating income for the quarter of $ 76 million. Mortgage guaranty continues to benefit from its proprietary risk selection model and in improving housing market, with 62% of earned premiums generated by high quality business written after 2008. The delinquency ratio of 5.3% for the quarter continued to fall as the volume of new delinquencies is lower and cure rates improved. The Mortgage insurance market continues to evolve as the highest rated and leading U.S. mortgage insurer, United Guaranty is well positioned to remain a disciplined and competitive market participant. In closing we continued to advance our strategic initiatives, work collaboratively across AIG businesses and further build value for all our stakeholders.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jay to discuss and life and retirement results.","Jay Wintrob","","Thank you Peter and good morning to everyone. Beginning on Slide 13, the first quarter of 2014 was another record quarter for AIG\u2019s life and retirement business. The segment delivered over $1.4 billion of operating earnings, achieving the highest level of quarterly earnings in our history. Operating income was driven by strong growth in fee income and enhanced spread income. Higher account balances due to strong sales and equity market appreciation generated increased fee income. Interest rate sensitive businesses continued to benefit from disciplined pricing on new business, reduced renewal crediting rates and a run off of older business crediting relatively high interest rates.","Our diversified portfolio of alternative investments, hedge funds and private equity generated very strong returns during the quarter, contributing approximately $260 million of investment income above our targeted 10% annual return. Fair value accounting for investment in PICC Group common stock resulted in a $110 million decline in net investment income year-over-year.","In addition to strong earnings, life and retirement delivered $1.7 billion of dividends to the holding company in the first quarter and we\u2019re on target to meet our dividend plan for 2014. We ended the quarter with shareholders equity ex-AOCI of $34.6 billion, nearly 2 billion higher than a year ago. Our all products all channels distribution platform continued to produce strong results. Retail sales were up 61% from the year ago period reaching nearly 4.4 billion in the quarter. Sales of retirement income solutions products, including individual variable annuities and fixed index annuities reached nearly $2.2 billion in the quarter up 54% from the year ago period.","Our guaranteed income options, effective marketing programs and materials and award winning customer service continue to differentiate our offerings in the marketplace, while innovative and competitive product design has improved the risk profile of these products. We remain comfortable with our level of sales and continue to achieve pricing IRRs in excess of our long-term targets.","Fixed annuity sales more than doubled from the year ago period to $960 million. Our cost efficient flexible annuity administration platform and deep long-term relationships with financial institutions enable us to remain the number one provider of fixed annuities through the bank channel, a position we\u2019ve held for the past 18 years. We saw a slight decline in fixed annuity sales on a sequential basis reflecting our strategy of maintaining disciplined pricing in response to declining interest rates which occurred over the course of the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, assets under management reached $324 billion, up 9% from a year ago, driven by strong retail investment product net flows, higher separate account balances and greater institutional assets.","Net inflows in our retail products and group retirement businesses were $1 billion in the quarter, up substantially from a year ago. This improvement was driven by strong growth in sales and retirement income solutions, retail mutual funds and fixed annuities as just discussed. Our stable value wrap business accounted for $13 billion increase in AUMs from the year ago period, reflecting the deepening and broadening of our client relationships in that business. Overall we\u2019re pleased with the growth in assets under management we\u2019re seeing across the portfolio of businesses.","Slide 14, provides the components of operating income for our retail and institutional businesses. Line of business comparisons to the year ago quarter were adversely effected by the fair value accounting for PICC mentioned earlier. Excluding this impact, retail and institutional operating income each increased by 10% versus the year ago quarter. Retail operating income benefited from growth in fee income from retirement income solutions and enhanced spread income from fixed annuities. Institutional operating results were driven by increased contribution from group retirement from both higher fee income and enhanced spread income in that line of business.","Over the past four years we\u2019ve redesigned our products to reduce risk to AIG. In our retirement income solutions business, approximately three quarters of our $25.3 billion of variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits include benefits with strong de-risking features, such as the VIX indexing of our writer fees and volatility control funds. In addition we require minimum allocations to the fixed account which also reduces risk. We see competitors increasing their presence in this market, consumer demand for variable annuities remains very strong. We\u2019re also benefiting from growth in index annuities as a result of improved product features, a low interest rate environment and our strong bank distribution presence.","Slide 15 shows our trends in yields and spreads. Base yields in the quarter was 5.32%, up from 5.3% in the prior year quarter and up from 5.29% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase primarily reflects the contribution from participation income on a commercial mortgage loan sales and redemption income on our preferred stock holding in the quarter, which more than offset the impact of lower new money reinvestment rates.","We continue to actively manage crediting rates on our in force block and remained disciplined in our new business pricing as demonstrated by the decline in the cost of funds, for both our fixed annuities and group retirement business.","As a result, net spreads expanded for both fixed annuities and group retirement sequentially and from the year-ago period. At the end of the first quarter 72% of our fixed annuity and universal life account values were at minimum guaranteed crediting rates. Slide 16 shows our investment portfolio compensation and returns and reflects the benefit to net investment income of strong alternative investment performance in the quarter as mentioned earlier.","So to sum-up, we\u2019re off to a good start to the year with strong earnings and distributions to AIG. We plan to continue executing on our strategic initiatives which include growing our distribution organization and increasing the productivity of our wholesalers, affiliated agents and financial advisors. We\u2019re successfully leveraging our strong relationships with distribution partners to increase penetration of our broad retail product portfolio, build on our market leading and offer competitive and profitable retirement income solutions.","We also look to continue opportunities to grow our institutional businesses, where we can achieve the most attractive risk adjusted returns. And with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Liz to open for Q&A.","Liz Werner","Thanks John. Operator could we open up the lines?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR","In the commentary Bob said that the buy back in the quarter was measured and so, I was wondering how to think about what we can expect for kind of a run rate there? Should we think of this as something we can run rate or could you let that go more, going forward?","Bob Benmosche","I think the word measured is not necessarily for the quarter, but generally speaking as we go through this period of time, the Federal Reserve coming in and really working with this us on being prepared for an official CCAR down the road, once it\u2019s defined by the FED. But you want to make sure that you do things in a steady and that\u2019s all that was referring to us. So I think as we look through the rest of the year, we have a capital plan, we\u2019ll review that capital plan and update our stress testing as we do it internally.","Again, it\u2019s not the official Federal Reserve stress test but as we update ourselves we will keep an eye on that capital plan once IOFC actually closes and we have the money in hand we will take a second look at it. So it\u2019s just doing things in a very measured way, both for the Federal Reserve and quite frankly for the rating agencies. We want to make sure we satisfy, especially the coverage ratio for them as they are asking us to do. And we\u2019re in constant dialogue with them. So that\u2019s all we\u2019ve meant.","Randy Binner - FBR","And then the follow-up would be, if do you have any kind of updated comments on the process with the FED in particular there\u2019s been recent introduction of bi-partisan legislation in both, excuse me -- the house from the senate looking to clarify the FED\u2019s interpretation of Section 171 of Dodd-Frank. And so wondering if you have any commentary on how that might have affect the process?","Bob Benmosche","No, I think what you see going on is an attempt to rationalize what\u2019s in FED versus insurance company, versus banks. So I think they\u2019re Collins Amendment and such is something that needs to be worked through so that the Federal Reserve can clearly take a look at what we do here at the insurance companies. And look you all understand that our liabilities are very different and the way they behave is very different as we begin to match the assets and liabilities and our focus is really long term solvency so to make we live up with the promises that we make to our client and that\u2019s a big deal. Not say that banks don\u2019t do that as well but it\u2019s a different business and a different structure. So I think that pretty much -- I hope that covers more broadly and I think we\u2019re continuing to work with everybody to make sure that not only in the U.S. but around the work to make sure we\u2019re hearing too and fired up the design of our appropriate regulation.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","For Peter, the 97% underlying combined ratio would view do that as a starting point that property casualty business can improve over the course of the year, I just want to clarify that first?","Peter Hancock","Yes. I do still improvement in the combined ratio during the course of the year based our forecast of normalized trend, yes.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","And then there appears to be a persistent drag on the reserving. I believe we\u2019re in the fourth quarter in a row of persistent reserve strengthening. When do you feel that drag will be over?","Peter Hancock","So we do a quarterly review of separate segment of the reserves that are in particular subject to longer tails and harder to predict loss cost trend and that each quarter is looked at independently over the one before. So the cards fall where they fall based on new information that emerges, and we do it with our internal actuarial team as well as external review. The fact that you\u2019ve had four quarters in a row to meet it is statistically not very significant and the numbers relative to the total reserve of over 60 billion are relatively modest.","The particular prior year development in this quarter was from two principal sources, the international financial lines, which is a very profitable business, we like. And so while there have been a gradual increase in temperature in a number of foreign jurisdictions, that\u2019s something which we gradually adjust our pricing to, but we feel very comfortable with the return on risk of that business and if anything see that as exposing the need for more insurance from the U.S. to other jurisdictions. So it was a sort of some positives there. The other piece relates to a large surety loss that occurred and it really came to us last year. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s prior year. But it\u2019s a transaction that was underwritten about four years ago, that involved a company that went into bankruptcy. So I don\u2019t see it as indicative of the reserve weakness. It\u2019s just a one-off event.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","How big was the surety loss?","Peter Hancock","$89 million.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","$89 million. Okay, Peter, I think it is significant from a comparison standpoint at least. We\u2019re just not seeing this drag from other large P&C companies. For David Herzog, given all the $2.5 billion of cash up front from ILFC, with $5 billion to $6 billion dividend from the P&C business and substantial dividends also coming from the Life Company. I just want get a sense of why AIG wouldn\u2019t accelerate the buyback, even taking into account that were during the course of coming up on a CCAR analysis?","David Herzog","I think, what Bob said - that captures the essence of how we are approaching capital management. With respect to ILFC, as I said in my opening remarks and Bob said, we are now like to go through a process of actually close the transaction. We\u2019re going to update our stress test better that you could look at that as a sort of normal course, that\u2019s what. We will be subject to at some point. Although we\u2019re not today, we will be. So we are following an early process with the Fed. We will update those results. We will review those results with the rating agency, with Fed itself and with our Board of Directors.","And so again -- and then we\u2019ll update or capital plan. I think it\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s not appropriate to put in a capital plan, capital actions that are based upon contingent fund. Others that have tried that did not like the result. So we\u2019ve learned from that, we\u2019ve learned from others. So capital plan will be updated in normal course and then will review that updated capital plan again with those various stakeholders and then take appropriate action. Again I think our approach to capital management has been consistent, steady, orderly and those are dimensions that we believe are balancing the various stakeholders, including the Fed and including rating agencies, including our own management board of directors. So we\u2019re moving at an appropriate place given the environment, given the on boarding of the Fed. Again, you saw what we did in the first quarter, and that is relative to what we did in the fourth quarter. So I think we\u2019re comfortable with the pace we are on.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Great, I hope at 80% above we view that is a compelling opportunity for buybacks. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Peter, I just wanted to ask a little bit about the North America commercial business. It looks like the year-over-year improvement there slowed a bit in the first quarter. Given the return rate gains in your earnings through and movement towards what I would assume is a lower loss ratio properly book, and even taking into consideration the severity losses that were effectively flat year-over-year; trying to understand what the margin, kind of whether we hit a speed bump or what happened in the first quarter? Was there something I\u2019m missing there?","Peter Hancock","I\u2019m going to give that to John Doyle to answer.","","John Doyle","","Hey Mike, what I would point out is that we continue to see underwriting improvement in our U.S. casualty business. As Peter mentioned casualty produced suggested profit for us in the first quarter for the first time since we\u2019ve been using that as our primary performance metric and it was more notable than that -- is that our U.S. casualty business was also RAP positive in the quarter. So we feel good about that.","Having said that, we saw some pressure on the top line in the first quarter. The cap property market got considerably more competitive in the quarter. So we sacrificed some volume in the quarter there, in some cases locked some accounts. We also moved up on some programs to retain some relationships on some business that we thought was within an appropriate margin.","And then in casualty there were some pressure on the top line. As Peter mentioned ratable quarters on large accounts but also there was also some pressure from DVA business, it\u2019s just a work comp like cover for U.S. contractors doing business, largely in Iraq and Afghanistan and with the wind down of the lot of the work there we saw some pressure there. We did see decent growth in the other segment and continue to grow outside of cap property in the United States.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","So should we expect some kind of reversion of what we saw in prior quarters in terms of margin expansion there or how should we -- it would just seem that a lot of the really big opportunity to push for excess rate over loss trends -- the low hanging fruit might be behind us? Just trying to understand just given what we\u2019re seeing elsewhere, how should we think about margin expansion in the North America commercial business from here, just given that\u2019s an engine of margin improvement of the company.","Peter Hancock","I\u2019m not sure it ever feels like low hanging fruit to me, because there is lots of competitors out in the market,","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Fair enough.","David Herzog","And I would also mention to you that it\u2019s not just about price. Risk selection is an important driver for our underwriting improvement and we continue to refine more techniques and use a lot of the analytical capabilities that we\u2019ve brought on to the team over the course of the last couple of years to improve. But as Peter mentioned -- I pointed out cat property, but as Peter mentioned in his prepared remarks and mostly other lines of business, rates continued to exceed loss cost trends. And as he also mentioned we do expect continued loss ratio improvement when you normalize for the severe losses and during the course of this year.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Capital","","Yes, Peter I think you -- when talking about severe losses in commercial lines, you said the $186 million was within a reasonable range. I\u2019m wondering what the range is that you\u2019re using today? And should we expect that range to be increasing over time as it seems like your continuing to emphasize property over casualty in your growth plans?","John Doyle","","This is John, let me -- I\u2019ll jump in on that again. Severe per commercial were $145 million this -- the number you\u2019re referenced includes the three consumer losses that Peter referred to. It\u2019s within a range of reasonable expectations. What I would say it\u2019s slightly higher than what we\u2019d expect but it\u2019s going to be bumpy. Of course we\u2019re not going to see -- it's a quarter-to-quarter predictable number of these losses. One of the losses in fact came in on March 31. So just as an indication but -- and if property continues to grow as a percentage of the book, we\u2019ll see more contribute from that line of business over time.","Peter Hancock","Yes, the most unusual aspect in terms of severe losses as I mentioned is in consumer where we had these three rather unusual fires, but in terms of the last few quarters, I was reassured by the fact that most of the severe losses were from property policies written some time ago. So it\u2019s not as a result of a new exposure. Yes we are growing our property business but there is no evidence that that is the cause of the elevated severe losses that we had in the last three quarters. Over time yes, as the book grows it will become a bit more lumpy, but no I think it\u2019s better diversified today than it\u2019s ever been before, diversifying away from U.S. cat to a more internationally balanced global property portfolio.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Capital","And then also, can you provide us any visibility on the other property casualty segment which no premiums but throws off roughly 40% of your property casualty earnings. And perhaps some sort of breakdown between what the run off piece of that is, maybe the timeline for what that associated tail is. And then how much of it is just purely investment income that doesn\u2019t get allocated to the commercial and personal segments?","Bob Benmosche","Well, the first is, I\u2019ve got to work backwards. Your last comment is a substantial element in that line item, which is the access investment income. We used to transform pricing mechanism between that other segment and the consumer commercial which looks at risk free rates plus the liquidity premium which is roughly 50 basis points. The only investment returns over and above that is shown in our other segment and we\u2019ve been fortunate the asset management group has done an excellent job of getting better returns than that. And so that shows up in that segment. But we also have a number of run-off portfolios, excess workers comp, some environment policies in asbestos in that which is going to be running off over several years, and it ultimately will free up capital to be redeployed either dividends or growth in the rest of the business.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Capital","So when the run-off is complete do you still expect to have in other segment? I mean I know we\u2019re talking years down the road probably?","Bob Benmosche","I think if it is certainly not a bad scale and I think that perhaps another segment might be consolidated for all of AIG because we have a number of run-off assets at the holding company like the DIB and so on. So I think that hopefully at some point the total amount run-off assets in the whole company are a footnote that doesn\u2019t receive as much intention as they do today. But today, between those are the holding company and those that are in PNC, it\u2019s still fair amount of trapped capital which ultimately will get re-deployed productively.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW Management.","Meyer Shields - KBW Management","When we look at the international retail segments, I am looking at last year. You had sort of underlying loss ratios in low 50 in the first half of the year and the low 60% range in the back half of the year. Is this some sort of seasonality for the sequential improvement from 4Q due [ph] fourth quarter actually represents something sustainable?","Bob Benmosche","I didn\u2019t hear your question was it -- did you say commercial or consumer at the beginning?","Meyer Shields - KBW Management","I am sorry, international commercial.","David Herzog","The severe loss that John mentioned that came in at the very end of the quarter was an international one and I think that it\u2019s largely severe losses shifting from domestic to international. ","Bob Benmosche","And we disclose it in top on Page 17, the severe loss numbers for international commercial and you can see the growth there from the best two quarters of that year being very low to an elevated level as for Q3, Q4 in the first quarter of this year.","Meyer Shields - KBW Management","Okay. So we shouldn\u2019t expect the same sort of seasonality going forward?","Bob Benmosche","No, I think we had very low in the first half of last year and elevated in the last three quarters.","Meyer Shields - KBW Management","Right. Unrelated question how should we think about the process related expenses for regulation? I guess the beginning of AIG unique regulation, the new churn space. Is that likely to increase or decrease from what we\u2019re seeing currently?","Bob Benmosche","I think that you have seen it baked in a bit with our numbers. So we talked about our expenses and when are they coming down. We -- for example may be close to 300 people dedicated full time for working on our stress testing, it could be as much as 1000 people supporting them at various points in time, in a run rate or in the numbers. We\u2019ve already in a process of investing huge technologies. We\u2019ve been able to build a real strategic state of the art system on the investment side, the asset side. We are now putting team together on building the liabilities, employing demand in a very high tech kind of way. So that money is in the run rate, it\u2019s been in the run rate for, I would say at least 2.5 years and we saw a dropping from the fall of (indiscernible) FED year. And we need to start really modernizing it (indiscernible) which has been in the run rate quite a while.","David Herzog","Yes. I think the big investments are sort of quite separate from regulation FED related to merger integration of AIU and Fuji Fire & Marine in Japan. That\u2019s a big spend this year.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America","Yes. Couple of questions. The first is that the G&A expense within P&C was quite a bit low as it has been running and it was lower in every single segment. Should we be reading into this improvement and this is just --- not the ratio but the aggregate number was down quite a bit from the fourth quarter. Should we read into that?","Bob Benmosche","You could but I don\u2019t think you would be interpreting it right. You got to do the FX adjustment which is very sizable yen expenses so they look lower with a lower translation. But we are making progress on expenses but as I alluded to, we won\u2019t see a full benefit until 2015 as we work our way through the merger integration costs in Japan. I have to say that we had slightly lighter projects than in Japan in the first quarter than I had planned, and we\u2019ll see that come through in the second quarter and third quarter despite the higher pace, but the full year plan for spending in Japan is on track.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America","And what about the drop in the U.S. I assume that -- something to that? Again fourth quarter to first quarter, both in commercial and consumer, that overhead number came down quite a bit.","Bob Benmosche","In the fourth quarter 2013 we had higher comp related expenses within both the U.S. and international businesses and that wasn\u2019t repeated in the first quarter of this year.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America","Got it. And then second question, on IFLC, I fully understand how you\u2019re approaching this from a capital management standpoint. You clearly don\u2019t want to put the cart before the horse. You have said in the past several things on IFLC. One you said that the sale of IFLC would be a credit positive event for the company, that there was transformation to some extent. You also suggest that the capital of that unlock that you have received when you sell IFLC, in your view should be free and clear. It wasn\u2019t supporting any other businesses. Do you still stand by those statements?","David Herzog","It\u2019s David. Yes. The short answer. Listen, getting IFLC has total liabilities of about $25 billion, $26 billion and that number sits today on our balance sheet and liabilities held for sale. There is no question that the rating agencies will see the actual closing of that sale as credit positive, as much as said so. And the capital, whether it\u2019s the shares of AirCap or the cash that we receive, it will sit at the holding company, unencumbered not backing any other business or liability and our judgment process will be as I set forth in terms of how we\u2019re going to go about evaluating what we will do with those proceeds. Bob I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything?","Bob Benmosche","","I guess just keep in mind that I think the IFLC management team, over the last four years have done brilliant job of turning the around a business where we had not dealt with legacy aircraft as appropriately as we should, did not have the right financing in terms of duration matching against purchasing of claims and so on. So there is a huge amount of work went on cleaning it up, building a really strong new airplane purchase book. If you look at the planes, the NEO, we were right out in front of that and congratulations to the executives that got that going, the NEO 320. So we have a really strong order book, we have really done a wonderful job of cleaning up our finances and other thing was older aircraft that needed to be sold or parted out and so on.","And we should put the two companies together, we view it as a very strong property and for now we\u2019re getting some cash immediately which is important. We do, as David said have a lock upon it but we also see the future of this over the next several years as being extremely positive. And so we\u2019re going to make the right economic decisions for the company and our shareholders. And over the next two or three years we\u2019ll see what\u2019s there and make the decision based upon how AIG is trading, where we are vis-\u00e0-vis book value. We\u2019re expecting improvement in our operating earnings as we go forward, improvement in our ROE as we go forward. So if that all comes together, we\u2019ll have a better view of how we deal with this non-core asset, which we think has a lot of promise over more than one or 1.5 year time frame.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS","","Two from me. First just on the property casualty insurance interest in dividend in the quarter, I know you said that part of the reason for the reduction was the lower invested asset balance but it was really a substantial decrease. Was there anything else unusual going in there, FX or something would have impacted the decline from the fourth quarter?","David Herzog","There wasn\u2019t anything substantial. As we said the alternative investments were strongly performed but our overall interest and dividend -- interest receipts were in line with our expectations.","Brian Meredith - UBS","Okay. Because I was just looking, it\u2019s down like $80 million sequentially. Maybe there is an allocation issue, kind of what you\u2019re talking about with the other that went into that.","David Herzog","There is 15 million of PICC mark-to-market and then ultimately of other declines in interest returns -- interest yields.","Brian Meredith - UBS","Great. And then my second question is for Peter, John. I am just curious the severe loss activity that we\u2019re seeing, could any of that be attributed to some of the changes you made in your reinsurance program? And then kind of as an addendum to that, is there any way to kind of get a sense of what the benefit the changes in the reinsurance program have had to your underlying combines in the P&C area?","Peter Hancock","Our international net exposure of non-U.S. net exposure did increase as a result of changes in re-insurance. We continue to back test that decision to take more net and remain confident that it\u2019s been also a right economic decision for us. Last year in the first quarter we saw an unusually low level of severe losses at $60 million in losses and this year was close to a more normal rate. But as I mentioned before, as a percentage of our total portfolio, our high limit property business globally is a bigger part of our commercial insurance operation. So we do expect, at least in the near term those exposures to increase. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","I\u2019d love to start with a question for Kevin. So we\u2019ve started to see some improving consumer margins. You\u2019ve talked about your initiatives in auto, warranty, and accident health. And I was wondering if you could - you\u2019ve been here for about six months and the Company. Consumer business started to change about 18 months ago. I\u2019m wondering if we can give us a sort of a little bit of a story as to sort of how the focus in consumer is shifting? And maybe some concrete examples of specific changes, and sort of specifically about things like pricing and underwriting, I\u2019m kind of curious, are you pulling these levers hard enough to get your business to down to a target of low 90s combined.","Kevin Hogan","Thanks Josh. As I mentioned last time. We are playing in consumer essentially at similar playbook to what has been very successful in the commercial side, really focusing on underwriting discipline. We\u2019re using similar tools in terms of global writers, regulate portfolio reviews et cetera. And in the big portfolios of Japan and of the U.S. in the last two years, we\u2019ve taken substantial actions not only in terms of rate adequacy but also changing certain terms and conditions in the underwriting aspects of the portfolios and as you mentioned, those few underwriting actions are starting to prove particularly in the automobile and the accident and health areas.","Outside of the two big portfolios in the U.S. and Japan, we\u2019re managing some important growth related initiatives in some of the world\u2019s fastest-growing markets, the SPE portfolios and from those areas, as we are using appropriate technical tools from the start, we\u2019re starting off with a standpoint for the sound technical base. There were a number of challenges in the portfolios that we\u2019re re-underwriting our way through, including the accident and health business in the United States, which is still a bit of a drag on our growth. But we are establishing a sustainable portfolio and so I would say we\u2019re partially through the re-underwriting process, but we have a sound base on which now to focus on growth.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","So a question for Peter, or perhaps Charlie, around actuarial and reserving. So you guys have been investing to drive an actuarial transformation along with everything else you\u2019d been doing. I\u2019m wondering if you give us a sense for what more you need to do to bring your actuarial data in processes to be best in class and then if we think about them sort of discreetly, you have given reserves in three buckets, sort of pre \u201904 legacy reserves from the financial crisis years and then say the more recent business that you guys have written yourselves since 2010 or \u201911. For each of these three buckets, could you give us a sense of your confidence level and sort of where you think the puts and takes and say strength and weaknesses might be in the current pace?","Peter Hancock","Okay, Charlie, I\u2019ll leave that one to you.","Charlie Shamieh","Josh, firstly on technology, I\u2019d say before you get technology, the key thing, as Peter mentioned a bit of it is in relation to the international financial line reserve strengthening. There\u2019s a lot of work that we\u2019re doing to get very granular information with the claims that happened because we do see evidence of earlier settlements of claims on a paid and an incurred basis which is a good thing. We have much richer stake reserve information than we ever had before. And so a lot of the actuarial methodologies are being adopted for that. And we believe our reserves reflect the best estimate for that\u2019s causes a lot of difficulties and looking at historical patterns and the triangles, because Eric\u2019s team is actively affecting those trends. And we think that will be beneficial to us in ultimate loss cost eventually.","In terms of technology, we are -- Bob mentioned it earlier, part of the stress testing work and the capital management work that we\u2019re doing, we are putting the liabilities on to fairly expanded industrial strength platform for income statements and balance sheet projections. And these are industry tools that help us not just look at point estimates, but also uncertainties in those estimates and what drives those uncertainties.","In terms of the confidence in the three buckets that you mentioned, I believe we have confidence in every one of those buckets. We test and derive best estimates regardless of which accident year we\u2019re looking at. If we see emergence now that we had previously not expected, we will react to it in the quarter. One of the drivers in international financial lines was in isolated pockets in Europe, in our personal indemnity. We saw a much longer sale, than we have ever seen before back to 2005, as early as 2005 in some cases and we're reacting to that.","So I wouldn\u2019t give you a differentiated answer. The point that we\u2019re following looks at everything, every quarter in a very detailed dive into the long sale process, we have claims reviews and underwriting. And also ERM involvement in the validation process, at least once annually for the long sale process. ","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","That\u2019s great. So, and then so this quarter with the international financial, it sounds like you must have had some late margins, sort of some latency you didn\u2019t see it didn\u2019t expect and then the surety was basically an individual claim that came through. It sounds like this is much more a case of you guys are responding to the data, as opposed to say changing your approaches and sort of doing a study or something like that?","Bob Benmosche","I think that\u2019s very fair. International financial alliance is really isolated through two pockets. Peter mentioned them earlier, but Australia and New Zealand in the access players and in CRA and CNR specifically. And if I would say the frequency and the severity of this environment Australia in particular was higher than we had basically build into our price. But as Peter said, that remains for us a very profitable portfolio. And then the European BI, we had isolated pockets of individual countries in Europe where we saw much later emergence for a claim financial.","Liz Werner","Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Liz Werne, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ma\u2019am.","Liz Werne","Good morning, everyone. Before we get started I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain certain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes and circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events, actual performance or events may differ possibly materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause this include the factors described in our first, second and third quarter 2014 Form 10-Q and our 2013 Form 10-K under management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations under risk factors.","AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims their obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a results of new information, future events or otherwise.","Today's presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement, which is available on our website, www.aig.com. This morning in the room we have our CEO, Peter Hancock, David Herzog, our CFO; and the heads of our business segments. John Doyle, Head of Commercial; and Kevin Hogan, Head of Consumer.","So with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Peter Hancock. ","Peter Hancock","Thanks Liz, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I\u2019d like to discuss the quarter\u2019s results, our priorities, financial objectives and our view of economic forces impacting our businesses. As we look back over the full year, the earnings growth of our core insurance business, our DTA utilization and accretive share repurchases resulted in 12% growth in book value per share excluding AOCI and DTA.","Our fourth quarter and 2014 full year accomplishments reflect our commitment to value based management and focus on growth, profitability and risk. As just one example of executing on value based metrics, I\u2019d like to highlight our execution of debt retirement that spreads exceeding those of our debt issuance.","This strategy resulted in over $0.5 billion of incremental economic value for shareholders despite an approximate $800 million GAAP charge to net income. This quarter you will also see that our re-segmentation highlights are focussed on customers. Our customers look to us as their lead insurer rather than just another source of capacity and you\u2019ll hear more on our commercial and consumer customer focus from John and Kevin.","Our fourth quarter included both accomplishments and challenges. We saw the early signs of expenses moving in the right direction, both the commercial and consumer P&C businesses delivering accident year loss ratio improvement from the same period last year. We executed on a number of positive capital management actions and yesterday we announced a new $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization.","Our fourth quarter results also included evidence of our risk management discipline across the company, specifically accident years 2005 and later continued to develop favourably. We continue to accelerate the DIB unwind with a focus on maximising economic value and we moved access capital from our life insurance companies to the parent.","We also recognize the challenges that persisted this quarter and we remain focussed on them, specifically certain older accident years have resulted in additional reserve strengthening .We provide details on the older accident years in our earnings presentation which David will speak to.","Consistent with our practise since 2011, this quarters actions are based on new information coming from a thorough and independent reserve analysis. We believe that this stable development of more recent accident years highlights the value of our reserving practises and our underwriting discipline.","Our priority is to deliver sustainable ROE improvements as we look to 2015 and beyond. For the full year 2014, ROE excluding AOCI and excluding DTA was 8.4%. Over the course of the year access alternative returns and lower than expected catastrophe losses added about one percentage point to this full year ROE. Excluding that 1% gives us a good starting point to discuss ROE expansion going forward.","Over the next three years we\u2019re focussed on achieving annual ROE improvement through our commitment to managing gross profitability and risk. We seek to deliver a consistent level of expense savings through our technology, process redesign, shared service centers and simplification of our organisational structure.","Turning to page three of the earnings deck. We outline our financial objectives for the next three years. Based on the outlook for our businesses and the current environment, we believe that we can achieve 50 basis points or higher of annual improvement in ROE ex-AOCI and DTA through 2017 from the normalized base lines of 7.4% for 2014. Our ability to be higher will be driven in part by the timing of emerging benefits from our investments and the growth and savings resulting from these investments as well as catastrophe losses and investment returns that are in line with our expectations.","Our long term ROE objective remains 10%. Our view on general operating and other expenses is that we can achieve a 3% to 5% annual decline on a net basis through 2017, which allows for growing our investment in technology and systems. David will provide further comments on our outlook for general operating expenses.","Finally, we expect book value per share growth ex-AOCI and DTA to exceed 10% annually through 2017 as a result of improved profitability, further capital and risk management actions and our DTA utilization, assuming our ability to deploy access capital continues.","We maintain a disciplined risk appetite for new businesses and acquisitions. Our acquisitions have not been capital intensive and have provided unique capabilities, clients and distribution and are not driven by a desire for acquiring assets or short term earnings. I like to close with a few comments on the impact of external forces on our business and how we react to the changing environment. The reduction in inflationary expectations is good news for claims, trends and underwriting results. Growth in the U.S. is also encouraging and we will pursue new business with our disciplined approach.","Offsetting these positives is the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment and a decline in property casualty rate increases. Kevin will speak more about the impact of the current interest rate environment. While there are positives and negatives to our operating environment we believe our discipline commitment to our customers and our ability to meet the wide range of their needs will serve us well in the long run.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to David.","David Herzog","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review the highlights for this quarter's results, our recent capital management actions and balance sheet strength and our outlook for 2015 capital management.","Turning to Slide 4, you can see our total insurance operating income was up slightly versus a year ago. After tax operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or $0.97 per diluted share. In the fourth quarter, our operating return on equity adjusted for AOCI and DTA was 6.8% and as Peter mentioned 8.4% for the full year.","Reported net income was $655 million and included the charge for retirement of debt of $824 million associated with our liability management actions. Book value per share excluding AOCI and DTA grew to just over $58 a share 12% higher than a year ago, driven by our earnings, our DTA utilization and accretive share repurchases. I will highlight a few noteworthy items for the quarter and John and Kevin will provide more details on the commercial and consumer operating results.","Turning to slide 5 we summarize prior year development in our property casualty results. Net adverse prior year development for the quarter was just under $300 million including premium adjustments of about $50 million and relates primarily to accident years 2004 and prior.","Commercial insurance reported prior year development of about $197 million including those premium refunds. There were four classes of business that contribute almost equally to the adverse emergence and those include primary workers compensation, healthcare, pollution products and certain financial lines.","Consumer insurance had a modest favourable prior year development of about $35 million principally from our private client group business. The runoff segment now reported in corporate reported net adverse prior year development of about $135 million driven primarily by pollution products within the runoff environment book and retained a specialist in assumed reinsurance portfolios.","As we have seen in the last couple of years, the overall adverse development was related to 2004 and prior. As of this year end, we have experienced less than a 2% change in our initially recorded year end alternates for each of the last eight accident years ","In the third quarter, we disclosed that we expected a $250 million to $350 million negative impact on our workers compensation discount due to the fall in interest rates as of September 30.","In the fourth quarter we reduced our workers compensation discount by a little over 560 million due to the combined impact of this fall in interest rates and faster pay down of our reserves. In our U.S. life business we added a little over a $100 million to the estimated reserves for incurred but not reported death claims which reflected continuing efforts to identify deceased insureds and their beneficiaries, primarily related to legacy small face amounts policies pursuant to the resolution of a multi state audit.","Turning to slide 6 which represent the corporate and other operations we saw a mark-to-market earnings decline in mark-to-market earnings from our direct investment booking global capital markets this quarter. We continued to actively wind down the direct investment book and the global capital markets and in the fourth quarter we redeemed about $2.5 billion of debt to bring a full year total to about $7.5 billion using cash and short term investments allocated to this book. We expect ongoing wind down to result in the release of capital to parent overtime.","We expect that the earnings contribution from the direct investment book will also decline as the portfolios continues to wind down. The parent company investments in AerCap and PICC continued to deliver and result in about $250 million of pre-tax operating income in the quarter.","Total corporate expenses net were $236 million in the quarter down on a sequential basis largely due to the incentive compensation accruals discussed in the prior quarter. Our reported operating effective tax rate for the quarter declined to just over 21% driven primarily by tax benefits related to foreign operations.","As Peter mentioned managing our expenses while investing in our future are key priorities for AIG. As a base line slide 7 shows total operating, general operating expenses for 2014 f5rom our new disclosure in the financial supplement. Our top investments are included in the reported general operating expenses and totalled a little over $650 million in 2014. For example the Japan integration is included both in the general operating expense and is included in our investments as we described them.","We are focussed on reducing the business as usual expenses which we define is GOE, plus these investments sustainably over time, as well as focusing on the overall expenses and the expense reduction that Peter referenced, all the while making the necessary investment making the necessary investments to the fund growth, profitability and enhanced risk management.","Our capital management highlights begin on slide 8, during the quarter we deployed $1.5 billion towards the repurchase of approximately $28 million shares of common stock bringing the full year repurchases to $4.9 billion, an additional 3.5 million shares were delivered in January with the full completion of the ASR which we initiated in December.","In addition, the Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $2.5 billion which reflects the strong capital flows from our life insurance companies as well as the reduction in risk in our property-casualty business.","With respect debt management, we continue to manage the cost and maturity profile of our debt. As a result of the actions we\u2019ve taken in 2014 we\u2019ve reduced our run rate interest expense by roughly $250 million and we expect the annual interest expense for 2015 to be just under $1.1 billion.","As shown on slide 9, we ended the quarter with financial leverage ratios including hybrids of just over 15% or little over 16% when getting effect for the January issuances. We continue to be opportunistic in our debt capital management and expected that an improving earnings profile will continue to positively affect our coverage ratios going forward.","The yearend RBC ratio for the fleet of U.S. Company, U.S. life companies is estimated at around 490% after giving effect for the fourth quarter and January distributions, which is closer to our targeted operating RBC level.","Cash flow to the holding company remains strong as you can see on slide 10. We received cash dividends and loan repayments from our insurance subsidiaries of $2.9 billion during the quarter, bringing the year to-date to just over $8 billion.","We also received $700 million in distributions and fixed maturities securities bringing that total for the year to just over a $1 billion. In addition, in January our businesses paid $2.8 billion in dividends.","Looking ahead to 2015, we expect $6 billion to $7 billion in potential share repurchases and shareholder dividends. This total does not include any potential monetization of non-core assets.","This is subject of course to board approval, ongoing discussions with rating agencies in any regulatory approvals that could be required. As part of the natural evolution, we have moved to a more dynamic approach of the deployment of our capital which reflects our capital utilization for risks, deployment of capital on our businesses and capital flows.","We expect dividends from our insurance subsidiaries in 2015 of $4 billion to $5 billion in addition to the distributions received thus far in 2015 that I mentioned a moment ago.","Further, we expect tax-sharing payments between $1.5 billion, $2 billion annually [ph] over the next several years which reflects tax planning strategies and updates to our taxable income projections and also reflects our capital gain recognition that realized all of the capital loss carry forwards.","We continue to expect that our tax attribute DTA will be fully utilized by 2020 to 2021. We expect our operating effective tax rate for 2015 to be 33% to 34%. ","So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.","John Doyle","Thank you, David. This morning I will discuss our commercial results which include the operating segments, property casualty, mortgage guarantee and institutional market. You will see that we have moved our insurance run off business which have been part of the PC other, to corporate. This is consistent with our focus on managing runoff lines to capture the greatest economic value for AIG.","Certain expenses and investment income that were previously reported as part of PC other have been allocated to commercial and consumer to be consistent with how we manage the business.","The total commercial segment pre-tax operating income was $1.2 billion in the quarter, driven by improved property casualty and favorable mortgage insurance results, offset by weaker returns in our institutional market business.","Beginning on slide 12 with property casualty results, the quarter benefited from lower CAT and severe losses and improved operating efficiency. Net premiums written excluding the effects of foreign exchange and return premiums on loss sensitive business decline 1% compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to our continue underwriting discipline in U.S. casualty.","This was partially offset by new business growth in financial lines and property. Financial lines grew in all regions and importantly in targeted growth areas such as multinationals, small business and M&A.","Property grew in all regions and segments outside of the U.S. particularly in middle market property and highly engineered risk. Our intense focus on enhancing customer services in these lines, for example, engineering and loss control services has increasingly becoming a differentiator for AIG.","Overall, rate change from the prior year quarter was essential flat. Rate change in U.S. financial lines was just over 2%, while on U.S. specialty it was up about 2% as well. U.S. property rates were down nearly 6% in the quarter. Outside of the U.S. overall property casualty rates decreased slightly.","With respect to the rate environment, our management of business mix, enhanced pricing and risk selection tools and improved claim services gives us confidence in the accident year loss ratio trends and continued growth in risk adjusted profitability.","For the full year the accident year loss ratio as adjusted was 65.6% or roughly flat from last year following a period of positive improvement. In the quarter we experience modest elevated attritional loss activity in our short-tail lines.","General operating expenses improved in the quarter primarily due to the efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives partially offset by investments in technology, engineering and analytics.","The structure of our corporate cat placement was consistent with the prior year procured at an improved rate. We also continued our strategy of accessing the capital markets entering into our third cat bond transaction which total $500 million in new issuance.","This new bond offering was met with substantial investor interest. Collectively our current cat bonds provide $925 million of indemnity protection. Net investment income for the quarter 7% from the same period last year to $1.1 billion reflecting the impacts of lower new money yields, lower invested assets and reduced contribution from alternative investments.","Net investment income for the quarter included approximately $100 million dollars of income from a rates offering in AIG strategic investment in PICC. ","Turning to slide 13, mortgage guarantee reported another strong quarter of operating performance with operating income of $171 million. Mortgage guarantee benefited from decreased first lien losses and increase in first lien premiums earns and a second lien litigation settlement.","The improvement in lost ratio also includes $30 million of favorable prior years reserve development. Mortgage guarantee remains an important part of our operations given its strong returns and its strategic insights into the residential mortgage market.","Turning to slide 14, institutional markets pre-tax operating income decline to $180 million [ph] for the quarter primarily due to lower investment returns on alternative investments. The decrease in net investment income was partially offset by higher fee income driven by growth in assets under management primarily from the stable value RAP business.","Premiums and deposits in the quarter grew from the same period last year. Now with regard to 2015, we expect modest growth in the aggregate as we continue to optimize our business mix.","We also anticipated additional 1 to 2 point improvement in the property casualty accident year loss ratio in 2015, from ongoing execution of value based initiatives, progress in underwriting and claims excellence and expectations for improve short-tail losses.","Although I would caution that results can vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of the short-tail business. We also expect to achieve improved operating efficiency while making investments in technology, engineering and analytics.","And as David mentioned we see this quarter\u2019s decline in net investment income as a trend that will likely continue into 2015 as our loss reserves decline and we continue to invest in this interest rate environment.","To sum it up, the commercial team continues to advance its strategic initiatives and to build on the momentum to become our customer\u2019s more valued insurer.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kevin to discuss the consumer results.","Kevin Hogan","Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. As you can see from our revised financial presentation, our consumer results now bring together all of AIGs insurance products and services for consumers whether individual or group based contracts that were previously reported in the life and retirement and property casualty segments.","We\u2019ve created this global consumer platform with the broad distribution reach under a common leadership team and remain focus on executing against our strategic priorities including our targeted growth strategy.","In the fourth quarter we closed on the acquisition of Ageas Protect Limited, a leading provider of life protection products in the U.K. and entered into an agreement to acquire a Laya Healthcare, an Ireland-based healthcare company, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2015.","These acquisitions will help drive continued expansion of our consumer portfolio of insurance solutions design to meet consumer needs for financial, health and retirement security.","We believe Ageas will help strengthen our capability in the U.K. where we already offer personal accident, health and travel insurance coverage to consumers, as well as customized insurance solutions for high network individuals through AIG private client group.","Laya Healthcare service more than 23% of the Irish private health market offering life, dental and travel insurance as well as health and wellness coverage which nicely rounds out our available products in Ireland and provides a platform for expansion into health insurance in select additional markets around the globe.","Combined our consumer businesses delivered $923 million of operating earnings during the quarter. I will cover highlights for each of our three operating segments and share some views on 2015.","Before discussing results for the quarter for our retirement businesses which begins on slide 16, I wanted to remind you that as part of our resegmentation, we revised our presentation of retirement results to reclassify a portion of policy fees along with the related portion of DAC amortization from operating income to non-operating income.","This reclassification of policy fees which relates primarily to guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit embedded derivatives in our variable annuity products offsets the fees from these embedded derivatives with the associated change in fair value of such derivative viabilities.","This reclassification reduced pre-tax operating income for the full year of 2014 by a total of $215 million or roughly $50 million per quarter that had no effect on GAAP net income. We believe this treatment is in line with current industry practice.","Operating income for retirement was $722 million for the quarter and reflected growth in key income resulting from higher assets under managements and a decline in net investment income.","Policy fees rose from the prior year quarter on growth and assets under management driven principally by strong net flows and variable annuities in retirement income solutions and market depreciation.","The decline in net investment income was driven primarily by lower returns on alternative investments as well as decline in base yields as reinvestment rates are below the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio.","At current levels we would expect a 4 to 6 basis points quarterly decline in base yields. We also expect net investment income to be lower in 2015 by approximately $200 million due to the significant distributions of excess capital to parent in 2014.","Turning to slide 17, the quarter benefited from effective spread management achieved through disciplined new business and active management of crediting rates. The outflow of older policies which carry higher crediting rates than current rates offered has also contributed to reducing our cost of funds which we have reduced in both fixed annuities and group retirement over the last 12 months.","Assets under management ended the year at $224 billion, 3% higher than a year ago driven by the strong variable annuity net flows and over all separate account investment performance partially offset by net outflows and fixed annuities and group retirement.","Net flows for fixed annuities have been affected by the low interest rate environment. We expect that sales of fixed annuities although up on a sequential basis will remain challenged in the current low interest rate environment as we continue to maintain new pricing discipline.","We also experienced two large groups surrenders in our group retirement business related to retirement plan consolidations which we believe are part of the normal competitive pressures in this business.","In addition recent market results suggest pressure on new sales of variable annuities, although our index annuity sales continued to gain momentum and macro trends continued to support growing customers need for quality income solutions.","Slide 18 presents results for our global life business, which now includes Fuji life in Japan. Life pre-tax operating income of $80 million decreased compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to a charge of $104 million in the fourth quarter to increase reserves for incurred but not reported death claims that David mentioned earlier.","This reserve reflects continuing efforts related to a previously disclosed multi-state audit and market conduct examination from 2011. The decrease in pre-tax operating income also reflected a decline in net investment income compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily from lower alternative investments returns as well as a decline in base yields.","With respect to life sales, Japan delivered good growth with a 4% increase in sales from the fourth quarter of last year and a 7% increase in premiums. For the full year, Japan represented almost half of the new business sales for our global life business.","Life insurance in force reached over $1 trillion at the end of the year more than 9% higher than prior year on both organic growth and the acquisition of Ageas Protect.","Turning to slide 19, personal insurance reported operating income of $121 million which reflects improved underwriting income from the year ago partially offset by lower net investment income.","Net premiums written grew 2% from the same quarter a year ago, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. We saw growth in the automobile and personal property lines of business partially offset by declines in certain classes of accident and health business as a result of our focus on maintaining underwriting discipline in pricing in terms and conditions.","The personal insurance accident year loss ratio as adjusted was 52.1 for the quarter and 6.1 points lower than the same quarter a year ago reflecting improvements across all lines of business.","Improvement in the accident year loss ratio for our U.S. warranty programs business was offset by an increase in related profit sharing arrangements which increase the acquisition ratio.","We continue to experience lower than expected losses in Japan automobile which benefited from reduced frequency and across the portfolio both catastrophe and severe loss experience were better than our expectations.","Looking ahead to 2015 we believe that the full year 2014 accident year loss ratio excluding impact of cash and severe losses is more indicative of our expectations for personal insurance than the current quarter ratio.","The general operating expense ratio decline 1.7 points from a year ago primarily due to efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives partially offset by increased technology related expenses.","While we\u2019re pleased that we have begun to see benefits from our initiatives thus far, as David mentioned, we are focusing on delivering on further operation efficiencies as we move forward.","Our Japan integration initiative is an important part of this story given the size and scale of our Japanese operations. We currently estimate that Japan integration cost will amount to $150 million in 2015 consistent with previous disclosure.","However, as the final data of merger is subject to approval by the relevance authorities specific timing of benefits to emerge remains uncertain. We are carefully managing every aspect of this complex initiative and remain on-track to deliver an internal rate of return on this investment that will exceed AIG\u2019s hurdle rates and achieve a return in the low double digits.","We have already begun to see certain benefits arising out of these investments such as the recent launch of a new agency front-end system that is now available to over 1500 agents and will be expanded across our distribution network in the coming months.","To close, for our consumer businesses we\u2019ll remain focus on managing growth, profitability, and risk by executing on strategies, maintaining a prudent risk profile and emphasizing capital efficient growth opportunities.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.","Liz Werne","Thank you. Operator, can we open up the lines of questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Mike Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs","Mike Nannizzi","Thank you. So Kevin, just following up on something you just said now, on the consumer loss ratio, the full year being more indicative than the fourth quarter, the expense ratio was higher in the fourth quarter than the full year. So if you juxtapose those two, that would imply that, in personal lines, you would be running over 100.","Is that where you expect to be running that business, or is there something on the expense side that we should be considering where 4Q may not be a good starting point? Thanks.","Kevin Hogan","No. We\u2019re anticipating running this business over a 100. We anticipate overall continuing improvements in the expenses in personal insurance associated with the efficiencies that we have gained. And in terms of loss ratio, there was better than expected experience this year particularly with respect to Japan automobile. And so it\u2019s that particular anomaly that we don\u2019t anticipate to repeat in 2015.","Mike Nannizzi","Got it. Thanks. And then maybe, Peter, the $650 million, maybe David, $650 million that you -- or so that you talked about in investment in 2014, could we get an idea of what that was in the prior year and what have been the returns that you have seen, so the expense saves that you have generated from the investment so far, just to get an idea of sort of how that process is tracking?","Peter Hancock","We didn\u2019t discussed 2013, because it\u2019s a bit of \u2013 the comparison is not really one for one, because there were many projects and initiatives that we\u2019re doing in 2014 that were not in existence in 2013, so it\u2019s a bit of apples and oranges so to speak.","So, the returns that are coming out of \u2013 again, they are in varying stages. So for example, the biggest items in there are for example our movement to shared services, the Japan initiative and certain the shared services and some of the finance functions, those are the biggest ticket item. So we\u2019re beginning to see payback in each one of those at various stages against some come sooner than others. The finance centers have more immediate payback. It\u2019s closer to a near within one year of the spent you\u2019re seeing the initiatives. So, we haven\u2019t quantify the exact benefit yet, but again its going to varied by each one of those projects.","David Herzog","I think the important theme is that we\u2019ve set expense targets that we just disclosed on a net basis. So effectively we are maintaining and increasing the level of investments while reducing the net number by 3% to 5%, so the business as usual expense declining faster than 3% to 5% as we step up the level of investment on return \u2013 on projects where we feel comfortable that we have a good expected return above our hurdle rate. So we\u2019re not sacrificing long-term growth and efficiency in order to get this net expense reduction.","Mike Nannizzi","Great. And then just connecting, David, your comments on deployment this year, the $6 billion to $7 billion, just trying to square that to the buyback authorization of $2.5 billion. So is the expectation that you put the buyback authorization out, you exhaust it at some point this year and then continue increasing or putting up new authorizations as you go through?","Peter Hancock","Well, the expectation for the full year is 6% to 7% both in total for share repurchase in shareholder dividends. And again, I\u2019ve made reference to more dynamic approach so we wanted to reflect the very robust distributions to the holding company and importantly the reduction in risk in our P&C business and so we increase the amount of authorization or asked for authorization \u2013 the amount of authorization we ask for to the first quarter. So, we will deploy as appropriate and then again based on facts and circumstances seek additional approvals throughout the year.","Mike Nannizzi","Great. And last quick one, any impact from energy related investments on either private equity returns, book value that we should think about just given the three months lag in private equity?","Peter Hancock","Nothing material.","Mike Nannizzi","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen","Yes. Thank you. Couple of questions. One is in the U.S. consumer business, and I know the acquisition expense ratio was up because of these profit-sharing commissions, but the loss ratio relative to the past couple of quarter actually didn\u2019t get better and so is there some sort of catch up with that number, what kind of acquisition ratio should we expect going forward? Is it bit different than what you have been running?","David Herzog","Yes. Jay, thanks. The sequence of loss ratio improvement is not substantive, but year-over-year it is substantive and the profit share is of course a look back mechanism. And so \u2013 I think where we are right, we\u2019ve restructured the underlying programs in the U.S. warranty business essentially instituting deductible and other risk management, arrangements which would change the profile of the loss ratio and acquisition ratio overtime.","Jay Cohen","Got it. And then secondly, the comment about a 1 to 2 point accident year loss ratio improvement I guess on the commercial side for 2015 -- and I guess it was John that said that -- can you discuss the drivers of that improvement?","John Doyle","Sure, Jay its mix of business really being the primary lever. It\u2019s also increased confidence in some of the risk selection and pricing tools we\u2019ve implemented over the course of the last several years. It\u2019s from improved claim service outside of primarily outside of the United States made big investments in our claims team and claim technology to improve how we run off the results outside of U.S.","And then lastly we expect the short-tail losses which you know as I mentioned were slightly elevated this year, the attritional short-tail losses to move back to a more normal state. So it\u2019s a combination of those things, but you know as I also noted given the amount of short-tail business we have it can be lumpy from quarter to quarter.","Jay Cohen","Got it.","John Doyle","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Moving on we\u2019ll take our next question from Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Thank you and good morning. First, for David, the lockup of the AerCap shares begins to expire this month and I heard that you've made a mention of that $6 billion to $7 billion of share repurchase and dividend in 2015 didn't include monetization of non-core assets. So I was hoping you can update us on your view in terms of when or if you can start to sell down that AerCap stake of $4 billion? Thanks.","David Herzog","Sure. The -- if part is pretty easy, its further contractual lock ups which the first one third expire actually next week. That\u2019s the how we could. We haven\u2019t commented on the monetization of this non-core asset I\u2019ll maybe ask Peter to share his views and perspective on it. As we have done before \u2013 as I said before it doesn\u2019t change our view of this as a non-core asset but we want to, will be very thoughtful as we think about maximizing value for our shareholders. So Peter, anything you want to add to that.","Peter Hancock","I think that we\u2019ve had a good track record over the last five years of making very thoughtful disposal decisions in the light of the value that we can realize and a patient approach to disposing of this non-core asset is what we think makes sense. It\u2019s quite accretive to our coverage ratio from a raisings perspective and in our stress test while as an equity, a concentrated equity position on the face of it, it was seen like a hot potato. I would not describe it that way because we have extremely comfortable capital accretions from a stress testing perspective. So I think we have time on our side, but we recognize it\u2019s a non-core asset and if we receive a favourable offer for it, of course we will dispose a bit and then redeploy that capital to our core operations.","Jay Gelb","All right that makes sense. Then on the ROE expectation, if I think about 50 basis points of improvement starting at a 7.4% level for this year normalized, I\u2019m just trying to get a qualitative perspective of why Peter you and the board feel that that\u2019s adequate to potentially not get to 9% before even 2017.","Peter Hancock","Well we have a long term goal of getting north of 10% as I stated, and most importantly getting it above our cost of capital and so we look at the interaction of what we\u2019re doing to reduce our cost of capital in particular de-risking the company and focussing the quality of earnings on really repeatable sources.","So, sure we could get to the target quicker, but we\u2019d probably be at the expense of sustainability of earnings, quality of earnings, and we have judged that this is an appropriate pace that continues to demonstrate our commitment improving returns while doing so in a sustainable way. And so we\u2019ve made careful tradeoffs to improve the returns and it would be very transparent about that process.","Jay Gelb","All right. And then last one, on the life risk-based capital ratio currently at 490% when we hear from other large life insurers like Met and Prudential, they are targeting more in the 400% to 450% range. So I'm wondering if you still might have more room to bring down that RBC in the life business.","Peter Hancock","Thank you, Jay. As we have said I think in the past, our range, target range is somewhere in that business between 425 and 470, that\u2019s a range. So we\u2019re at 490. We\u2019ve taken very substantial amounts of capital out of those companies, so the short answer is yes, we still have more room to reduce that but again we\u2019re pretty clear and we\u2019re clear with all our stake holders what that range is and we\u2019re going to be very methodical and measured about how we do that. But, we\u2019ve made clear what our range is, we\u2019ve obviously taken very substantial steps to get close to that, remember last year we were north of 560 or 568 a year ago. So we\u2019ve taken meaningful steps, so I think those actions should give you some sense of how we are thinking about it.","Jay Gelb","Thank you.","Operator","Moving now we\u2019ll take our next question that will come from Adam Klauber from William Blair.","Adam Klauber","Well thanks, good morning. The retirement and life generally -- it was a weaker quarter; our income was lower than it has been really over the last five or seven. Should we think about this as more of a typical quarter, or should we think about it, look at the context of those segments more on an annual basis versus the fourth quarter?","Peter Hancock","Yes thanks Adam. Look I think in part of the difference in the income came from the performance and the alternatives and partnerships which you know I think is kind of a normal course of business. We have seen a little bit of deals compression but nothing unusual in this quarter. We did have the IBNR reserve, the ongoing activities from 2011 associated with the identification of policy holders and beneficiaries, which is a process involving a third party vendor provides us information we have to engage in the matches and you know as that process comes to near a conclusion you know we have to respond to the matches that are occurring and the identification of those policy holders.","A lot of these are very small face amount policies, a lot of them go back a number of years and matching you know is not an automated process. And those are some of the anomalies, you know as I mentioned that the current rate environment and by that assuming a 10-year key around 180 this is where we expect a drift of four to six basis points per quarter in the base yields. That\u2019s a trend that will depend upon what the future rate environment is.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And then in group retirement you mentioned a couple large accounts left or were consolidated. Do you think there will be more of those or are they one-off and do that have any impact on their quarterly financials?","Peter Hancock","So we don\u2019t, first of all I think it\u2019s important to note we don\u2019t anticipate a substantial impact on earnings from these larger cases and with respect to the larger cases they don\u2019t always come up for revisitation, we see nothing on the horizon at this juncture, of course you can\u2019t anticipate where consolidations may occur. And as you know there are consolidations in a number of industries especially healthcare associated with the recent developments in those industries. So we do see them as part of a normal aspect of the environments and they are essentially one off items.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And then in the commercial insurance, on the P&C side, we saw good progress on the expense ratio. You mentioned you are going to continue to work towards that but in investments. So again, is this year -- is the progress we have seen this year better than we can expect going forward, or is it possible to see that type of progress going forward on the expense ratio?","Peter Hancock","As I mentioned in my opening comments Adam, we\u2019ll see some GOE improvement next year, I don\u2019t anticipate that it will get the same dollar amount dollar that we improved earning 2014 you know and of course the ratio will depend on other factors, but we do expect to continue to get more efficient.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question; will be from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling","Hi, good morning. So Peter, thank you. I think we all appreciate the clarity in your goals. I wanted to spend just a minute or two talking about them. Like Jay, I guess I am kind of surprised about the pace of recovery that is implied by the bridge to 10% and I wonder \u2013 obviously, first of all, make sure we understand that, but I also wonder more fundamentally, why is AIG's long-term goal only at 10%?","If I try to put this simply, many of your monoline peers in life and P&C all consistently generate solid mid-teens ROEs. Why shouldn't something higher be the long-term inspirational target? Is there something about the business mix or infrastructure challenges or capital requirements that\u2019s really going to be a permanent headwind for the Company, or is this something we just need to be patient and we are going to see upside to these goals over time?","Peter Hancock","Well, I think given where we\u2019re starting from to speculate beyond three years is challenging. The 10% in an environment if we have persistent deflationary pressures, low inflation and low investment yield. In our view is actually quite comfortably above what the cost of capital is likely to be at that point.","So our goal as we say in overall terms is have to sustainable ROE above our cost to capital, which is also a function of our risk levels. And so if others are running at much higher ROEs I suspect it is \u2013 because they choose to run their balance sheets with more leverage and are willing to take more risk.","And we think that we would like to position the company as a very balance portfolio of diversified risk so that that we can whether swings in these pricing cycles, swings in the economic cycles and be opportunistic in times of crisis where we think that there are tremendous one-off opportunities to add value. And I think that maximizing ROE inhibits that financial flexibility but making sure that their ROE is comfortable above the cost of equity of the company and from sustainable sources as oppose to short term risk taking of any kind. So we are very committed to improving the quality as well as the quantity of earnings and been transparent about that shift of mix.","Josh Stirling","Okay. I'm wondering if we could just briefly, similar sort of concept in a way, thinking about focus on returns and the environment. I think you guys disclosed pricing was down relatively notably in property. In commercial business I think overall you guys were flattish. How do we think about you guys maintaining your pricing discipline in the context of everything else you are trying to do when you are also still trying to grow?","How do we know that you are going to focus on margins first and sort of long-term health of the franchise second?","David Herzog","Well, I wanted to signal that very much in the $2.5 billion buyback, because we talk about one of the factor that let us to step up the pace of buyback was the fact that we had reduced risk in the business and in particular in commercial. And that\u2019s because we walked away from certain property renewals where we felt we were not getting adequately return rewarded for risk.","And so what we\u2019re really saying is that the pricing discipline comes with it a sense that the capital we have is precious and we will not deploy it if we\u2019re not getting an adequate return on it. So, prompt return of capital that\u2019s not deployed at adequate ROEs is our way of demonstrating to you and internally that we\u2019re not about volume or about value.","Josh Stirling","That\u2019s great. Thanks for the clear signal.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take our question that will come from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank","Josh Shanker","Yes. Good morning everyone. I just had some questions about the early debt retirement and when it occurred. Was there some debt that you retired in the quarter that already paid a coupon during the quarter, or more succinctly can we look at the 4Q run rate of interest expense as, at this point, a benchmark for looking into 2015?","David Herzog","Josh, its David, as I\u2019ve said in my opening remarks we expect based on full year expectation to have interest expense of around or just inside of $1.1 billion. So again, you can look at the fourth quarter as a reasonable proxy.","Peter Hancock","For 1Q and then go down.","David Herzog","Again, that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to give you a level of insight. I think it\u2019s important to note that our leverage ratios are very much inside our target area, our target zone and that effect on the low side of that, so I think we\u2019ve got plenty of financial flexibility, but we are obviously focused on balancing leverage and our coverage. So I think those are critical points you should take away.","Josh Shanker","Great. And on the incurred but not reported death claims, there were related charges taken both in 2Q, 2011 and 4Q, 2011. What solace should investors take that we are getting close to getting this \u2013 as an issue that is behind them?","Peter Hancock","Well, yes, that\u2019s true, I mean, this has been an ongoing process of working with new process for identifying deceased policyholders and their beneficiaries. We have much experience now with the vendor and with the matching process and we went through an extensive analysis. We\u2019re getting down to the last \u2013 I think process is with the vendor and we have some insight into what we believe is going to be coming in the matching process in the future.","So right now this is our best estimate of what we think will bring us to the conclusion of this process. But until we get the files from the vendor and engage in a physical matching we can\u2019t provide 100% guarantee.","Josh Shanker","And that charge includes the interest on unpaid claims as accrued since that time?","David Herzog","Yes. It does, in fact that was an aspect of one of the reserve increases that you noted before and so we do fully incorporate interest in the reserve.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Thank you.","David Herzog","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our question from Larry Greenberg, Janney Capital.","Larry Greenberg","Good morning and thank you. I'm wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on what\u2019s going on at VALIC. I understand the large cases that were lost, but I guess, in particular, it appears you have been pretty aggressive in managing crediting rates and I'm wondering if maybe that is having an impact on the business, just recognizing the flow of surrender activity and overall flows? And it also seems like the ROA has been trending down as well, so maybe just an update on the health of that business?","Peter Hancock","Actually we consider the health of the group retirement business actually quite strong. We continue recruit advisors. We have had I think good success with the process of expanding some of the product portfolio that we\u2019re able to represents in that business. And while it is true we are and we continue to be disciplined in our new business pricing.","We don\u2019t see the loss of these large cases as relevant to that. We continue to invest in this business. We invest in our record-keeping capabilities and also our advisory capabilities and we\u2019re also introducing a kind of a retirement\u2019s information center to help educate our customers there.","The most important part of the margins in this business or in the smaller and medium size cases and in the ongoing contributions, so we do not get necessarily distracted by some of the consolations that occurred in the large case area.","Larry Greenberg","So other than the large case activity, its pretty much business as usual there?","Peter Hancock","It\u2019s certainly a competitive environment and we are monitoring very carefully the developments in that business, but like I said we continue to invest in that business and we are comfortable where we are. Clearly yield environment is something that impacts that business as well. And we are investing in substantial technology to improve our position.","Larry Greenberg","Great. And then just finally, on the life RBC ratio, was the decline for the year driven entirely by dividends up to the parent, or were there any adjustments made for low interest rates as well?","David Herzog","[Indiscernible] the short answer is no. That\u2019s a substantially all of the decrease in the RBC was related to the dividend close. We did provide additional reserves for cash flow testing, but those were insignificant relative to the rest of the decline from distributions.","Larry Greenberg","Great. Thank you very much.","Liz Werne","Hey operator, I think we only have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Certainly. We\u2019ll take in our final question from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Peter, I just wanted to ask you a few questions about your 9% ROE goal for 2017. Should we view that as a \u2013 is that a goal, is that a plan? What are you contemplating for interest rates, now does that assume rising interest rates, flat can you just give a little color there?","Peter Hancock","So first of all I wouldn\u2019t describe it as a goal. Our goal is \u2013 our broadest goal is to have a sustainable ROE comfortably above our cost of equity and secondly we\u2019ve restated our long term goal of 10%. The full cost which is what I have provided over the next three years of 50 basis point improvement per year is premised on an interest rate environment that reflects the forward curve in the market. So whether the market is right or wrong your guess is as good as mine. We tend to run at fairly carefully match duration book of the company, don\u2019t speculate on interest rates but I think that the interest rate assumption that we\u2019ve used in our financial planning is based on the forward curve.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. This is just an editorial comment by me but I think one thing being lost here is the fact that you also mentioned you are expecting 10% book value growth. So I would just comment that 50 basis points of improvement per year with 10% book value growth is actually a pretty solid level of earnings growth implied, for whatever that is worth.","David, and just to clarify, if I understood your comments correctly the $2.5 billion buyback authorization is expected to be the pace in 1Q and then should we then expect a falloff? I assume that is funded by the de-access that was taken out of the life company and then should we expect a falloff to get to that, I guess, $6 billion to $7 billion of total capital return, including dividends for the balance of the year? Is that the right pace to think about?","Peter Hancock","Tom\u2019s its Peter. I think that the concept of the buyback being funded is I think combining solvency risk with liquidity risk in a way that I wouldn\u2019t. As you noticed in the last quarter we issued a substantial amount of very long term debt at a very effective level so we have comfortable liquidity in the holding company. And so as we look at this scale of buyback it\u2019s not really constrained by liquidity, it\u2019s really driven by risk.","And so as we look at how the risk profile of the company changes, the RBC levels and dividends up from the subsidiaries is simply one indicator of enterprise risk, but the more we the rating agencies and the Fed look at the company as one combined enterprise we start to see that we have substantial capacity to cope with the risk level of the company because the company has been substantially derisked over the last five year and we continue to de-risk the company. ","And as I mentioned earlier, as we exercise discipline in terms of new business writing we may find if the pricing environment in the P&C side is softer further capacity because of less risk. That may not be reflected in the short term and RBC ratios. So I just want to make sure that we recognize this is not literally dollar for dollar funding its separating the liquidity management which is comfortable with a view towards managing enterprise risk well within our risk appetite.","Tom Gallagher","Understood Peter on their sources and uses comment. Am I right about their pace though that you all expect?","Peter Hancock","So I think that the pace you can incur [ph] from David\u2019s 6 to 7 for the full year which would suggest it\u2019s somewhat accelerated pace in the first quarter, but reminding yourself that it excludes any non-core asset disposals or accelerated unwind of a dip.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks. And then one last one, Kevin, one thing that stood out in your businesses was pretty strong improvement in international. There was a drop off in revenues but then margins also picked up, can you explain what was happening there?","Kevin Hogan","Well you know Tom an important part of the improvement does come from Japan and we have been working on the overall rate adequacy in that environment in addition to enjoying an unusual year with respect to the automobile loss ratio that was a feature of and the change in the way non claim discount bonuses that actually driven down frequency to the entire market and then the fuel prices which ironically were high at the time you know also reduced the amount of driving and that led to a substantial improvement there.","I think in terms of revenue, there is an underlying improvement in our growth, but it is not as dramatic as the improvements in both loss ratios as we\u2019ve instituted many of similar underwriting tools as to what commercial has successfully used over the last couple of years.","Tom Gallagher","Okay and so it\u2019s Japan auto driving the improvement \u2013 so is this do you think this is a good new run rate would you expect continued margin improvement from here?","Kevin Hogan","The Japan auto was unusual in that the prices of fuel were high they are not anticipated to stay high, so we do not expect frequency to stay that low, but Tom the improvement in the underwriting actually comes across the board, it\u2019s not limited to Japan. The implementation of the tools that I mentioned are having an impact on rate adequacy and portfolio quality across the board, as we actively manage the portfolio. So don\u2019t anticipate the loss ratio as a fourth quarter as a run rate there\u2019s a number of anomalies we had a very benign CAT environment, severe losses below our expectations and also the unusual situation in Japan.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Liz Werne","Thank you everyone and we will be sure to follow up with everybody who\u2019s still in queue.","Operator","And thank you everyone. That will conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation."]}}
