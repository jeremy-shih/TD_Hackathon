[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael A. Salop","Thank you, Lauren, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's first quarter 2015 results, and then we will take your questions.","The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab, and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.","Today's call is being recorded and our comments include forward-looking statements.

Before I discuss the quarter, I want to mention the situation in Nepal following the tragic earthquake last weekend. Our thoughts and hopes are with the people of Nepal, and the Nepalese diaspora community around the world during this time of need, and we are implementing a variety of measures to assist the recovery efforts. Western Union is committed to helping the communities we serve around the world and we plan to continue to support relief programs in Nepal during the rebuilding process.","Turning to the first quarter results. We delivered a good start to the year as each of our business segments produced constant currency revenue growth. Operating margins improved and earnings per share increased 5%. These good results were achieved despite operating in a challenging global economic and geopolitical environment, including the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.","In the first quarter, Western Union consumer money transfer revenues increased 2% in constant currency terms, which was consistent with the growth in the fourth quarter of last year.","Westernunion.com produced strong growth with transactions increasing 25% and principle growth even stronger. Westernunion.com growth was led by the U.S. market, where almost half of the transactions were initiated on a mobile device. We also further developed our account payout business, which represented over 25% of the cross border principle going to westernunion.com in the quarter.","The retail money transfer business remained resilient, with good cross-border growth from outbound markets, such as the U.S., Germany, The U.K., United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, offsetting outbound weakness in Russia and some parts of Africa. We continue to see fairly stable cross-border pricing environment and our net pricing investment in the first quarter was minimal.","","As we discussed last quarter, we have implemented some price reductions in the U.S. domestic money transfer business, which were rolled out in April. However, even with these actions, I am comfortable with our pricing strategies and expect full year pricing to remain in the low single-digit range as a percent of revenue.","As we mentioned, when we provided our outlook at the beginning of the year, we expected market growth to be challenging in 2015, some of you may have seen that the World Bank published its revised remittance outlook earlier this month. The bank is projecting very slight cross-border principal growth for 2015 with a positive outlook for the U.S., offset by weakness in Europe and Russia and the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar.","The revision is not surprising and it's consistent with the business trends we saw at the end of the last year as well as the translation impact of the stronger dollar. The World Bank does project remittance principal to return to 4% growth level in 2016 and '17.","Turning to Western Union Business Solutions. Constant currency revenue growth improved to 7% in the quarter. We continue to believe the B2B business will provide strong growth over the next several years, and as the revenue increases, the profitability should accelerate.","Business Solutions also brings special capabilities to Western Union, as we look to expand our cross-border engine and offer multiple services to new types of partners in the future. Current examples include offering account-to-account branded and white label cross-border services to financial institutions, and offering cross-border tuition payment products to universities.","Returning to the first quarter results, consumer bill payments produced 11% constant currency growth, which was driven by the Argentina walk-in and the U.S. electronic bill pay business.","Finally, we continue to invest in compliance programs across our businesses as we execute our multiyear plan to rollout key enhancements. Over time, I believe our compliance investments will give us a strong point of differentiation with partners around the world.","So 2015 has started out generally as we expected. There are external challenges around the world, but our business is performing. Cost initiatives and foreign exchange hedging programs are helping to sustain the bottom line, while we continue to invest in our global cross-border platform to reach new customers and client segments.","Cash flow generation remained strong and we again provided substantial payout to shareholders with $231 million returned in the quarter through share repurchases and dividends.","Based on our business performance to date, we are on track to deliver the 2015 full-year financial outlook we provided at the beginning of the year.","Now I will turn the call over to Raj to give you a more detailed review of the financial results for the first quarter. Raj?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Thank you, Hikmet. Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter results as they were largely in line with our expectations. First quarter revenue of $1.3 billion was down 2% compared to the prior year period due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, but revenue on a constant currency basis increased 4%. The impact of currency translation, net of our hedge benefit, reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $79 million compared to the prior year period.","In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue decreased 4% reported or increased 2% constant currency, while transactions grew 3%. C2C cross-border principal declined 4% in the quarter or increased 2% constant currency. First quarter principal per transaction was down 7% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to foreign exchange, as the decline was 1% in constant currency terms.","The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 7 percentage points. The differential was caused by a 6% negative impact from currency as net pricing in the quarter was 0 and mix impacts were small.","Turning to the regions. In the Europe and CIS regions, revenue declined 9% or increased 2% constant currency compared to the first quarter a year ago, while transactions increased 4%. Due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results, I will be referring to constant currency movements.","In Europe and CIS, Germany delivered good revenue growth in the quarter, but Russia declined as the economy continued to weaken. Although the Russia outbound business fell significantly, we did see good growth from inbound, which now represents over half our Russia revenue.","North America revenue declined 2% and was flat on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 3%. U.S. outbound delivered good growth again in the quarter with strong increases to cents -- on cents [ph] to Latin America and Mexico.","Our Mexico business continued to grow faster than the market, based on the latest Banco de M\u00e9xico data covering the first 2 months of the year. Trends in our U.S. domestic money transfer business were similar to the fourth quarter, with growth in the lower principal bands and declines in higher principal bands.","Total domestic money transfer revenue declined 3% on transaction growth of 2%. As we mentioned last quarter, we are implementing price reductions in our higher domestic money transfer principal bands to address the evolving market pricing.","In portions of the country, we are adjusting our domestic money transfer prices to $12.50 for transfers between $50 and $1,000. We are making these adjustments at retail locations in areas where we are seeing the most competitive impact and they are being accompanied by marketing and communication programs. The actions were just initiated this month, so we expect to report early results next quarter.","The westernunion.com portion of the domestic money transfer business continued to post very strong growth in all principal bands. This business sends electronically, but pays out primarily in cash at our agent locations across the country, with most transactions sent for Money in Minutes delivery.","As a reminder, domestic money transfer represents about 8% of our total revenues with about half of that in principal bands above $200.","As Hikmet mentioned, even with the price reductions in the domestic business, we expect our full year pricing investment for all of C2C to still be in the low single-digit range.","In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 6% or 1% constant currency, while transactions decreased 3%. Weakness in parts of Africa was driven by oil-related challenges in Angola and continued market disruption in Libya, but these impacts were partially offset by growth in Nigeria outbound, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.","In Asia Pacific, revenue was down 6% or 2% constant currency. Transactions in the region declined 4%. Strong revenue growth in Japan was offset by weakness in the Philippines and some other Asian inbound markets.","Revenue in Latin America and Caribbean region increased 4% from their prior year quarter or 10% constant currency, while transactions increased 6%. Results benefited from strong inbound business from the U.S. as well as outbound strength from Argentina, Brazil and several other countries across the region.","Westernunion.com C2C revenue grew 17% in the quarter or 23% constant currency. Wu.com transactions increased 25%, while U.S.-originated transactions grew 28%.","Electronic channels revenue in total increased 17% in the quarter and now represented -- represents 7% of total company revenue.","In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue increased 7% in the quarter or 11% on a constant currency basis. Similar to prior quarters, strong growth in the U.S. electronic and Argentina walk-in businesses was partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in.","Business Solutions reported a revenue decline of 1% or an increase of 7% constant currency. Strong growth in Europe, including from sales of our hedging products, helped drive the constant currency increase. We also posted strong increases in specialized products, such as education and NGO payment services.","Turning to consolidated margins. The operating profit margin was 20.6% in the first quarter compared to 20.1% in the prior year period. The operating margin improvement was primarily due to cost initiatives, partially offset by the expected increase in compliance expense.","As you will recall, we expect approximately $15 million to $20 million of savings this year from the programs implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014 and another $10 million to $15 million of incremental savings from the 2013 programs. Approximately $12 million of total savings were achieved in the first quarter.","Compliance expense was approximately 3.8% of revenue in the first quarter compared to 3.0% in the prior year period. This percentage may vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on timing of certain expenses and spending, and we continue to expect a range of 3.5% to 4% for the full year.","The overall impact of currency translation relative to last year was negative to revenue and profitability, but hedge gains helped to mitigate some of the impact, which is the intent of our hedging programs.","In the quarter, we recorded approximately $16 million of hedge gains on our revenue line and these also flowed through to operating profit.","From a margin percentage standpoint, the positive impact of the hedge gains was largely offset by negative impact from lower revenue and profits due to currency translation.","EBITDA margin was 25.5% in the quarter compared to 25.1% in the prior year period. Reported earnings per share of $0.39 increased 5% from the $0.37 in the prior year period.","The C2C segment operating margin was 23.1% compared to 22.9% in the prior year period. The C2C margin benefited from cost savings initiatives, which were largely offset by increased compliance expense as expected.","The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 18.7% in the quarter compared to 20.2% in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to increased legal costs and additional compliance spending, although the C2B margin did improve significantly compared to the second half of last year.","Business Solutions reported an operating profit of $2 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $4 million for the same period last year. The improvement in operating profit for Business Solutions in the quarter was primarily due to the impact of productivity and cost savings initiatives and lower amortization expense.","Depreciation and amortization was approximately $12 million in the quarter compared to $15 million in the prior year period.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $212 million for the quarter, while capital expenditures were $44 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.7 billion and cash of $1.8 billion. Approximately half of the cash was held by United States entities.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares for a total of $150 million. Our remaining authorization of $1.06 billion expires in December of 2017. We also paid $81 million in dividends in the quarter.","As you recall, earlier this year, we announced a 24% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.155 per share, and a new $1.2 billion authorization, share repurchase authorization. At quarter end, we had 517 million shares outstanding.","So we believe 2015 is off to a good start, given the challenges from a stronger U.S. dollar and softness in many global economies. Based on the first quarter results and our recent business trends, we are affirming the full year financial outlook we provided in February.","Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to just clarify your comment about full year pricing investment would be in the low single-digit range. Does that mean that it's closer to having kind of a negative 1% impact? I know you typically talk about the 1% to 3% range.","Hikmet Ersek","I think it will be in the lower part of that. So we are -- we don't think that we're going to have big price investments. I'm very comfortable with our strategy. We did not -- our prices are comfortable. We are competing in the market. We did some price investment, local price investment in our domestic money transfer business. But overall, total pricing actions will -- I'm comfortable with our current pricing strategies, Sara.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. Sara, last year the pricing was about 1% of revenue. In the first quarter, we were at 0% pricing. So I mean, that should just give you a sense of in the low single-digit range.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just on commission expense. It was up for the last 2 years after renewals of some large agents. How are you thinking about commission expense for 2015?","Hikmet Ersek","I feel generally comfortable about that. I don't think big increases here. Raj?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. I mean, the commission expense for this year we see as being flat to last year. We did have some larger renewals that impacted commission rates last year, but they are more stable this year. In fact, in the first quarter, we saw commission rates were down a little bit from last year, but for the full year, we expect commission rates to be about flat. And I would just add that longer-term our focus is really on lowering overall distribution costs for the business, as the mix of the business changes and evolves to be more of [indiscernible]","Hikmet Ersek","Let me give you an example, Raj. Sara, as you know, one of the biggest -- fastest growing part is account-based money transfer to be dropped money also besides retail, which is huge to drop also money and account-based money transfer to an account and these commission rates are totally different than with retail commission rates. So that mix, which Raj is talking about.","Operator","And the next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin David Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just want to start off -- I mean, just quickly back to pricing. I mean, this year, other than the domestic side of things, which obviously saw some pressure from competitors, it actually seems like it's been a more stable year, and I'm just curious what you see happening in the market. I mean, for a number of years, there has been tough competition coming and different types of competition coming, but again, this year it seems like it's leveled off. Do you think that we're in for a more stable protracted environment for a while? I mean, is there something about maybe the regulatories? Is that what's doing it? Or just a little more color on longer terms, stability on pricing versus anything else?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, first of all, the pricing has been stable the last few quarters, right? Not only this year, this quarter, I think, the pricing environment. Last year, we invested 1%, Darrin, on the -- but normal pricing, on the corridor-based pricing, and we're going to continue to do that. We're going to continue to do price promotion on certain corridors and we are doing it, but as a company, if we operate in 16,000 corridors in 200 countries, you have the flexibility to adjust your prices to the customer needs. So I think we're going to be stable this year on the pricing.","Darrin David Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, maybe just a better way to ask -- I mean, back in like 2012 when there was a substantial price decrease, what were the environmental conditions that led to that? I mean, it's something different now, maybe we are. It seems like maybe just a more appropriate run rate that's different now about then -- versus then?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I feel much comfortable, Raj, you want to add something, but just on 2012 -- I mean, as you recall, that -- our prices were quite high there. In some corridors, we were far above the market environment. And as I said, in 2012, I said, I'm going to do this pricing, they will come back and that happened because we were -- we adjusted our prices to market environment in 2012. And after 18 months, we had the first success after 24 months, there was positive revenue growth. I think most of the corridors are now quite stable.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, Darrin, I'll just add that we haven't seen a big reaction to those significant prices we did and there are just more costs in the industry as well that people have to manage through, which may be impacting other players.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, compliance costs, technology costs, so there are costs in the [indiscernible], yes.","Darrin David Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That makes sense. All right. Just one last one and then I'll turn it back to the queue. On the B2B business, the FX -- the more volatile environment from an FX standpoint we're in now obviously should help, and then I think it did help this quarter around hedging being used by some of your customers. Going forward, I mean, is that something we can count on now, just given the more -- assuming we have a higher volatile environment, I know year-over-year it looks like it will be that way for the next 2 calendar quarters also?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Well, if you're able to predict volatility, just let us know. I think the -- we're pleased with the performance of the B2B business. Yes, volatility helps in the short-term and it did help us in the first quarter. But if you look at the progress that's been made the last 3 quarters in a row since the middle of last year, we have accelerated revenue performance and the business continues to execute on its strategies. And given our market position, we believe we can fill in that low double-digit range. So volatility is going to help in the short-term, but we still believe strongly in that business and the outlook there. And we also -- we're able to improve profitability this quarter, which is a positive, and I think it's heading in the right direction.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, one thing, Darrin, on the Western Union Business Solution, also helps on our growth is the payments part, payment business. As I mentioned earlier, our university payments and our NGO products are growing very fast. So it's not only foreign exchange trading, it's really also students, for instance, Indian or Chinese students paying their tuition in England or in the U.S. when they come and pay their tuition. That environment is growing pretty fast.","Operator","And the next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I think just on the -- I was surprised on the Europe CIS side, held up pretty well. Transactions slowed. It looks like sequentially the revenue got a little bit better. Is that just a mix pricing issue? And then given what the World Bank commented on in that area, do you expect any sort of downtick in that region in your outlook?","Hikmet Ersek","I think mix is the right quote there, right answer, not only on the pricing side, also on the corridor side. It's also on the countryside. Russia is definitely -- outbound was very strong market for us, but the economic environment, oil price and so on did -- geopolitical issues, did impact our business there. Southern Europe is still challenging, however, U.K., Germany countries are doing pretty well, and that's good actually for our business. It shows again, being in so many countries that shows the strength of portfolio here. On the World Bank, the World Bank adjustment has been not only global adjustment, but brought down. It's not only on Europe. So I think they adjusted their numbers also recently.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. So it sounds like it wasn't much of a surprise to you. And just as my follow-up, I hate to ask it, but just this Iran OFAC disclosure in the Q, what should we be watching for -- I mean, could this trigger some fines? Just trying to understand what the implications might be?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Tien-tsin, this is Raj. We don't know much more than what's been disclosed in the 10-Q. We did identify one of our subagents was being on the OFAC list and we reported that to the authorities as we needed to, and really that's all we know at this stage.","Hikmet Ersek","And it's kind of a rule that we have to disclose this and what we did. It's really on what it says on the disclosure.","Operator","The next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about principal growth. It looks like total principal or at least principal per tran is down about 1%. I think World Bank is talking about overall principal being slightly up. So when you guys think about share gains or losses, how do you guys think you're fairing in the marketplace right now versus kind of The World Bank numbers in total?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Bryan, this is Raj. I think we're just doing just fine. Last year, our principal growth was 5% and that was also the growth in the market. The World Bank data, we certainly look at, but it's more directional at this stage than firm as all the data comes in from the various parts of the world, those datasets continue to get refined. So we're comfortable with where we are.","Hikmet Ersek","I think we're doing fine.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Our principal constant currency growth is around 2% for the quarter. So I think we're in good shape there.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And does it make sense to get more aggressive to try to take more share? And I know price is one lever, but you can also increase the amount of marketing. Just how do you think about gaining more share than the marketplace?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, first of all, we are focused on the profitable market share gain, right? I think both we have to grow and profitable growth is always our focus. I mean, just an example, we are putting a lot of resources against electronic channels or electronic money growth [ph], as you know, since 2012, about 3% of our revenue, down [ph] 4%, 5% and now 7% already of our total revenue is electronic. So we do gain market share. We are very pleased with our Dot.com transaction growth, 25% transaction growth, even our principal amount was there stronger. We are very pleased with our account-based money transfer growth. So I think we are focused. These are new customer segments. Still we see that there are new customer segment and we also look at the demographic, last time was that -- in more younger customers. They used us and they stick in also longer with us, so I think we're going to continue to do that.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Just last question for me. On the LACA, obviously, constant currency revenue spiked to 10%, that's up from 4% last quarter. Transactions went up to 6% from 2%. Is that just all the strength in U.S. dollar, so therefore, you saw a spike there? And then, I guess, the follow-on question on that would be, do you think that's sustainable as we go into throughout the rest of this year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","U.S. outbound business continues to do well, particularly to the LACA region. So that's what drove some of the growth in LACA. We also had good growth in our Argentina business as well as in Brazil and several other markets, actually, in that region. So even on a reported basis, the business still had decent growth and good transaction growth.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And is it sustainable, Raj?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","I would hope so. We'd like to continue, Bryan.","Hikmet Ersek","[indiscernible]","Rajesh K. Agrawal","But we'll see how the -- the U.S. outbound -- our perspective is that the U.S. outbound business will continue to show good growth this year, so that should bode well for the business.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Jamie Friedman of SIG.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Raj, I know you gave a lot of detail about the constant currency on the revenue side. Did you see any benefit on the expense side from the rise in the dollar?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. I mean, we have a fair amount of our expenses in the various foreign currencies and that's why we -- otherwise, we would've seen a larger negative impact on the operating profit line. So from a total currency standpoint, if I just give you the currency impact in total, it was about neutral in our margins because we had the benefit of the hedges, which flows through both of our revenue and our profit line, but it also -- the negative currency translation, just more broadly, for the business, largely offsets that margin benefit from the hedges. So the currency impact, the margins was about neutral. And what you're seeing come through the actual margin improvement are all the cost savings initiatives that we have in place.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes. And clearly, a lot of good work there. And then, Hikmet, I was hoping to ask you about the mobile side. I think you said in your opening comments, about 50% of your transactions at wu.com and now mobile. I guess, what -- so what -- how does that alter the behavior? Is that a younger demographic? Is that a more frequent user? Is the fraud less? Maybe some comments about how the mobile user might be different than the rest of wu.com?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, it's right, almost 50% of the U.S. westernunion.com users are mobile. We see younger demographics, that's true, but it's also lower principal bands. So people are using more mobile percent, $50, $70, $100, $150 in a very fast environment, while -- it's examples like while you are taking an underground, you get a phone call, emergency phone call, and you use your phone and send money and somebody in our 50,000 locations, all over the U.S., can pick up the money immediately. So the strength of retail being present in 50,000 locations in every corner and mobility, combining that has been seeing as a huge use case, and it's stronger growing part on the mobile and we do promote it also.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Ryan Cary for Jason. Just quick question. it looks like Asia-Pac continues to be under a little bit of pressure. I know you cited a slowdown in the Philippines and it looks like there's some challenging comps as well, but is there anything more there? And is this something that can recover over, say, the next few quarters?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","We're seeing -- APAC is largely an inbound market. So we're seeing -- because many of the markets are receiving the transactions, some of the key send markets have slowed down, so APAC is really just a beneficiary. The -- that's why they're getting the transaction and revenue growth that they are. So that's really the result because many of the markets in APAC are just receiving transactions from some of the markets that have slowed down. And in the Philippines, we've also put some higher -- more compliance rules and programs in place, which has impacted the business in the short-term.","Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And while it's still clearly very early, it looks like you purchased $150 million in shares in the quarter. Should we still expect to see the $1.2 billion authorization used ratably, so, say, $400 million or so over the year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, that's what I would still plan for, Ryan. That's still our plan. In any given quarter or in any given year, over these 3 years, we may be different from that amount. But generally, that's our plan.","Operator","The next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to follow-up on wu.com. We've noticed that the gap between transaction growth and revenue growth for wu.com has continued to narrow. Historically, you've done a lot of free promotions that led to a larger gap between these 2 metrics. Just wondering if you can give us an update on your strategy here in terms of pricing promotions for wu.com.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, on wu.com, we're very pleased with the growth. First of all, we had 23% revenue growth on a constant currency basis and that was on transaction growth to 25%. We have, historically, put some promotional pricing in place and done some other things to drive the various channels and products that we're offering in that channel. So you're just seeing some of that narrow in some of the pricing. We do continue to price that business separately from our retail business, particularly as we talked about DMT. The same issues do not exist in the digital business. So it's just being priced differently and some of that -- pricing that we were doing has just gone away that's narrowed the spread, if you will.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, just to make it clear, we are very pleased with -- really with -- Dot.com numbers has been performing very well. And it's just the beginning of the game actually. We are only in 25 countries, we are expanding. Like our retail money transfer business, we will be in 200 countries one day. And we are going to expand here and -- we started to initiate in San Francisco about 3 years ago. We had -- as I said earlier, electronic channels, we're only 3% -- 2% to 3% of our revenue, already 7% of our total revenue and major contribution of that is westernunion.com growth, and I am pleased. And it's only the parts. So we do promotions. The differentiation is that to get customers, new customers. And then once we get the new customers, we grow the revenues also. And always, we open a new corridor, go to the new areas, you do promotions and that's the westernunion.com, but generally with constant currency of 23% revenue growth was a good quarter.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then earlier this week, there were some news out about you guys exploring a pilot program with Ripple Labs. Can you just talk about how far along you guys may be exploring utilizing Bitcoin like protocols? And maybe talk about some of the opportunities and risks that this -- these technologies create for you guys?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Sure, Smitti, let me start. With Ripple, we're evaluating the possibility of a pilot with them through their infrastructure that they've created, but there's really nothing more to say about that right now. We're certainly aware of these other protocols and we are evaluating whether or not they apply to anything that we're working on, but...","Hikmet Ersek","I think David Thompson and the team -- our CIO and the team is constantly looking at different platforms to upgrade our platform. As I mentioned earlier that, our goal is to find new customer segments, new way of doing this business, but we are very pleased -- besides running the business, we are very pleased with our core business and we are always looking for other opportunities to upgrade our platform.","Operator","The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I guess, the first question is in your C2C business, there is this long term trend that transaction fee growth is shrinking as a percent of total, while FX and commission and other revenue, that portion is increasing. And I just wanted to figure out -- first of all, I guess, what's going on there? How sustainable is it for you to sort of increase the FX and commission part of the C2C revenue contribution?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes.","Hikmet Ersek","Will you do that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Let me start, Ashwin. The -- you may be referring to the growth in the FX line in the quarter. We redid these and rebalancing this past quarter between fees and foreign exchange, and it was really just shifting between fees and foreign exchange. There was no impact really to the consumer pricing and no impact net to our revenues. So it was just rebalancing of those 2 items and that was to better align with certain parts of our business in the market pricing. So there was really no impact to consumer pricing or to our revenues.","Hikmet Ersek","I think we did that in the past, although this quarter was a little bit higher, but we do that always, adjusting our FX rates and pricing the market environment. So that's portfolio.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then on margins, obviously, good job on margins there. If you could break out the impact from cost initiatives versus the offset from compliance, which seems to have stabilized now in terms of expanding, and then the hedge benefits that would be helpful?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Sure. Let me just start and see if this answers your question. The hedges that we had this quarter -- we had a gain of $16 million on our hedges. So that helped our revenue line, that also helped our profit line and that helped margins by about 100 basis points, margin percentage. However, the currency translation on our revenue and profits, the impact in margins from that translation largely offset the margin benefit that we had from the hedges. So currency impact and total was net neutral on the margins in the first quarter. And so what you're actually seeing come through in the margin improvement is the net benefit of the cost savings initiatives, offset slightly by the higher compliance costs in the quarter.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In other words, going forward is sustainable then?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Well, the cost savings are things that we already have underway. The compliance costs will vary from quarter-to-quarter, but those are the 2 impacts that are showing up in the first quarter. Obviously, the currency impacts will be potentially different each quarter and it's based on where currency rates are, ultimately, on how that equation will play out.","Operator","The next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Raj, I wanted to ask you about the domestic pricing. You're obviously going to lower that pricing yet. As Hikmet said, you still anticipate being on the lower end of the pricing decline that you've communicated in the past. So was this something you anticipated? Or is there some offset that is helping you stay at the lower end?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","No, it's -- we did anticipate it. And we had planned on making price changes in our DMT business. Even during the course of last year, as you recall, Kartik, we've been telling you that the cross-border environment has been quite stable. Having said that, we always look at our 16,000 corridors. We do price increases in some parts, we do price decreases. There is a balance of both of those things that are going on in the world. But generally, we haven't seen a big need for large pricing in the cross-border business and we knew and have, in our outlook, the planned pricing in our DMT business.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, also putting into perspective, Kartik, the DMT price is, as you know, it's only for certain events, and it's only for certain parts of the country where we feel competitive pressure. It's like a Street Corp. [indiscernible] pricing, which we've -- which we were doing earlier and we always choose pricing actions. So if you do that -- except the 2012 one-time correction, we always do on a very intelligent way looking at the corridors and where the competition is -- where to do it.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then on compliance costs, I think Raj you've said in the past that it might be possible to automate some of those processes and that might help you lower compliance costs. Are you at a point where you can start thinking about that? Is that something you could see doing in 2016? Or is this just a manual process that's very difficult to automate and the expenses are going to stay kind of where they are?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Kartik, we are very focused on optimizing our compliance programs. And in the short-term, and it's still the short-term, we've had to hire a significant number of people in the compliance organization, now over 2,000 people. And that was more than 60% of the costs in the first quarter on the compliance number, but we also are continuing to invest in technology, in automation of our processes. And over the long term, I do believe that we'll be able to optimize our compliance spend. I don't see it really stepping down from where we are in the near future because we -- the regulatory environment continues to evolve and it is complex, and it's a global effort. So I think we are at a more stable place in the current range that we have for this year, but our goal is always to optimize [indiscernible].","Hikmet Ersek","But I really believe that it will differentiate us to be partnered with different parts of the world. I think it's an investment that makes it special, that makes it [indiscernible] and to apply in different parts of the world with regulations. And I believe that it's competitive advantage long time -- long term.","Operator","We'll go on to our next question from [indiscernible].","Unknown Analyst","You guys talked about price decline in -- just in the DMT business, but overall, obviously, kept it flat for the overall franchise. Just wondering are you guys actually raising prices in certain select corridors? And anything that would be noteworthy?","Hikmet Ersek","We always raise prices or decrease prices in different parts of the world. We even change bands within the price -- within the 16,000 corridors. That's a part of the business we have been doing it for many years. And that's -- but it's nothing that big price actions that we're going to change our pricing strategy for certain time for near term.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. Just to clarify, [indiscernible], in the first quarter, the domestic money transfer pricing wasn't in place yet, so we didn't have that impact on the pricing.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, thanks for clarifying. And then secondly, just, Raj, on the FX hedge benefit, $16 million in the quarter, are you still expecting $70 million for the full year? Should it -- do you think it will come ratably through the year? Or any call outs by quarter?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, not by quarter, but we are still expecting about $70 million benefit on the hedges for the full year and that can vary a little bit depending on where exact -- where rates, currency rates are, but yes, still expecting about $70 million. We've assumed, just -- you know, we've assumed about EUR 1.10 rate, and obviously that continues to fluctuate around.","Michael A. Salop","Okay. Lauren, I understand that's the end of the queue. So we want to thank everybody for joining the call today and wish you a good afternoon. Thanks.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Thanks.","Operator","The conference is now concluded.

Third quarter were solid as we produced strong adjusted margins and improved consumer money transfer revenue growth, and completed significant action related to our previously announced restructuring program.","Digital growth remains strong with digital money transfer including westernunion.com and third party white label digital services increasing more than 20% in the quarter. Additionally, we're seeing digital services delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of constant currency revenue growth.","And we were able again use our strong cash flow to return significant funds to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We now returned well over $700 million year to-date.","Given our third quarter results and trends expected for the reminder of the year, we remain on track with our full year financial outlook. Raj will give you more details on the quarter and our restructuring activities within few minutes.","Before that I would like to review the long-term strategy and financial targets we announced last month including a 23% operating margin in 2022 and the low double-digit earnings per share compound annual growth for the next three years compared to our 2019 adjusted outlook.","As noted at our Investor's Day we have tremendous assets for cross-border money movement and payments. Let me recap these briefly. We have a vast global network, a strong brand, a distinct global processing and settlement capabilities.","Over time, our business and customers are proven to be resilient and they trust us to move their funds quickly and reliably. In recent years we have strengthen our compliance capabilities, added more digital services and expanded our network connections to bank accounts, mobile wallets and cards.","We continue to progress our digital expansion and our announced \u2013 and announced the opening of westernunion.com in India where consumers will now be able to sent funds cross-border to our service.","Although India is a traditional inbound country, we believe there is an incremental opportunities for outbound business. India is one of the fastest growing emerging economies and outbound remittances have been growing the last several years.","We have also implemented real-time cross-border transfer and payments capabilities via different channels. In addition, we have taken operational steps to make our platform more agile by investing in new technology, implementing lean processes and adjusting our operating model.","With this foundation in place, our new global sales will focus on opening our platform to more third parties use cases in both cross-border money transfer and payment solutions. We believe this will give us incremental long-term revenue opportunities.","This includes area such as e-commerce, marketplaces where we had already begun a collaboration with Amazon, as well as white label consumer money transfer for third parties, cross-border services for institutions and many other opportunities.","We mentioned some of the white label money transfer examples at our Investor Day and Sberbank in Russia and Saudi Telecom are continuing to perform very well and add growth to our portfolio.","We are now expanding this opportunity to other countries. We recently announced new white label and processing agreements with major financial institutions in Korea and Japan.","Our three-year target assume 2% to 3% revenue growth overall, but over the long-term we expect new cross-border solution services for third parties will contribute incremental growth to our business.","In our receiving where we consume money transfer business, we expect revenue growth will be driven by three primary initiatives. First, we want to create deep relationships with customers whether they ultimately transact in digital or retail.","Second, we plan to leverage data to better customize to user experience and maximize life time value. This includes using technology and artificial intelligence to expand our dynamic pricing activities at an even more micro level and provide customize offers to consumers.","And third, we plan to increase the productivity of our network by providing specialized customer and agent experience at top agent location based on sends revenue. This will include initiative such as digital self-service, priority lanes, real-time marketing offers, expanded product offerings and differentiated agent incentives.","In digital solutions, we expect revenue growth to be led by adding more business verticals. We are continuing to expand existing high growth areas such as education payments while also leveraging our EDGE platform and digital self-service offerings.","As we discussed last quarter, we have also begun a restructuring plan and are undertaking other efficiency initiative to accelerate profit growth and cash flow for the next three years while the new platform revenue initiative develop.","We anticipate these actions will generate $150 million of incremental profitability by 2022 in addition to providing additional funds for reinvestment in the growth of the business.","These savings combined with our revenue assumption support our financial target of improving operating margins to approximately 23% in 2022 and delivering a low double-digit EPS compound annual growth rate over the next three years.","We also expect to generate more than $3 billion of operating cash flow over the 2022 period and return $2.5 billion to $3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","So, we are excited about the future. Our cross-border money transfer business is solid and digital business is growing strong. Business Solutions has delivered better growth and we are expanding our presence in the very large B2B market.","In addition, we believe that we have incremental long-term growth opportunities by opening our platform to third parties. Overall, third quarter results were solid and efficiency initiatives are well underway.","Now, I would like to turn it over to Raj for a more detailed discussion about the third quarter financial results. Raj?","Raj Agrawal","Thank you, Hikmet. Third quarter revenue of $1.3 billion declined 6% compared to the prior year period, while adjusted constant currency revenue which excludes our divested businesses in the prior year period increased 4%.","Currency translation net of the impact from hedges reduced third quarter revenue by approximately $46 million compared to the prior year primarily due to depreciation of the Argentine peso.","The decline in the peso negatively impacted reported revenue by 2%, while the effective inflation on our Argentina businesses is estimated to have positively impacted both reported and constant currency revenue by approximate 2%.","In the consumer-to-consumer segment, revenue increased 1% or 2% on a constant currency basis, while transactions grew 2%. Total C2C cross-border principal increased 3% or 4% on a constant currency basis, while principal transaction was [Indiscernible] or increased 2% constant currency.","The spread between C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 1% with a negative 1% impact from currency. Pricing and mix offset each other as pricing positively impacted revenue while mix had a negative impact.","Turning to the regional results. North America revenue grew 2% on a reported and constant currency basis, while transactions declined 1%. Growth was led by the U.S. Mexico corridor and other U.S. Alpine business, which was partially offset by continued declines in U.S. domestic money transfer.","Domestic declines were generally similar to last quarter's trends. In Europe \u2013 in the Europe and CIS region revenue declined 1% or increased 1% on a constant currency basis with growth led by Spain France and Russia. Transactions in the region increased 6% aided by the Sberbank white label business.","Revenue in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region grew 4% on a reported basis or 5% constant currency while transactions increased 1%. Revenue growth was driven by strength in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, including benefits from the Saudi Telecom white label business and increased prices in certain corridors.","These benefits were partially offset by lost business due to hard currency limitations in certain African markets. The Latin American and Caribbean region continued to deliver strong constant currency revenue growth led by transaction growth in Ecuador and Chile.","Revenue in the region increased 4% on a reported basis or 12% constant currency, while transactions grew 10%. In the APAC region, revenue declined 13% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Transactions were down 6% in the region.","Transaction trends improved sequentially while revenue trends were similar to last quarter partially due to pricing reductions implemented in certain markets. Westernunion.com revenue grew 16% or 17% constant currency with transaction growth of 16%. Wu.com represented 14% of total C2C revenue in the quarter.","Cross-border westernunion.com revenue increased approximate 25%, but this is partially offset by declines in domestic money transfer. Business Solutions revenue was flat on a reported basis or increased 3% constant currency and represented 8% of company revenues in the quarter.","Constant currency revenue growth was driven by strong performance generated from customers in Europe, as well as increased sales and hedging products and strong growth in the education and financial institution verticals. Other revenues which consist primarily of our retail bill payments businesses in the U.S. and Argentina decreased 48% in the quarter which reflects the impact of the Speedpay and Paymap divestiture in May.","The Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina posted good increases in transactions and local currency revenue growth and increase in U.S. dollar terms as well. Other revenues represented 7% of total company revenues in the quarter.","Turning to margins and profitability, we will focus on consolidated margins as segment margins are not compatible with the prior year period due to reallocation of corporate costs following the divestiture of the Speedpay business.","We are also providing adjusted metrics to exclude restructuring expenses, merger and acquisition costs and related tax effects. The consolidated GAAP operating margin was 15.1% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the prior year period. The decline was primarily due to the impact of restructuring expenses from our previously announced initiatives.","We incurred $92 million of restructuring expense in the quarter with the significant majority attributable to severance. We continue to expect approximately $100 million of restructuring expense for the full year and approximately $50 million to be incurred in 2020.","Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 22.3% compared to 22% in the prior year period. With the increase primarily due to operating efficiencies partially offset by the impact of Speedpay and Paymap divestitures.","Speedpay and Paymap contributed about 50 basis points to last year's third quarter margin, while foreign exchange hedges provided a benefit of $10 million in the current quarter compared to a benefit of $4 million in the prior year period.","We expect adjusted margins to be lower in the fourth quarter due to timing of spending and planned investments, and we are maintaining approximately 20% adjusted margin outlets for the full year.","The GAAP effective tax rate was 16.8% in the quarter compared to 21.7% in the prior year period, while the adjusted tax rate of 18% compared to 11.8% in the prior year period.","The decrease in the GAAP rate was primarily due to changes in estimates for Tax Act provisional accounting in the prior year period. The increase in the adjusted rate was primarily due to non-recurring benefits in the prior year.","GAAP earnings per share in the quarter was $0.32 compared to $0.46 in the prior year period with the decrease primarily due to restructuring expenses, adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter was $0.49 compared to $0.53 in the prior year period. Due to dilution from the Speedpay divestiture and a higher adjusted tax rate partially offset by lower shares outstanding.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, year to-date cash flow from operating activities was $665 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter were approximately $19 million. At the end of the quarter we had cash at $1.4 billion and debt of $3.2 billion.","We've returned $224 million to shareholders in the third quarter including $84 million in dividends and $140 million of share repurchases which represented approximately 6.5 million shares.","The outstanding share count at quarter end was 420 million shares and we had $1.1 billion remaining under our existing and new share repurchase authorizations, the majority of which expires in December 2021.","Turning to our financial outlook, we are affirming our three-year financial targets and 2019 full year financial outlook. We continue to expect GAAP revenues for the full year to decrease mid single digits due to the divestiture of the Speedpay business in May.","On an adjusted constant currency basis excluding Speedpay and Paymap from both years and excluding any benefit from Argentine inflation, we expect a low single digit constant currency revenue increase.","GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 18% while the adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 20%. We expect GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of approximately 18% to 19% and the adjusted rate approximately 19% for the full year. We continue to expect the effective tax rate in 2020 to be in the mid-teens range.","GAAP EPS for the year is expected to be in a range of $2.47 to $2.57, while adjusted earnings per share is expect to be in a dollar -- in the range of a $1.72 to $1.80. GAAP cash flow from operating activities for 2019 is expected to be approximately $800 million, while adjusted operating cash flow is expected to be about $950 million.","We continue to expect to spend between $5 million and $6 million on share repurchases for the full year and we have repurchased $475 million through the third quarter. In summary, we are pleased with the quarter's results and we remain on track with our full year financial outlook.","We have begun implementing our new global strategy designed to drive profitability, efficiency and long term growth. And we have made significant progress on the restructuring.","We have also continued to return significant funds to shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We look forward to delivering our strategy and financial targets and we will provide updates on key activities as we move forward.","Thank you for joining our call today and operator we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hikmet Ersek","Hi, Darrin.","Darrin Peller","Hey. Starting off on the revenue side, I mean, pricing looks like it benefited to you by -- I think you said 100 basis points. So, I think we saw some of those trends in the World Bank data too. I mean, is that a broad based macro trend you're seeing from a competitive standpoint across the industry? Or are you actually already starting to see some of the customized efforts you talked about at your Investor Day taking hold where dynamic pricing is already being implemented?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. I'd say, Darrin, the pricing benefit, we didn't quantify. We said that pricing and mix have largely offset each other. But we have seen in the market generally that the pricing is relatively stable. So we haven't really seen any pricing pressure certainly on the downside and it has been quite stable. As we do more dynamic pricing and as we bring more technology into the equation, looking at location based pricing or day of week and time of day. It actually is more difficult to actually distinguish between what is a pricing increase or decrease. And so we really want to get away from getting that because it may not be actually accurate. So we really are trying to drive the overall lifetime value of a customer as we modify our pricing strategy.","Hikmet Ersek","But generally I would say, Darrin, the pricing environment is stable and we feel we are quite competitive with our corridors. And as you know Darrin, being as Raj said, being in so many corridors and being so dynamic helps us to adjust the prices and really focus on the customer long-term value.","Darrin Peller","Okay. All right. That helps. And just one quick follow-up guys. I mean the -- you obviously call out a lot around the partnership model now and the ability to use your network for others STC and Sberbank is the notable ones. You mentioned others coming on. I mean, I guess I'm just trying to figure out the materiality of these to your transaction growth rates and how you'd expect them to impact transaction growth rates on the overall C2C business starting as early as 2020. I mean is this enough to move the needle and what kind of numbers of larger partners are you adding beyond the ones you talked about already?","Hikmet Ersek","So, the good thing is that let me start with the good news. It's incremental, right? Because we saw in the Sberbank for instance, the Sberbank transaction or bank transactions are happening anyway, but it's quite complex with the correspondent banking and they're choosing us to do it the easy way to transfer that. That really are incremental transactions. They're not cannibalizing in big picture our business, our existing Western Union branded business, right?","I think from the -- it's still as you know four or five examples worldwide. I just came back from a world tour and I just -- we just signed an agreement in Japan. We just signed an agreement in South Korea, which we are very excited. They are similar like Sberbank big banks. They want to use the platform to drop money worldwide. And that's kind of strategy is a long-term strategy.","As you also know for making agreements financial institutions are long term agreements, at the same time it takes some time to implement them, because you have to -- your IT steer systems has to be match with their systems. But given our open API we are very confident that we can really adjust it very fast. So I'm excited about that you know putting our platform and to the banks, because in that case we are not offering a new product. We are really solving a problem of the banks which they have and the money moves the account-to-account anyway. But with our real-time account payout it's really replacing their issue in most cases.","Darrin Peller","Okay. All right. Thanks. Thanks guys.","Raj Agrawal","Thanks Darrin.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey, good afternoon guys. I just wanted to see if you guys have any\u2026","Raj Agrawal","Hi, Jason.","Jason Kupferberg","Hi. I just want to see if you guys had any preliminary thoughts on where a 2020 revenue growth might land. I'm just thinking about it obviously in the context of the three-year guide. Some of these initiatives that you've been embarking on will presumably ramp to some extent next year. Others may take longer. So, just wanted to see where we should be thinking about a reasonable range potentially for next year, obviously assuming no major changes in the macro backdrop?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. Jason, I would say that we're still comfortable with a three-year view that we gave. Our assumption is that we're going to grow 2% to 3% and that's assumed just as a reminder that assumed about 20% digital growth which includes wu.com and some of these digital partners, but nothing that material. And we assumed a relatively stable retail business in that regard with their dynamic pricing and the engagement we'll have at the customer. And then we also seemed a mid single digit B2B growth over that three-year period. So, we're not really ready to get specific guidance for next year, but we're comfortable with the three-year view that we gave.","Hikmet Ersek","And also the new opportunities, Jason, our long-term opportunities, and once they get material we are really excited with the start, but once they get material we will give definitely some more color on that. So, it's early, but as Raj said, that we feel comfortable with our three years assumptions on revenue.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. And you've talked about the uptick in C2C constant currency revenue growth. I think we went from 1% last quarter to 2% this quarter. Does it feel like 2% is sustainable?","Raj Agrawal","Well, we know that the 2% to 3% [Indiscernible] three years assume that the consumer business in total is going to go 2% to 3% as well, right? The uptick in the quarter just specifically was related in large part to the significantly improved performance in the Middle East, right? And Saudi Telecom was a key part of that overall performance. So yes, we'd love to have it continue in that range. So let's see how things transpire here. But it was good performance.","Jason Kupferberg","Just one more from me; I was curious just as you continue to rollout wu.com in more countries. If you're seeing any distinct patterns in terms of how the usage patterns of the service tend to evolve when you actually launch in a new country?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think so. I mean, the India example which I gave earlier it's new example for us launching a dotcom business and receiving -- mainly receiving country. But don't forget India has 1.2 billion people and that's very fast growing economy with millions of emerging middle class and they are trading and they are connected globally. And they do want to send money. I think we have some important is there. We have to create the brand awareness there, obviously, send money also, not only to receive money. But we are very excited about that.","And also just one thing on India, we recently announced the real-time on an account in India. We made an agreement with UPI. UPI is a kind of kind of ID with the Yes Bank together, so you can drop immediate \u2013 we can really drop immediately money just with the phone numbers and with the name specially EPA name to the accounts to all Indian banks which we are the first there and we are first financial institution doing that for cross-border transactions through India. And we are very excited about that also.","So, to your question on westernunion.com it depends on the market. It takes time. But it is still a huge potential and I'm very proud to say that, remember Jason few years ago you asked me, when are we going to have the 10% of the revenue of the total revenue. Meanwhile we have 14% of our total revenues done by westernunion.com which and it's still growing with 20%.","Jason Kupferberg","Right. Well, thanks for the comments guys.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Hi. Great. Thank you. Happy Halloween to you guys. The margin that I want to ask the -- you're running a little bit ahead year to-date what 20.6 [ph] it looks like ahead of your approximate 20. I think as you mentioned it will be a little bit lower in the fourth quarter. Is that normal way seasonality spending? Are you doing something unique? I'm just trying to get a good jumping off point here and whatever you can tell us on 2021 -- 2020 margin would be great too? Thanks.","Hikmet Ersek","It sounds like a slip of the tongue there. Yes. I would look at this year as being more \u2013 this quarter is being timing related. It similar to last year's pattern. It doesn't necessarily mean that that's going to happen every year, but there were some timing of spending and we do have some further investments in the fourth quarter. We could end up a little bit above or so a little bit more just depends on how we spend the money in the fourth quarter. But we're still comfortable with the approximate 20% outlook for this year. And as we had said at Investor Day, we do expect to get margin improvement each of the next three years. And so I won't get any more specific than that, but we are looking for margin improvement next year.","Raj Agrawal","Generally and as we start with our program, Tien-Tsin, I will say that really the lean management tools helps the company, how we think about our operating way, how we really look at our optimize business, but at the same time the growth shows also that we have potential to further growth. So we are not holding back, not investing and in Q4 I believe that we're going to continue to invest where the growth initiatives and that's but still improving the margins. So I'm very confident about that.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Okay, great. Real quick if you don't mind, Hikmet. At 2020 [Indiscernible] and the people there was very clear talking about open platform and strategy seems very clear everyone's on board. I'm curious the pipeline for new potential partners here now that you've been more vocal and visible with it. How has that evolved here in recent weeks or recent days?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, as a sales guy I was on the road now the last 10 days around the world. I have to say that I met several CEOs and I have to say that we are really solving a problem for some big financial institution especially for their exotic currencies for opening our platform. And I'm very excited and there are some potential prospects here. And I believe that there's some more to come and I'm excited about that. Actually in Japan and South Korea we really signed ones, right? They are new partners there. They want to use our platform to drop money globally in a very efficient and compliant way and the fastest way, right. And real-time to millions of accounts and that makes me very excited.","And also Amazon is one of the examples that we are opening our platform to collect funds for a third party. It's their product. But it's our network. It's our machine. It's our engine and I believe that these are also contracts they will there are more potential here. I am confident. I'm going to -- you're going to hear more about that in coming years. And it's too small, obviously, and it's just beginning of a big journey, but exciting journey because as we show those in Investor Day the facts are there and they are still going.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Now it will be fun to track it. That's for sure.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Raj Agrawal","Thanks Tien-Tsin","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Keane","Hi, guys, happy halloween.","Hikmet Ersek","Hey, Brian.","Brian Keane","I wanted to ask on the earnings outlook. We're still the adjusted EPS range of a $1.70 to a $1.80 which then makes a $0.10 pretty wide range for the fourth quarter. I was wondering if you could share as to one side or the other that range or maybe talk about what would get you to the high end and low end of that range?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, Brian, It just takes -- it's a number of factors are going to determine where we come out of my range. The level of spending that we have on various initiatives, obviously, will have an impact to the level of revenue growth. So I mean, we gave you a wide range, but we're very comfortable that we're going to be in that range and where it comes out is just going to depend on a number of different factors that is hard to call at this stage. Just given the margin improvement that we had in the third quarter that just depends on how much investment we make in the growth initiatives. So \u2013 but we're comfortable with that range and we'll see where that comes out. And again as we had mentioned at Investor Day, we do expect to get low double digit type of earnings per share growth over the next three years. So it should set up well for next year and the year after.","Brian Keane","Is one of the wildcards for the fourth quarter just how much marketing or how much additional spend in investment goes in?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. Marketing is certainly one of the key investment areas.","Hikmet Ersek","I'm not sure it's the wildcard. We know what we are doing.","Raj Agrawal","Yes. No, I mean, it's not a wildcard. We know what we're doing but it just depends on how much we put forth there and -- but yes I wouldn't read too much into the wide range there. We're comfortable with where we are and we're tracking according to our plan.","Brian Keane","Yes. Got it. And then wu.com I mean it moderated slightly, I think was growing close to 20% moderate a little bit to 17%, anything to read in there or any tougher comps or something that created a little bit of a modest slowdown?","Raj Agrawal","Not really. I would just say that 80% of the business grew at 25% in wu.com which continues to be the highlight of the business, the cross-border piece, the domestic piece continue to decline so that -- the domestic part of wu.com was slightly worse than last quarter but in the same range. So that's certainly having an impact. And then as you saw in our notes overall digital growth including the white label partnerships grew more than 20%.","Hikmet Ersek","That includes also domestic.","Raj Agrawal","Yes. That also includes domestic, obviously all of that. So the total digital business including the white label partnerships grew at above 20%. So we're pretty comfortable that we can continue to grow at that level with the total business. So I mean, in wu.com we continue to have large expansion plans there. We think it's a great opportunity for the future and we continue to add geographies and channels to that business.","Brian Keane","Got it. Thanks for the help.","Raj Agrawal","Sure, Brian.","Operator","The next question comes from James Fawcett of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Priscilla calling on behalf James. Just a quick follow up on the pricing question. Last quarter you called out some pricing benefits particularly in U.S. domestic as you price up some of your products there. Was that also in play this quarter or was there something else?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. That's certainly a key part of the overall pricing list. As you've seen the transaction growth in North America was down 1% but revenue growth is up 2%. So we are continuing to try to maximize the overall value of the U.S. domestic money transfer business so there is some pricing embedded in there as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then, just a quick question on India and how you're thinking about entering some of these new markets? You mentioned that you have to increase brand awareness. So how do you think about going to market there, increasing brand awareness? Is this providing potentially discounted digital services in India so people know what the product looks like or is it just increased marketing spend. How are you thinking about that?","Hikmet Ersek","I think it's a similar market approach where we do it everywhere. But don't forget that India been for many, many years the receiving country. But emerging new, the middle class Indians want to send money and they want to use their account and westernunion.com to send money. More and more people they want to use connect their debit cards, their credit cards or their bank accounts to westernunion.com, and that's the thing. What we do it in every country when we launch a new country this awareness, but we are excited about that about India long-term because we never did that in such a huge country out front business and I believe that build a new opportunity.","It shows an example of Western Union, how flexible Western Union is in many country and how many opportunities we have. What kind of portfolio we have. And that part of investment will definitely help them. But it's nothing different than opening a new country.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ramsey El-Assal","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I also wanted to ask a bit about pricing and clarification. How far along are you with the sort of infrastructure to enable more of an enterprise wide rollout of the dynamic pricing and maybe I've just missed that that's already something that's in place. I just wanted to clarify whether the pricing power that you've displayed in the quarter was related to that or is that something that's more of a future state sort of implementation?","And then lastly I kind of more conceptually on the same topic, I just wanted to kind of explore with you or have you comment on the degree to which that dynamic pricing -- true sort of AI driven dynamic pricing might result in incremental pricing power as you're able to take price sort of more efficiently?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. I think, Ramsey, good question actually. If you look at our business being in 20,000 corridor plus, we've been doing dynamic pricing all the time. We adjust the pricing. You heard several quarters before and for several years I was talking about suite [ph] corner pricing and other activities. This is what we have done here is that we really go through more corridors. We've multiple the corridors with some product adjustment and pricing adjustments. And also if you download your westernunion.com you will see also so you can choose between different channels when you send money to different countries with different channels. It's like an airliner. We were adapting the pricing to the customer needs, to the demands and that has been different -- definitely power.","Now what we're doing is that we tested with artificial intelligence the certain corridors. We are really -- over the years, we will invest that because it's huge, right, 200 countries, different corridors, different needs and \u2013 but artificial intelligence is definitely something will give us power. The other thing is I mentioned again, the pricing environment generally has been stable. We\u2019ve been -- definitely, we have some competition, but we are products, our speed, our channels, our brand makes it, our compliance programs, our settlement programs, our platform makes it happen that our pricing environment is been -- has been stable.","Ramsey El-Assal","Thanks for that. Just my follow-up is on B2B and on your business payment segment. Can you talk about sort of which strategies? You see that such a large opportunity. Which sort of sub strategies you see within that segment that are available to drive growth. Is it focusing more on AP automation or global disbursements is something that we feel a lot of other companies especially some startups really making kind of hay out of. Just curious in terms of where you see the primary growth drivers in that or opportunities in that business?","Hikmet Ersek","I think our core business is doing the volatility, global volatility that on our core business is like hedging helps on the FX trading part. But I'm very excited about the verticals. The vertical acquisition like the university acquisitions globally and we're going to expand that also like middle tourism to acquisition of hospitals paying really, the consumer paying the bills in their local currencies and able to study abroad and\/or their parents paid in local currency and send their kids abroad to study.","I think that's going to continue, the verticals going to continue, but also our EDGE platform which serves the SMEs exporters and importers where they meet online on the platform and really connect them. That's also a growth opportunity. So I believe over years we will definitely have more payments focus. You will hear more about that because it's a huge market. As we demonstrated that the Investor's Day and we have a small portion of the market. And SME small size SME exporter\/importers continue to be very exciting for us.","Ramsey El-Assal","Got it. Thanks so much.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Hello, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Hi. So I wanted to start with trying to get more of -- more granular information with regards to the segments in geographies if you don't mind kind of going to because I do see that there's some pretty good acceleration in the Middle East South Asia piece, which I'm thinking maybe this is because of things like Saudi Telecom that agreement. But there's also deceleration in many of the other segments and normally quarter to quarter it's not this size of a move. So I'm kind of trying to figure out from a segment basis if you can provide granularity?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. Just on Middle East, Africa and South Asia just to reiterate some of my commentary. We had strong growth in Saudi Arabia and UAE and then we had a slight offset from the hard currency issues in parts of Africa. But overall the market improved dramatically from a revenue standpoint, so 4% revenue growth, 5% constant currency. Saudi Arabia was driven by a couple of different \u2013 well, primarily driven by the performance of Saudi Telecom that had very strong performance both transactions and revenue. And then some price changes in certain corridors.","And then UAE also had a good performance that was driven by some agent incentives and other things we're doing in the local area as well as some price changes. And then overall those transactions also improved. So Saudi Telecom I would say would be the number one highlight for the region. If you look at some other regions; Europe and CIS stayed relatively stable. Transactions improve there. That was largely driven by the Sberbank white-label business that we have which had high transaction goal [ph], less of an impact to the revenue side.","North America was relatively stable to last time. Latin America was a little bit softer, but Latin America has been growing in the double digit range for quite a while, right? So we saw Ecuador and Chile growing well and that was largely business going to Columbia because of the migration patterns we're seeing from Venezuela to the neighboring countries. And then Asia Pacific, we are doing price reductions there. So that helps. The transactions trends a little bit. There's still negative. But it helps a little bit but revenue for that reason stayed about the same. So does that give you a little bit more color, Ashvin what you're looking for?","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Yes. It does. I guess the one part that I mean I'm thinking any impact from Hong Kong and such in South Asia maybe -- in East Asia. Sorry, but that probably completes the picture there. So, then the other question I had was with regards to -- earlier this year obviously you guys took a look at the various businesses you divested certain assets. Is there anything else left in that process because you kind of look at the stub of the other revenue piece which by the way you guys continue to extract good EBITDA out of it. And then you look at B2B. Anything that you could be doing inorganically adding, subtracting, that is left to do?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. I would say that if you look at our strategic focus, it is really around cross-border, cross-currency, money movement. So, things that fit within that strategy we like and we'll continue to own and we may look for other things that help to supplement our strategy there.","And things that are not in that definitions or potential candidates who as to look at divesting but there is not much left. Really the only domestic payments business we really have left of any size is in Argentina. And Argentina has its own issues as you know.","So, there's not much more left there but we're always looking for acquisition opportunities that help to supplement our capabilities or can help to supplement what we want to do strategically over the next few years.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And a quick clarification if I can on tax rate. Because I was under the impression the tax rate over the next sale couple of years would be stepping down. But in the quarter itself it picked up just a tad.","I'm assuming this is just quarter-to-quarter fluctuation and nothing's changed with regards to our clear tax rate going down?","Hikmet Ersek","I would say the tax rate almost for this year is very consistent with what we've been saying all year. So, it's in that high teens range given the specific factors from this year but we do expected to step down into the mid-teens range for the next few years and specifically we expect through next year as well.","So, we're much on track with what we've said about the tax outlook.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it, thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Kartik Mehta","Hey, good afternoon Raj, and Hikmet.","Raj Agrawal","Hi, Kartik.","Hikmet Ersek","Hi, Kartik.","Kartik Mehta","I mean to ask you a little bit about your ability to use obviously a physical distribution system for other channels and Amazon specifically maybe because it's so much in we've talked about it so much.","But as you look at that particular product, has Amazon or you marketed the product outside the U.S. and some of the other emerging market countries. Or are you is that coming up?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, not really. Yes, it's coming up, it is really Amazon I believe that its first use their product. They're going to promote it, we're going to upgrade, we are putting our platform there. And it's really marking activist really didn\u2019t start it. It's coming up I guess.","And Amazon knowing Amazon they're very customer friendly. They want to have a 100% good a customer experience and everything. So, big global launch will happen. At the same time I have to say that so far the tester I'll we call it the start is going pretty well. And we have countries like Columbia, it's doing very well actually.","And some, it's really big launches coming up hopefully soon Kartik.","Kartik Mehta","So Hikmet, so it sounds like Amazon has shared with you that they want you launch this product globally. So, there is more consumer awareness. Is that of your statement based on your answer?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes.","Kartik Mehta","And then, just one question on pricing, obviously very stable. Is there a difference right now that you're seeing from just a physical distribution, the pricing in that channel versus the digital channel, is more aggressive than the other or is more one more and you said that is one more aggressive than the other.","Hikmet Ersek","Which say that again, Kartik. Digital is more aggressive than versus --.","Kartik Mehta","Digital versus retail, are you seeing difference on pricing.","Hikmet Ersek","Depending on the corridors.","Raj Agrawal","Yes, I think it really that's exactly the answer. It depends on 1000s and 1000s of quarters, the country pairs that. We sometimes we're very aggressively priced, Kartik, and this quite well but sometimes we\u2019re aggressively priced, at other times we don\u2019t need to be so aggressively priced.","And in another quarter is that its retail for example, we are pricing to maximize the value of our domestic when we transfer business, so it just depends. And I think as we migrate more dynamic pricing capabilities, ultimately our goal is going to be drive better lifetime value of customers.","So, that might mean that we reduce prices in certain areas we increase prices and we take advantage of conditions because ultimately as you saw at Investor Day we want that customer to not walk away without doing a transaction. So, we want to price the products that they do that last transaction with us.","Right, so it's just as we evolve to the more dynamic pricing capability, that's really going to be how we look at the business.","Kartik Mehta","Fair enough. Thank you very much, appreciate it.","Hikmet Ersek","Sure.","Raj Agrawal","Thanks, Kartik.","Operator","The next question comes from James Freeman of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","James Freeman","Hi.","Hikmet Ersek","Hi.","James Freeman","Thanks for taking my question. So, you guys covered a lot of territory today. I just did two upfront. One, in terms of the compliance, I'm sorry if I missed it, but are we still rise in the 3% range. How can we figure out that, that's the first one?","And then, the second one is you mention Argentina, I realize that there's only specifics to say but what is the narrative around that access field. Is that sort of strategic option for you or what should we be thinking about that.","So, one is compliant and then the other on I could see a stance.","Raj Agrawal","James, it was very hard to hear you.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes.","Raj Agrawal","But the first question was I believe compliance stand and the second question on --.","Hikmet Ersek","It's on Argentina.","Raj Agrawal","Let me James let me try to address and then you can let us know if we didn\u2019t if we have to assume more there. on the compliant stand, the last few years we've been very consistently spending roughly $200 million it's spend in that 3.5% 4% range.","We are trying to get away from giving specifics now on the compliance and because it has been so stable. Obviously we can never predict the future, it depends on where regulation goes, but we feel very good about our compliance capabilities and in program.","So, it's been very stable would be the message I would give to you there. And then, on Argentina, I didn\u2019t quite understand your exact question there. Do you mind repeating that one more time on Argentina?","James Freeman","Yes. I my other question is and I'm sorry about the bad connection, it was connected in the phone that had. But the pads with your product and is that --.","Hikmet Ersek","Pago Facil?","James Freeman","Pago Facil, is that the strategic options there or is that something you've taken away, then how should we think about that.","Hikmet Ersek","It's not worth the domestic bill payments business. So, I would just say that it produces good cash flow. But it's not necessarily doesn't necessarily fit within the broader strategic area that we want to focus, which is cross border, cross currency money movement.","But we like the Argentina business, it's been a good producer for us and it is a part of our portfolio and that's how we have.","Raj Agrawal","I think Argentina business has been part of our portfolio. We do use locations, the Pago Facil locations also for inbound outbound business. And it has been a stable business for many years and we have good management there. And but our focus continue. It's a very small part of our business, output is continue to be in cross border cross currency.","James Freeman","Got it, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, -- pardon me. I appreciate you taking the question this afternoon.","Hikmet Ersek","Andrew, how are you?","Andrew Jeffrey","I'm doing well, thank you. It's interesting to see this, to me this' is kind of juxtaposition between the revenue growth of the business which is clearly stabilizing and picking up in some cases. And then, this commitment to return of capital which I think the markets really like this here by the way.","What I'm trying to understand is, is there some point recognizing you've given us this multi-year plan. Where if you see real success with some of these newer initiatives that you're calling out especially considering your compound multiyear revenue growth is essentially being driven by essentially 20% of the business.","Will you choose to reinvest and maybe accelerate growth around some of these newer initiatives or how you're going to evaluate that versus just sort of being debts that are returning this capital shareholders?","Hikmet Ersek","I mean, capital we are very committed to return the capital to our shareholders and our strength cash flow is continue to going be there and we are very committed. But let me step back and tell you we are so successful with our opening the platform why we believe that we're going to be successful.","It's the correct, maybe. And the first signs looks like we're going to continue to be successful. We blow up the platform over to years which gives us the capability to offer our platform to third parties which the others don\u2019t have it. The compound capability, the settlement capability and 137 currencies, real-time capabilities and accounts and wallets and cards.","It's a huge platform for 200 countries capable, legally capable, its operating 200 countries. These are a huge competitive advantage and we have them already.","Now we just our bills wants to open our platform to the third parties which doesn't need additional big investments. Really, we are looking at our processes optimizing our process open our platform to third party, that's a big advantage that maybe others don\u2019t have it.","So, our platform and the password, Western Union customers now we are really opening to the platform to solve an issue of our third parties. They're going to move money anyway but in a hard way but if they use us, it will be easier way. And that's the incremental part of that revenue.","Of course we will, look at that is the incremental opportunities we were going to invest this, but I don\u2019t assume that we will have a huge different investments which will affect our margins and we are very committed to our three years margin expansion.","Raj Agrawal","Yes. The only thing I would just add is that as we had said Andrew on at Investor Day, we are saving, we're driving some more savings than just the $150 million by 2022. And that is with an eye towards investing back into business to drive some of these longer term growth opportunities.","So, we have enough investment allocated to some of these things and we'll just to see how the experience is over the next few years as we think develop.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And then, as a follow-up, the gross margin cost of services as a percentages has been pretty stable. It's been increasing a little bit. Are we to the extent you're driving operating leverage. Is it coming more from OpEx as opposed to cost of goods.","I know this is you haven\u2019t been capitalizing a whole lot of commission costs. It certainly would seem like it's a fairly benign agent environment.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I would say that we certainly the fixed expenses will be an area where we get a significant amount of our savings but we also as you've heard are driving toward efficiencies in our cost of sales. And so both will certainly be a factor but and we want to try leverage.","As we look at commissions, it's a number one cost item in the company. So, we have to look at that, we have to find a way to be more efficient there and we believe we have the right strategies there and so yes we're getting leverage on our entire cost structure let's say and that's a part of the overall formulas.","We get the revenue growth, we also get leverage as we keep those costs pretty stable.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. I appreciate it, thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Sure, thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from David Scharf of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","David Scharf","Oh yes, and thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to just follow-up with one more question on the XP platform initiative. And I'm wondering, it clearly all the investments in compliance over the years have positioned this to effectively outsource those programs and relationships.","And I just wanted to sort of double check. Is there any additional compliance or risks or maybe just requirements that you could potentially foresee having to address based on opening up your API and inviting third parties to leverage the platform.","Hikmet Ersek","Well moving money cross-border cross-currencies always complex. It's very regulated and obviously the complexity of the business understanding the complexity of the business the competitive advantage for us. And we know it how to do it but at the same time there is also risk always of course.","But we believe we are very well positioned to answer or to respond to many questions and many regulatory requirements that global regulators have. If we think that in 200 countries and 137 currencies definitely it has something. I don\u2019t see additional risk because if you're opening your platform already to the banks, it's a kind of know your customer environment already done.","But our team is very diligent to choose the right partner, our team is very much investing to look what how we can move in a very compliant way worldwide and we are very dedicated. We have a great compliance team, we have a great legal team.","And they are really within the advising us and within our business mobile here and that's we see that compliance and on the money lending activities and responding to them as a competitive advantage.","David Scharf","Got it. And I would imagine it's no different from the way you've had agents as well. Okay, thank you very much.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Raj Agrawal","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","And Andrew, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Next question will come from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Tim Willi","Great and thank you very much for the time. Two questions, the first one was just a housekeeping on the modeling. Raj, could you go back through the margin impact was from the Speedpay divestiture, just to sort of make sure I got that accurate sorted in my own thought process over the next couple of quarters.","Raj Agrawal","Alright, yes. I mean, if you look at our financial tables, we have quite a bit of detailed information in the tables. So, last year Speedpay and Paymap generated about $370 million of revenue and a $110 million of direct profit. And they had a margin benefit to the business of around 70 basis points.","And then this year we had a 40 basis point benefit in the first quarter and then no benefit in the second quarter and we sold it obviously in May. So, no further benefit there. So, it should give you a lot of details in the tables.","Tim Willi","Okay. I'll go back to those. Thank you for framing out. Second question I had was just on wu.com given the length that you've now had this business and the success. And obviously you want assuming lots of repeat customers that are probably been with you now for some time.","I guess, going back to an earlier question about pricing. Just any insights or color you could share around if you sort of test and think about pricing and the stickiness of customers given the duration of how long they've been with you and just any sort of thoughts around engagement.","Do you think people are truly exclusive to wu.com or do you think there are people out there that their activity might say hey you might have another digital money transfer that will, you should ship on their smartphone as well because they got comfortable with the ease of using wu.com maybe thinking about trying out some of the else's service or you feel like people are still pretty exclusive to you.","Raj Agrawal","No Tim, great question actually. The big difference between dot com and walk com [ph] is that at the dot com you have to pre-register yourself. You have it really acquisition in the beginning. And once you're on those system when we do the our customer and everything. ","You're nearly the, the loyalty is huge within the westernunion.com. One of the reason is that no one can match our distribution, met to it worldwide. So, you collect funds where dot com and you can send money anytime so one of the 500,000 locations or one of the billions of accounts.","And in real time. And it took us well to develop the both size and that makes the customer loyal. Once you can send money to your grandmother in Uganda to the next corner, and in minutes drop money in our location or to India to an account in minutes really going in minutes without any issues.","That loyalty is definitely something that we admire. Saying that in the new countries then we are very focused on acquiring new customers and the existing countries are real which we've been longer time be Wes dot com, it's all about customer experience and customer loyalty.","And I am completely excited about the western union dot com. The study definitely in western union dot com all about the customer.","Tim Willi","Great, thank you very much, really appreciate that.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Raj Agrawal","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Thanks everyone for joining. Have a good evening.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"22694":["The Western Union Co.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Laura. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's 2016 third quarter results, and then we will take your questions.","The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.","Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2015 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles.

Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, we are pleased that our diversified global business and strategic initiatives enabled us to deliver another solid earnings performance in the third quarter. And we accomplished this while navigating current headwinds and macro challenges in some international markets.","Our U.S. business remained strong. And westernunion.com money transfer accelerated nicely, increasing 28% in constant currency. This growth helped us balance all related softness in many of the Middle East and African countries.","We delivered good margins, coming in at over 20%, despite negative impact from currency and the legal matter accrual. And we continue to generate strong cash flow and returned significant funds to our shareholders. We are on track to deliver on our full year earnings outlook and are affirming our earnings per share range of $1.60 to $1.70.","Total revenue in the quarter increased 2% on a constant currency basis, with the consumer money transfer business increasing 1%. Within money transfer, the U.S. business was strong across the board with good growth from both outbound and domestic money transfer. Our U.S. to Mexico business continues to shine and has now outpaced market growth for principal and transactions in each quarter for the past three years.","In addition, we recently greatly expanded distribution in Mexico nearly doubling our network. This was driven by the activation of our transfers services at OXXO, which is Mexico's largest convenience store geographically with 14,000 locations. With this new service, customers can stage transactions on the phone in advance or through dedicated phones and digital kiosk in the stores and then receive their funds at the counter.","Turning to westernunion.com, this quarter's revenue increase is impressive, given the larger size of our digital business relative to competitors. We continue to see tremendous growth from the mobile app and the westernunion.com business was particularly strong in the U.S. markets. We also continue to expand our digital assets rolling out mobile apps in Canada and additional countries in Europe, giving us 16 transactional mobile apps in the market among our 37 westernunion.com countries.","In addition, in the U.S. and the UK, we have added a new omni-channel feature to our mobile apps. The customers can now fund 10 transactions from mobile apps via cards, accounts and also cash. This new feature allows consumers to start transactions on their smartphones and then pay with cash at agent locations adding convenience and reduce time for in-store transactions.","As I mentioned earlier, remittance flows from the oil producing countries have been affected by the low oil price environment, while this is not a new factor, we did see softening in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, key markets in the Gulf that had largely maintained growth trends until the middle of the year.","Overall, the C2C pricing and competitive environment remains quite stable as we had not seen significant changes in the marketplace. While there were some announcement recently concerning price changes for competitive services in limited areas, we don't anticipate this having significant impact on our business. We are very well-positioned in the U.S. to Mexico corridor with our 50,000 agent locations in the U.S. and 26,000 in Mexico and the very competitive fee of $8 on sends up to $1,000.","In the U.S. domestic money transfer market, all the certain competitors are lowering fees on very high principal transfer. This is a small piece of our business today. To put this in perspective, U.S. domestic money transfers over $1,000 represent less than 1% of company revenue. So overall, we are competitive with our current C2C product and pricing strategy and for the near future we do not anticipate major companywide pricing adjustments.","Turning to the other segments, the consumer bill payment business again delivered double-digit constant currency growth in the quarter while business solutions was flat. All the business solutions had good growth from its payments product, especially verticals such as serving clients in the education sector, reductions in customer's hedging activities negatively impacted results. Strategically, we continue to advance our EDGE digital platform for importers and exporters. We have enabled thousands of business clients for use of the platform which recently won Payments Innovation award in London. So, overall, we remain on track to deliver our earnings outlook, even with the many challenges we have faced this year.","Our strong financial position has allowed us to continue investing in our platforms including advancements in our digital technology and compliance assets and programs. And we are intent on further expanding our capabilities and network of digital and physical touch points. These include agent locations, mobile, online, accounts and kiosks, both direct and through our agent partners as we leverage our platforms to offer consumers and businesses freedom of choice in how and when they want to move money cross-border.","We will talk more about our long-term strategies in the coming months, but right now I want to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the third quarter results in more detail.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Hikmet. Third quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 2% or increased 2% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced third quarter revenue by approximately $52 million compared to the prior year.","In the Consumer to Consumer segment, revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 1% in constant currency, while transactions grew 2%. C2C constant currency revenue benefited from strong growth in westernunion.com, while regional growth was led by North America and Latin America.","However, softness from the oil producing countries continued to negatively impact the Middle East and Africa and part of the Asia Pacific region. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 3% or 2% on a constant currency basis, while principal per transaction declined 5% or 4% in constant currency terms.","The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 3 percentage points including a negative 2% impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 2% in the quarter and was affected by the principal per transaction decline, while pricing had a positive impact of 1%.","Turning to the regions, consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movements, as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. North America continued to deliver strong results in the third quarter. Revenue grew 6% or 7% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound sends to Mexico and Latin America drove the region's revenue growth. In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de M\u00e9xico principal and transaction data for the third quarter. Our U.S. domestic money transfer business also posted good results, as revenue increased 4% and transaction growth improved to 5%.","In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 2% or increased 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 2%. Revenue growth was driven by Greece and the U.K., partially offset by declines in Turkey. As a reminder, Greece was impacted in the third quarter of last year by government imposed market restrictions on money transfers during the country's financial crisis.","In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 10% or 8% in constant currency and transactions were down 9%. Lower oil prices continued to affect the region's results in the quarter, with trends weakening since the last quarter in Saudi Arabia, Angola and the UAE.","In the Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 4% or 3% in constant currency, while transactions decreased 5%. Received markets in the region including India continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil producing countries. Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region grew 3% and increased 8% in constant currency, while transactions grew 12%.","Revenue growth in the region was largely driven by the strong inbound business from the U.S. Included in the regional numbers discussed, westernunion.com's C2C revenue growth accelerated to 26% in the quarter or 28% in constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. westernunion.com transactions increased 29%, while U.S. originated online transactions grew 33%.","In the Consumer to Business segment, revenue declined 3% or increased 11% on a constant currency basis. Constant currency revenue was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which was partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. The depreciation of the Argentine peso continued to cause the decline in the reported revenues.","Business Solutions revenues declined 4%. On a constant currency basis, revenues were flat, as good growth in Europe was offset by reduced customer hedging activities, particularly in Australia and Canada.","Turning to margins and profitability, the consolidated operating margin was 20.2% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the prior year period. This quarter's operating margin was negatively impacted by 110 basis points from a $15 million accrual related to a previously disclosed FTC legal matter. This is in addition to the $15 million we accrued for this in the second quarter, as we have not reached an appropriate resolution with the FTC at this time.","Other negative impacts on the margin included foreign exchange, customer and funding mix in the electronic bill payments business and incremental technology expense, which were partially offset by lower compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses. Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $12 million compared to $21 million of gains in the third quarter of last year.","We continue to expect approximately $45 million in hedge gains for the year. Based on recent rates and our current hedge position, we currently project about $15 million of gains for 2017. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $22 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year.","Compliance expense has been steady and came in at 3.5% of revenue in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 25.0%, down from 27.1% in the prior year period as a result of the same negative factors that affected operating margin. The tax rate of 9.6% benefited from a 160-basis-point impact from the FTC accrual and compared to 12.5% in the third quarter of last year. We still expect a full year rate of approximately 12%. Earnings per share was $0.44 in the quarter, including a negative $0.02 impact for the additional FTC accrual and compared to $0.45 in the third quarter of last year.","The C2C segment operating margin of 23.4% was down from 25.5% in the prior year period and was negatively affected by 140 basis points from the accrual. The C2C margin was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange and higher technology expense which were partially offset by lower compensation related costs.","The Consumer to Business operating margin was 9.1% in the quarter compared to 16.4% in the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to customer and funding mix in the U.S. electronic business. The mix impacts related to the addition of a large new biller and lower margins and general increases in credit card usage as a funding option by consumers.","Business Solutions operating profit was $3 million or a 3.5% margin compared to a loss of $3 million in the prior year period. The operating profit improvement was driven by lower depreciation and amortization expense which relates to the write-down for a contract termination in the third quarter of last year.","Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $20 million in the prior year. The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 17.1% which compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of last year.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $822 million year-to-date through September. Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.2 billion and cash of $1.3 billion with approximately 50% of the cash held by United States entities.","After the quarter, in October, we retired $1 billion of maturing notes which had a coupon of 5.93%. We funded this maturity by drawing down on a $575 million term loan facility which carries interest rates of LIBOR plus 150 basis points, and through a combination of cash usage and commercial paper issuance.","During the third quarter, we paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $84 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $310 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of September was 485 million shares.","Turning to our outlook for the full year, we are narrowing the revenue growth outlook while affirming operating profit margin to EPS range and operating cash flow. The updated revenue outlook for the year is an increase of approximately 3% constant currency which should translate to a decrease of approximately 1% on a GAAP basis.","Operating profit margin for the full year remains approximately 20% while EPS remains in a range of $1.60 to $1.70. We have been able to maintain the margin outlook despite the unanticipated $30 million of legal matter accruals during the year due to favorability and other expenses. We continue to expect to generate $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities, and we now expect the $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to the previously announced IRS agreements to be paid in 2017.","So, to summarize, we delivered solid results in the quarter and remain on track with our full year earnings outlook. Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and we continue to return significant funds to shareholders.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Ryan A. Cary - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. This is Ryan Cary for Jason. Clearly, low oil prices continue to be a headwind to results. Should we expect negative growth as kind of the new normal for the time being in the petro producing regions or the impact less structural in these regions could recover relatively quickly with a rebound in energy prices?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I think we did see some impact which \u2013 especially from the Middle East and Middle East-related oil producing countries. That's a fact. But I will say, overall, being in 200 countries, having that portfolio, that balances the strong U.S. growth. The strong westernunion.com digital growth accelerating the transactions and revenues is really a great result.","It has \u2013 I would say, it takes time, right? If the oil prices are higher, the jobs have to be created, the investments have to be done in Saudi Arabia or UAE and Middle East countries, that creates jobs and if the people have jobs, they send money. But as you know, putting things in perspective, it's a good part of business but not that big part of business. And being in 200 countries helps us to have good results.","Ryan A. Cary - Jefferies LLC","Great. And just a follow-up. How should we be thinking about the tax rate going forward? I believe you call that expectation is for kind of a mid-teens tax rate over the next couple of years. But it seems like over the last three years to four years, that's often been the initial assumption before coming in a couple hundred basis points lighter. So is this a trend that we shouldn't expect to continue going forward or \u2013 and I'm trying to get a sense of how we should think about the tax rate, particularly, after kind of the lighter than expected this quarter?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. Ryan, this is Raj. We still target a mid-teens tax rate, and that's still what we expect for the next couple of years based on what we know today about the tax laws and the current environment with our business.","We've continue to benefit from some discrete items that have helped us during the course of the year. In this quarter, for example, we \u2013 obviously, we have a benefit from the larger accrual in the U.S. which helps to \u2013 helps the mix on the overall tax rate. We also have had some favorable resolutions to various outstanding tax matters with various governments around the world. And so that continues to help us and we're going to continue to try to do that as much as we can. Putting aside the discrete items, we're probably in that mid-teens rate, which is what we fully expected when we came into this year, but we are doing a good job in trying to manage things as best as we can on the tax side and that continues to be our goal.","Ryan A. Cary - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Operator","And the next question will come from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Jim.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the acceleration in the westernunion.com business, kind of the \u2013 some of the geographies that might have been underlying that and I guess if you can kind of look forward, talk about some of the factors that might help you close the gap between transaction growth and revenue growth?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","So, Jim, this is good news, right? This fantastic news, our acceleration of dotcom especially given the size how big our westernunion.com business already is, 8% of our total revenue and accelerating where 28% and transaction by 29%. The growth comes from both sides, expansion geographically and \u2013 but also very strong U.S. business, which have been for many, many years so customers are returning using us, they love the app, the westernunion.com app. Our transactions in the U.S. are growing by 33% and that's amazing and we are really gaining there market share and getting new customers, still the customers are new, 80% of the customers using westernunion.com digital environment are new to Western Union, they didn't use in the last 12 months, or, Raj, right? They did not use us the last 12 months and it's a great story and then now we are in 16 countries.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","27 countries.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","And the westernunion.com 16 countries on mobile app and we recently also launched new features in Canada and UK where you can really stage transaction. If somebody doesn't want to use bank account or credit card, they can go to a location and stage a transaction, pay at the location. So these things are definitely a multi-product and multi-channel environments helping. The other thing is also, what the competitors don't have and that's why they are not growing that fast is that we are in 200 countries. We can drop money in 16,000 corridors with one app. From Canada you can send money to 200 countries. From U.K. you can send money to 200 countries, from 37 countries, electronically digital, you can send money. That's the growth part. So we are very pleased with our digital growth and that's going to continue. Our investment is going to continue and my expectations will be \u2013 I'm very motivated with that.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","That's good to hear. Thanks. And then, maybe just as a quick follow-up. There's been a lot of headlines around the Walmart U.S. to Mexico kind of pricing structures that they recently published. Can you maybe talk about whether you expect any potential knock-on effect relative to the rest of the market and I know Walmart is pretty small, but still I guess there's a speculation about whether that could have a broader market affect or where you think it's just going to be confined to simply Walmart?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Well, I wouldn't say Walmart is small, in particular, but in this business, it is small. We have 50,000 locations in the U.S. and 26,000 locations in Mexico. And our pricing has been very competitive also, $8 for up to $1,000. And the facts speak its language. We've been gaining market share for three years every quarter and these facts are from Banco de M\u00e9xico facts.","So the distribution, the product positioning, the pricing, the brands, the compliance programs, all these platforms help us to be gaining market share. So we will always do pricing actions corridor by corridor. We will look at that, but I feel quite competitive with our pricing and I see the pricing is very stable and we're going to continue hopefully gaining market share in this very important corridor for us.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the pricing front. I think I heard plus 1%. So where are you being more opportunist, is this change more on the FX side or transaction-based side. Just any more color there would be great.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. Well, Tien-Tsin, you know our business so well. We are in \u2013 as you know, we are in so many countries, so many bands, so many different things. I would say that generally we still have 15% to 20% premium on average globally. Our price has been not affected and we will \u2013 the increases come on FX, most of the time FX increases but in some corridors also in the fee, and in some corridors we decreased actually also prices. And as you know, being in so many corridors, being in so many countries, it's a portfolio management. We feel comfortable by gaining market share also in some corridors, increasing the FX rates, that helped also, and it's mix \u2013 basically, it's the mix. It's not a big increase obviously. It's really the mix that impacts our 1%.","Raj, is that the truth?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I think you answered it well. There was some volatility, as the Brexit activity took place at the end of the second quarter. And that's \u2013 we put some different spreads in place. So that helped us, Tien-Tsin, overall in the business from a pricing standpoint, but we do increases and decreases on an ongoing basis throughout our business.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. No, that's good to know. Just on the Business Solutions side, any change in how we should look at that in the fourth quarter and maybe into 2017. I know that FX is all over the place and sort of macro trade is all over the place. I don't know if there has been a share change as well. But any updated insight on Business Solutions?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Sure. On Business Solutions, if you look at the Business Solutions, we are very pleased with our payment sector, the verticals where the students pay as a payment. On the hedging side, volatility always helps, right? The global trade has been slow, Tien-Tsin. That's been mainly affected and especially in the countries we are operating has been slow. Saying that, we will \u2013 we are still very strategic, very important for us. That's why we invested in the EDGE digital platform. We have thousands of exporters and importers registered there. They are trading in this platform. And that will be definitely helping on long-term on our numbers. But short term, volatility will help us and the global trade will help us.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. As always, I appreciate it.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. How are you doing?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hello, Bryan.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi. Good. Good. How are you?","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good, good. Just wanted to ask about the guidance. It looks like you guys narrowed the revenue guidance range to 3% in constant currency. And I believe the first half of the year was 3% constant currency. Third quarter was 2% in constant currency. So I'm just trying to figure are you guys expecting a little bit of a pickup in constant currency revenue growth in 4Q to round out the 3%?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","We just \u2013 we said approximately 3%, Bryan. So it obviously can be a range of outcomes for the fourth quarter and it still give us 3% for the full year, but that's approximately 3% for the full year. That's about where we've been running throughout the first three quarters of the year and that's about where we expect for the full year.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then you narrowed kind of the revenue range, but you didn't narrow the earnings per share and obviously there's still a $0.10 range there, which is a wide variety of outcomes for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what would get you to the low end of the range and to the high end of the range and maybe where you guys feel more comfortable?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, I would say we feel comfortable with the range as it is. We didn't really change the range primarily because we've also taken into account the $30 million of additional legal accruals that we've had now through the last couple of quarters. For us, the outlook really hasn't changed a lot. We continue to see the business trending the way it has been. We reiterated margins at 20%. We also have the same cash flow outlook and our EPS range, we just didn't change it because of the \u2013 what we've \u2013 because of legal items but you can see that through the first three quarter and even in the third quarter, we got to an EPS of $0.44, which is very much in line with our expectations and we feel good about the full-year outlook.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think, Raj, we talked about that we wouldn't have the $30 million, that outlook would be different, it would be on the higher end.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, we would have probably updated the outlook have we not had the $30 million that we've taken into account.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But no real one-time items to think about on a comparable basis from 4Q last year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","No, no, not really. If we have any one-time type items or things that we might do to address the cost structure, we will certainly tell you about those once we finish out the year but nothing that we can discuss at this stage. We are always looking for cost efficiencies and opportunities for the business but nothing to call out at this stage.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Darrin.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Just a quick follow-up around the margin, I mean, it does seem like there were some items in there and obviously you have been able to maintain it relatively stable despite that. So, I guess, can you just maybe rewind and give us a sense of what you see as the operating leverage opportunity? In other words, if we were to show 3% growth once again in 2017, I mean, is there any reason to see \u2013 to expect \u2013 to not be able to expect some margin expansion on that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, Darrin, I can't talk about 2017 margins, but the reason we've been able to maintain the margin this year at around 20% is we have managed our expenses quite tightly. Even though we've taken into account an additional $30 million of legal cost, we've been able to do that. For us, obviously, we need to get good revenue growth to drive better profitability but then you have to look at our other cost items that will have an impact, obviously, like our commissions, which have been flat the last couple of years, our compliance costs have also been relatively stable at that 3.5% to 4% range. And then, as I mentioned, just earlier we are continuing to look for cost optimization opportunities. So all of those things will have an impact and will have more color for you on those things as we finish out the year. But the margin this year, we are pleased with the 20% operating margin outlook, even in the face of some of these other things that we've had to deal with.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","And prices are stable from top-line; that helps also. And also just generally I would say that the company is really operating in a much better way, more efficient way. Despite all the challenges, global challenges, I think we found a way to operate very effectively.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up on the guidance question. I understand you're saying it's just 3% and there's a lot of outcomes that can get you there. But I guess I'm just trying to figure out what may have been in your expectations beforehand to be low to mid-single digit top-line versus now 3%. What changed, I guess, and again, we understand it's not a massive move from one to the other, but...","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...anything will be helpful?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, we had been running at 3% for the first half of the year on a constant currency basis and we still have six months left in the year when we maintained our outlook last quarter, low to mid-single digits. But as we've seen it tick down in the business, given the oil related markets. We're more comfortable with the 3% revenue growth outlook because of the performance that we had in the third quarter. And it's really the Middle East, the oil related markets that have shown a tick-down because we are continuing to get very strong growth in the other markets like the U.S., up on to Mexico, to Latin America, the domestic business, the digital business, obviously, and so those trends haven't really changed. We've seen just the tick-down in the Middle East and Africa business which is impacting APAC as well.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That's helpful. And just quick one, I mean on the mobile side, last quarter I know you guys had a bit of a spread between the revenue growth rate and the transaction growth. It actually looked like, to the point mentioned earlier by someone, it definitely improved. Not only you commented on mobile being a driver of the acceleration on wu.com but can you help us understand why the revenue per transaction would've improved so much given how much is mobile?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, I mean, we're continuing to see very strong growth in the mobile channel for wu.com and we're pleased with that. So that hasn't changed from before. As we mentioned before, we do pricing optimization throughout our business including our various channels and we did increase some spreads in the dotcom business but our overall pricing in the dotcom business is very market competitive when you look at the rest of the competition. So we're just really aligning and maximizing the opportunity there, and we're getting very consistent growth with transaction growth now, 29% transaction growth and 28% constant currency revenue growth. So it's a pretty consistent picture and it's very consistent with what we had expected coming into the second half of this year.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. All right. All right. Sounds good. Thanks, guys.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks. Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, Hikmet. Hi, Raj. How are you?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So I have a question about that legal accrual. I think your presentation did mention that there was an offset compensation in D&A. If you could size that, that would be helpful. And then as we kind of all start thinking about next year's model, what are the headwinds and tailwinds? Is it fair to assume that on the headwind side there is probably about $0.05 of tax rate but on the tailwind side you probably have the hedge roll-off that you don't have anymore? Can you help kind of with the timing of that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. Ashwin, let me try to answer your questions. In the SG&A line, as you mentioned, we had the FTC legal accrual for $15 million. That's the size of it. There were some offsets with lower compensation and lower D&A. And SG&A as a percent of revenues was up just a little bit from the last year. So I'll just let you do the math. But there was a slight...","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. The D&A, as we mentioned in the Business Solutions, that was a one-time charge we took a year ago in D&A. So there is about $7 million difference in that Business Solutions D&A.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","And the rest of it is just the comp. As you look at next year, I can't really go into specifics. But there are a number of different factors to consider \u2013 all of the things that I've mentioned in the previous question around revenue growth as well as the various cost items. But tax will certainly be a consideration.","Putting aside any discrete items, as I mentioned earlier, for the next couple of years, we would probably be in the mid-teens area for tax rate. But as I also mentioned, we're always trying to look for opportunities to optimize our tax rate. We will have some interest savings as we go into next year because of the refinancing that we just did.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","The ultimate amount of interest savings will depend on our debt level. And then we also have a refinancing next year that we have to do. So there may be some negative carry related to that. And then we also have the hedge gains that will \u2013 if rates stay exactly where they are today, then we'll have less in hedge gains. So all of those things will have to come together in how we ultimately look from a profit standpoint.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. So, okay, I guess, the follow-up question is just a clarification. In your presentation, again, in that C2C chart where you provide the transaction to revenue bridge, if there is other mix and I might have missed what the expectation for the other mix was?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, I mean, it's very simply \u2013 we had lower growth or softness in higher RPT markets. Our principal per transaction was down by about 4% on a constant currency basis and that's largely been driven by Europe and certain parts of the Middle East. So it's really the mix impact that's showing up in that negative 2%.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. Thanks. See you next week.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Ashwin.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure. Thanks, yeah. See you next week.","Operator","And the next question will come from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good evening, Raj.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi. How are you?","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good. I wanted to \u2013 the wu.com, as you talked about the transactions and revenue are coming in closer and seems as though you've been able to manage the spread there. Is that a result of you pricing differently or is that the result of the competition being less aggressive and allowing you to manage pricing better?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Well, I can't speak in the name of competition, what their issues is that \u2013 their issues, I guess, mostly they can't expand globally and they don't have the power to expand globally and they don't have the \u2013 they can't drop money to the 2 billion accounts we have and they can't drop money to 500,000 locations and everything, right? I think the strong growth is two things, Kartik. First one is the customers are coming back, who use once mobile, they love it, they stay there, they are coming back. We see that very good and that's the U.S. growth besides getting more customers, we are really having returning customers.","And the team is doing good job on that communicating with them online with via mobile, really having a loyalty programs which is great getting them back. The second thing is the geographical expansion. Expansion in Canada, expansion in UK with new devices but also in Europe and now we are starting to expand that also, you'll see recent announcement, coming announcement in other countries, in Asia, and other parts of Europe, in Middle East, we're going to expand our online and our dotcom activities and mobile activities. And it's a good business to expand, Raj.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, I would just add, Kartik, that one unique feature that we have that most of the competition does not have is cash payout. We initiate transactions online but we have a vast retail network that really sets us apart from other competitors.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","That link is definitely the compliance programs and you have to have a license to operate in a country. And that's not easy to get it. And we've been there for many, many years and we are really building our digital transformation. The digital transformation is happening built on our fundamentals and the other \u2013 the competition has to probably get there first.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And then just on overall pricing, obviously, you had a positive impact. Anything that you see on the horizon that changes that or do you think this environment, you'll be able to kind of sustain the pricing levels that there are right now?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Well, if you look at, the market is quite stable, right? I don't see any big noise out there. There has been some announcements done by the competition, but we feel we are pretty well positioned. Overall, we still have 15% to 20% premium globally and so we will continue the pricing actions but it won't have \u2013 we're going to stay in our historical norm and that will have been \u2013 we feel comfortable on that. For the near future, I don't see big changes.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And then just last question, Raj, just want to make sure I heard you correctly. You said, I know you don't want to give 2017 guidance, I understand that, but you were talking about some of the things that we should consider. On interest expense, did you say you thought that would be a headwind or did you not say that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","I did not say that. I said that interest expense would likely be lower next year given the refinancing we've done. Part of the refinancing was with the term loan, as I mentioned in our comments, which is at LIBOR plus 150 basis points, which is lower obviously than the note that we just retired at 5.93% and then we use some commercial paper. So we'll get interest savings there but it might be offset with some other components that I also mentioned and then we also have another refinancing to do next year of $500 million, which is at the end of the year, but we may refinance that earlier in the year, so there could be some negative carry as well associated with that.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Kartik.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Laura, I understand there is one more question in the queue.","Operator","Yes, that question is from Matt O'Neill of Autonomous.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Yeah, hi. It's Craig Maurer for Matt O'Neill. Just a broad-based question. You had stated in the prepared comments that you're comfortable with pricing where it is now. But should the oil economies not recover and the global economy remains suspect, do you have any other pricing leverage other than risk that you could use to reverse the decline in transaction growth?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Well, if you look at our business, I mean, there is a global challenge. It's for all, right? It's not a competitive challenge. It affects everyone. I think that in the markets where we feel very competitive with pricing \u2013 as I said earlier, we will always do pricing. That's the beauty of having this portfolio. And we didn't do 16,000 corridors. We have different customer use case. We have different bands, receiving center, FX and fees. So we can do that \u2013 we're going to continue to do that, and I feel comfortable where it is.","I think it was more of noise out there with the announcements and currently \u2013 near future, what I hear from my market leaders, they feel comfortable. What I hear from our digital leaders, they feel very comfortable that \u2013 and we are growing with our numbers. 28% digital growth is impressive, very stable, very resilient retail business. And for the near future, I don't see, I can't predict the future \u2013 long-term future, but I feel comfortable where the business is.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. All right. So just thinking ahead, I know you don't want to comment on 2017. But I mean, your positive comments seem to be slanted toward some level of recovery in those markets. So I suppose, as we think out to the guide, should you not get a \u2013 should you not get any improvement in the oil economies, we should probably expect a continuation of trend seeing the quarter.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Well, I can't predict the economy \u2013 the oil prices, right? I can't predict the global economy. And that's something I am always cautious. And I said at the beginning of the year, 2016 is cautious. And today I am still saying cautious, right?","But the beauty of our business, if you look at our top two business, not only U.S. but worldwide, we've been always up and down. And currently in the U.S., we're doing a good job. Outbound and intra-business is doing very well, digital doing very well.","Parts of like UK, although there were Brexit talk and everything, UK business is doing very well. Our Australia business is doing well. We do have \u2013 impacted in Saudi Arabia and UAE where they send money mostly to South Asia. This corridor has been impacted. And that's why some parts of the like India corridors has been a slower growth, because Saudi Arabia send and UAE send has been slower.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Okay, thanks, Craig. I think that's all the questions we have in the queue. So I want to thank everyone for joining us and wish you have a good evening.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The conference is now concluded.

Earlier this year, we reoriented our strategy for growing our global business so we could return to revenue and profit growth in 2014 by strengthening Consumer Money Transfer, increasing customers' end usage in Business Solutions and generating and deploying strong cash flow for our shareholders. We said we could restore our competitive position and drive future growth.","Now halfway through a transitional 2013, our second quarter performance shows we have made substantial progress in achieving these objectives and demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business models.","As we expected, our second quarter Consumer Money Transfer transaction growth rates accelerated compared to the first quarter, as our pricing actions continue to build momentum with consumers. Electronic channels growth also increased, with strong contributions from both westernunion.com and electronic account-based money transfer through banks.","Western Union Business Solutions delivered a second consecutive quarter of solid growth and, more importantly, initiated new services, partnerships and markets to drive future performance. And additionally, Consumer Bill Payments improved, with strong constant currency revenue growth in the quarter. While consolidated operating margins are down from last year, as expected, partially as a result of our strategic pricing and other actions, we remain solidly on track with our full year financial outlook, and we are affirming our 2013 guidance.","Before turning the call over to Scott to discuss our financial results in more detail, let me give a few examples of progress on each of our key strategic priorities for 2013.","In Consumer Money Transfer, we are seeing that our pricing actions are having the desired effect. In Mexico, Western Union brand transactions increased 22% in the quarter. This was an improvement from the 9% growth in the first quarter and 2% in last year's fourth quarter, when we first implemented the price reductions. We are regaining momentum in Mexico, which should also be aided by activating new agent locations over the next several quarters. The price actions in other corridors are also performing well. And, overall, we are meeting our transaction objectives for the priced corridors.","Entering the second quarter, we have completed about 75% of the planned pricing initiatives. In these priced corridors, transactions increased 17% in the quarter, or 11% if you exclude westernunion.com. Prior to implementing the pricing, transactions in these retail corridors were decreasing slightly, so we are seeing a good lift in consumer usage. The westernunion.com online pricing actions are also yielding very strong results. Overall, westernunion.com Money Transfer transaction growth accelerated to 68% in the quarter. As of end of June, we have initiated substantially all of the previously planned pricing actions.","We also made progress in other areas to strengthen Consumer Money Transfer for the future by further increasing the number of agent locations, expanding our electronic channels, introducing more direct-to-bank services and becoming more mobile. Our total agent locations increased to 520,000 as of end of the quarter. We remain focused on adding productive new locations and other points of presence, although there have been some offsets, as we remove some locations that were dormant or required compliance-related changes.","We mentioned last quarter that we have signed agents in Mexico, which will give us approximately 10,000 new locations there once implemented. And we also just greatly expanded in Germany. In July, 3,000 additional locations were activated with the German POS bank increasing our presence in that country by over 50%.","I am pleased with the new relationships we continue to formulate. Recently, we added a major new bank in Saudi Arabia with the signing of Riyad Bank, which will offer both cash and account-based money transfer services in one of the world's top 3 outbound markets for remittances. And this month, in the U.S., we also activated 1,500 agent locations with SunTrust bank, which has a strong branch network across the Southern states.","Electronic channels revenue increased 26% in the second quarter. Westernunion.com Money Transfer transactions increased 68%, and account-based Money Transfer transactions increased 51%, as we activated new services with banks in Turkey, Jordan and Vietnam. We now have over 70 banks connected for account-based money transfer service.","Earlier this month, I was in India for the launch of a new direct-to-bank service, which give us the capability to send money transfers from westernunion.com and agents location in the U.S. and U.K. directly into a bank account in India. Direct-to-bank is a large market opportunity that we plan to develop over the coming years.","I also visited Nigeria, where we are working to expand account-based and mobile money transfer services with both banks and mobile network operators. We now have 17 active partners globally for mobile money transfer. And our money transfer services are also available for bank customers at approximately 115,000 ATMs, including new rollouts with banks in Thailand and Turkey. Providing both senders and receivers of their choice of channel is a key element of our money transfer strategy, and we continue to add online, mobile and account-based options for our foundational retail network around the world.","Western Union is uniquely positioned to connect the digital and physical world for money transfer, and we believe these new channels will be a key driver of future growth. Overall, we are on track with our plans for Consumer Money Transfer in 2013, and we continue to expect our Western Union brand C2C transactions to increase mid- to high-single digit for the full year.","Our second strategic initiative for 2013 is to drive growth in customers and usage in business-to-business. And during the quarter, we made solid progress. Western Union Business Solutions delivered 6% revenue growth in the quarter, or 8% in constant currency terms. We are gaining traction in the market with our refocused sales efforts and continue to expand our service offerings and capabilities.","In the quarter, we launched a new service with the MasterCard Business Network, where we provide cross-border payment services to their business customers. The network is an online resource that help streamline business operations and enhance productivity for small- and mid-sized businesses.","We also significantly expanded our services in India and Japan. And we increased offerings for university student cross-border tuition payment services in several countries, including China, India and South Korea. Business Solutions now offers cross-border payments services in 32 countries, with Colombia being the most recent addition. Although we still believe we can generate stronger business solutions growth in the future, as global trade recovers and our new services and market contribute more meaningfully, we are pleased with the progress we have made so far in 2013.","Our third strategic initiative for 2013 is to generate strong cash flow and deploy it for our shareholders. Year-to-date, through June, we generated $478 million of cash flow from operating activities and returned over $450 million to shareholders. This consisted of $314 million of share repurchases and $140 million of dividends.","As Scott will discuss in a moment, we continue to expect to generate $900 million of operating cash flow for the year, with approximately $700 million returned to shareholders, representing approximately 7% of the current market capitalization.","So based on the year-to-date performance and current trends, we have affirmed our full year financial outlook. Our Consumer Money Transfer actions are meeting our objectives, with Western Union brand transactions increasing 7% in the second quarter, up from a 2% increase in the first quarter.","Electronic channels are growing rapidly, with revenue growth of 26%, compared to 18% last quarter. And we are adding more choices and convenience for consumers around the world. Business Solutions is picking up momentum, with constant currency revenue growth of 8% compared with 7% last quarter. Consumer Bill Payments is delivering good constant currency revenue growth of 7%, up from 3% last quarter. And we continue to generate strong cash flow.","So far, our strategic actions are working, and we remain confident that these actions will lead to revenue and profit growth in 2014.","Now to give you a more detailed review of the financial results for the quarter, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott T. Scheirman","Thank you, Hikmet. As mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we are making in our key businesses, and we are affirming our full year financial outlook for 2013.","In the second quarter, we reported total consolidated revenue of $1.4 billion, which was down 3% compared to the year ago quarter, or 2% on a constant currency basis. Pricing investments and compliance actions led to C2C revenue decline, as expected, but the rate of decline moderated compared to the first quarter, as transaction growth accelerated. As Hikmet mentioned, Business Solutions and Consumer Bill Payments each delivered good revenue growth in the quarter.","In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue declined 4%, or 3% constant currency. The decline included a negative 1% impact from the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, which are still being affected by the compliance-related changes implemented in the third quarter of 2012. Transaction growth for Western Union brand accelerated to 7% in the second quarter compared to 2% in the first quarter. The second quarter growth was driven by the pricing actions and strong performance in the electronic channels. Overall transactions, including the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, increased 3%, up from a decline of 2% in the first quarter.","C2C cross-border principal increased 2% in the quarter, with no impact from currency, while Western Union branded cross-border principal increased 5%, including a negative 1% impact from currency. Total principal per transaction declined 1%. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was 7 percentage points, including a negative 1% impact from currency.","For C2C, the impact of net price decreases was approximately 7% in the quarter, while mix had a positive impact of approximately 1%. We continue to expect the full year pricing investments to be approximately 6% to 7% of C2C revenue, or approximately 5% of total company revenue.","Turning to the regions. All of the regions delivered improved transaction growth rates compared with the first quarter trends. In the Europe and CIS region, C2C revenue decreased 4% year-over-year, including a positive 1% impact from currency. Transactions in the region increased 3%, aided primarily by pricing actions and continued strong growth in markets, such as Germany and France.","North America revenue declined 12% from the prior year, while transactions were down 2%. The transaction decline was driven by the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, while revenue was also impacted by price reductions. Mexico revenue, including Vigo and Orlandi Valuta, declined 23%, and transactions decreased 3% in the quarter.","For the Western Union brand, Mexico revenue declined 11%, while transaction growth accelerated to 22%. The Western Union brand grew significantly faster than the market based on the Banco de Mexico data available for April and May.","Domestic money transfer revenue was down 1% on transaction growth of 5% in the quarter. The difference between transaction and revenue was attributable to fewer large principal transfers at price reductions in westernunion.com. Lower principal bands and domestic money transfer continued to perform well, with increases in both transactions and revenue.","Revenue in the Middle East and Africa region was flat compared to the year-ago quarter with no impact from currency, and transactions grew 6%. We're seeing good results from our pricing actions from Europe to Africa, and the Gulf states are providing steady growth.","Asia-Pacific region revenue was down 4% in the quarter, including a negative 1% impact from currency translation, while transactions in the region increased 5%. The Latin American Caribbean region revenue was flat with the prior year period, including a negative 7% impact from currency, while transactions declined 3%. Revenue in the region was positively impacted by geographic and product mix, although this was offset by currency translation.","Turning to our digital business. Westernunion.com again delivered strong results, with Money Transfer transaction growth of 68% and a revenue increase of 25% in the quarter. U.S.-originated online transactions increased over 75% in the quarter.","Total electronic channel revenue, which includes westernunion.com, account-based money transfer through banks, and mobile increased 26% in the quarter. Electronic channels represented 4% of total company revenue, up from 3% of revenue in the year-ago period.","In addition to the strong growth from westernunion.com, transactions from account-based money transfer through banks increased 51%. Prepaid revenue, including third-party reload, declined 9% in the quarter, primarily due to softness in our U.S. business.","Moving to the Consumer-to-Business segment. Revenue increased 2% in the quarter, or 7% in constant currency terms. Good growth in South America and in the U.S. electronic business drove the Consumer Bill Payment improvement, with a partial offset from decline in the U.S. cash walk-in business.","Business Solutions reported another solid quarter with revenue growth of 6% or 8% constant currency. Both spot payments and customer hedging activity contributed to the growth, with particularly strong performance from the U.K. and several countries in Asia. The acquisition of the French Travelex Global Business Payments business, which was completed in May of 2012, contributed 1 point to the Business Solutions growth in the quarter.","Turning to consolidated margins. As expected, the second quarter GAAP operating margin was 20%, compared to 24.3% in the prior year period. The margin decline was primarily the result of increased compliance costs; pricing-driven revenue declines in mix; strategic investments, primarily in IT; expenses for cost-savings initiatives; and higher marketing. These impacts were partially offset by lower Travelex integration expense.","There were approximately $14 million of expenses related to the cost-savings initiatives in the quarter. Increased compliance costs included additional expenses related to anticipated extension of our Southwest Border agreement. As noted in an 8-K filing in June, we agreed with the State of Arizona to extend the current Southwest Border agreement, which was due to expire on July 31, by an additional 90 days. The extension is intended to give both parties time to discuss potential amendments to the settlement agreement, which may include further extending the terms to allow additional time to implement the monitor's recommendations.","EBITDA margin was 24.8% compared to 28.4% a year ago. Reported earnings per share in the quarter were -- was $0.36 compared to $0.44 in the prior year.","The C2C operating segment margin was 23.2% compared to 28.5% in the prior year period. The margin was impacted in the quarter primarily by increased compliance costs, strategic investments, price-driven revenue declines and mix, expenses related to cost-savings initiatives and higher marketing.","The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 20.5% compared to 22.4% in the prior year period. The margin was negatively impacted compared to prior year by pass-throughs to billers of Durbin-related debit card savings, which reduced revenue.","Business Solutions reported an operating loss of $7 million for the quarter compared with a loss of $15 million in the year-ago period. The reduction in operating loss was primarily driven by lower Travelex integration expense.","The second quarter $7 million loss includes $15 million of depreciation and amortization and $6 million of Travelex integration expense. The second quarter of last year depreciation and amortization was $15 million, while integration expense was $14 million.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $478 million. Capital expenditures were $69 million in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.7 billion and cash of $1.4 billion. Approximately 50% of the cash was held by United States entities.","During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares at an average price of $15.92, totaling $125 million. In addition, we paid $69 million in dividends. Earlier this month, we also declared another $0.125 quarterly dividend, which will be paid on September 30.","As of quarter end, we have 552 million shares outstanding, approximately $80 million remaining under our repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2013. We continue to project 2013 repurchases and dividends to total approximately $700 million this year, or about 7% of current market capitalization, including $400 million of share repurchases.","We expect to generate approximately $900 million of cash flow from operations or approximately $1 billion, excluding the remaining $100 million of tax payments from our 2011 IRS agreement. These payments are included in our 2013 cash flow outlook, although it is possible that some of the payments may not occur until 2014. We are affirming the 2013 full year financial outlook that we provided in April.","As we stated at the end of last year, we expect 2013 to be a transitional year, as we implement our strategic actions. And we are pleased with the progress we made during the first half of the year.","Laura, we are now ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask about just industry growth in general. It sounds like -- listening to your comments, Hikmet, and then, obviously, what your peers have said, it feels like industry growth is improving. Can you elaborate on that? I'm just curious if it's safe to say that there's an improvement in industry growth, broadly speaking?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, fortunately we are acting in a market which is growing in totally. As you know, especially, cross-border remittance market is what World Bank says got 5% to 6% growth approximately [indiscernible].","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, about 6%, yes. And [indiscernible] too, in principal.","Hikmet Ersek","And [indiscernible] too, also. It's about 5%, 6% growth in principal amount. So obviously, revenue is a little bit different on that part. But, generally, I would say that I'm very pleased with our performance. And as you recall that we said that last year, we're going to implement all these actions. The actions are working. And to gain -- and our -- to gain market share. And we are very pleased with the results. Just to give an example, Western Union-branded transaction. Mexico, growing by 22%, up from 9%. And it was lower than little [ph] quarter before. So I think the actions are working. Also, the other actions on the different parts of the world are working. And price is not the only one, right, which impacts. We are having 520,000 locations. Electronic channels are growing very fast. We have 115,000 ATMs. So being everywhere, anywhere and serving the customers, it does work, so I am pleased with the progress we made.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two quick, just, clarifications. Just transaction growth in the quarters where pricing was not addressed. It looked like it accelerated from 1% to 5%. Are we calculating that correctly, Scott?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, yes, it's correct. It was right around 4%, Tien-Tsin, but the specific number is 4%. But we feel good about those corridors too and the progress that we saw.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So it did accelerate. And lastly, just any impact on transactions, in general, from all the FX volatility? I know that was called out with -- at Xoom, so, especially, with the rupee move. Any impact on transactions worth calling out?","Scott T. Scheirman","I'd say, in simple terms, no. Consumers do vary their behavior a little bit. But the Indian rupee, there was some movement there. But we're in 200 countries. India is a very important market. But consumers, their loved ones have needs, so they routinely send money back. So didn't have a significant impact on our results this quarter.","Hikmet Ersek","Just a reminder, Tien-Tsin. We have 123 currencies, which the customer uses, right? So that's, definitely, also something. We don't see the impact on that so much.","Operator","The next question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about going forward. Do you still expect the transaction growth to accelerate in the third and the fourth quarters, just given what you see so far?","Hikmet Ersek","The answer is yes. The answer is yes. And we are affirming our year-end guidance, as you know. And part of it is the acceleration of the transaction growth, and the pricing actions are working. We have now implemented -- or activated 75% of them, implemented all of the pricing actions. And they should work. And the -- and non-priced corridors are also growing 1% to 4% abroad. So, generally, I see a good momentum.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then, Scott, can you remind us when OV and Vigo -- I know it's been a tough comp here. When does that anniversary? Is that in the middle of this quarter?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, it'd be in the middle of the third quarter, so we'll have some of it through the third quarter. And then the fourth quarter would be the first, I'll say, clean quarter, if you will, Bryan, where the comps get easier from that standpoint.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, fourth is more to measure it -- better to measure it.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, just, finally, for me, the -- do you still expect pricing to return to its normal declines of 1% to 3% cycle in 2014 after giving the pricing initiatives this year?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I believe that we did a big investment in 2012, which affects 2013 numbers. Generally, I would say that it's not only pricing. I think we really pulled this strategy here, which we are -- our focus is revenue and profit growth for '14. And to achieve that, there are many factors too, and pricing is one of them. I don't see that we're going to have a big investment as we did it in -- from today's point of view, as we did it in -- in end of 2012.","Operator","And the next question will come from Smittipon Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question is, I was wondering if you guys are seeing any different in the trends in this round of price reductions versus past rounds of price reductions that you guys have implemented.","Scott T. Scheirman","Smitti, I would say we're in 200 countries, 16,000 corridors, so you do get some variations. But I'd say that the key headline is the price investments are working. And in those corridors, we did make pricing investments. Transactions were up 17%, so they're spot on to our objectives.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And for westernunion.com, are the top corridors that you have in that business similar to the top corridors that you have in the off-line space?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, generally, yes. But if you look at our business, we are in 32 countries in westernunion.com, or is it...","Scott T. Scheirman","We're -- yes, we're in 23 countries.","Hikmet Ersek","23, I'm sorry -- to 23 countries and sending to 200 countries. So you can multiple to -- from 200 countries, which means that we are serving many, many corridors, right? And our goal is to expand these countries, adding more and more countries, which means that adding more and more corridors and, eventually, being in 200 countries with our westernunion.com and electronic channels. And the team is working very hard on that.","Operator","And the next question is from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Roman in for Julio. First, a clarification question in Mexico. The agent locations that are to be added there, are these agents that have been signed up and just, they need to be implemented? Or do these include some of that, perhaps, are in the pipeline and not yet signed up?","Hikmet Ersek","No, they have been signed up. Giving the time to implement them. It takes time to implement that. You have to activate the IT systems and everything and the programs -- compliance programs, so -- but we have signed them.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. And just to be clear, Roman, we have signed about 10,000 locations that'll roll out in the next 12 months, but they are signed agreements.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, okay. We noticed the headlines, so that's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, and we can speak specifically to Mexico or other corridors. But as you add agent locations in corridors that you repriced, how did the dynamics work there? Are you trying to manage the pricing a little differently with these new agents? Or are you -- is the pricing going to be the same as the new prevailing prices in those corridors?","Scott T. Scheirman","Generally speaking, we price to the market and where we see the consumer value proposition lies. So as new agents come on board, what they love about our business is the strength of our brand that we can connect 520,000 locations. We have westernunion.com for -- on the payout side. So, if you will, the pricing market-by-market will vary. But generally, we treat all the agents the same, which is important to our brand and who we are.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, finally, on Business Solutions. What type of revenue growth do we need to see there in the near term to get to profitability? The integration expense coming down, obviously, helps. But what kind of top line performance do we need to see there?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. As I stated in last time, we do see a long-term, lower double-digit growth rate in this business. I think, now we accelerated our constant currency revenue growth from 7% to 8%. And I think the team is really, really focused and expanding also the countries there have been. So we have a roadmap to go there. And that will definitely help the bottom line. But maybe, Scott, you want to add something on the...","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, yes. The only other color I would give to add to Hikmet's comments. If you look at the margins on a year-to-date basis, EBITDA margins, minus the integrations expense, those margins are in the neighborhood of 14%, if you will, so it is profitable today. And those margins are up compared to a year-to-date basis from the prior year. And so as we expand to more countries, as we gain scale, as we launch more products -- for example, we've launched the options in the U.K. in the last quarter. We signed a deal with MasterCard this quarter that we're excited about. So as we generate that long-term, that low, double-digit revenue growth, the scale and leverage should allow us to get EBITDA margins comparable to the company average.","Operator","And our next question will come from Greg Smith of Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Can you comment on the prepaid business? Just looks likes it's kind of weakening there. What are your thoughts, broadly, on the opportunity in U.S. and north and as well as international?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes.","Hikmet Ersek","I'd go with -- maybe...","Scott T. Scheirman","Go ahead, Hikmet, yes.","Hikmet Ersek","If you like to add something -- if you look, our prepaid business is a small part of our business today. It's around 1% of our revenue. And it has been a little bit difficult to build the awareness and get the advantages of that. However, it does open to Western Union brand. All these cards are Western Union-branded cards. And once the customer gets the loyalty, it uses also potential other products. And what we do is that we are really bringing the prepaid customers to our core business. Is it cash in, cash out, or using the Money Transfer or Bill Payment businesses? Do you want to add something on that?","Scott T. Scheirman","No. I think, Greg, the other opportunity for us, well, as Hikmet kind of mentioned, is to take our prepaid business, which we think is a nice long-term opportunity. But we're experimenting with some different business models in different countries and better connect that back to the core business, which we think leverages our brand, our distribution and our customer base. So we want to, as the years come, kind of tighten those a little bit closer together as we move forward.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Sure. And then, just if you step back and think about your business as it's moving to digital channels. And is that happening faster than maybe you would have expected a year ago or slower or, obviously, about as expected?","Hikmet Ersek","No, it's really -- if you recall, we said that we want to accelerate our growth here. Don't forget that we had -- 2%, 3%, 4% of our total revenue is non-electronic channels. The westernunion.com, as you know, that we opened an office in San Francisco. And this team is doing great. It's growing by 68% on transactions. We are right on our plan to achieve, well, approximately $500,000 -- $500 million by year 2015. And the revenues also accelerated from 18% to 26% in this quarter. So we have a roadmap to get there on westernunion.com and our digital business. One good thing is also on the digital business, electronic account-based money transfer business. We have now 70 banks globally on that. And where you go to your electronic banking account and you click and send money worldwide to 200 countries, and that grew by 51%. So I think our strategies on the electronic channels are working. Last year, just to give it a -- just to compare with the environment, last year, revenue was $150 million on westernunion.com. And this is something that -- we want to bring that to $500 million by end of year 2015.","Scott T. Scheirman","And the other color I would add, Greg, which I think is important too, really, 2 things, is one is that we're really well positioned to bring together the best of the electronic world and the retail world with our brand and our network. But, also, on the electronic channel with dot-com, 80% of the customers we're seeing are new.","Operator","And our next question is from George Mihalos of Credit Suisse.","Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Ryan Davis calling in for George. I have a few questions. First off, kind of following up on the question earlier on the second half of the year. Could you kind of give us an update on the July trends, whether there's a big acceleration in transactions in your quarter relative to the second quarter?","Scott T. Scheirman","Ryan, this is Scott. Thanks for joining us this morning. But as customary with our past practice, we do not comment on trends within a quarter during a quarter. But what I will say is that we're cognizant of what those trends are. And, if you will, led to the confidence to reaffirm our guidance for 2013. So we're pleased with how the year-to-date results have been through June. And our outlook gives us confidence to reconfirm the guidance.","Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. Can you provide us some color on how the transactions progress throughout 2Q monthly?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. I'll just come back to my prior comments. Just consistent with past practices, we don't comment month-by-month. And the reason being is you have holidays or calendar impact and other things. But again, what we saw in the first quarter and the second quarter, again, transactions increased from 2% in the first quarter to 7% in the second quarter, very nice acceleration. And those priced markets went up 17% growth. So all those things give us confidence that our strategy is working. Customers love the brand and the network. They're coming back in the front door, so we did reaffirm guidance.","Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, one more. What's driving principal per transaction lower on a constant currency basis? I just thought it was the aggressive online channel. Shouldn't that kind of be reversed?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, just to frame it. For the quarter, it was down about 1%. I think one of the key points is C2C transactions grew 7%, so customers came back in the front door. The one item that's having some impact on that, and we called it out during the call, is domestic money transfer. The high principal sends there were down somewhat. But overall, what we really like about our business model is that if the transactions come in the door, what's the most important thing is getting the transaction. And that really drives our revenue model.","Operator","And the next question is from Sara Gubins of Merrill Lynch.","David Chu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is David Chu for Sara. How should we think about pricing for the second half? So should we expect a more significant impact in 3Q versus 2Q and then like less of an impact in 4Q, as you have lapped some of the Mexico initiative?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. David, thank you for your question. How I frame it is from a customer transaction standpoint, we do expect transactions to accelerate in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. As far as lapping pricing, we did start the pricing actions mid-November of 2012, so we'll begin lapping those in mid-November of 2013.","Michael A. Salop","Yes, when you look at the reporting, David, I mean, the actions themselves are largely done. We've -- after the end of the quarter -- as of end of the quarter, we completed most of the pricing. But when you look at the reporting, in the third quarter, it probably is going to be the highest, because all the actions will be in place and then we start anniversary-ing, as Scott said, in the fourth quarter.","David Chu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. No, that's helpful. And maybe this is a little bit early, but are you seeing anything in the market place that suggests a meaningful pickup in compliance costs in 2014?","Scott T. Scheirman","What I'd say, David, is that having a robust compliance program and a strong culture of compliance is very important to us. And so, broadly, as we think about the global landscape, the regulatory environment continues to move. So as I think about '14 and '15, right now, I'd expect our compliance regulatory cost to increase. But what's important about that is that it protects the brand, it protects the customer, it protects our agents. And longer term, we believe that's going to be a competitive advantage because of our scale and our scope of what we can do with compliance and the regulatory.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I'd just add on that. I do see that as a competitive advantage. We have really the culture in our company. And most importantly, it protects the consumer. And it has been some investment down here. I believe it will continue to -- we're going to have those investments. But long term, as Scott said, I just want to repeat that, I believe it will be -- given our scale, it will be a competitive advantage. But don't forget, we are in 200 countries. We comply with all regulations world and try to be the best in class and leading in this industry here.","David Chu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just last one, if I may. So are most of your larger agent renewals for 2013 finished at this point, or is there more in the second half?","Hikmet Ersek","If you look at our agent network globally, we have always negotiations constantly, being in 200 countries, have a global agent network. And as I said, we recently added new agent negotiations -- we had new agent negotiations, and we added new agents. And one of the best one was probably the Riyad Bank in Saudi Arabia or 10,000 locations in Mexico, so it's constantly growing. And we activate the SunTrust Bank in the U.S.. So I think that seasonality, year-by-year, it changes, but most of the -- we have constant negotiation with the agents. Most of the contracts are 5-year contracts in average, so it comes every time.","Scott T. Scheirman","And what I'd add is I'd say, we enjoy high renewal rates. The example I would give is our top 40 agents have been with us for an average of 17 years. They very much value the brand, the customers that we bring to their locations and our network.","Operator","And the next question will come from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research.","Glenn T. Fodor - Autonomous Research LLP","You've had some large declines in yields in the online channel for several quarters now. How much longer do you think it'll take for your actions to anniversary here? And can you give us your best estimate of the delta between your online pricing and the competitors'? And then, secondly, your differential between your online pricing versus your offline pricing as best as apples-to-apples as you can?","Hikmet Ersek","Maybe you can give him some detail on that. But let me start how we see that. We do see it corridor by corridor. Probably you're asking the question, \"What's your online pricing in the U.S. against the competition?\" I just want to say that our U.S.-originated transactions last quarter grow by 75%. The biggest advantage of we're seeing is that online, we serve from one point 200 countries. If you have our Germany, online transfer, we serve from Germany 200 countries. So that's the biggest advantage. And we adapt our pricing corridor by corridor. We pick up corridors, and we do price promotions on that.","Scott T. Scheirman","And Glenn, what I would add there is that we will lap the western.com (sic) [westernunion.com] pricing in November, so we'll grow through that, if you will. But just with transactions being up 68% in the second quarter, I think that's a very strong statement from our customers that they very much value the consumer proposition. So whether it's the attribute of price, the brand, the customer payout, customers truly like the business. And in the U.S., U.S., we saw over 75% transaction growth from second quarter.","Glenn T. Fodor - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay. And then, just thinking about pricing actions outside of where you've been active over the last couple of quarters, and what you're going through now, are there any rumblings of measures you might have to take elsewhere? You haven't mentioned it, but I just wanted to see if there's any texture of things we should be aware of? Any rumblings just to avoid any surprises over the coming quarters of new pricing -- new larger-scale pricing implementation?","Hikmet Ersek","Glenn, so far, so good. Our pricing, non-priced corridor's growing by 4%, 75% of our business, as you know. But it's so far, so good. I feel comfortable with the progress. Pricing, as you know, Glenn, our business very well. It's only a part of our actions. It's the -- we, as Western Union, I believe deserve the premium pricing. Our brand is very valuable. Our compliance programs are very valuable. We are protecting the customers. The customers trust us. And we do really choose corridor by corridor. And pricing is nothing new for us. We did the last 10 to 15 years, corridor by corridor, different pricing. But I don't see, from today's point of view, a big investment -- corrective investment, transformational investment. We did it in last year, 2012.","Operator","And that final question will come from James Friedman of Susquehanna.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I also wanted to ask about the regulatory. Earlier in the year, you had described the regulatory is getting hotter, and you had outlined the mandatory callback obligations. I was wondering, do those -- are those obligations mandatory callback, extending to other corridors? And how you would characterize regulatory at wu.com (sic) [westernunion.com] versus WU off line?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, first, I think the important point is that we very much have a culture of compliance and want to have best-in-class compliance programs. That's very important for our brand, protecting our customers, our agents and so forth. As we think about compliance, broadly, we are doing things such as high principal dollar callback to protect the customer. That's what we want to do. We have expanded that to other markets and other corridors. And we'll continue from time to time to implement things to protect the customers and to protect the agents.","Michael A. Salop","That's for both wu.com (sic) [westernunion.com] and off-line.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, thank you, Mike -- for both channels.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes. Okay, interesting. And then with regard to wu.com (sic) [westernunion.com] I was just wondering, and I hadn't heard you mention this before, if you have, I apologize. But being that wu.com (sic) [westernunion.com] is more of a one-to-many as opposed to one-to-one model. Are you seeing customers use it to remit to multiple countries? Or is that behavior any different than the typical pattern of one sender to one country?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, if you look at our customer base, right? I mean, let's assume a Filipino customer using online from here to send money to Philippines, obviously, uses that channel. But in the U.S., as you know, there are many ethnic groups, many migrants, many customer from different ethnic groups. And we do give them the availability to use different things. So in the U.S., for instance, I'm sending from my online account from my iPhone to my father, Turkey, money, and it works pretty well. And my father in Turkey picks the money up. So I think it's really -- what I wanted to say is that from one point, you can serve 200 countries. You can serve one from westernunion.france (sic) [westernunion.fr] 200 countries. I think that's the huge advantage of Western Union.","Michael A. Salop","Thanks, James. Thanks, everyone, for joining us.

We are very pleased that we continued the momentum from the end of last year into the first quarter of 2018. We delivered healthy 7% revenue growth, or 5% in constant currency for both the overall company and our consumer money transfer business, and we also generated solid profitability. Our digital business continued its impressive run with 23% revenue growth for westernunion.com money transfer in the quarter or 20% in constant currency. And westernunion.com is becoming an increasingly important part of our business, representing 11% of total money transfer revenues in the quarter, up from 6% just three years ago.","Regionally, outbound business from Latin America led our money transfer growth, with U.S. outbound also strong and Europe accelerated nicely from the trends at the end of last year. Overall, our cross-border principal grew an impressive 9% in the quarter, due to our good execution in retail and continued strong growth from digital.","Among our payments businesses, Speedpay U.S. electronic bill payments delivered a solid revenue increase in the quarter and Pago Facil Argentina bill payments again posted strong double-digit revenue growth. Business Solutions revenue increased 3% reported or declined 2% in constant currency terms, an improvement compared to the fourth quarter, but still below our long-term expectations as we continue to implement turnaround actions.","So, overall, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter top line growth, especially in cross-border money transfer. But also, our profit margins and cash flow were solid, with margins just over 19% and cash flows from operations of $133 million. Based on our first quarter results and our expectations going forward, we are affirming the full year revenue and operating margin outlooks we provided in February.","We have had a nice start to the year from a growth perspective, although there is still some softness in the Middle East and with U.S. domestic money transfer. The pricing environment globally has been stable for the last few years, and we had slight net price increases in consumer money transfer in the first quarter 2018. As always, we will continue to monitor globally the competition and competitive pricing actions, like the recent one in the U.S. from Walmart. We adjust if needed in certain corridors, but we do not expect significant changes in our pricing actions at this time.","Now turning to our long-term strategy, we remain focused on our vision of being the leader in cross-border, cross-currency money movement. Our goal is to accelerate revenue growth by leveraging our strong cross-border capabilities to serve additional customer segments on our platform. Digital expansion is a priority and we expect to open multiple new westernunion.com countries this year with a focus on mobile. We have just begun digital expansion in Latin America and Caribbean region, adding transactional capabilities to a new app in Panama and a website in Jamaica.","In retail money transfer, we continue to work on enhancing retention through better customer experience and relationship management, including initiatives such as Stage & Pay that introduce mobile and digital elements to retail transactions. With our payments businesses, efforts focused on expanding with new payments-based services and new geographies in B2B, providing digital solutions to clients and migrating our services to next-generation platforms. We also remain committed to driving continued improvement in our operations, with plans to create further efficiencies and productivity improvements to fuel investments in our growth initiatives.","So, to summarize, we delivered a very good first quarter. There are some soft spots, but we have good momentum in key parts of the world and feel confident about the business. And we are continuing to execute our long-term strategies, including driving operating efficiencies and a continuous improvement mindset with our WU Way programs.","I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year, but right now I want to turn the call over to Raj to give you more detail on the first quarter results.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Hikmet.","First quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion increased 7% compared to the prior-year period or 5% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation net of the impact from hedges benefited first quarter revenue by approximately $19 million compared to the prior year.","In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, which represented 79% of company revenues in the quarter, revenues also increased 7% on a reported basis or 5% constant currency and transactions grew 4%. Total C2C cross-border principal increased 9% or 5% on a constant currency basis, while principal per transaction increased 5% or 2% constant currency. The spread between C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 3%, with a positive 2% impact from currency. Pricing had a positive impact of 1% compared to the prior-year period, while mix was neutral again in the quarter.","Turning to the regional results, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions. North America revenue increased 4% on both a reported and constant currency basis, while transactions grew 1%. Growth was driven by U.S. outbound business to Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and India, partially offset by softness in the U.S. domestic and U.S. to Mexico businesses.","In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 14% or 5% in a constant currency basis, driven by France, Turkey and Spain. Transactions in the region increased 8%. Trends in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region were similar to the fourth quarter, although slightly softer in the oil-producing countries. Revenue in the region was flat on a reported basis or declined 1% constant currency, while transactions were down 2% in the quarter.","The Latin American and Caribbean regions continued to deliver strong revenue growth with an increase of 20% in the quarter or 25% constant currency, driven primarily by Argentina and Brazil. Transactions in the region grew 17%. In the APAC region, revenue increased 2%, or was flat on a constant currency basis, while transactions grew 1%.","Westernunion.com delivered strong performance again, as reported revenue grew 23% or 20% constant currency on transaction growth of 24%. Westernunion.com represented 11% of total C2C revenue in the first quarter.","Business Solutions revenues increased 3% or declined 2% on a constant currency basis and represented 7% of company revenues in the quarter. Revenues were negatively impacted by declines in Europe, particularly in the UK, which were partially offset by strength in North America. The education vertical continued to be a bright spot in B2B, again delivering good growth in the first quarter.","Other revenues, which consist primarily of our bill payments businesses, increased 4% in the quarter or 10% on a constant currency basis, and represented 14% of total company revenues. Other revenue growth was once again driven by the Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina and the Speedpay electronic bill payments in the U.S.","Turning to margins and profitability, the consolidated operating margin was 19.1% in the first quarter, compared to 18.4% in the prior-year period, or 19.5% in the prior year on an adjusted basis. The decrease compared to last year's adjusted margin was primarily due to higher marketing spending and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by lower average commission rate and operating leverage from revenue growth.","Foreign exchange hedges in the quarter had a negative impact of $9 million compared to a benefit of $7 million in the year-ago quarter. Overall, currency negatively impacted operating profit in the quarter by approximately $3 million compared to the prior-year period. We achieved approximately $13 million of savings from WU Way initiatives in the quarter compared to minimal savings in the prior-year period, so we are firmly on track to generate approximately $25 million of incremental savings this year.","EBITDA margin was 23.9% in the quarter compared to 23.5% in the prior-year period, or 24.6% on an adjusted basis. The GAAP effective tax rate was 8.9% in the first quarter compared to 24.1% in the prior-year period. On an adjusted basis, the tax rate was 11.4% compared to 24.8% in the prior-year period.","As we previously stated, due to the complexities and uncertain interpretations of many aspects of the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December of last year, certain of the 2017 impacts were provisionally estimated and additional effects would likely be recorded this year. In the first quarter, changes in our estimates related to the Tax Act resulted in a $6 million benefit to our GAAP tax expense.","Due to the Tax Act provisional accounting changes, we are now providing both GAAP and adjusted tax rate and earnings per share calculations for 2018. The decrease in the adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was primarily due to the prior-year rate being unusually high and, to a lesser extent, some discrete benefits in this year's quarter. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2017, our rate was negatively impacted by changes in the internal ownership structure of certain of the company's international subsidiaries.","Earnings per share in the current year quarter was $0.46, which compare to $0.33 in the prior-year period. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was $0.45 compared to $0.35 in the prior-year period. This increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily due to revenue growth, the lower effective tax rate, and fewer shares outstanding. The C2C margin was 22.2%, which compare to 22.5% in the prior-year period. The margin decrease was due to the same factors impacting total company adjusted margin.","Business Solutions operating margin was 2.9% in the quarter, which compare to 2.6% in the prior-year period, while the unit's EBITDA margin was 13.8% in both the current quarter and the prior-year period. Operating margin for the businesses included in other revenues was 10.1% in the quarter which compare to 12.4% in the prior-year period. The year-over-year margin decline was primarily due to the higher bank fees in our U.S. electronic business, partially offset by revenue growth.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $133 million in the first quarter, which is net of a $60 million payment for previously announced NYDFS settlement and approximately $20 million of spending in prior-year WU Way expenses. Capital expenditures were approximately $37 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.1 billion and cash of $934 million.","We returned $88 million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter. We did not have any share repurchases in the first quarter due to some timing factors, but we have not changed our full-year expectations for buyback and expect to resume buyback in the second quarter. The outstanding share count at quarter end was 461 million shares and we had $943 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, which expires in December of 2019.","Based on our first quarter results and our recent business trends, we are affirming our revenue, operating margin and cash flow outlook for the year. We continue to expect revenue growth to be in a range of low to mid-single digits this year on both a reported and constant currency basis, and operating profit margins of approximately 20%.","The GAAP earnings per share outlook was increased to reflect the more favorable first quarter tax rate, including the impact of the adjustment related to provisional accounting for the Tax Act. We now expect our GAAP tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 14% and the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 15%. Our previous outlook reflected a range between 15% and 16%.","Consequently, we have increased the GAAP earnings per share outlook to a range of $1.81 to $1.91 for the full-year, with adjusted earnings per share in a range of $1.80 to $1.90. Cash flow from operating activities is still projected to be approximately $800 million in 2018, which is net of approximately $200 million of outflows from the combination of anticipated final tax payments related to the IRS agreement in 2011, the New York State Department of Financial Services settlement payment and WU Way payments related to 2017 expenses.","So, we have started off the year well with good growth momentum and solid profitability and cash flow and have adjusted our full-year earnings outlook modestly to reflect the tax benefits realized in the first quarter.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Wanted to ask about the \u2013 a little bit of the higher marketing expense and then the negative impact that FX had on the operating margin \u2013 the adjusted operating margin, maybe you could break that out. And then just trying to figure out if that marketing expense is just timing and it will even out throughout the year or is there something specific going on in the numbers that we should be \u2013 we need to know about. Thanks.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. Hi, Bryan, this is Raj. On the marketing expense, we were just under 4% of revenues, our marketing expense for the quarter, which is closer to what we expect the full-year average to be, and that was higher than last year's first quarter just because we sort of underspent in the first quarter of last year.","And the FX piece of it, we had a negative 50 basis point impact to margins in the first quarter, and that was largely driven by the negative impact of our hedges, and then there were some offsets to that. So, we would expect the FX impact in the first quarter to actually reverse, assuming rates stay where they are during the course of the rest of the year, and then just some timing of other expenses. So, that's really what the makeup is in the margin in the first quarter.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then \u2013 so in the second quarter then, will we still have a negative FX impact, or will it reverse starting in the second?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, if you think about, it really depends on where the euro rate was and other foreign currencies last year and a few other factors. So, the euro strengthened quite a bit during the course of the year, particularly in the second half of the year last year. So, you'll see less of an impact in the second half, maybe less of an impact in the second quarter as well. And then we have some other offsets like the Argentine peso devaluation continues, as well as some impact from our hedges, but you'll have less impact the next three quarters than you had in the first quarter.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Helpful. And then, Hikmet, just thinking about the competitive landscape, obviously the news of Walmart getting more involved in money transfers globally, it sounds like there's no plans for you to make any adjustments to pricing changes at this time. Maybe could you just talk a little bit about what that competitive environment now means with Walmart entering and what you'll be looking at to see if you need to adjust price or not?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yes, look, Walmart is one of the competitors for many, many years. You asked that question several times. We operate more than 20,000 corridors globally, for which we adjust prices if needed. Just to put in \u2013 we have 50,000 locations in the U.S., Walmart has 4,700 locations in the U.S. We are sending to 550,000 locations globally from the U.S. We are operating in 200 countries and many corridors. So, I believe that our competitive environment has been very good.","We will definitely look at the prices. We may have to do some pricing actions around the competitive locations, but that \u2013 we have been doing that street corner pricing, weekend pricing, different band pricing, next day pricing. We have been doing that for many years and we will continue to do that. On the pricing environment, I don't see big competition. It has been stable for the last years. We even had price increases, slight price increases in Q1. And so I think that the environment has been stable, and I don't \u2013 from today's point of view, I don't expect big price changes from our outlook.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Bryan, our pricing is quite competitive, also when you look at our U.S. outbound business. U.S. to Mexico is the number one corridor and we already have $8 up to $1,000. Jamaica, Philippines, we're also very competitively priced. So, that positions us well even with the changes that have been made recently.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions, gentlemen.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to start with a top line question. Obviously, a good start to the year here, the 5% constant currency revenue growth here in Q1. I know you're leaving the guidance for the year unchanged at the low to mid levels, is that just because you've got a tougher comparison in Q4, I believe it is, or are you just being a little bit cautious at this early juncture of the fiscal year in terms of some of the soft spots in the market that you alluded to in your prepared remarks?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Well, generally we are pleased with the start as you said, Jason. I think we had a very good start, 7% respective, 5% in constant currency. I think the team is doing very good. Retail money transfer has been executing very good. U.S. outbound business, several quarters, has been very strong. Europe nicely and Latin America outbound has been very good. So, I think that's going to continue. I would say that it's too early to look at giving a \u2013 or changing the guidance here. But we like this good start, and we like how we started the year and we're going to continue to execute.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just on WU.com, the constant currency growth there did slip a couple of points, I think. I think you were 22% last quarter, if I'm not mistaken, 20% this quarter. Do you expect that to reaccelerate? I think you did have a meaningfully tougher year-over-year comparison here in Q1. So just wondering if we can get back into the low-20s or low to mid-20s, or are you thinking 20% is kind of the barometer for the year?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","So, we are also here very pleased with our 20-plus growth rate, obviously. And one thing what we do is that we follow the two strategies in the markets where we have been for several years. We do the customer experience. The customers using us come in more often. And like in the U.S. outbound online transactions, they are really loyal customers. They like our service to send money to 200 countries.","And the other thing is also we are expanding. We are more than 40 countries. We recently announced Jamaica and...","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Panama.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","...Panama. And you're going to hear more announcements opening new countries very soon, and we're going to expand, especially in mobile. The people like mobile. Most usage on the online is the mobile apps, and they stay loyal. So, I am confident about the 20-plus that has been our track record. Is it 21%, 22%, 25%? It depends really on the quarter and depends on the seasonality of pricing \u2013 sorry, seasonality actions we do, promotions we do, and depends on the corridor. So, we're going to continue to execute that.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just the last one I wanted to ask was on U.S. to Mexico, I know you mentioned having the competitive pricing there. I think maybe in the prepared remarks you said something about some potential or some ongoing softness there. I just wanted to dive into that a little bit. Just kind of volume and transaction trends in that corridor just compared to what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, like, have we stabilized or have things gotten any better or worse in the corridor?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, I think U.S. outbound to Mexico is only one corridor for many corridors. We have been seeing a little bit of softness compared with the other corridors. But none of our corridors are bigger than 5%...","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","None of our countries are bigger than 6%.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","...6% of the revenue. So, I think if you put in perspective, it's maybe more of a seasonality. Just to put things in perspective, in Mexico, we have about 30,000 locations. And in the U.S., we have about 50,000 locations, plus our very strong growth on the dot-com connecting the 30,000 locations to Mexico has been a very good growth. And we also pay out in accounts, and that has been definitely something that we've been very \u2013 it's going to \u2013 it's a good business. We like it. And we're going to focus, but U.S. outbound generally has been a good run, Raj, right?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. And, Jason, we have not seen Mexico get worse, U.S. to Mexico. It got a little bit better in this first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. But it's not \u2013 at least at this stage, it's not getting worse. And we're positioned well competitively, as Hikmet said, when that market turns around.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Appreciate the comments, guys. Thanks.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Faucette (sic) [James Faucette] (25:26) of Morgan Stanley.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, just a quick question for me. So, I understand that you're not seeing a lot of pricing pressure right now, but when you look at the longer term and where you need to be dedicating investment and development on R&D, how do we think about your prioritization there, first of all? And secondly, when you look at other things like foot traffic, et cetera, has there been any noticeable change of that even if you haven't seen pricing pressure over the last while? Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, I think on the digital expansion, we are really seeing a good growth. Remember, about a few years ago, it was only 5% to 6% of our revenue was online. Now it's already 11%. It's a significant part of our send channel is the westernunion.com from many countries, to 40 countries to more than 40 countries to 200 countries. I think that's going to expand. So, we're going to spend money there. We're going to invest there. We're going to promote our online business. We're going to promote our apps globally in many, many countries.","On the second part of your question was...","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Foot traffic, any change in foot traffic...","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Not really. What we see is that repeat customers are \u2013 we invested also in the customer service especially in the retail side. We started some initiatives there and we see more and more repeat customers coming and that makes also our \u2013 we are satisfied with that result.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","I mean a key part of our growth in consumer money transfer was an acceleration of our retail business. So, we saw 6% revenue growth in retail, 3% constant currency, and transaction growth was 2%. So, we're seeing good retail business as well.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you. Good acceleration in revenue and principal sent. So, I wanted to ask, are you seeing early benefits of WU Way or maybe any opportunistic activity in transactions given some of the FX moves, just trying to better understand the acceleration you saw in both revenue and principal sent?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I mean, we \u2013 Tien-Tsin, this is Raj, and I'll let Hikmet speak after I do. But the \u2013 we saw acceleration in many aspects of our Consumer business. Some of it was related to pricing obviously, but that was about a one-point lift in the Consumer business. We had transaction growth acceleration. The market overall seems quite healthy. Principal growth, as you mentioned, we had 9% of principal growth and 5% constant currency, and that was driven by many different parts of our business. U.S. outbound was a key driver; parts of Europe were also a key driver there. And so we're seeing good traffic and good acceleration, and we'll see how the rest of the year plays out, but Q1 was quite good for us.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Also, on the WU Way, you asked a question on WU Way, the WU Way actions \u2013 the company \u2013 how we operate \u2013 the way we operate has changed. Obviously, we not only look at our operating efficiencies, we also look at how we can really invest in our growth initiatives, how we can accelerate to open new countries faster with our dot-com business, how we can have more efficient marketing initiatives, how we can have repeat customers more and we always use our lean management WU Way initiatives there. And that's really kind of a new mindset within the company. And the lean management initiative, the WU Way initiatives are not only working on the productivity actions, but also on the growth actions.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good to know. Just on the Europe acceleration, just to dig into that, is regulation driving some of that? And I'm not sure if there was some new regulation being proposed around DCC and I don't know if that impacts you directly, but anything we need to consider there for Western Union?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Really not, Tien-Tsin.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think it's really the execution on the market and dot-com part is also working very well. I did not hear anything that regulatory environment has changed in Europe. Obviously, we are much focused on the privacy side. That's a new area that we're going to focus on that. And that \u2013 but we are not alone here. That's many companies doing that. And \u2013 but besides that, the usual things, we are active there. We have our compliance programs. We have our anti-money laundering programs. And we saw a nice acceleration in France. We saw a nice acceleration in Turkey through different corridors. And so that has been the driver. So, nothing unusual.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good to know. Just last one, I promise, just on the share repurchases. No repurchases in the quarter. Raj, did you mention any restrictions? I may have missed it, just wanted to clarify that.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","I didn't mention anything specifically, Tien-Tsin.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","We just had some timing factors and considerations where we were out of the market, but we would expect to be back in the market in the second quarter. And we have timing things from time to time that prevent us from buying, but we should be back in the market in Q2.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very good. Thank you so much.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, this is Jenny Dugan on for Andrew. As volumes pick up and agent exclusivity breaks down a bit, is there going to be any change to your physical branch growth strategy?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","No. I mean, we continue to see a lot of white space opportunity for continued retail expansion and you've seen that over the last couple of years in various parts of the world. So, competitively speaking, we continue to get new agents, we're adding more to our portfolio, and we \u2013 that's why you're seeing some of the results that you're seeing.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think the success is really \u2013 we're really competitive on the market. I don't see any \u2013 in our \u2013 big \u2013 the team is doing very well in the market, so I don't see any big issues on the market.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then is there any change to your strategy in India, just given some of the change in cash usage and electronification over the last year or so?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think in India, we're very pleased with our India strategy, actually we have more than 100,000 locations all along in India and we really have also the \u2013 we are very active in major corridors. Is it from Saudi Arabia, UAE, or Qatar to India, or is it from Middle East, generally from India, or Canada, from U.S., from Germany, from England to India, these \u2013 Australia to India, this has been the corridors we've been very active and putting real good promotions that drives our growth there. Compared with the other competitors, we have a \u2013 I think we have a good size there and our competitive environment has been very well and I think that's it right.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Lara Fourman of Goldman Sachs.","Lara Fourman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Lara, how are you?","Lara Fourman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good. Good. Just in terms of the pricing increases you mentioned, is there any color you can give us on if there's any \u2013 where they are coming from or if they're on a certain transaction size or anything, I know you have 20,000 corridors, but any color there. And then also just more positive commentary on some of the commission trends, is that more from mix changing more digital or are you actually having better negotiating power when you renew some of the merchants and some of the partners you have?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Lara, on the pricing side, I would \u2013 there's nothing special. Absolutely, the pricing, as you know, over the years, the pricing environment has been very stable. And if you compare us with competition, we still have 15% to 20%, 15% higher premium than the competitors. Obviously, customers like our brands, like our customer experience, like the westernunion.com they use, like our reach, the global reach, being in 550,000 locations. Our anti-money laundering programs, our multi-currency settlement in 131 currency hubs. And that's really the premium that the customers are paying.","And to be on the market, this business has to generate some revenues, and we've been doing a pretty well job there, I guess. The increases, I would say that has been more than mix side. We do invest in some corridors. We decrease in some corridors and it has not been a significant increase, it has been a slight increase. On the commission side, Raj, do you want to say something?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. On the commission side, we're getting benefits in several different ways, Lara. We've been able to do a good job of bringing our overall retail commissions down over the last several years, and that trend has continued into this year. We also are getting the mix benefits from a faster growing digital business because that business is digitally initiated, either credit card, debit card, or bank account, but then one side of it pays out at a retail location, so that mix is benefiting us.","We really want to look at overall distribution costs in the company, and our goal is to bring total distribution costs down. So, as the business mix changes over time where we have more bank funding and bank payout and other ways of distributing the product, that's going to help us as well. So, we're pleased with the overall commission trends as well.","Lara Fourman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just one more for me, more for Raj, you gave some color on the tax rate in 2018. Any guidance you can give on 2019? I know last time you were talking about the BEAT tax could have more of an impact in 2019. Do you have any more clarity there?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, not at this time, Lara. We're still working through the BEAT provisions, the base erosion provisions, which effectively double tax a portion of our profit. So, there's still a couple of angles there. One is to push for a legislative change or potentially guidance from treasury, which we're trying to influence; or the other one is really to try to take things into our own hands and try to impact our structure or change our structure internally to alleviate the issue that causes the BEAT, base erosion \u2013 or the double taxation, if you will. So, we're still working on it. It's complex, as you can imagine, and it's going to take us the balance of the year to really come to a view on what that means for us later into next year.","Lara Fourman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, Hikmet; hi, Raj.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Ashwin.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I guess maybe start with a two-part question related to expenses. One is just to clarify, other than FX reversing are there other factors that guide the 10% operating margin, given (37:35). And then the related question is, have you already made all the GDPR-specific investments that you need to make (37:46)?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Ashwin, it's so hard to understand you, I don't know, but I'm no expert.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Let me try to give it a shot, Ashwin, if I understood your question correctly. On the margins, I think you were asking about the negative FX impact in first quarter. That will certainly reverse the rest of this year. We also would expect to get some leverage from our revenues that will be higher in the latter part of the year, and that will give us some margin lift. And then just timing of our overall expenses will also help us. So, that will help to get us to the margins of approximately 20%. It could be a little bit above, a little bit below, depends on where things trend.","And then I believe your second question was around GDPR. We're in the process of making those investments. That's regulation that goes into effect in Europe this month. And we've made a lot of different technology upgrades and changes. We've also invested in various operational changes in the company and are in the process of putting that in place right now.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, we hired lots of good talent reporting to our General Counsel, Caroline Tsai, recently here in the U.S. and in Europe, so that will help us also a lot.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then on WU.com, I just wanted to understand sort of the breakdown of what contributes to WU.com growth in any given quarter between new countries that you add, some same-store transaction sales versus pricing, any kind of help you could give to break that down.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, I mean, we don't really give a breakdown like that but, clearly, the existing markets are going to be the biggest contributor. The newer markets, it takes time for them to develop and for us to create awareness and they will add more customers over time. And the growth model here is keep adding more countries, more channels. Those things will contribute over the long term, while the current business keeps driving the short term.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, and the current business is all about customer relationship, customer management. And we know that the customers once they use our apps, they use our online, they register, they use that more often than retail. So, that helps on new \u2013 once we open a new country, it takes some time and then they start to use us and that grows also very well. So the model is really investing in the customer relationship, the existing customers, existing countries and opening new countries.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Understood. Thanks.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","And next, we have a question from James Friedman of Susquehanna.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Thanks. It's Jamie at Susquehanna. Hikmet, I believe in your prior comments, you had mentioned some of the use cases for WU Way as a growth driver. We often think of it as an expense initiative. I was wondering, have we seen \u2013 or can you share with us some of the use cases like have we seen any materialization? I think there was a WeChat and maybe a Facebook, I apologize \u2013 I really apologize if I got these cases wrong, but how do we see WU Way in the marketplace?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, I think what we do is that we have Agile. We are really focused on the end-to-end processes and from sending and receivers and we look how to optimize the go-to-market environment faster, how we do transaction in a faster way and in a more agile way. The WU Way next step is going market more agile, really investing in our innovation. And that starts it. And opening new countries and also building the customer relationship in a better way, that's all built on WU Way.","Just to give you an indication, about half of our employees, more than 10,000 of our employees have been trained on WU Way and they have the WU Way awareness training. And we have daily huddles. People start to work with getting together, what are the rates, where they can analyze the processes, where they can be more faster, how they increase the customer satisfaction rate. That's how we do it. And that has started to pay \u2013 it's a long journey, but it has to start to show first good results.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. And then if I could just follow up on the expense side, I thought you said, Raj, you did $13 million, may have gotten that wrong, in the Q1, $25 million for the year. Is that just because the comps get harder, or is there another reason why that wouldn't run rate longer into the year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, the run rate for this year will be $50 million, so that's what we'll achieve for the full year, which is $25 million more than last year. We achieved quite a bit in the second half of last year, so yes, when we grow over, there's not as much incremental benefit in the third and fourth quarter. And so that's why you'll see most of the increment in the first half of the year compared to last year.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. Makes sense. Thanks for the context.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies.","Benjamin Budish - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. This is Ben Budish on for Ramsey. I just wanted to follow-up on a question from earlier. You mentioned that with WU.com sometimes there's promotional activity. I'm just curious is that sort of what drove the divergence between the transaction growth and the constant currency revenue growth in this quarter or was there anything with mix or principal per transaction or anything like that?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Mix. It's the mix. The answer is mix.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, just mix of where the growth came from in the business.","Benjamin Budish - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just one other for me, on the B2B segment, you kind of mentioned earlier that there was some improvement, but below kind of the long-term plan. Can you maybe parse out like what drove the improvement quarter-over-quarter, and then what you expect over the next couple of quarters or years in the longer term?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","As we said earlier, I think our current business is below expectations. We are improvement \u2013 we have a refocus on the business. We really go to market differently now. We do use also WU Way activities here how to go-to-market, acquire new customers, how we serve the customers. Our long-term objective is definitely gaining market share here and growing stronger. Today's growth rates are good turn around, good start to the year, but below our expectations.","Benjamin Budish - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","Hey, Laura, I understand we have one more caller in the queue, so we'll take the final question.","Operator","Sure. And that question will come from Rayna Kumar of Evercore ISI.","Unknown Speaker","Good evening. This is Nick Fremo (44:50) on behalf of Rayna Kumar. I just wanted to ask how your partnership with Ripple is progressing and if you guys are seeing any other additional use cases for blockchain functionality besides the back office?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, one of the things is that obviously we look, currently, given our business performance a lot on innovation and different way of looking at our processes. Blockchain is definitely something interested. We are looking at it. We are testing also with Ripple. Our test is still a test. We are understanding where we can use the efficiency with Ripple, efficiency with blockchain. And we also have different investments, smaller investments in different start-up companies, different innovative companies. So that's going to continue to happen. We don't see a big change in our business model yet, but we will continue to be investing in \u2013 we will continue to invest in innovation.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","Okay. Laura, I understand two more people joined the queue. So, we'll take \u2013 we still have time for a couple more questions.","Operator","Okay. We have a question now from Bob Napoli of William Blair.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good afternoon. Just on \u2013 strategic question on pricing, I think, Hikmet, last quarter you suggested that The Western Union's pricing broadly is about 15% above the competition. I mean, I think that's come down somewhat over the years. But it does still seem like there are other players in the industry that are growing at a much faster pace. Do you think that your price premium at this point is at the right level or does it need to continue to narrow over time?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think, first of all, I am confident with our price premium. As I mentioned earlier, why the customers are choosing us, there are several reasons. Obviously, our brand, many people like our brand, like our services, like our global reach, being in 200 countries. We adjust prices constantly. We do constantly change our prices corridor by corridor. We even have weekend prices. We have over \u2013 we have corridor prices, street corner prices, and different to different, but overall, our business intelligence, our competitive intelligence shows us that we are still 15% higher and that has been stable for a long time, 15%. It's not been decreasing a lot, and we've been feeling very stable on that.","And from today's point of view, I feel comfortable with our pricing, comfortable with our services. And if one corridor goes down with the price competition is stronger, we will adapt to that. We will look at that. But in other corridors, we may increase prices. That's what we do. It's like an airliner, right, where you fly weekend, you pay different prices, you fly different destinations, different classes. I think that's what we do with 20,000 corridors. And within the 20,000 corridors, we do use artificial intelligence to adapt our bands. We do use different customer behavior, and that's one of our biggest competitive advantage to be in 200 countries.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then was there \u2013 and I'm sorry, I missed part of the call \u2013 a benefit from the volatility in currency and foreign currency volatility picked up quite a bit in the first quarter. Was that \u2013 did that have much of an effect on the quarter's earnings?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, just on the first part before I give to Raj. One thing also I want to mention is our principal grew impressive 9% this quarter and our transactions also grew. So, the people are using our services more and more. I think our pricing environment has been well received by the customers. Sorry, Raj.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, no problem. And, Bob, yeah, volatility, I would say there was a lot of market volatility. I'm not so sure that we saw a lot of foreign exchange volatility. So, it was not a big driver in our B2B business or more broadly in the company. I don't think that was really a factor for us to call out.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks, Raj. Appreciate it.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","Okay. I think we have one final question.","Operator","Yes, we do. And that question will come from Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Yeah, hi. This is Craig for Matt. Two questions and apologize for getting on late. Curious why the top end of guidance wasn't raised concerning the strong revenue performance, should we be worrying about anything in the back half of the year that could mute performance? And secondly, any thoughts on pricing, considering the Walmart2World offering that MoneyGram and Walmart just launched? Thanks.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, thanks, Craig, joining the call. As I mentioned earlier in that call, I think that we are very pleased with our start. And we have a strong quarter and we're continuing with our performance from 2017, and our programs we put in place are really especially in the C2C businesses is doing well. And that's the outcome of that in Q1. Our customer relationship and our customer experience in retail has been doing very well and our dot-com business has been growing, and adding new customers, by the way, additional customers to our network with our dot-com business doing really well. So, I think we are, from a growth perspective, we are pleased with that. It's too early to give \u2013 we believe it's too early to give a new guidance here, but we are confident with our business and we're pleased with our outcome.","And second part of the question was the Walmart part, I answered that question earlier. Look, Walmart is one of the many competitors worldwide, especially if you operate in 200 countries like we do, and 20,000 corridors like we do, there are many competitors. Just to put things in perspective, Walmart has 5,000 locations, 4,700 locations in the U.S. We have about 50,000 locations in U.S. to sending to 550,000 locations worldwide and more than 3 billion bank accounts worldwide. So, I think the connection that we build from the U.S. outbound is very competitive.","If we have to adjust prices, we will adjust. It's one of the corridors; we may do pricing promotions around the Walmart locations. That's what we do daily. It's nothing new for us to compete in the market. That's what we do daily, and the team is doing a good job.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay, thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","Okay, thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and we wish you a good evening.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

Overall, we delivered a solid quarter with good growth across several geographic regions in consumer money transfer, continued strong performance from westernunion.com, and 20% operating margins. The second quarter results once again demonstrated the stability of our core consumer business while our bill payments results were mixed and Business Solutions continued to be soft. Consumer transaction growth in the quarter was a healthy 5% and improvement from the first quarter and cross-border principal increased 9%, indicating we are performing better than World Bank market growth estimates.","Our digital business continues to advance with westernunion.com revenues increasing 22% in the quarter. This growth is even more impressive when you consider our multi-year success in the digital channel and our large digital customer and revenue base. Regionally, the Latin America and European regions remain strong, as well as the U.S. outbound market, partially offset by softness in the oil-producing Gulf countries of the Middle East.","We view the overall pricing environment as stable and we continue to do \u2013 make adjustments, both increases and decreases, wherever we see opportunities to benefit long-term growth. This quarter, we did some reductions in the Middle East, which brought the pricing slightly down, but this was within our outlook and overall competitive environment remains stable.","Looking at profits, our efficiency initiatives and expense management programs are delivering good results and I am pleased with our operating margins improvement from the first quarter. We also continued with our share buyback program, repurchasing $250 million in the quarter. Overall, our core money transfer business continues to perform, and we are winning and signing major agents. I'm pleased to announce that we just signed a new contract with Albertsons, one of the largest grocery chains in the U.S.","The agreement will add 1,000 locations to our network, a competitive win, in addition to extending our previous Safeway relationship, which, in combination, places our money transfer and bill payment services in over 2,300 Albertsons locations. Our strong global brand and customer experience in the retail channel, along with our digital capabilities, continue to be a competitive advantage.","Longer term, we are continuing to execute our strategic initiatives focusing on expanding digital offerings, enhancing the customer experience, entering new cross-border opportunities, and creating operating efficiencies.","In our consumer business, we have now expanded westernunion.com to 45 markets. And we also have many other digital opportunities in progress. We are working on expanding our co-branded digital offerings, such as with our bank agents, where we offer our money transfer to their online banking services and their ATMs.","Based on the information provided by our agents, we believe these digital offerings already represent approximately 2% of our C2C revenue, which is in addition to the 11% of revenue generated by westernunion.com. In addition, we are introducing high principal value account services in certain corridors with an intent to roll out more broadly over time.","We also see good opportunity to increase our westernunion.com penetration in existing markets, including Europe. Other consumer initiatives include various customer experience improvement and relationship management programs, such as roll out of our digital initiatives retail services, where a transaction can begin on the Western Union app and conclude at retail. Operationally, we expect our WU Way programs to continue to drive ongoing efficiencies...","Operator","Chorus call. Please hold for a conference specialist. Welcome to Chorus Call. Please hold for a Conference Specialist.","Operator","Please proceed.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I'm sorry. I'm going to continue where I stopped. There must be an issue on the connections from the operator.","Okay. Operationally, we expect our WU Way programs to continue to drive ongoing efficiencies and improvement as we further integrate lean and agile management throughout the company. So, we are excited about the future. Our second quarter results demonstrated solid progress in the core consumer business and good operating margins, as well as near term challenges with some of other businesses.","Overall, our full-year outlook remains solid, and we are continuing to make progress on long-term initiatives. Now, I would hike to turn the call over to Raj to give you more details on the quarter's results.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion increased 2%, compared to the prior year period, or 3% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation net of the impact from hedges reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $9 million compared to the prior year, as significant declines in the Argentine peso offset favorable translation from Europe. The decline in the Argentine peso negatively impacted revenue by approximately 2 percentage points, primarily in the bill payments business. We were able to offset part of this impact through increased revenue per transaction, in local currency terms. We estimate the offset was approximately 1.5 percentage points in the quarter.","In the consumer-to-consumer segment, which represented 80% of company revenues in the quarter, revenues increased 4% on a reported basis, or 3% constant currency, while transactions grew 5%. Total C2C cross-border principal increased 9% or 8% on a constant currency basis, while principal per transaction increased 5%, or 3% constant currency. The spread between C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 1%, with a positive 1% impact from currency. Pricing and mix each had a negative impact of 1% in the quarter compared to the prior year period.","Turning to the regional results, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions. North America revenue increased 3% on both a reported and constant currency basis while transactions grew 2%. The U.S. outbound business was, again, driven by strong growth to Latin American and Caribbean countries, and Africa. Trends in the U.S.-to-Mexico business improved sequentially, and returned to positive growth, while the U.S. domestic business had continued softness in the quarter. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 9%, or 4% on a constant currency basis driven primarily by France. Transactions in the region also increased 9%.","Revenue trends in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region reflected continued softness in the oil-producing countries, and some pricing reductions we implemented in the Middle East to drive volume. Revenue in the region was down 4% on a reported basis, or 5% constant currency, while transactions were down 1% in the quarter.","Our Latin America\/Caribbean region continued to deliver strong revenue growth, driven primarily by Argentina and other South American countries. Revenue in the region increased 11% in the quarter, or 20% constant currency, while transactions grew 16%. In the APAC region, revenue declined 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis while transactions were flat.","Westernunion.com delivered strong growth again as reported revenue grew 22%, or 21% constant currency, on transaction growth of 26%. Westernunion.com represented 11% of total C2C revenue in the quarter. Business Solutions revenues declined 4%, or 6% on a constant currency basis, and represented 7% of company revenues in the quarter. Revenues continued to be negatively impacted by declines in Europe, particularly in the U.K., although the education vertical delivered good growth again in the quarter.","Other revenues, which consist primarily of our bill payments businesses, decreased 2% in the quarter, or increased 9% on a constant currency basis, and represented 13% of total company revenues. The Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina experienced transaction increases, and local currency revenue growth, but in U.S. dollar terms, this was largely offset by the depreciation of the Argentine peso. Our Speedpay electronic bill payments business in the U.S. also declined in the quarter.","Turning to margins and profitability, the consolidated operating margin was 20.1% in the second quarter, compared to 15.6% in the prior year period, or 21.7% in the prior year on an adjusted basis. The increase in reported operating margin was primarily due to a legal settlement accrual and WU Way-related expenses incurred in last year's second quarter. The decrease in adjusted margin was driven by the timing of marketing and compliance-related spending, as last year's second quarter spending was relatively low in both areas. Marketing increased 100 basis points as a percent of revenue compared to the second quarter a year ago.","Foreign exchange hedges had no impact in the quarter, compared to a benefit of $7 million in the prior year period. We achieved approximately $16 million of incremental savings from WU Way initiatives in the quarter, which gives us approximately $28 million of incremental savings year-to-date. The EBITDA margin was 24.7% in the quarter, compared to 20.4% in the prior year period, or 26.4% on an adjusted basis.","The GAAP effective tax rate was 14.8% in the second quarter, compared to 9.7% in the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, the tax rate was 17.3%, compared to 11.2% in the prior year period. The increase in the tax rate was primarily due to non-recurring benefits in the prior year, and timing items in the current year period.","As we previously stated, certain of the 2017 impacts related to the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December of last year were provisionally estimated, and additional effects would likely be recorded this year. In the second quarter, changes in our estimates related to the Tax Act resulted in a $6 million benefit to our GAAP tax expense.","Earnings per share in the current year quarter was $0.47, which compared to $0.35 in the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was $0.46, compared to $0.50 in the prior year period. The increase in reported earnings per share was primarily due to the legal settlement accrual in WU Way-related expenses in the prior year period, while the decrease in adjusted earnings per share was primarily due to the lower adjusted operating profit margin, and higher adjusted tax rate in the current year period.","The C2C margin was 23.6%, which compared to 24.9% in the prior year period. The margin decrease was primarily due to the timing of marketing and compliance-related spending. Business Solutions operating margin was 1.2% in the quarter, which compared to 5.5% in the prior year period. The decline in operating margin was primarily due to lower revenue and increases in various expenses. Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 12.6% compared to 16.6% in the prior-year period. Operating margin for the businesses included in other was 8.5% in the quarter, which compared to 12.1% in the prior-year period. The year-over-year margin decline was primarily due to lower revenue and higher bank fees in our U.S. electronic business.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $299 million, which is net of a $60 million payment for the previously announced New York Department of Financial Services settlement and approximately $27 million of spending on prior-year WU Way expenses.","Capital expenditures were approximately $53 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.3 billion and cash of $938 million. We issued $300 million of five-year notes with a 4.25% coupon in the quarter in anticipation of retiring our $400 million 3.65% notes which mature in August. During the quarter, we returned $336 million to shareholders, including $86 million in dividends and $250 million of share repurchases, which represented 12 million shares. The outstanding share count at quarter end was 449 million shares and we had $694 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, which expires December 2019.","Based on our first half results and our recent business trends, we are affirming our full-year financial outlooks with two adjustments to reflect exchange rate changes and GAAP tax benefits. We continue to expect low to mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth for the year; however, we are adjusting the GAAP revenue outlook to low-single digits to reflect recent weakness of the euro, the Argentine peso, and other major currencies against the U.S. dollar. The operating profit margin outlook remains at approximately 20% and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in a range of $1.80 to $1.90.","Due to the second quarter benefit related to adjustments to provisional accounting for the 2017 Tax Act, we are adjusting our GAAP tax rate outlook for 2018 to approximately 13% to 14%, down from approximately 14% in the provider-year outlook. We expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14% to 15%.","The GAAP earnings per share outlook is now expected to be in a range of $1.82 to $1.92, up from $1.81 to $1.91 previously. Cash flow from operating activities is still projected to be approximately $800 million in 2018, which is net of approximately $200 million of outflows from the combination of anticipated final tax payments related to the IRS agreement from 2011, the NYDFS settlement payment and WU Way payments related to 2017 expenses.","So, to summarize, we delivered a solid quarter with good margins and we used our strong free cash flow to return significant funds to shareholders. Our financial outlook for the year is on track with minor adjustments for currency and tax.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thank you, good afternoon. Good job. I just wanted to ask, I guess, on the revenue side, the constant currency revenue growth did step down a little bit from Q1, so I'm curious how much of this was cyclical versus maybe pricing or mix or other factors, maybe for both C2C and the non-C2C businesses. Thanks.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure. Hi, Tien-Tsin, this is Raj. In the C2C business, some of it was clearly due to pricing, but we have very good trends in the consumer business. We feel very good about the stability of that business. The dot-com business continued to perform well. Latin America, Europe, North America were strong. And then clearly the Middle East region had some issues, we also have some pricing there, so that's what you are seeing in the consumer business. And then the B2B business and Speedpay and the Bill Payments business were somewhat of a drag to the overall growth from quarter-to-quarter, and that's really what you're seeing there. So \u2013 but overall, the consumer business had pretty stable trends.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, I think we are really solid, especially the retail money transfer business has been solid except in Middle East, but that's not new, as you know, Tien-Tsin. And we did some pricing actions there, but \u2013 and we do see some good return all the way down transaction-wise. And this is within our normal guidance. It's up and down on the Middle East. You saw our U.S. outbound business doing very well. As Raj mentioned, Europe outbound is doing very well, actually. And in France, particularly, is doing good. And dot-com is still a star and continue to be a star. Given the base compared with the competition, we have a much, much larger base, and we are still growing, with 20%. And we are affirming our outlook on the revenue side, so that's why. But there are some headaches also Tien-Tsin, as we outlined already. The Western Union Business Solutions and payments part has been slower than within our expectations.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Got it. Sure, everything's still in the range, so that's helpful to get some additional color. I just wanted to ask my quick follow-up, just on the Albertsons win. I know that's a big one. It's a credit takeaway. I know they have some corporate things going on, too. But I'm curious if the pipeline for agent signings, if that's changed? Or could that be up, given what's going on with MoneyGram and maybe with the Walmart, the commitment that they've had and whatnot. Have you seen any change in activity amongst bigger agents becoming available?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","No, I think as the agent signings are \u2013 any agent signing, and we are competitive on the market, it's a great win. We are very satisfied with that. It's also extension of our Safeway \u2013 30 years of Safeway relationship, and adding Albertsons as they merge together. And that has been a good one. And I could say that we are continuing to be very active on the market. And the agents like us, not only about the cash in payments, right, but also, they liked our stage transactions a lot, where you stage a transaction on mobile and you go and pull the cash there. And that has been growing very fast. So, the digital combination, retail combination, bringing agents, new customers has been a success story. And our compliance programs, I mean, these big agents really look at our compliance programs also. Right? I mean, they trust us, and we trust them. And the customers trust us. And that has been a win\/win situation. A great example is Albertsons, and I hope more to come.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Great. Great. Thank you so much.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Tien-Tsin.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Tien-Tsin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hey, Darrin.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hey, Darrin.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks very much. Hey, how are you? Thanks for the time. Just first question's on just a bit higher level. The westernunion.com business generally still trends very well. I think there may some questions, obviously, as you highlighted over the Business Solutions segment. I guess, Hikmet, really just asking strategic initiatives, how you think about the options for the company to reposition it for some sort of an acceleration at some point in the next couple years. Is there anything you can do around either adding on, bolting on pieces to westernunion.com? Or pruning some part of the company, that might make sense?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Great question, Darrin. I think we are always looking what is the best return for the shareholders are. Currently, we are, definitely focused to fix the Western Union Business Solutions issues. Part of the Western Union Business Solutions, especially the foreign exchange trading part is not performing well, especially in the U.K., not well. So, there's a specific problem that we are focusing. But it has been for a longer time, you're absolutely right, the performance has not been within \u2013 lower than expectations. And we will definitely look for Western Union Business Solution, what's the best for us, and what's best for the shareholder.","Saying that, also, our digital expansion is great, we will double on that. We invest more. We will go in 200 countries. We are in 45 countries. Our customer experience programs with westernunion.com is going very well. One thing I mentioned, also, in my opening comment is the white labeling, our programs with our existing agents and our new banks. The account-based digital money transfer is already 2% of our revenue. That's what our agents reported to us. And that's additional to 11% of our revenues were dot-com. So this is also something we are going there. And if there are also acquisition opportunities there, we will go after it. It has to pay back and it has to have the same growth rates, good margins for us.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. I mean, I guess, just a follow-up to that, Hikmet, are you at all being more aggressive on M&A, specifically on the digital side?",".","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Well, you know, we always been looking at that. Right? I mean, as you know, thank God we have a good business model with good cash generation, right? And we are always looking at that. But some of the multiples has been, as you know, there \u2013 some of them, they don't even make money. They just grow. And we just want to make \u2013 and their base is very small, actually. And it has to make kind of a good acquisition for us, and we do have some prospects. We are looking at it, but it has to be a good return.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Just very quickly follow up, the pricing mix \u2013 the mix and pricing impact on C2C, I mean it looks like it was a little bit lower \u2013 it caused revenue to be a little lower than transactions. It's been generally a pretty stable trend, though, in the last few quarters. I just want to make sure there's nothing from a trend-line that we should keep an eye on, it's just here and there each quarter.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, generally, it's here and there each quarter. We are pleased. The transaction growth actually went up in the quarter, as you have seen, Darrin, it went to 5%.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, yeah.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","And the cross-border principal was very strong at 9%. So, we are very pleased with that. I think the Middle East is an area that we were trying to invigorate some transaction growth, so that's where a lot of the pricing was focused. Overall, as Hikmet said before, we don't see any significant changes in the pricing environment around the world, and we're always doing increases and decreases, so.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","And in the Middle East, I just want to mention that, Raj, maybe for being more clear, in the Middle East, it's not only competitors or price adjustment, but it's also the economical environment, the old prices, the customer behavior has changed and there is \u2013 programs like in Saudi Arabia about Saudization that have impacted. So, we are really adapting our prices to the market needs.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","It's actually a market issue.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Market \u2013 more a market issue. Yes, Raj, it's more a market issue. But overall, I feel comfortable, Darrin, with the pricing environment and it's within our guidance. It's nothing unusual.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. That's great to hear. Thanks, guys.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi, guys. Just wanted to follow up on that. On the C2C business North America and Europe and CIS transaction growth both accelerated, but the constant currency growth decelerated. So, was there pricing as well that's causing that dynamic?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, it's a good question, Bryan. We had some prior price increases that we had made in both regions, and we always test things out, so we have rolled back, actually, some prior price increases, and it was less about reductions and more about just getting it back to \u2013 in some corridors, back to where it was before. And that's why you see the differential there. In North America, the revenue growth is still higher than the transaction growth and in Europe we are just getting good growth from France. But that's really what it was, more of a rollback of certain price increases we had done before.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then on operating margins, C2C operating margins were down on a year-over-year basis and that was due to timing of marketing and compliance-related spend. As we look at our models for the back half of the year, what do some of those trends look like for C2C on a year-over-year basis?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, on a year-over-year basis, marketing was higher than last year in the first half. You will probably see an opposite impact year-over-year in the second half. So, you will \u2013 for the year, if you look at it on a full-year basis \u2013 marketing is still going to be in the same range as it was last year, so about 4% of revenues. That's what we're expecting, but just some timing from first half to second half on a comparable basis. And if you recall, we had much heavier spending in marketing in the second half of last year, so it will not be as high as that spending level. And then there's some other put\/takes. Compliance is going to be relatively stable and, otherwise, nothing else really to call out there, Bryan.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And will compliance-related spending be similar as a percentage of revenue as last year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","It's going to be similar. It has been for the last few years, actually. It's been in that similar range, so I don't expect it to be materially different this year either.",".","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And anything you can do to get those costs down on a going-forward basis?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, you know, marketing is something that's really special to us and we want to keep driving growth in our digital business. But on the compliance in the other areas, we are always trying to do things as efficiently as we can. And our WU Way programs and driving operational and lean management, that's really the way we are trying to optimize things. It's not about cutting costs, it's really about putting better processes in place in the company and we're always looking at better ways of doing things, including in the compliance area.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, guys. Thanks for the help.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, thanks, guys. I just wanted to circle back on the comments about the oil-producing regions. So, I wanted to make sure we kind of understand the dynamics there, because obviously the oil prices have been on a nice upward trend. And I guess we would have thought that, at some point, that's simulating more infrastructure projects and so forth, and bringing in more migrant labor and stimulating, actually, more demand for remittances. But it sounds like there's actually pressure coming out of those send markets. So am I interpreting that right? Or what are the actual dynamics under the hood that are causing some of the pressures and then led you to try and stimulate demand with some pricing actions?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, there are several things, Jason, which impacts that. First thing is the immigration trends has been \u2013 as you know, Middle East, an oil producing country, has a different immigration policies than the rest of the world. You get \u2013 it's a two years or three years of visas you get it. And you go \u2013 and the country controls the immigration based on the projects they invest in. And generating cash flow, over the years, was less than the year's previous. And the project base really came down with the projects there.","Now it's started, it will start now \u2013 if the investment started again, it will attract long term, again, new workers to the Middle East. And that's number one. The second thing is that the Saudization project which started in Saudi Arabia, that has been giving jobs to more Saudis than giving jobs to Saud-Asians and that had an impact.","And then the third one is that we adjusted the prices to the customer needs because the earned money was less. There were different economic impacts. And that has been particularly in some parts of Middle East \u2013 I don't want to mention, because of the competitive reasons \u2013 but some parts of the Middle East, not all over the Middle East, we had done some pricing action. It's really responding to the market needs than a overall pricing change in our company's policies or that's really \u2013 that's it actually.","I don't know what to say more, Jason. That's it.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, that's comprehensive. That's helpful. And so, just coming back to wu.com for a minute, obviously it continues to slowly but surely increase as a percentage of total C2C revenue. I mean, when you kind of look out longer term, how big can it become as a percent of total? What would you aspire to there? I mean, is this 20-plus-percent revenue trajectory sustainable for another few years or so? I know the base will keep getting bigger, but obviously there's somewhat of a tailwind just structurally for that.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think we are in the beginning of a journey here, Jason. We are quite satisfied with our growth rates to 20%. And given our base, especially, how that \u2013 it's a great question. You have a great base compared with the competitors. Can you continue to grow that space? I think so because we are only in 45 countries, only. And some of the countries we just opened the last, maybe, 24 months, and that'll take \u2013 once that get us paid \u2013 that will also contribute to the growth rate.","In the existing countries, like in the U.S. outbound, or like France outbound, what we are doing is the customer experience. The customers, once they use westernunion.com, we saw that they don't easily go to the competition. They like our system. We are increasing our customer experience programs. I think that's what we are going to continue to do. It's just the beginning of a journey. And we're doing that.","The other thing is, also, I want to mention again our bank, dot-coms, right, using our system. Many banks want to offer to their account holders our global network. And it's already 2% of our revenue. And Scotiabank in Canada's a good example, for instance. They use our systems and they transfer money to 200 countries. And that's growing also. And we are have in France the same thing. And that's something also we are excited about that.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you for the comments.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Hi, Hikmet and Raj.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hey, Ashwin, how are you?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good, good. Thanks. I wanted to kind of turn the focus a little bit to the B2B business, if I could. Obviously, you guys made these acquisitions almost, I'd say, like, 8 to 10 years ago, spent a couple of billion dollars on them. Over that time period, I mean, the operating earnings from those two acquisitions have been kind of really small. And it seems to be sort of a cycle of continuous investment. So, I guess the question becomes, what's fundamentally wrong with your positioning in that market? And what exactly are you \u2013 what's the fix? I mean, can you sort of break that down for us?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, I think it's a good question, Ashwin. I think the issue is really the FX part of the business, right? The foreign exchange rate part of the business. And it has been \u2013 the market volatility has not been favorable for this business also. But that's part of that. What we really believe is the vertical part of the business, like the student pay, like the NGO pay, and these parts of the business going very well, but it doesn't show it at the overall results at the Western Union Business Solutions because it's still a smaller part of the business, but it's growing really, very, very well, and we are very satisfied on that.","Look, overall, obviously, that's a great business. It is \u2013 we believe on the big opportunity on that, but we also look at that if we can find how we can give the best back to the shareholders and that has been always \u2013 for anything, the shareholder value is the highest for us and we look at that. So that's \u2013 the team is doing a great job. They are really trying to fix it and the U.K. is a particular issue. And that's an issue that we want to do \u2013 we want to focus on that.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then the second question is with regards to the tax rate. Can you kind of go into sort of the actions that led to the \u2013 and it's a relatively modest difference, the actions that led to the tax rate being slightly lower, and where I'm going with the question is with regards to sort of the \u2013 as we think of tax rate in 2019 and beyond, will you be able to then use your tax planning mechanisms to keep the tax rate low?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Ashwin, I just want to make sure I understand your question. You said why is the tax rate higher? Higher than \u2013 I didn't quite understand.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","No, lower. Lower.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Lower? Oh.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I mean, yeah, yeah. What's the tax planning to keep it at the current levels as opposed to going higher?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, I think the \u2013 we are benefiting from various aspects of the U.S. tax reform, but there are also pieces that are hurting us or going a more negative, if you will. If you look at the overall tax rate, it is about 14% to 15% this year, and that's a combination of the lower U.S. corporate tax rates, as well as the minimum tax on our foreign profits and we earn the majority of our revenues and profits outside the U.S., as you know. So, all of that gives us about a 14% to 15% tax rate this year. The one thing that's still outstanding, as we think about next year, is the beat or the base erosion provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, which generally have a minimum tax on foreign payments or payments to foreign affiliates from the U.S. So, this year, that's not impacting us because that's only at a 5% rate. Next year, when that goes to 10%, that does have an incremental tax effect to us which will be negative to us, unless we can solve the issue. So, we are looking for guidance from Treasury or legislative change to fix that issue because we believe that was unintended in the tax law changes. And then we're also looking at some things structurally to address that. So, we'll have more color for you, Ashwin, as we enter the new year on how much of that issue we saw, but that's worth a few percentage points, so you can imagine that we're putting a full effort behind solving that issue.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Operator","The next question will come from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hey, good afternoon, Raj and Hikmet.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Kartik.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hikmet, when you initially discussed WU Way, one of the objectives was to hopefully help with top-line growth. Obviously, the underlying thought was to cut expenses but ultimately help with top-line growth. As you are into that program now, are you at a point where WU Way is helping with top-line growth or is that still going to take a little bit of time before you see the benefits of that?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think it will, because, it's really running the business in a different way and with our lean management tools and our agile management tools being faster in the market. And one the things is that what we use at the WU Way and other programs is that expanding our westernunion.com. No other company has 45 send countries worldwide to send money to 200 countries, to 500,000 locations, to 4 billion accounts. That's definitely using our WU Way tools how we can be faster. One thing we are also using our WU Way tools is in the customer experience one. We know that online users use us more often. They are repeat customers. And this is really done with our WU Way methods, processes, how we attract these customers. These are two examples. Obviously, we already use it. And about \u2013 I think it's about 4,000 people or 6,000 people at Western Union get their WU Way training. Our processing centers in different parts of the world, all our employees are really having their agile programs, WU Way training programs, and they go after every project with their lean management tools.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And then, Hikmet, as you look at potentially new agent signings, what's the trend been for signing bonuses and terms? Have you seen any changes in the last 6 to 12 months for either one of those?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Not really different than two, three, four or five years ago. And I think that has been, as you look at our agent commission, spend on sales, I think that has been really going down over the years, which is great, actually. The agent commissions and \u2013 which include also agent signings and everything. The effective rate of the agents has been going down. And our agents have been \u2013 once we have the agents, they have been for multi-years with us. Our top send agents have been more than 30 years with us.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","21 years.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Sorry, Raj, just corrected me, 21 years. And so, that \u2013 the long-term relationship has been always here, and we are happy with that and there has nothing changed, it's really being on the market. What changed, though, is that larger agents, especially with good names, are choosing partners like Western Union because of our \u2013 not of our global brand and digital offerings, but also about our compliance programs, not to disappoint their customers, work with a company like Western Union which has good compliance programs.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you, gentlemen, I appreciate it.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Okay.","Operator","And the next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, this is Jenny Dugan on for Andrew Jeffrey.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Jenny.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. How do you view growth in Zelle and Venmo playing out in terms of your U.S. pricing and volume currently, and then if you look out a few years?",".","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think generally, as you know, Jenny, we are \u2013 most of our business is coming from cross-border, cross-currency money transfer business, and that's our specialty. We have it in 20,000 corridors, and that's where we really make money. And if you put U.S. aside, none of our countries are bigger than 6% of our revenue. So, it's a very diverse portfolio. On the domestic money transfer business, we have some countries like the U.S. and some other \u2013 not many countries like \u2013 domestic, it's about...","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","7%.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","...7% of our revenue, if you put it in perspective of total revenue, and that's a smaller part of our business. It's a slower-growth business, but there are certain customers they like it because what happens is that especially if you send money from your mobile app, you immediately get cash in 45,000 locations in the U.S. and this is a huge competitive advantage and these kind of customers like that, immediate cash availability, sending money \u2013 let's say, $70 immediately from your phone and someone nationwide can pick up the money in minutes. That has been the case. But it's a slower business than our international business, slow growth business. And it's the certain customer \u2013 we respond to the certain customer needs.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","On Zelle and Venmo, some customers may be migrating to those, but those are account-to-account services, right? So, it's just different what our business is and that's why it's not \u2013 they are not that related, but there might be some migration of customers to those other free services.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","And we still make money. We charge fees and customers pay for that convenience and I think Venmo and Zelle fees structure is zero, I believe.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just real quick on wu.com, you've talked about 80% of new users coming from outside the Western Union base. Is that still the case or are you seeing more transition from your core?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Right. It's still the case. That's a good news. It's still the case. They are new. They like it. They joined westernunion.com and what we hear also from our agents, account-based digital money transfer, they're also new customer segment, and that's great, actually. Digital attracts new customer segments through our global branding.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","The great thing about our dot-com business is that it is digitally initiated. But the vast majority of the revenue we earn is still at a retail payout. So, it's not the place where competitors are actually trying to compete with us, they're trying to play in the account-to-account space, which is actually a business that we are going to be very good at as well. We are putting a lot of our resources and growth into account-to-account or online-to-account. And because of our global presence already, we're going to be able to get there faster than anybody else is going to be in 200 countries and territories around the world.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And next question we have a question from Rayna Kumar from Evercore ISI.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hi, thanks for taking my question.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Rayna.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","I just want to better understand your pricing actions in the quarter. Was the pricing decreases in the Middle East and rolled back on pricing in other regions in response to Walmart2World pricing? Or are you seeing some new competition out there? And secondly, do you expect further pricing cuts or rollbacks of pricing in the second half of the year?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Absolutely not. I mean, the pricing actions were really region specific, and it has nothing to do with Walmart2World. Our U.S. outbound business has been going very well, actually. You saw the numbers. And we've been competitive. We do always pricing action in the U.S. or whatever that is. Right? But it's always within our guidance, it's business as unusual. And that has not changed. So, we are very proud of our U.S. outbound business.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","And Rayna, we're always testing pricing even in close proximity to the Walmart locations. And we've done some things there, which is a very small fraction of our network, and not a big impact to the overall pricing picture. And we're having some success there as well. So, we feel good about the U.S. outbound, which is where the Walmart2World was focused.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","Great. That's really helpful. It's good to see the Albertsons win. When do you expect that to become material to revenue and earnings? And is there some additional upfront spending involved to get that on board?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","The Albertsons will be largely live as we start next year. We're going to spend some time to make sure we launch it really well.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Within the Albertsons umbrella, we have Safeway already.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","We already have Safeway, which is the majority of the network. But we'll be adding the additional locations or additional 1,000 locations by early next year. And so, it's a nice win for us, and we're looking forward to that revenue ramp-up.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","Great. And just one final question from me. The higher compliance spend in the quarter, was that above the traditional 3.5%, 3.6% of revenue range? And was that, like, a pull forward of compliance spend? Or are you seeing something out there in the regulatory front which you're reacting to?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Rayna, it was more about lower spending last year's second quarter. That was unusually low because we had a one-time benefit that helped us last year in the second quarter. So, this year is much more normal range. And it's in that range that we've been at for a while.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have a question from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hey, Jim.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Yeah, good morning. Or good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I'm not sure what time it is anymore. I guess there was a couple questions on pricing, but I did want to ask you about the Asia Pacific, where I think transactions outrun the constant currency revenue change by quite a bit. You didn't call that out, I don't believe, in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe just talk about what's happening in that region?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, I mean, APAC is a relatively small portion of our overall revenues. And this is outbound revenue from APAC, which is about 7%. I would say, there are two key drivers there were in Malaysia and Singapore. Those were the two countries. We had done some prior price actions, but that was back in the fourth quarter, so we're still continuing through that. But Australia is probably the biggest market there. The APAC region overall has been relatively flattish for us, and not a big contributor either way. So, we are doing some things there and launching digital in some markets soon and some other things as well, so.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Fair enough. And then maybe, Hikmet, on the digital strategy, I think you've talked in the past about partnerships with social media companies as being a potential driver to stimulate volume. Can you maybe give us an update there in terms of how much have those partnerships to date kind of turned into revenue? Any kind of sizing would be helpful. And then I guess going forward, would you expect there's a pipeline of additional partnerships that actually might jumpstart that business even further? Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","First of all, great question, Jim. We always look for additional partners and we are in acquisition mode, so our salespeople doing a good job, our account people doing a good job. So, I think there will be definitely a new announcement because people are really joining our network and they like that \u2013 the global network.","On the partnerships, I would say that the main growth, as you saw, primarily comes from westernunion.com. The send customers do trust the Western Union brand and they want to use the Western Union brand that \u2013 when they receive. The other big partnerships are those banks, where the funds are already on the banks and this is a growth area we believe that we can offer our platform to the banks and we are doing it, and it's already 2% of our revenue and it's going very good. And there will be more announcements there also, I believe, coming. And like banks using their own brand, but on the back is our processing machine, our network, payout network, everything. That has been also very good.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Jim.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure. Thanks, Jim.","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","Well, I understand we have one more question, so we'll take the final caller.","Operator","Yes, our final question will come from David Scharf of JMP Securities.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, David.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Hey, two questions, one specific, one general. On the specific side, Latin America has obviously remained sort of the bright spot in terms of growth. I'm trying to get a sense for wu.com's impact there. Can you remind us sort of the geographic focus of wu.com, whether...","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","...remittances to Latin America on that channel are proportional to Latin America's overall representation of revenue?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","So generally, what we see also it's a general \u2013 although the base is always a \u2013 kind of an outbound trends for the emerging markets, which Latin America is there also. We see good growth from some traditional inbound countries, also now new outbound transactions, and Latin America is a part of that. So, you see that growth there. From westernunion.com, obviously, we're for years very focused on the U.S. outbound and Anglo-Saxon environment like U.K., Canada, and Australia, but the big growth also is coming from Europe, Europe outbound, westernunion.com is growing. And I have to say that we just stretched the potential there.","We just started there, I think the team is doing good with customer experience, and then the expansion is definitely to the new countries in the Gulf states; the traditional outbound countries is also the next expansion, and in Asia we are hoping that we can expand \u2013 a new signed \u2013 is going to Brazil. We just signed Brazil outbound with our westernunion.com and others to come.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. And, David, just to clarify this, the regional reporting that we do is on an outbound basis, so the Latin America revenue growth and constant transaction growth is outbound. So, the U.S. to Latin America sends from wu.com would be in the North America region and it is a big important part of the business.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then just to wrap up, maybe kind of bigger-picture question. When I reflect on kind of the bullet point in your strategic initiative slide about entering new cross-border opportunities, even considering signing up Albertsons, as a takeaway. I'm trying to get \u2013 maybe you can help us understand a little bit from a capital allocation standpoint \u2013 how you compare the returns of those opportunities to just buying back more stock. Because it does feel like you're so large, so sprawling, that eight years into a global recovery, no matter how much you spent on marketing, promotion, restructuring, WU Way, the aggregate numbers are still sort of 2% here, 4% there, 3% growth there. Has the board ever considered the opposite tact of perhaps rationalizing your footprint, maybe paring back slower growth regions that might be more secularly changing like the Middle East, and not just a result of certain cyclical factors?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Well, you know our business very well, David. I mean, the big advantage of our business is that being in 20,000 corridors, right? And as you know, if you followed us for many years, you saw some regions are growing, some regions are coming down. The portfolio management with our pricing \u2013 artificial intelligence, with our pricing what we do here is our competitive advantage. Sending money from U.S. to 200 countries is huge. Sending money from Italy to 200 countries is huge. No other company do that. And we are not losing money. We are always making money. Or most of our costs are variable costs, and we need the growth, and that's what adds it.","And if you are only in a few corridors, let's assume that one economical crisis happens at that region, it will be even more risky. And we do allocate our marking investment, our investment against opportunities. And we are all constantly looking at our operating model with WU Way activities, how we can optimize it to drive the shareholder value.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Got it.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael A. Salop","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's second quarter 2014 results and then we will take your questions.","The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.","Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2013 Form 10-K, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","During the call, we'll discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We have reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section.","All statements made by Western Union officers on the call are the property of The Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you, Mike; and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, the first half results are generally in line with our expectations coming into the year, and we are pleased to be able to narrow the full year operating profit margin and earnings per share outlooks to the higher end of the previous ranges.","The strategic actions we have implemented in consumer money transfer over the last couple of years, including pricing adjustments in key corridors and digital expansion, have helped turn the business back to positive revenue growth in the first half of 2014.","Our productivity initiatives are also contributing to results as we have maintained a 20% margin in the first half, despite cost pressure in some key areas. And we continue to generate and deploy strong cash flow for our shareholders, with over $200 million of share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. For the first half of the year, we have now returned over $450 million to shareholders.","In the quarter, revenue increased 1% or 3% in constant currency terms. Our Consumer-to-Consumer revenue increased 2% or 3% constant currency, driven by both improvement in cash initiative retail Money Transfer and continued strong growth from westernunion.com.","Trends have been aided by our previous pricing actions, but we are also seeing growth in nonprice corridors. We have made adjustments to address our value proposition in the key corridors, and we do not believe significant additional pricing reductions are needed this year.","The impact of pricing in the second quarter was only 1% of revenue, although reported revenue was also negatively impacted by currency and some geographic mix differences compared to last year.","We continue to make progress with westernunion.com, including risk management enhancement in the U.S., the launch of mobile experience in the U.K., the addition of bank account funding options in several European countries and direct-to-bank actions in new markets.","We are acquiring new online customers at a fast rate as well as increasing customer retention. However, based on our latest customer comp projections and the timing of new service rollouts, we no longer expect the acceleration in trends to be as steep as we previously anticipated. As a result, our $500 million revenue target for digital is being pushed out beyond 2015.","Digital, which includes westernunion.com and Mobile Money Transfer, is still an area that is generating strong growth. Our strategies are working, and westernunion.com online money transfer revenues increased 31% in the quarter and are up 38% on a year-to-date basis. We expect the digital business to continue to be a long-term growth driver for Western Union.","Western Union Business Solutions' revenue was flat in the quarter, which follows 3 straight quarters of double-digit constant currency growth. We believe customers' activity was impacted by extremely low foreign exchange volatility in the quarter and some sales execution challenges. On the year-to-date basis through June, Business Solutions' constant currency revenue increased 5%, which is roughly in line with global trade projections. Although we continue to believe it is a strong long-term growth opportunity, considering the current lower foreign exchange volatility in the market, we do not believe we will reach the full year double-digit revenue growth target for Business Solutions in 2014.","For the total company, however, based on our first half performance and forecast for the remainder of the year, we have affirmed our 2014 revenue outlook. We have narrowed our operating margin outlook to approximately 19.5% to 20%, which is at the higher end of the previous range. As a result, I am pleased to report we have also narrowed our earnings per share outlook to $1.45 to $1.50, also at the higher end of the previous range.","As we look to the second half of the year and the future, we remain focused on strengthening consumer money transfer with an emphasis on digital expansion, growing Western Union Business Solutions and generating and developing strong cash flow for our shareholders. We believe long-term growth will be driven by digital, C2C and Business Solutions but also with lower but steady growth rates from the cash initiative C2C.","In consumer money transfer, we expect cash payout at our global agent locations and ATMs to still be extremely important for our receivers, and we plan to continue expanding our account payout options to bring new customers to our business.","Increasing our network through both strategic retail agents and more digital connection is also important part of our strategy. In Business Solutions, we plan to continue to increase our integrated product offerings and expand our customers base to drive business in a strong long-term growth market. And of course, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and deploy it for our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","Finally, I would like to say how pleased I am with a couple of key additions to our team that we announced earlier this month. We are very proud to add Robert Selander, former CEO of MasterCard, to the Western Union Board of Directors. Rob brings a wealth of business and financial service experience to our board, and we are looking forward to benefiting from his payment expertise. And as you are aware, Raj Agrawal was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer after serving in the role on an interim basis since the beginning of the year. Raj has demonstrated to me and to our Board of Directors that he was the right choice for this position. He's a strong leader with a diverse financial and business background, and he has deep knowledge of our business. So, Raj, I would like to now welcome you officially to this role, and I would like to ask to give more detail on the second quarter.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Thank you, Hikmet, and I am very pleased to be named in this role, and I look forward to meeting more of the investment community in the coming months.","So let's turn to the financial results for the quarter. Total revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of 1% or 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year.","Electronic channels revenue increased 27% in the quarter and represented 6% of total company revenue.","In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue increased 2% or 3% on a constant currency basis. Total transactions increased 6% in the quarter, which benefited from our previously implemented pricing and other strategic actions in key corridors and strong growth in westernunion.com.","Western Union C2C cross-border principal increased 7% in the second quarter or 6% on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction was flat compared to the prior year period on both the reported and constant currency basis. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, we expected C2C transaction growth rates to come down from the 9% levels we saw the last 3 quarters as we moved further away from the pricing-driven lift, but the pricing impact on revenue has narrowed.","The spread between the C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 4 percentage points, including a negative 1% impact from currency. The impact of net price decreases was 1% in the quarter, while mix had a negative impact of approximately 2%. Mix was negatively impacted by growth in some lower revenue per transaction geographies and the reduction in business and some high revenue per transaction corridors. We continue to anticipate 2014 pricing actions to be modest.","Turning to the regions. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 3% year-over-year, including a positive 1% impact from currency, with Germany continuing to deliver strong growth. Transactions in the region increased 11% and benefited from the pricing actions implemented in 2013.","North America revenue grew 1% in the quarter, while transactions increased 3%. U.S. outbound continue to deliver good growth, while Mexico revenue grew 2% on a transaction increase of 3% in the quarter.","Domestic money transfer trends were similar to the first quarter, with revenue increasing 1% and transactions growing 6%.","In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue and transactions each increased 6% compared with the year-ago quarter, with no impact from currency. Strong revenue growth from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates drove the region's increase, and we are pleased that we recently renewed a multiyear agreement with Bank Albilad in Saudi Arabia, one of our largest global agents.","In Asia Pacific, revenue grew 1%, including a negative 1% impact from currency, and transactions increased 3%. Revenue benefited primarily from strong growth in Japan and further increases from the Philippines.","The Latin America and Caribbean region revenue was down 13% from their prior year period, including a negative a 6% impact from currency, and transactions were flat. The currency impact was primarily due to the weak Argentina peso, while constant currency revenue was negatively impacted by government-imposed restrictions on the market in Venezuela.","Westernunion.com delivered strong C2C revenue growth of 31% in the quarter while transactions increased 46%. U.S.-originated online transactions also grew 46%.","Wu.com continue to benefit from very strong revenue growth in several key corridors, including U.S. outbound to India, the Philippines and Mexico. U.S. domestic money transfer and U.K. to India. In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 5% in the quarter but increased 8% on a constant currency basis. The differential between the reported and constant currency rates was primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso.","On a constant currency basis, the South America businesses continue to grow while in the U.S. increases in electric bill payments were offset by declines in cash walk-in business. Business Solutions revenue was flat on a reported and constant currency basis and represented 7% of total company revenues in the quarter.","Turning to consolidated margins. The second quarter GAAP operating margin was 19.8% compared to 20% in the prior year period. The margin was negatively impacted by higher average C2C retail commission rates, higher interchange costs in consumer bill payments and the impact of currency and benefited from cost savings initiatives and lower integration costs. Compliance expense in the second quarter was approximately 3% of revenue. We continue to expect cost to ramp in the second half of the year, but we do appear to be in good shape to be -- toward the lower end of our 3.5% to 4% full year outlook.","The benefits from cost savings initiatives relate to comparisons with cost in the second quarter of last year when we incurred $20 million of expenses related to the combination of cost savings initiatives and Travelex Global Business Payments integration. We also achieved just over $10 million of incremental cost savings in this year's second quarter and continue to expect approximately $45 million in incremental savings for the full year.","EBITDA margin was 24.7% in the quarter compared to 24.8% a year ago. Our tax rate was 16.5% in the second quarter, and we continue to expect a full year rate of around 15%.","Reported earnings per share in the quarter was $0.36, which is the same as the prior year period. The C2C segment operating margin was 22.7%, down from 23.2% in the prior year period, primarily due to higher average retail commission rates and the negative impact of currency, which were partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives.","The Consumer-to-Consumer operating margin declined primarily due to higher funding costs related to increased interchange expense, driven by increased credit card usage by our U.S. electronic bill payments customers. The second quarter C2B margin was 16.2%, which compared to 20.5% in the prior year period.","Business Solutions reported an operating loss of $3 million for the quarter compared with a loss of $7 million for the same period last year. Both quarters included depreciation and amortization of approximately $15 million. The reduction in operating loss was due primarily to lower integration expense compared to the prior year period.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $450 million. Capital expenditures were $51 million in the second quarter, and for the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately 4% to 5% of revenue. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.8 billion and cash of $1.6 billion. Approximately 25% of the cash was held by United States entities.","During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 9 million shares for a total of $143 million, and we paid $66 million in dividends. Year-to-date through June, we have returned $457 million to shareholders. At quarter end, we had 530 million shares outstanding and $177 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, which expires June 2015.","As Hikmet mentioned, based on our first half performance and current forecast for the remainder of the year, we are affirming the full year revenue outlook, and we are nearing the operating profit margin and EPS outlooks to the high end of the previous ranges. We now expect the operating profit margin to be in a range of approximately 19.5% to 20% and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.50. We have also adjusted our expected cash flow from operating activities to approximately $1 billion. Our previous forecast of approximately $900 million included $100 million of anticipated tax payments related to our 2011 IRS agreement, which are now expected to be made in future years.","So to summarize, our first half results were in line with our expectations, and we believe full year profit margin and earnings per share will be at the higher end of the previous outlook ranges.","That concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter, and operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just want to ask about a few corridors. It looked like Europe and the CIS region again was pretty strong; it up ticked in the quarter. And then on the other -- on the flip side, APAC and Latin America region looked like it down ticked a little bit. Maybe you can just talk about what's going on there?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Sure. Bryan, this is Raj. On Europe and CIS, we anniversary-ed most of the pricing actions through the first quarter of this year, but we did have some additional pricings in the second quarter of last year. And so we're still seeing the benefit of some of the pricing actions. And having said that, we also continue to see good growth from Germany and some other markets. So Europe overall is doing well for us.","Hikmet Ersek","Also Russia was good for us.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Russia was also good for us. We had good transaction growth there. For APAC, Philippines was a good contributor to us, but it did slow down a little bit in the market, but overall it was about flat quarter-to-quarter.","Hikmet Ersek","And India deliver, Bryan, good revenue, transaction growth, especially also from online corridors. We were pleased with our westernunion.com to India.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. And then LATA. There are couple of things that are going on in the LATA market. Argentina, on a reported basis, Argentina is cause of the lower reported revenue numbers because of the currency devaluation of the peso. The peso is about 35% weaker than it was about a year ago. And then, when you look at the business on a constant currency basis, Venezuela has imposed a restriction on the entire market in terms of capital flows to Colombia, which is our primary corridor there, so we were impacted there. That corridor has basically shut down, so we did lose that part of the business. We haven't assumed that the business is going to come back the rest of this year. We expect that at some point the business will come back, but we've made an assumption that it's not coming back to us at least this year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question for me on the margin. Just outside of C2C, what is the margin outlook, I guess, in the C2B and the Business Solutions going forward? How should we think about the margins?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","For C2B, we were impacted this quarter by higher interchange costs in the -- we had consumers using more credit cards. Over the last 12 months, we've been expanding our payment options with our billers and with new billers that we bring on, and credit card is a key requirement there. Clearly, that's in an effort to drive revenue growth there, but we also saw higher costs. So that's something that we're trying to address but...","Hikmet Ersek","It's also an industry trend what I understand too.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, we see just an industry shift towards more consumers using credit cards. So we're not going to able to fix that overnight, but it is something that we do believe we have some solutions to handle and to address this year. And in terms of the B2B business, the profitability is about at the same level as last year's quarter. We had some higher compliance costs in the quarter that were above where we would have normally had the business. I do believe that the business will expand margins over the next few years in that business because we need to get the revenue leverage, and we didn't revenue growth in the quarter. But as we get revenue leverage, we will be able to expand margins in that business as we can leverage the infrastructure that we've already put in place. So I would look for greater margins over the next few years in that business.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But for the second half of this year, the margin should be pretty similar to what we saw in both segments to the second quarter? Or should it be different?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","I think on the payments business our key issue that we're dealing with is the higher interchange costs. I don't really have a view for you on that one. That's really higher than we had expected this year. So it's hard to say exactly when we'll get that solved, but we are addressing that. On the B2B business, I would look for improvements. I can't tell you what it'll be exactly in the second half, but I would look for improvements over the next 12 months in the margins there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Hikmet, could you just talk a little bit about the digital business. I know you said that you're no longer looking for that $500 million bogey that you have left. Kind of just talk about where do you stand?","Hikmet Ersek","No, I think we are very pleased with our digital business. Last quarter we grew 31% of revenue, year-to-date about 38%, even the transactions growth about 46%, so we are very pleased with the momentum. We are also pleased with the customer acquisition. As you know that we put out the targets on the customer acquisition. The new customer acquisition brings revenue for the future. And the customer acquisition target is not accelerating is not, is not as steep as we thought in the last few months, but we are very optimistic. It's a very focused business. The main growth in the future will -- for Western Union will continue to come from our digital business. We are in 23 countries, dropping money to 200 countries, and our expansion policy continues. Our expansion strategy continues. So only the new customer acquisition has not been at the acceleration rate that we thought, and that's why we come back from the $500 million 2015, which was a target we set.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. And Kartik, I'll just add that the business continues to perform really well. I mean we had great growth in the quarter and the -- pushing the target back for next year is not really about this year's performance. It's really the acceleration that we needed from here on out. Going into next year was our primary concern, and that's why we've pushed that number back beyond next year. But the business is performing really well and really improving on various metrics.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Does this changed at all your outlook for the profitability of the business because revenues are going out? Or does it in fact maybe make the business more profitable quicker?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","No, I would say generally it does not change the outlook on profitability of the business. For us, we've always believed and still continue to believe that as the business scales and gains leverage we'll be able to grow the profitability of that business. We're spending a disproportionate amount in both marketing and technology in that business, but we won't need to keep spending at that level. Right now, the focus has been on spending so that we can drive that revenue growth, and we're still getting really good revenue growth in that business.","Hikmet Ersek","And also add on that, Kartik, as you recall, last time you asked the question, but the funding methods from the send side with the credit card will be less, so interchange fees long term will be less. There'll be more account-based money transfer and more direct ACH. And also, in Europe we have the direct support, and all these things will help to bring the interchange fees down. And on the send side, we don't have the agent commissions. So long term, I'm quite confident about the profitability of this business.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last question, Raj. You've done a very good job bringing cash back and returning capital to shareholders. How long -- or with the process you have in place, how long can you continue to bring cash back and continue returning that to shareholders?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, Kartik, we focused on that quite a bit as you can imagine. We're pleased with the current program we have, which goes through middle of next year. It's a $500 million program, and we still have about $180 million left on that program. As we said before, and this is still what I believe to be true, is that we do believe we have options to bring additional cash back over the next few years in some similar manner as we put our programs in place internally for intercompany working capital programs. So I believe we can continue to bring cash back and keep returning cash both in the form of dividend and stock buyback.","Operator","And the next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Raj, congrats on the title. I'll ask on the Business Solutions side. I heard sales execution was an issue. How quick a fix can that be? And can you just elaborate on that. And just the very low effect of volatility, I know you've heard that from a few firms now. Can you quantify the impact there and how that might -- what the sensitivity is in the future?","Hikmet Ersek","You want to -- why don't we [indiscernible]...","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, let me start with the -- thanks, Hikmet. Let me start with the volatility question first, and I'll give it to Hikmet on the sales part. On the volatility part of the business, the outlook for the -- first of all, our strategy for the business hasn't changed. We still believe that this is going to be a good grower for Western Union, contribute well to our overall growth. But when you look at the volatility, as well as it was, it was at a multiyear low and continues to be at a low level, putting today aside for a moment. Our customers begin to change their behavior because our business is made up of hedging, foreign exchange, risk management and then we also have other payment transactions that happen. So when you feel more comfortable with the transaction or when you feel more comfortable with where currencies are, you are less likely to move off the sidelines and do a transaction. Now ultimately over the course of 1 year or over 2 years, you will actually have to do the transaction, so it's really a short-term issue. Over the course of 1 year or 2 years, we would not expect volatility to have that much of an impact to the business. It's really in a very short period of time when you have such a dramatic move in the volatility level then we do see that impact.","Hikmet Ersek","Exactly. The volatility also impacts our sales execution contingent [ph] because the people are not trading that easy. It's hard to sell that, and plus on that, during the integration process we also changed some salespeople. We have a new sales organization. That has also impacted. Saying that though, on the nonforeign exchange trading business, on the payments part, like universities and like in due [ph] payments, we've been executing pretty well there. So new sales, new payments part of the cross-border will be as the transaction has been executed very well. But on the existing core business, we had given lower foreign exchange and other integration shows we had a little bit sales execution issue.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I see, I see. So if FX also stays low here, I mean -- I guess we should still assume it to be sort of muted growth for the -- maybe for the balance of the year. But it sound like you're still confident in double-digit longer term?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, we feel confident in double-digit longer term. I think the volatility it's hard to predict where that's going to be. Ultimately, customers have to do transactions. But when we achieve a flat growth, it does take a little bit of time to come back from that.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, understood. One more for me. Just on C2C everything looks very much in line, everything looks good there. Just the modest pricing outlook was comforting. Just wanted to clarify. So Walmart-2-Walmart, I guess hasn't been an issue. I mean also just thinking about some of the geopolitical things out there. Russia, you said was good. I know Israel some -- it's obviously some activity there. Just curious, if any of that could have been reflected in your guidance in any way?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think we are quite comfortable with our guidance on the revenue outlook, Tien-tsin, on the -- particularly on the domestic money transfer, revenues were up 1%. Transactions were up 6%. The delta, as you know, Tien-tsin, is the -- because our -- it's basically mixed because our lower band transaction have been growing faster than on the higher band transaction. I will say that with our 46,000 locations all over the nation in the U.S. the customers are continuing to use the ABMT business. So I'm -- especially also on the very strong westernunion.com., electronic DMT is going very strong with mobile, the people are -- who use their mobile phones to send transactions in the lower band, so I'm pleased on that part. The other, on Russia and on Israel and other parts of the world, I would say, generally -- as you know, we operate in 200 countries. We definitely have every day somewhere, something. Over the last 14 years, I've seen so many things; and being in 200 countries, that helps a lot. We have diversified portfolio. None of our countries out of the U.S. is bigger than 6% of our revenue, and that diversification helped. On Russia, I would say that our actions we have put took place about 18 months ago, the price promotions, especially to CIS countries and other outbound countries helped a lot to turn around this business. And the delta between revenue and transaction became closer, so that's also pretty well-executed there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Listen, I just want to touch again on pricing. It's good to hear you mentioned that pricing changes should be about done for the year, if I heard that correctly. When we look at the revenue per transaction I mean it dropped sequentially, and I guess that's sort of been the trend as we've seen from the -- ever since you made the pricing drops. Should we now expect that to stabilize somewhat going forward given that -- given your comments? So revenue per transaction going forward or other impacts to that, that we should keep in mind? And just, Hikmet, on a higher level maybe, if we think about pricing going forward now. You obviously made a big change. It had a successful impact of really showing elasticity to transaction growth. Going forward, can you give us some more advice, I know we've talked about it in the past quarters, as to how we should think about pricing in 2015 and really just longer term with where the business model looks like it's responding today?","Hikmet Ersek","Let me try to answer the longer term because, as you know, we don't give long-term guidance, '15 guidance, but let me understand -- directionally maybe, I can give you, Darrin, an overview. First of all, you're right. I think -- I'm not planning big pricing actions coming on the '14. I'm pretty comfortable with our projection, with our revenue projections. The impact where you see here is that they're mainly mixed. It's a band mix and the corridor mix. We see very strong growth in, for instance, in DMT, as I mentioned earlier to Tien-tsin's question on the lower bands, on the DMT, on the Mobile Money Transfer and also and some corridors are growing which are with a lower band --lower RPT faster than on a higher RPT corridor. That has been the case. The mix has impacted are part of it. But long term, I would say that, I think, we're going to not change our strategy. We're going to look at corridor by corridor,. We will always have a competition there on the market. We will -- especially corridors especially. It's a very competitive market, but we believe that we are very well positioned with our corridor-by-corridor pricing actions, and we will continue to drive the revenue. We are focused on the revenue growth,. We are focused on the operating profit growth, and that's going to continue.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just I guess with respect to looking at the next couple of quarters in terms of modeling, from a revenue-per-transaction basis I mean maybe if, Raj, you can just give us -- is there any other moving parts we should just keep in mind maybe besides pure pricing?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Well, I mean, the things that you should just think about our -- 3 things that can impact RPT are certainly pricing. We're not planning on any major pricing, but they'll be some just normal level of pricing. There'll be some mix impacts, and then you typically will have some currency impact as well. So those are the kinds of things that you should think about as you move forward.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. That's helpful. Just this one follow-up and I'll turn it back to the queue, if you don't mind. On the gross margins side, I mean that's been pretty stable for a while now. We've heard some discussion in the industry around more competition for exclusivity around the agents. So I mean can you give us a little color? Are you seeing any signs of that in the sense of other -- of your competitors really trying to go after breaking more exclusivity up and potentially turn off or higher commissions to agents in the market? Or is that really just -- are you able to really use your brand and hold off -- hold that off of from happening?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think this is really a pressure from the competition. They are going with higher commissions, with higher signing bonuses and everything. But, Darrin, you know this business. Most of our agents has been very loyal, especially send site. The top 40 agents have been loyal for us the last 17 years exclusive basis. They feel comfortable when they promote our brand with us. They feel comfortable. But, Darrin, case-by-case, we do have competition there. But I feel comfortable that we will continue to have our agent network keeping -- and our network exclusive and continue to have that environment.","Operator","And the next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. One on just a modeling question, if I could, Raj. In terms of quarterly run rate for interest expense, which dropped down I think a couple of million dollars this quarter, is that a new number we should use? I know it's probably not huge at the bottom line. I'm just trying to make sure I understand how that'll look over the next several quarters and into next year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, on interest expense, specifically, we -- as you know, we refinanced some debt in the first quarter of this year. We retired debt that was at 6.5%, and we issued some floating rate notes as well as some other term debt, so it was at a much lower interest rate, so that's having a positive impact. If you look at the other income expense line in total, we have some offsets there for FX losses on our -- related Argentina, so just look at those items in total. But yes, the interest expense should be lower than it was on that specific line item.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then the other question I had is, I guess it was a handful of weeks ago there were some stories about banks sort of throwing in the towel on money transfer. And I know from a direct perspective, that's obviously good news for you guys. I've been talking with other people. There's -- I've also heard people say that banks might stop supporting other money transfer companies to just rid themselves of any exposure to the industry. I know you guys have talked a lot about compliance as a competitive advantage. I mean anything you would say around those comments and those stories that gives you even more confidence? Are you seeing as you look deeper into the competitive landscape that, that's sort of starting to absolutely happen or be talked about where smaller guys are losing bank partnerships on top of banks just getting out of the business?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, Tim, I want my money back, and compliance is an investment we believe that will pay back. And 3.5% to 4% of our revenue, and we believe that it's a good investment. And it shows already some good signs that some banks or some other competitors are getting out of this business, and we do see some market share gain in some markets, not overall. In 1 or 2 markets, we started to see that, and it helps our -- banks not serving us, I don't know. I think it's about working together. Don't forget 75% of our network globally are banks and financial institutions, and they do see -- one of our biggest agents is La Banque Postale in France. And we've been together working more than 25 years worldwide with them, and they are very pleased with our programs, and we do share our compliance programs with them. And I think we have a good business model that they're going continue to work. On the competition, I can't give a comment here. I don't know how their compliance programs are, but I think our existing agents are happy with us.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I mean, I guess, where I was coming at from Hikmet, is clearly you guys are good partners with banks. I'm thinking more along the lines that there are lots of smaller players throughout this industry, as you know, that use banks for their banking services and partnerships around money flow. Do you think that those sort of second- and third-tier players in money transfer might find it harder to have -- to find banks that will work with them as a vendor and sort of a money transmitter partner, not necessarily an agent but just sort of say, \"You know what, we want to rid ourselves of compliance risk, reputational risk. We will not be banking money transfer companies as a partner\"?","Hikmet Ersek","Short answer is, yes, I do see that long term, and I saw it in some markets. And the short answer is, yes, they will have -- law enforcement will also ask them to implement all these programs. I think, yes. The answer is, yes. That will be hard for them.","Operator","The next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to go back to the discussion about commissions. Commission expense has increased for the past few quarters given agent renewals. And I'm wondering how we should think about that expense as a percent of revenue going forward? And whether or not there are any large agent renewals coming up in the next couple of quarters?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Hey, Sara, this is Raj. Yes, the -- in terms of renewals, generally, we'll have -- the contracts are typically 5 years in maturity. So in any given year, you might have 20% renewals. But you're not always going to have all the lumpy renewals every single year. So from a retail commission standpoint, yes, we've had some pressure. Our opportunity more broadly is about reducing overall distribution costs as we grow and change the mix of our business. So as we have more bank account type options, funding and sending to bank account and as we grow our digital business, that overall distribution costs should go lower. We also have the opportunity as we bring in new agents to bring them in at a lower overall commission rate. Now that doesn't have an impact right away, but it does have an impact longer term, so that's really the way we think about it. We have had success in managing commission, retail commission rates in the past, and we're, obviously, very focused on that. But at the same time, we want to balance the larger renewals. That's something that we're not prepared to lose. So that's the way we think about it in terms of overall distribution costs.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then separately just on the compliance initiative, can you give as an update on where you are in implementation?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. We're making progress. We have -- we expect the spending in the compliance area will be a little bit higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. As you know, we indicated last time that we plan to have about 2,000 people in the compliance organization by early next year, and we are deep into that hiring process, and so those costs will ramp up as we move into the second half. We're making progress on the overall implementation of the various programs, KYC programs, KYA programs and overall processes that we need to put in place. So we feel good about the progress we're making. We have a multiyear implementation plan, and we're all along that plan.","Operator","The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess my first question was, on the digital side when you say new customer acquisition rate is down, is that a question of you needing to maybe spend more? Are certain corridors tapped out? Is it more competition from other sources? What's going on there?","Hikmet Ersek","No, no, it's not down, Ashwin. I just want to correct that. Once again, I want to be very clear. It's not down. It's even growing very fast pace, but acceleration, which we were planning, right, for future, it's not as steep as we wanted to have it. Once again, I just want to be very clear. We are very pleased with our acquisition. We are pleased with our revenues. We are pleased with our transaction numbers, and the new customers are coming; 80% of the customers are new to the network. So all our surges [ph] are working. But we had good targets, and the targets are -- was higher acceleration coming over the months, and this is not at that number as we would like to...","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, we're acquiring customers at an extremely fast pace. We're also -- we have a fast rate of activation of customers. We're converting more customers, improving retention. But as Hikmet mentioned, the acceleration that's required the rest of this year, we don't see that coming at this stage. We're still working through that and are driving for the best result there, but we -- that's why we pushed that target back.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. No, what I meant was I mean your growth rate has dropped from -- what was it -- 65% in 4Q to 55% to 46%. And that's what I meant. I didn't -- that's what I meant. I mean in terms -- is that law [ph] of large numbers and what's going on? That's what I wanted, try to drill down, but we can talk about that offline. I guess, on the -- back to the compliance. Raj, you did mention 3.5% to 4%. You will be at these lower end of that range this year or near?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And is that because you're being successful in implementing certain things? Or is that a pushout into next year which -- is that also at a similar level, 3.5% to 4%?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, Ashwin, it's really the result -- we're making progress, as I had mentioned, on the key activities there of putting actions and processes in place. The ramp-up of the hiring is really coming in the second half of the year, so we see the spending ramping up in the second half of the year. Now there could be some spillage between years, between this year and next year; but overall, we feel good about the range for next year, which is the 3.5% to 4%. That's -- based on what we know today, that's still a good range for next year. And depending on how the specific items that we complete this year, that'll help us get more specific on in terms of where that's going to be next year.","Hikmet Ersek","Ashwin, if you allow me. One thing I will admit, we use the opportunity on compliance. Also mentioned that in this call is that we do see the impact of revenue impact on the higher band. All the programs we implemented in our programs. As you know, we went out there. We said we're going to do that compliance. We could create a culture of compliance. And we do see the impact on that, especially on the higher band, and it impacts our revenue growth. But long term, I believe, back to Tim's question, that will be a competitive advantage because I believe that we are going to be ahead of the competition.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, and from a -- just a cost standpoint, obviously, we're trying to do things as efficiently as we can. So initially, the focus has been on hiring people, getting things completed. But then, longer term, we want to put technology in place. We want to get efficiencies out of the spending that we are doing.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And on SG&A, I guess pretty good controls this quarter, and that was in spite of the World Cup spending. I don't know how material that was or is that going to have an impact in either 2Q or 3Q. Is there something that we should take into account or is that not material?","Hikmet Ersek","No, it was -- we did not spend on World Cup. We had a small promotion for some loyal customers, agent. But we did not spend anything on World Cup. It was maybe on Euro Cup you are mentioning, in Euro Cup, and that's a multiyear program, that's included in our marketing expenses. In our normal expenses, it's forecasted, so -- it's nothing. So I think the team did a good job. As you know, we announced some cost savings initiatives, and we are executing against that, and that has been reflected in Q2.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Can I sneak in a last question on the $100 million tax payment that got pushed out, any explanation on that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. It's really a question of timing, Ashwin. We had planned on that payment being in the fourth quarter, late in the fourth quarter this year. And there are just some outstanding items that are unrelated to that, that impact the timing of it, but we plan to make those payments starting next year. So it's really just a question of timing. Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","And our next question will come from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","S.K. Prasad Borra","This is S.K. Prasad Borra on behalf of Jim Schneider. Can you elaborate a bit more on your compliance costs, especially as you head into 2015, how would that pan out?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, our plan right now, S.K., is that we would -- we believe that the range for next year is still the 3.5% to 4%. Again, we don't have more detail behind that at this early stage. But based on the spending that we're doing this year, the programs we're putting in place, we believe that the range at this stage is 3.5% to 4%.","S.K. Prasad Borra","Okay. And you mentioned that it's going to be a sequential increase in the compliance costs heading into second half. Is it just more headcount related? Or is investments heavily geared to technology as well?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","It's all of the above, so it's headcount related. It's other programs. It's technology. The spending is split roughly half for people and then the other half is between technology and outside services. So it's a mix of all of those.","Operator","And that question will come from David Togut of Evercore.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","This is Rayna Kumar for David. Could you please discuss your plans for an instant ACH cross-border money transfer product, maybe tell us a little bit more about the timing and pricing?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, absolutely. And Rayna, you're talking about the -- really primarily the U.S. When we look at our business, instant ACH is one of the many things that we're introducing or going to introduce. We're doing a lot of great things in the business, and I don't want to lose sight of that. We are global in scope. We have many products and services and features that we're enhancing to improve the overall customer experience. We're adding many more customers to the franchise, even in our current business. And we're also expanding our distribution, so more bank account funding and payout options. Instant ACH is going to help, but it's not the only thing that's going to drive our business. So our plan is to introduce that later this year. And we're testing that as we speak with a couple of thousand people, but we will introduce it more formally and more broadly to other U.S. customers later this year.","Hikmet Ersek","It's only for the U.S. corridor, and it's a part of our business. So it's also how much risk you want to take, right? We are quite confident and quite happy with our growth rates, 31% revenue with less risk. That's a good growth and good help for the margin. But we do also -- huge growth comes from Europe outbound on .com, and we do have their direct debit capabilities, support capabilities, which helps us to drop money immediately.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","How should we think about pricing for this product? And what specific corridors from the U.S. will it be initially introduced to?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, we do already have ACH.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, we have ACH right now, which is a 4-day product. Instant ACH will just be an expansion of that. Our ultimate goal is to have that available for many of the corridors in which we operate but...","Hikmet Ersek","You can drop money with -- today's ACH, you can drop money to 200 countries, no problem. The question is, how do you fund that? So we serve, despite the competition, to 200 countries already with our ACH. The question is, when do you do the instant ACH? How much risk you take it? Currently, we are quite satisfied with our customer response, so -- I think and also satisfied with our growth rates.","Michael A. Salop","Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We want to wish you a good afternoon, and we'll talk to you next time.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

I am pleased with our fourth quarter results as revenue growth accelerated to 5% or 4% in constant currency terms driven by improved trends in our consumer money transfer business. Performance was laid by our digital business with westernunion.com money transfer revenues increasing 22% in the quarter and representing 10% of overall consumer to consumer revenues. ","Recently, cents from Latin America and North America drove the consumer growth, but we also start to see improved performance from the oil producing countries of the Middle East and Africa. Our payment businesses were mixed with good double-digit growth again from our speed pay and WU Way bill payment businesses partially offset by poor performance from business solutions, which led to a goodwill impairment charge.","Looking back on our full year, while 2017 GAAP net income was impacted by the Tax Act and goodwill impairment, our business remained resilient and performance overall was solid. We delivered 3% constant currency revenue growth approximately 20% margins on adjusted basis and adjusted earnings per share of the $1.18 exceeding our initial outlook at the beginning of last year. We successfully rolled out our WU Way business transformation achieving $25 million of savings and changing the way we work to enable operating efficiencies that can fuel future growth and we are able to generate strong cash flow and returned over $800 million to shareholders.","We remained focused on leveraging our cross-border capabilities and reinvesting efficiencies to accelerate growth in the future. In addition to our distribution network and brand, we have a combination of key pillars that differentiate us and continues to put us in a strong position in cost quarter money movement. These pillars provide a strong and unique platform with advanced technology, compliance infrastructure, global licenses, regularity relationships and settlement and effects capabilities. This gives us over the opportunity process and drive more global funds and transactions to our platform by acquiring additional and incremental consumers, financial institutions and global businesses.","In consumer money transfer, we believe digital will continue to be the growth driver and our resources are focused on digital expansion, more westernunion.com countries, more mobile, more digital partnerships and more products and services. At retail, we are continuing to invest in customer experience including providing digital services to retail customers such as stage and pay through mobile. We are also utilizing WU Way and lean processes to minimize customer pain points and optimize experiences to our money transfer business. ","In business solutions and bill payments we are implementing new go to markets where they just continue to leverage our digital platforms maximizing digital self-service, making additional tech enhancements and driving operating efficiencies. We believe our unique platform also allows us to serve additional cross border payment opportunities. ","Now as we look to 2018 our financial outlook reflects our expectations for a stable environment. We believe we will continue to drive good growth from our cross border, cross currency global business led by our digital channels although we do expect declines in our US domestic manufacture business. US domestic business which represents 7% of total company revenues in 2017 experienced softening transaction trends in the back half of the year and it\u2019s likely being affected to some degree by free P2P services in the market.","The cross-border environment however remains stable and we again do not expect significant pricing moves this year. In 2017 we had the net price increases in C2C after flat average pricing the prior two years. We continue to expect good growth from our bill payment businesses. Overall in 2018 we expect low to mid-single digit revenue growth and approximately 20% operating margin with stable trends in pricing, commission rates and compliance spending. ","So, to summarize we ended 2017 on a positive note with improved revenue trends in the fourth quarter and overall business performance for the year exceeded our expectations. We implemented the WU Way business transformation process and met our strategies to drive accelerated growth in the future. ","We were again able to deliver strong capital allocation to our shareholders and we are very pleased to announce a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend. We feel good about our cross-border capabilities and strategies and look forward to continuing to execute against them to drive good results and future growth. ","Now I will like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the fourth quarter results and full year outlook for 2018 in more detail.","Raj Agrawal","Thank you Hikmet. As I review 2017 financial results I will focus primarily on the fourth quarter, the similar information for the full year can be found in our press release in attached financial schedules. ","Fourth quarter reported revenues are $1.4 billion increased 5% compared to the prior year period or 4% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation net of the impact from hedges increased fourth quarter revenue by approximately $6 million compared to the prior year. In the consumer to consumer segment which represented 80% of company revenues in the quarter revenues also increased 5% on a reported basis or about 4% constant currency. Transactions grew 3% driven by growth in Westernunion.com. Total C2C cross border principal increased 6% or 4% on a constant currency basis, principal for transaction increased 3% and was flat constant currency.","The spread between C2C transaction growth and revenue growth in the quarter was 2% with a positive 1% impact from currency. Mix was neutral in the quarter while pricing had a positive impact of 1% compared to the prior year period. ","Turning to the regional results for the quarter I will be referring to constant currency movement as I discuss individual country contributions to the regions results. North America revenue increased 3% on both the reported and constant currency basis, while transactions grew 1%. In the quarter, strong growth in U.S. top-line business over the Latin American and Caribbean countries, India and Africa was partially offset by declines in the U.S. domestic and U.S. domestic businesses. ","In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 6% or 2% on a constant currency basis, while growth was led by France. Transactions in the region increased 7%. Revenues trends in the Middle East Africa and South Asia region turned positive in the quarter, benefiting from improved results at oil producing countries including Saudi Arabia. Revenue in the region increased 1% on a reported basis or was flat constant currency, while transactions were down 2%. Total inbound business to India from all regions grew 7% in the quarter, an improvement after fourth quarters of declines following the government's demonetization program implemented in November of 2016. ","The Latin America and Caribbean region continue to deliver strong revenue growth with an increase of 21% in the quarter or 23% constant currency, driven by Argentina and several other South American markets. Transactions grew 17%. ","In the APAC region, revenue was flat on a reported and constant currency basis while transactions increased 3%. Westernunion.com continued its strong performance as reported in constant currency revenue of each grew 22% with transactions also increasing 22%. Westernunion.com represented 10% of total C2C revenue in the quarter. Business solutions revenues declined 4% or 8% on a constant currency basis and represented 6% of company revenues in the quarter. Revenues were negatively impacted by declines in sales of our hedging products and overall poor performance in Europe particularly in the UK, although we continue to see good growth in the education vertical. ","Other revenues which consists primarily of our bill payments businesses increased 11% in the fourth quarter or 14% on a constant currency basis. Other revenue growth was driven by Speedpay, electronic bill payments in the U.S., and the Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina and represented 14% of total company revenues in the quarter. ","Turning to margins and profitability. Our consolidated GAAP results reflects some significant special items so we have again provided adjusted metrics to better reflect the ongoing fundamentals of the business. The adjusted metrics exclude the impacts of the tax act, the non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to business solutions, move away business transformation expenses and certain federal and state government settlement expenses. I will mention the impact of these items in my remarks, but I refer you to our press release tables for a detailed listing of the adjustment items for the quarter and the year. ","The non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to business solutions was $464 million pretax, the fair value revaluation resulted primarily from recent business solutions revenue and profit performance and the impact of the Tax Act. As a result of charge, GAAP operating profit and margin in the quarter were negative. Adjusted operating margin of 17.9% in the quarter compared to 19.7% in the prior year. The decline was primarily due to incremental marketing spend and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Currency negatively impacted operating profit in the quarter by approximately $13 million compared to the prior year period. Foreign exchange hedges in the fourth quarter had a negative impact of $7 million due to the strengthening of the euro and other key currencies which compared to a benefit of $10 million in the year ago quarter. For the full year, hedge benefits were approximately $5 million compared to benefit of $48 million in 2016. ","WU Way expenses were $35 million in the quarter and $94 million for the full year with about 90% of full year spending attributable to sovereign and consulting fees. We achieved approximately $13 million of savings from the WU Way initiative in the quarter which resulted in a total of $25 million of savings for the full year.","Compliance expense was 3.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter and 3.6% for the full year. Excluding the previously mentioned adjustment items, EBITDA margin of 22.5% in the quarter compared to 24.5% in the prior-year period. Tax expense in the quarter included an estimated incremental expense of $828 million related to the U.S. Tax Act, the adjusted tax rate was 14% in the quarter compared to 7% in the prior-year period. The incremental Tax Act expense was primarily due to taxes from certain of the companies previously undistributed foreign earnings partially offset by benefits from the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax asset and liabilities and other tax balances.","The company\u2019s 2017 U.S. Federal tax cash liability including the effects of the Tax Act and other company income and tax attributes is estimated at $780 million and will be payable over the next eight years with 8% per year payable in years one through five 15% in year six, 20% in year seven and 25% in year eight. Due to the complexity of uncertain interpretations of many aspects of the Tax Act, certain of the 2017 impacts have been provisionally estimated and additional effects maybe recorded in 2018 in accordance with SEC guidance.","We currently expect our tax rate in 2018 to be between 15% and 16%. The Tax Act beat or based erosion provisions on U.S. payment made the foreign affiliate may result at a higher rate for us in 2019, but we are still evaluating interpretation as well as working on possible mitigating actions so it is difficult to project the precise impact at this stage. We will benefit from tax reform in relation to efficient, long-term access to our foreign cash as U.S. taxes on future foreign earnings will no longer be tied to repatriation. We do not expect the Tax Act to significantly impact our capital allocation plan in the next several years. ","The incremental Tax Act expense and the goodwill impairment charge negatively impacted earnings per share in the fourth quarter resulting in a GAAP loss per share of $2.44 which compared to a loss of $0.73 in the prior year period. The prior year period was impacted by our joint settlement agreements with Federal and State government. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.41 in the quarter which compared to $0.47 in the fourth quarter of last year.","Turning to the segment and other margins. The goodwill impairment and other adjustments are excluded from segment operating result. The CEC margin was 21.4% which compared to 22.8% in the prior year period. The margin decrease was due to increased marketing spending and the negative impact of foreign exchange partially offset by lower average commission rate and lower technology expense. Business solutions operating margin was negative 3.2% in the quarter compared to positive 9.7% in the prior year period. The decline was due to lower revenues in higher technology and other operating expenses. ","Depreciation and amortization for business solutions as well as approximately $11 million in the current quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year period. The business solutions EBITDA margin was 8% which compared to 21.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016. ","Operating margin for the businesses including in other revenues was 7.8% in the quarter which compared to 6.6% in prior year period. The year over year margin improvement was driven by revenue growth which was partially offset by a negative impact of foreign exchange. ","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $736 million for the full year, this includes outflows of approximately $600 million from payments related to the settlement with federal and state government and $77 million of WU Way spending, partially offset by associated tax benefits. Capital expenditures were approximately $55 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter we had debt of $3 billion and cash of $838 million with approximately 25% of the cash held by US entity. ","In December we retired $500 million of 2.875% maturing notes. We returned $92 million to shareholders in the quarter consisting of $80 million in dividends and $12 million of share repurchases which represented 611,000 shares. The outstanding share count at quarter end was 459 million shares and we had $943 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization which expires December 31st 2019. ","Turning to our outlook we expect solid business performance in 2018 with minimal net impact from foreign exchange and stable pricing. As a result, revenue growth is expected to be in the range of a low to mid-single digit increase this year both on a reported and constant currency basis. Operating margin is expected to remain at approximately 20% as we plan to reinvest in growth initiatives to accelerate the topline in future years. ","We continue to expect to generate incremental savings of approximately $25 million from WU Way transformation initiatives this year which when combined with the 2017 savings would equate to a run rate of $50 million a year. As previously mentioned the effective tax rate in 2018 is estimated to be approximately 15 to 16% with the increase from last year's adjusted rate of 13% primarily due to discrete benefits recognized in 2017. We expect full year earnings per share in a range of a $1.78 to a $1.90. ","Cash flow from operating activities is projected to be approximately $800 million in 2018 which is net of approximately $200 million of outflows from the combination of anticipated final tax payment, related to the IRS agreement from 2011 the New York Department of Financial Services settlement payment and WU Way payments related to 2017 expenses. ","So, to summarize we are pleased with the solid business performance in the quarter. Delivery on our full year adjusted financial outlook and our strong cash flow generation and allocation to shareholders while we continue to implement our strategies to accelerate growth. We expect stable business and solid margins in 2018 and continue strong allocation to shareholders. ","Operator we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan, please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Thank you so much, good afternoon it's good to see the acceleration in the C2C business so I'll ask just on the digital side I'm curious how are the margins performing for digital, I know its 10% of revenues now. And is the 20% growth sustainable in your view say in 2018?","Hikmet Ersek","Firstly, I am pleased with our performance overall. I would say especially as driven by the digital as you have mentioned. Last quarter 20% growth plus 20% growth, and we are quite -- we are only in 40 countries and the growth is still coming mainly from the countries which we've been longer existing and the new countries that are small not adding too much to the absolute numbers but growing very strong. And as you know we want to be in 200 countries with our westernunion.com delivering to 200 countries. So today we are sending money from 40 countries to 200 countries and that's going to expand obviously that's what's Khalid and the team all are doing very fast. And we are really picking the main corridors where we can compete and we can really grow strong. So, I am quite optimistic. ","On margin side, I think that's truly good margin. Obviously, we are still in the investment mode. We are still in the marketing. Our main focus is in growth but we are very pleased also with the margin side and the .com side. ","Tien-Tsin Huang","Okay good. And then I guess the only sort of wait maybe in C2C sounded like was domestic. I know you shared some numbers there, but how much of an impact did that have on C2C revenue and what's the outlook or maybe the strategy to turn that around?","Hikmet Ersek","Yeah, I think as you know just putting things in perspective, there is only 7% of our C2C revenues is domestic. And domestic money transfer is still use cases, it's still immediate cash payouts at all locations, 50,000 locations. Also, you know send using mobile, sending cash payout or using cash to cash retail money transfer. We do see some impact mid-to-zero fee like Zell or Venmoon that part, we do see some impact on our business. And it's hard to compete with zero field. But we do have still use cases. People still using us to pay out immediate cash when they want cash it's a different customer than having B2B customers. ","Raj Agrawal","We saw some declines there, just to give you some metrics, it was 9% of C2C revenues in the last quarter. And a year ago it was 10% of C2C revenues so a little bit of a decline but it's manageable given the size that it is. ","Tien-Tsin Huang","Got you. And maybe just one last quick one just on the Wu Way front. Just curious do you expect that to have any revenue impact in 2018, 25 million incremental that was consistent but do you see any kind of revenue list potentially. ","Raj Agrawal","I mean the revenue list is going to be overtime obviously. We're investing now in various areas including digital, digital is where we would see more of the revenue lift in the short term. ","Hikmet Ersek","I think Raj, remember we'd all seen recent customer experience on the Wu Way. It's a different way of go to market with customer experience. The team has doing different things like our stage, and pay transaction at Walgreens locations. Or you really do a stage transaction on your mobile you go and pay cash. That's a good growth, because air transactions that's going pretty well. So, it's done by a Wu Way initiative. Really looking at them processes going with the lean management tools for the market. ","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks guys good afternoon. I wonder if you can just walk us through some of your segment level assumptions for revenue in 2018 between C to C, B to B and C to B. I know B to B obviously is having some challenges, I just want to make sure that we put the pieces right here.","Raj Agrawal","Yeah, I mean we\u2019re assuming similar to slightly improving trends in some of the areas obviously and that\u2019s why we have given a low to mid-single digit type of growth. Our consumer business overall grew 3% last year and on a constant currency basis that includes mid-20s type growth in digital so that\u2019s the kind of range that we would assume. ","B to B we\u2019ve assumed better growth than we had last year. Last year, we were down by 3% in the B to B business so that should improve this year. We\u2019re driving a lot of activities to change the sales model in that business. ","Our bill payments businesses had very strong growth last year and so that\u2019s something we\u2019re keenly focused on. That was driven by Speedpay and then obviously Pago Facil as well. And so those businesses do better than what we saw last year then we have the potential to be at the higher end of our range, but we have given a range of low to mid-single digits just accommodating. Obviously DMT we mentioned that we expect that to continue to decline this year and then we have done a little bit of pricing in U.S. to Mexico just on the FX spread site. So, we\u2019ll have to see some of those things play out.","Hikmet Ersek","In general, we expect both adjacent table pricing, I think we continue to see that from 2017.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Yeah. And maybe just on the strategic side. Can you walk us through your perspective on some of the block chain related initiatives obviously you guys are working with some companies in that space and just talk about how you see block chain getting integrated into your business and maybe give us a sense of what sort of timeframe over which that could happen and what some of the benefits could be?","Hikmet Ersek","Yeah Jason, obviously generally as a financial institution we do look at block chain in general and we\u2019ve been doing that for a some time, I would say and we are looking especially in the processing settlement and working capital optimization are also in the regulations part on the compliance part on the block chain capabilities and we do test, we do have some tests we dripple and we did that in some corridors also and the dripple is one example. We also have on the crypto currency, some investments on the digital currency group. And so, it is definitely some part of our innovation we are looking, but so far, it\u2019s not something to report that we\u2019re going to change the environment, our existing capability is very stable as you can see from our performance, but that\u2019s something that we are taking seriously and looking at it and testing.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. And just last quick one from me. I heard you say $800 million in operating cash flow for 2018. I didn\u2019t hear the CapEx piece, which just trying to get through a free cash number and then what have you taken to the EPS guide for buybacks?","Raj Agrawal","Yeah, I mean $800 million is the GAAP operating cash flow estimate, that includes $200 million of outflows for very special items including the settlement with the IRS from 2011, more WU Way payments and then the settlement with the NYBFS or if you add those back in it\u2019s a couple of hundred million higher.","CapEx I would expected to be in the same type of range that we have seen in the last few years 3% to 5% of revenues is where it's been, maybe towards the higher end of that range this year just given some real estate and other requirements we have.","And then your last question was around share buyback. Share buyback, we have 940 million left on the authorization which is good for the next two years through 2019 and I would expect that we'll utilize most of that over the next two years assuming we don't have any other strategic things that we're looking at but that would be our base plan.","Operator","The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays, please go ahead.","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys. Just start pricing on the topline, the topline outlook obviously going for an acceleration and I know FX is part of that but we saw some benefit from pricing in the current quarter as you said. Just curious what -- you're saying [indiscernible] can you repeat an element of pricing benefit versus transaction growth through the business mix perhaps once again in '18. Is that helping you drive to maybe that mid-single digit number is that just currency, I'd be curious to hear a little more what's happening on the pricing environment first?","Hikmet Ersek","I think we see the pricing environment stable and I think that as I mentioned several quarters earlier that the pricing environment has been stable because it\u2019s complex and it\u2019s some costs some operational expense to do this business to operate in 200 countries, so it is hard to -- our operation model reflects our pricing in the market, we are around an average 15% more pricy than the other competitors but has been stable. I don't see any changes here short term if nothing something big thing happens but I don't see the changes. ","The other thing though is also I would say that we're going to continue to do pricing investment in certain corridors but overall the transaction trends has been also stable. It's not like only on the pricing side so the transaction has been also very stable and very strong growth on the dotcom side on the digital side.","Darrin Peller","Alright, that makes sense, but just one other question, when thinking about the margin profile and the outlook, again you're showing some acceleration too low to mid-single digit for revenues, you also have the benefit of now hopefully seeing some of the impact of the WU Way initiatives in terms of coming out, I know you adjusted out but essentially making the business more efficient. ","I guess I'm just wondering in terms of margin expansion potential you're calling for I think 20% again, I guess I just wonder what you're planning on investing and what kind of growth rate and the topline you would actually need to get a more material amount of operating leverage in the business given the backdrop of acceleration.","Raj Agrawal","It\u2019s a very good question, we've given an outlook for low to mid-single digit revenue growth this year and ultimately the level of margin will depend on where the actual growth level comes out and we said approximately 20% so as we said before it could be above, it could be below that depending on where the revenue growth is. ","We need sustainable mid-single digit growth at least to be able to get some leverage. We are investing back in the business this year, the most key area that we're investing is back in the digital expansion, we really want to be in 200 countries and territories as fast as we can and that's going to be over the next few years, so that takes time and money to get their channel expansion not just geographies but also more mobile, more accounts, those kinds of touchpoints. ","And then we're also continuing to invest in our technology area in things like information security, privacy requirements, those kinds of things so that's where the investment is going, but we absolutely have the potential to drive better profitability in the business if we continue to get sustained growth at the mid-single digit level. ","Operator","The next question comes from Brian King of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian King","Yeah hi guys. Just wanted to make sure I had it correct on the stronger growth rate in the C2C in the money transfer business. I know it came in I guess 4% constant currency that's up quite a bit from 1% last quarter constant currency. Is that mostly due to economic improvement worldwide because even the digital business is about the same growth rate it's been in the past. So, I don't think that was a major driver. ","Raj Agrawal","Yeah. There are two key areas that helped the growth improve from the last quarter. Middle East, Africa and South Asia, so the trends although they are still flattish, they improved dramatically from the third quarter. And we're getting the benefit of overall better performance in the oil markets, including Saudi Arabia which became positive in the quarter. And then India started to grow over from a year ago, the demonetization that happened. So that's a key driver. And then North America was slightly better as well given the strong U.S. dotcom business. So those are the two key drivers along with good growth overall in other parts of our business. ","Brian King","So, it sounds like that should be pretty sustainable as we go into 2018, now that those comps have gotten easier?","Raj Agrawal","I think from a comp standpoint, it will be good for the balance of the year, we would have to assume a stable environment in the oil markets. And so, assuming a stable environment it should be better. And then we're always looking at opportunities to drive more market share and other growth in our key markets. ","Brian King","Okay. And then the margins in the fourth quarter were below ours and I think street estimates. But it sounds like you guys were expecting to spend little extra on marketing. So, is that true it kind a came into align your expectations and for modeling purposes should we expect the fourth quarter this year to kind of match the lower margin that we saw in this quarter?","Raj Agrawal","Yeah. The fourth quarter of last year we spent almost 5% of our revenues on marketing it was 4.9% which is higher than it's been for some time. and it was largely timing from the first part of the year. and that's what we expect to do. We've got some 20% operating margins for the full year which is what we had expected. And that's about what we're guiding. It's hard for me to tell you what to think about the fourth quarter of this year which is really going to depend on how we rollout some of our programs. We'll give you more color as we have it as we move through the course of the year. ","Brian King","Okay, superb. And then last question for me. Hikmet, I know you talked about the U.S. domestic transaction is going to be a little bit weaker due to P2P services. What's the risk of that moves in to cross boarder P2P going forward?","Hikmet Ersek","I think I don't see that risk high. I mean in certain quarters it could happen, but I don't see that risk high because we've been doing that cross border, cross currency you need to license this. You need definitely the compliance programs, you need the multi-currency settlement, all the platforms which differentiates us from others have been implemented, it's hard for duplicate, it's hard to rebuilt it. and that's what we are advancing and that's what we are really investing in. ","And some companies which been doing this like competitors been only in the one country forever they couldn't expand their services to other corridors because it's hard. It's hard to go through a country and doing the services. It's hard to serve the customers in exotic currencies or minor currencies in minutes dropping money in minutes. So that's our competitive advantage, that's what we are building on, that platform and talking all the time. So, I think that it will be hard to have the P2P like zero fee, P2P into other countries.","Operator","The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar ","So, a question on consumer behavior. Are you seeing any deviations from normal behavior due to changes in U.S. integration rules? So, for example our checks saw that the send to El Salvador kind of grows after diddling on the side of the TPS. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s one time in nature, you seen the same kind of thing particularly in your send on the U.S. to LatAm or Caribbean. And I guess the flip side of it is you see higher send amount, that\u2019s worth calling out as wages [indiscernible] and either things like that?","Hikmet Ersek","So, we don\u2019t see many -- I mean we operate obviously 40,000 corridors or whatever that is. We don\u2019t see many changes on the same side. If that\u2019s the question from customer behavior. Certain corridors there will be always some behavior changes depending on the regularity environment, depending on the pricing, depending on the product. But generally, I would say that we don\u2019t see it. ","The second thing is also what we see Ashwin is on the digital side, the customers are still slogging in network. So, it\u2019s still incremental, 80% of the customers still the number has not changed. Are really new to our westernunion.com they didn\u2019t use at least the last 12 months our services and they are really new to our Western Union digital environment. That behavior is continuing. So, with our digital environment, we are getting new customer segment, with retail it\u2019s all about customer experience keeping the customers within our network. Is that an answer of your question?","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Yeah. Now there is a follow-up question, I\u2019m going to line up the number to that question. The tax rate for 2018 I guess that\u2019s stayed hard. I guess looking ahead to calendar 2018 given that you lost your ability to use some of this cash management strategy, can you sustain this 15% to 16% tax rate that you have in 2018 into the future or should we be looking at that level?","Raj Agrawal","Yeah, just a little bit of back on this, 15% to 16% this year. If you look at U.S. tax reform where we will benefit from the lower U.S. corporate rate of 21% on income that is tax that U.S. rates are some part of income and then most of our foreign income will be tax now at the minimum 10.5% rate. So, the combination of those two things are giving us 15% to 16% rate this year.","There is a third piece which is based erosion or beet [ph] which you may have heard about which this year is not much of an impact to us, next year it goes from 5% this year to 10% next year and that could have an impact of increasing the rate for us. ","We think there are unintended consequences of this, it effectively creates double taxation for a portion of our income. So, we\u2019re looking for some kind of legislative solution to it that will help us and other companies or some kind of guidance and that we are also looking at structurally addressing that potentially this year. So that has the potential to raise the rate by a few points. Actually, we\u2019re not able to solve any of it but we're certainly working very hard this year to try to solve a portion or all of that.","Operator","The next question from Laura Foreman of Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.","Laura Foreman","Hi, thanks for taking my questions, I just wanted to go through some of the different corridors just in terms of -- to what end business the spends have been consistently strong and over 20% growth, is that something that you think you can continue in 2018.","Hikmet Ersek","Well we're hopeful that it\u2019s going to continue. I think just look at it in terms of total C2C business. Latin America has been strong driven by Argentina and Brazil, Chile even Mexico LatAm has been doing opening up the smaller piece, so we've gotten the benefit of some of the market changes that have been taking place there, so we're hopeful that we can continue some good growth there. I don't know if it'll continue to be at the same level but we're still hopeful of some good growth in that market.","Laura Foreman","And then for US and Mexico it\u2019s the second quarter of continued weakness there, I think you mentioned some pricing changes. Can you give us any more color there?","Raj Agrawal","Yeah when the transaction growth actually improved in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter and our pricing from a fee standpoint has been quite competitive but we did review some FX spreads in the market for US to Mexico to try to grab some more share and so that's where really why you're seeing some revenue weakness there. Over the last two years we've done a really good job of gaining more share in that corridor with our 30,000 plus locations in Mexico, the ability to pay into the majority of accounts there so we're well positioned in the overall Mexico market I would say is also just softer given the environment that we're in.","Hikmet Ersek","I think over the years we've been capturing good market share there, but if you look at the last three-four-four years I think the team is doing a good job to grow this business.","Laura Foreman","Okay and then just one question on compliance, I don't think you gave any guidance for 2018 in terms of where it falls into long term range, any thoughts there?","Raj Agrawal","Yeah, with last year we ended up at around 3.6% of revenues for compliance as a percent of revenues, and this year we expect a similar range, we're not going to give the outlook any more on the compliance spend it\u2019s become more stable now. It is part of our normal business but I don't expect it to change materially this year.","Operator","The next question comes from Daniel Hussein of Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.","David Hussein","Hi, thanks for taking the question, just to clarify the base erosion, is it as simple as five incremental percentage points to the tax rate to 21% for 2019 and then besides legislation were there other operational office [ph] that you think you might be able to implement, thanks.","Raj Agrawal","On base erosion I wish it were as simple as just adding the five points, it\u2019s complex, it\u2019s basically base erosion taxes, US payments to foreign affiliates so yes and there are complex formulas that you have to work through but it's worth a few points to us so it\u2019s absolutely a key focus for us to try to solve that internally and then the 15 to 16% rate for this year really takes into account all the other puts and takes and in tax reform it ends up not being a significant impact for us this year overall, but it is reflective of everything that we know other than the base erosion provisions that may impact us more next year. ","David Hussein","Okay, perfect. And then I apologize if you covered this. You didn't mention the hedge gains. So, were you expecting a meaningful margin impact from hedge losses this year that would potentially fall off in 2019?","Raj Agrawal","We had a negative impact from the hedges all year on the margin. And we don't expect the significant impact from currency overall. There is some impact from hedges, there is impact of stronger foreign currencies that helps to offset that. But when you net it all out there is not going to be a significant impact from currency in 2018. We are expecting a little bit of a loss on our hedges this year, just given where currency rates are, but that's more than offset by the strength in foreign currencies against the dollar on our overall revenues and profits. ","Operator","The next question comes from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Please go ahead. ","James Friedman","I wanted to ask you about -- I realize it's more of a journey than a destination, but with regard to India, does it still like return the corner there?","Raj Agrawal","You broke up at the last part, something about India?","James Friedman","Sorry. I was asking with regard to India. Does it feel like we turned the corner there at this point?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, India I think. India as you know many strong quarters India from U.S. to India, Europe to India and for Middle East to India. Definitely all projects in countries have been showing improvement including Saudi Arabia which is extremely strong quarter for India. And also, demonetization means that we are -- that's about last year quarter 4, and it's a grow over there. so that helps, and our business in India we are very pleased, and we also have a lot of India to account growing very strong. As you know we have over 100,000 locations in India plus we have millions of accounts in India which people are choosing now sending either to a location or an account. And we do see also a little bit better principle amount here, and using the online sending, dropping money on an account. So, the India performance has been very good for us. ","James Friedman","Okay. and I just want to follow up with regard to crypto. I heard your answer earlier taking it, but we get a lot of questions about that. If you could give us some sense of where we are in your perspective in the lifecycle of crypto applications in money transfer. I mean is it a technology looking for a business or do you see real use cases here? ","Hikmet Ersek","Well first, we have to differentiate between cryptocurrency and block chain obviously. And then block chain is definitely something interesting as an application, and which we may use it in several parts as I mentioned earlier is it a regulatory technology or digitally identifying or is it the settlement. And we with people do with ripple do some tests with some corridors on the settlement side. Is it dollar to pesos on that side, can we use that on a real time block chain environment. And so, this is the test we are on that. ","On the crypto currency side, look, currency is currency. I think the big advantage we're seeing in globally is that we turn any currency to a use cases. So, we really turn on ordinary currencies so people really can use the currency to their day-to-day expenses or day-to-day use cases. ","And if digital currencies are the ordinary currency which is used by a country then we could do it, but it is hard to do car wash with a bit coin or go buy a milk or pay school fees with a Bitcoin in Bangladesh or in Ghana or in Chile. So, I think that\u2019s the environment. And other thing is also look we are regulated environment that\u2019s one of our strongest asset that we are regulated in 200 countries and we response to regulated environment, we do have the compliance programs for 40,000 corridors and within that environment with the Reserve Bank together, we apply our operations to the regulatory environment. So, it\u2019s important for us that this currency should be regulated and so we can really serve the customers in the right way.","Operator","The next question comes from Rayna Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Rayna Kumar ","It is good to see the strong growth in India. I\u2019m just wondering if you have seen any changes in competitive environment just given one of your largest competitors is making a big push in the region.","Hikmet Ersek","Well in India, I think generally it fits always where to send money from which corridor to where. The biggest advantage of Western Union is that we are in 200 countries with 500,000 locations plus with our 40 outbound, the online outbound countries. So, if you want you send the money with Western Union, it stays in the system. So, we can distribute to 100,000 locations and to our more than 600 million or 700 million accounts in India in minutes and that\u2019s the biggest advantage we have. We feel quite competitive in India. You can see from our recent report that our India business is doing well and definitely there are the competitors like Ria or MoneyGram are in the markets, but that has been the other markets also, big advantage we\u2019re seeing is that we are in many corridors and we are really in many portfolios and we serving the Indian customers.","Rayna Kumar","It\u2019s very helpful. Could you discuss your commission expense outlook for 2018?","Hikmet Ersek","I think commission has been quite stable, agents like us, we like the agents and the business works pretty well to prices and commissions which is very related to each other obviously has been very stable. If you look at that also over the years the commission rates have been declining. It helps also on our productivity and that is also part of that mix obviously mix corridors help us also to drive the commission rates down. But the agents have been very cooperative with us and that has been a good environment.","Raj Agrawal","Yeah, the other thing the digital business growth that we\u2019re getting is helping the overall mix. There are multiple different mix impacts so as because we only pay commissions on one side of our transaction that\u2019s only helps the commissions. But then we also have to look at the overall distribution cost and minimize funding cost in the dotcom business. So, there are various mix impacts that are helping as well.","Rayna Kumar","Got it. I noticed your cross-border principle accelerated to 4% constant currency in the quarter. What were the drivers to that and is that sustainable this year?","Raj Agrawal","Yeah, I mean the improvement that we saw in some of key regions the Middle East, Africa, South Asian region, that's one of the key drivers of the improvement of principal growth, cross border principle and you know over the last couple of years you've seen our cross border principle has been somewhat negative due to that region's performance so now that we've had a little bit better performance that's also helping us from a cross border principle standpoint and this year the World Bank estimates for last year lease were for around 3.9% growth and we grew around 3% so we'll see the World Bank may continue to revise its outlook as it always does so we'll have to see what ultimately comes out.","Hikmet Ersek","The only thing I would like to add is that you know principle is good, also revenue growth is very important for us profitable revenue growth, so that has been very -- I'm very pleased with the performance of the teams there, and that\u2019s something they'll keep an eye also.","Operator","Yes please, the last question will come from Bob Napoli of William Blair, please go ahead.","Bob Napoli","Thank you, appreciate it. The B2B business as you pointed out decelerated quite a bit in the fourth quarter down 3% for the year and I think you suggested -- you guys had suggested that it was going to be better than the down 3% in 2000 at least in your forecast in 2018, given the deceleration in the fourth quarter, what is going to turn that around quick enough to get back in the range of better than down 3.","Hikmet Ersek","Good question Bob, I think what we are trying to achieve here is definitely our sales approach getting new clients. New client acquisition has been a little bit slow in 2017. We do see good revenue growth on our payments part of the business but on the trading parts we have been very slow in hedge and forwards, that has been really declining that has been the challenge but on the payments side like university payments or NGO paid [ph] has been doing good performance and going to continue to do that and the focus is definitely on the forwards and hedges and turning that around that will help and acquire new customers that\u2019s something that the team is very focused, we put a new sales force and new sales approach there and that's something that the team is focused on that currently.","Bob Napoli","Okay thank you. The Speedpay business can you remind me what the size is of Speedpay? What is the growth rate of that business? What do you expect that to be over the next few years?","Hikmet Ersek","So, it's about 4%. It\u2019s about 400, little less than $400 million of the last year of our business and it\u2019s a good growth it\u2019s a good business we really like it and it has been a double-digit growth over the years and that has been a very good performance and so that's something that the billers like us also and customers use that that makes the payment very easy. It\u2019s a US business it\u2019s a domestic business and it\u2019s not cross border and we\u2019ve been very pleased with the performance.","Bob Napoli","Okay, and then last question. Your business I think has held up a lot better than many would have thought a few years ago, but as you look at your business today and get a little bit of an acceleration in the quarter what do you view, what do you keep an eye on as your biggest risks or competitors? Is it other blockchain players, cross border, is it things like Venmo or what is it is it Ria, is it just other companies in your space. What is the biggest competitive threat, especially since you still have that pretty substantial premium on the pricing side?","Hikmet Ersek","So that's a good question obviously. I'm thinking about that daily. So, one thing I realized also is that over the years certainly build something is really very competitive. But having this cross-order engine or platform with the regulatory compliance and technology advantage has been working and working and we are now what we are doing is that really taking that to the next stage with our WU Way and technology investments. We are taking that also to the next stage. ","So, one thing is that we are going to the market with our WU branded products like we are now retail with Western Union and on our Westernunion.com with WU branded products. ","The other thing is also we see good growth is that to white labeling of our platform to partners like financial institutions or big businesses. I think I got more and more calls from other businesses also from financial institutions, can you help us to deliver exotic currencies or minor currencies to certain countries or having also businesses delivering our platform doing the multi-currency settlement for many countries or also the compliance programs for many countries. That\u2019s something that I think coming here we are very focused on that, besides committed to our Western Union growth. This platform could be used also for some white labeling to extent our platform our new businesses and your financial institutions. ","Michael Salop","Thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. We wish you a good day. ","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael A. Salop","Thank you, Lauren. Good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss 2012 fourth quarter and full year results and the company's outlook for 2013. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions.","The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.","Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2011 Form 10-K, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We've reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section. All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of The Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012, which were largely consistent with the outlook we provided in late October.","Scott will give you a more detailed review of the results later on the call, but I would like to spend a few minutes recapping 2012 and discussing our priorities for 2013 and beyond.","Overall, the business delivered a third consecutive year of constant currency revenue growth despite challenges from compliance-related changes affecting Mexico and Latin America, economic softness in Europe and competitive pressures in some parts of Consumer Money Transfer business.","Our digital and electronic account-based money transfer business grew rapidly, and we continue to see our online channel attract new customers.","For the year, electronic channel revenue increased 27% and now represents 4% of total company revenue. Although we're seeing in business solutions, revenue growth was not as strong as planned, we made good progress integrating the Travelex acquisition and further expanding our product offerings and geographic reach.","Some of the great aspects of our business model is generating strong cash flow. In 2012, we continued this trend and cash from operating activities reached approximately $1.2 billion last year. Over the course of 2012, more than $1 billion was returned to shareholders through a combination of stock buyback and dividends.","Moving to 2013, our strategies are focused on 3 key initiatives: Strengthening our Consumer Money Transfer business; driving growth of customers and usage of Western Union Business Solutions; and generating and deploying strong cash flow for our shareholders.","Consumer Money Transfer remains a great business to be in. Remittance market is growing, and we are a market leader with strong assets. As we discussed at the end of last year, we have faced competitive pressures and some regulatory-related changes in some corridors, and we are implementing key actions to address them. We believe we have the right plans in place to regain momentum and we are keenly focused on executing these plans.","Our planned actions include: improving the consumer value proposition, including pricing investments in key corridor; continue to expand our digital and account-based electronic channels; and further expanding our agent network. We will also continue to upgrade our anti-money laundering and compliance capabilities. We are committed to be the best-in-class programs in these areas, and we are now spending over $100 million a year on these programs.","For the pricing investments, we expect to invest approximately 5% of total company revenue into pricing in 2013 to address challenges in certain corridors. The majority of this pricing will be in some key markets, and actions will cover corridors representing approximately 25% for our consumer-to-consumer business is on revenues.","Our brand value commands a premium price in most corridors, and our brand stands for trust, speed, reliability and convenience. We will continue to market our brand, enhance services, deepen customer relationships and expand convenience through more choice. However, we also want to strike the right balance with price to achieve an attractive consumer value proposition in each market, and that is the ultimate goal of the pricing investments.","Based on our experience with similar actions over the last several years, we believe the pricing investments will result in a declining consumer-to-consumer revenues in 2013 but lead to revenue growth in the following years due to anticipated increases in consumer usage and loyalty.","In late November and early December, we launched about half of the planned pricing investments, so we have limited reach on the data at this point. However, let me share with you some early good news in some of the corridors.","For example, we implemented pricing for the Western Union brand from the U.S. to Mexico, and we have seen the expected transaction lift. We're seeing in brand transaction growth for Mexico increase mid-single-digits in December compared to a slight decline in the market according to the Bank of Mexico. This is an early indication that our pricing investments are working. We have also seen respectable increases in transactions in the westernunion.com business, and we have seen nice transaction growth in the France to Africa corridor.","While early results from some of the U.S. Latin America corridors have not seen as strong yet, they are still in the process of driving awareness in these markets.","Let me say once again, it is very early in this process with our pricing investments, but so far, so good. Overall, for the portfolio of corridors we are -- we have been taken pricing actions, we are seeing the transaction lift we expected, but many of the actions are yet to be rolled out or fully marketed.","In addition to improving the consumer value proposition, we also remain focused on further developing electronic channels as we continue to expand our efforts to connect the cash and digital world for our consumers.","Both westernunion.com and electronic account-based money transfer through banks are growing fast, and we are capitalizing on these fast-growing channels opportunities. We plan to add capabilities, such as direct-to-bank delivery and more mobile access and further our reach to acquire even more consumers.","Westernunion.com money transfer transactions grew over 40% in 2012, and we believe we will see significantly higher transaction growth in 2013. Revenue exceeded $150 million last year, and we remain on track to meet our $500 million digital goal for 2015.","Transactions for electronic account-based money transfer through banks increased over 50% in 2012. And we are focused on expanding the service to more banks in 2013, as we believe this electronic channel also represents strong incremental opportunity.","We plan to continue to increase our agent location network, with a particular focus this year on strategic areas such as rebuilding the Mexico and Russia networks and further expanding in Europe and Asia.","We are also expanding our alternative distribution channels. Approximately 100,000 ATMs globally have the Western Union Money Transfer capability today. As we take the steps to strengthen our value proposition in key corridors, attract new customers to digital and account-based channel expansion and other initiatives and further grow our network, I am confident we will see a rapid transformation in 2013 and return the Consumer Money Transfer business to growth in 2014 and '15.","Our second strategic initiatives for 2013 involves driving growth in customers and usage in Western Union Business Solutions. We continue to believe business-to-business payments offer long-term opportunity for Western Union. Global trade is expected to grow at attractive rates over the long term, and Western Union Business Solutions offers strong platforms, services and customized solutions for small businesses and other customers at competitive rates. All the slowdowns in trade and normal integration challenges impacted the Western Union Business Solutions revenue growth in 2012. We made strategic progress that should support our growth in the future.","We expanded our presence to 30 countries, realigned and refocused our sales organization and incentives and laid the groundwork to increase our product offerings.","Our B2B sales organization focus will have more specialization on product and customer segments, and sales incentives have been better aligned to drive performance. Product offerings are being expanded, as we will introduce options and forwards products in additional countries, provide specialized payment services for non-profit organizations and focus on developing export-driven models as well.","We believe new customer acquisition and additional usage will drive stronger revenue growth in Business Solutions as we progress through 2013, and we should see additional benefit and stronger growth over the long term as global trade returns to better levels.","Finally, the third key initiative we are focused on 2013 is to continue to generate strong cash flow and deploy it for our shareholders. We anticipate cash flow from operating activities of approximately $900 million in 2013 or approximately $1 billion, excluding IRS agreement, tax payments, and we do not anticipate any significant acquisition activity.","We expect to return approximately $700 million to shareholders in 2013. This includes approximately $400 million of share repurchases and around $300 million of dividends. Based on recent stock price levels, these actions combined would represent returning approximately 8% of our market capitalization to shareholders.","To summarize, Western Union Foundation is strong. We have a valued brand, a global network, worldwide operation and expertise and robust cash flow. The balance sheet is healthy, and even in this 2013 transition year, the company should generate over $1 billion of operating income. We are focused on execution in 2013, as we take the steps to reset the business. We believe in our plan and our investment, and I am confident the strategic actions that we are implementing should position us well to drive growth in the future.","We anticipate a return to revenue and profit growth in 2014, as we benefit from having more customers, better value proposition, additional products and services and further cost efficiencies while participating in growing markets.","Now to give you a more detailed review of the financial results and other 2013 outlook, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott T. Scheirman","Thank you, Hikmet. As I review 2012 financial results, I will primarily focus on the fourth quarter. Similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules.","Overall for the quarter, we reported consolidated revenue of $1.4 billion, which was flat with the year ago quarter on both a reported and constant currency basis.","Consolidated pro forma constant currency revenue, including a full quarter of Travelex Global Business Payments in the prior year period, decreased 1% and was negatively impacted by 1% by the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands.","Revenue for the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands declined over 50% primarily due to the Mexico location reductions in the third quarter, which resulted from the Southwest Border compliance changes. Vigo and Orlandi Valuta represented about 2% of total company revenue for the full year.","In the consumer-to-consumer segment, revenue decreased 2% on a reported and constant currency basis, with transactions down 1% compared to the prior year period. Excluding Vigo and Orlandi Valuta, Western Union branded consumer-to-consumer constant currency revenue grew slightly in the quarter on transaction growth of 3%.","C2C cross-border principal declined 3% in the quarter or 2% on a constant currency basis, an improvement from last quarter's rate. Western Union branded principal increased in the fourth quarter.","C2C principal per transaction declined 2% year-over-year, which also represented an improvement from the third quarter rate.","Turning to the regions. C2C revenue in the Europe and CIS region, which represented 22% of total company revenue, decreased 5% year-over-year. The decline included a negative 2% impact from currency translation. Transactions in the region were flat with the year ago quarter.","Although much of Europe remains soft, Germany continued to perform well. And overall revenue transaction trends for the region improved relative to the third quarter.","Turning to North America, revenue declined 9% from the prior year and transactions were down 6%. The region represented 19% of total company revenue. U.S. outbound revenue declined in the quarter, while domestic money transfer revenue was flat on transaction growth of 7%. U.S. outbound revenue was impacted by some of our pricing actions, which, as we mentioned, are meeting our overall expectations.","Mexico revenue declined 25% and transactions decreased 21% in the quarter. Mexico revenue is being impacted by a full quarter of the compliance-related reduction in Vigo locations and by the pricing investments that were implemented in the quarter for the Western Union brand.","For the Western Union brand, Mexico revenue declined 8%, while transactions increased 2% for the full quarter. As Hikmet mentioned, transaction results improved to mid-single-digit growth in December, following our pricing actions.","In total, Mexico represented 4% of total company revenues in the quarter. While Mexico revenue trends will be very challenging until we reach the anniversary of the Vigo location reductions and the pricing actions, we're actively working to expand our agent locations in the country and leverage the Western Union brand.","Regarding the Southwest Border agreement. The Monitor's term was scheduled to end July 31, and we are continuing to work diligently with the Monitor's recommendation. We have spent over $40 million on Southwest Border compliance activities since we signed the agreement in early 2010 and made major changes to our business model in Mexico. While we have devoted significant time and resources to these efforts, we do not expect to have all of them fully implemented by July 31 due to their extensive and complex nature.","Western Union Business Solutions was recently added to the scope of the Monitor's review. And in late January, the current Monitor resigned. The new Monitor is in the process of being identified. We're conferring with the State of Arizona about the company's progress and implementing the recommendations and the implications for the agreements. We will update you when we have further information about the status.","Turning back to the Middle East and Africa region. Revenue in the quarter increased 3% on a reported basis, including a negative 2% impact from currency, while transactions grew 6%. Trends improved compared to the third quarter, as strong outbound business from the Gulf States help drive the growth.","The Asia-Pacific region was flat in the quarter -- the Asia-Pacific region revenue was flat in the quarter, including a positive 1% impact from currency translation with flat transaction growth.  China revenue increased slightly in the quarter, but this was offset by declines in other large inbound markets. The Latin America and Caribbean region revenue grew 2%, including a negative 2% impact from currency. Transactions declined 5% in the quarter and were negatively impacted by the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta compliance-related changes implemented in the third quarter.","Westernunion.com C2C revenue increased 16% on a reported basis and has no impact from currency. Transaction growth accelerated to 46%, largely driven by the success of promotional and enterprising investments intended to accelerate customer acquisition. As a reminder, westernunion.com results are not included in the growth rates for the other 5 regions, although they are included when we discuss specific country trends.","Total electronic channel revenue, which includes westernunion.com, account-based money transfer through banks and mobile increased 22% in the quarter. Electronic channels represented 4% of total company revenue, up from 3% of revenue in the year ago period.","Revenue from account-based money transfer through banks increased 37%. We now have nearly 115 banks signed for account-based money transfer, with service launched at over half of these banks.","Prepaid revenue increased 16% in the quarter. The prepaid business, including third-party top-up, represented approximately 1% of company revenue. Prepaid cards were available at approximately 40,000 retail locations globally at the end of the quarter, including approximately 1,500 locations outside the U.S.","Turning back to the total C2C business. The spread between transaction and revenue declined in the quarter was 1 percentage point, and there was no impact from currency.","For C2C, the impact of net price decreases was approximately 2% in the fourth quarter, while mix had a positive impact of approximately 1%. For the full year, the pricing impacts was approximately 1% on both C2C and total company revenue.","Moving to the Consumer-to-Business segment. Revenue decreased 1% in the quarter, including a negative 3% impact from currency translation. South America continues to have steady growth, but this was offset by declines in U.S. walk-in business.","Business Solutions reported a revenue of $93 million in the quarter, which compared to $68 million  a year ago. On a pro forma basis, including a full quarter of Travelex results in the prior year period, Business Solutions constant currency revenue was down 2%.","Our Business Solutions customer account continues to grow, and we now have a presence in 30 countries compared to 23 a year ago. The transactions are growing in double digits, but  principal per transaction declined, an indication of the soft global trade conditions.","Turning to consolidated margins. The fourth quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 20.1%, or 20.9% excluding $12 million of Travelex integration expenses, compared to 25.0% in the prior year period and 25.4% excluding $5 million of integration expenses.","The current quarter includes $31 million of expenses related to new cost-savings initiatives. In addition, the margin was negatively impacted by the higher Business Solutions bank fees and other spending, pricing investments, increased marketing, higher compliance related to the Southwest Border and Dodd-Frank and increased bad debt expenses. EBITDA margin was 25.2% compared to 29.2% a year ago, excluding integration expenses in both periods.","Other expense net was $41 million in the current quarter compared to $6 million a year ago. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we recognized a gain of $20 million related to the revaluation of the company's previous ownership position from European superagent, Finint, and a gain of $21 million on foreign currency forward contracts related primarily to the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments.","Reported earnings per share in the quarter was $0.40 compared to $0.73 in the prior year. EPS was $0.42, excluding Travelex integration expenses, which compared to $0.40 in the prior year excluding the $205 million tax benefit related to the IRS agreement. EPS in the current quarter includes $0.03 of expenses related to the cost-savings initiatives.","The C2C operating segment margin was 25.0% compared to 28.0% from the same period last year. The margin was impacted in the quarter primarily by cost-savings initiatives and expenses, price investments, increased bad debt expenses and higher market.","The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 17.0% compared to 27.3% in the prior year period. The margin decline was primarily driven by the impact of the renegotiation of the  third party sales and distribution agreement, which should benefit C2B margins in future quarters, and expenses related to cost-savings initiatives.","Business solutions reported an operating loss of $18 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $2 million in the year ago period. Last year's operating loss reflected only a partial quarter of Travelex Global Business Payments following the November acquisition.","The current quarter's $18 million loss included $18 million of depreciation and amortization and $12 million of Travelex integration expenses.","The depreciation and amortization of last year's fourth quarter was $13 million, while integration expense was $5 million. Bank fees from higher transactions and IT and compliance spending also increased compared to last year.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. We once again generated strong cash flow in 2012. Cash flow from operations for the year was approximately $1.2 billion, which includes the impact of $92 million of net tax payments relating to the agreement with the IRS. We have approximately $100 million of remaining tax payments related to this agreement, which we expect to pay in 2013.","Capital expenditures in the quarter were $85 million and included increases in agent signing bonuses, including some major renewals. For the year, capital spending was just under 5% of company revenue, in line with our outlook.","Depreciation and amortization expense was $62 million in the quarter. At the end of the year, the company had debt of $4 billion and cash of $1.8 billion. Approximately half of the cash was held by United States entities.","In the fourth quarter, we issued $750 million of debt, including $500 million of 5-year notes at a coupon of 2 7\/8% and $250 million of 3-year notes at a coupon of 2 3\/8%. We plan to use a portion of the proceeds to pay out $300 million of notes that mature in March.","During the fourth quarter, we spent $351 million to repurchase approximately 27 million shares at an average price of $13.12. In addition, we declared $72 million in dividends, which were paid in December.","As Hikmet mentioned, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2012. We repurchased 51 million shares last year, or just over 8% of total shares outstanding.","As of year end, we had 572 million shares outstanding and $394 million remaining in our repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2013.","Turning to our expectations for 2013. Our outlook reflects the strategic actions we are implementing this year to drive future revenue growth and enhance long-term profitability. The strategic actions are expected to negatively impact revenue and profitability in 2013 but lead the growth in 2014 and 2015.","We expect the economic environment of 2013 to be similar to 2012. The outlook includes a pricing investment of approximately 5% of total company revenues, approximately 6% to 7% of C2C revenues in 2013. We expect these pricing investments to improve transaction trends this year, with Western Union branded C2C transactions anticipated to increase mid to high-single-digits in 2013 compared to 4% in 2012.","Total C2C transaction increases are expected to be about 2 percentage points lower than Western Union brand due to the clients from the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta.","The transaction growth rate should improve sequentially as we move through the year, as the pricing and other actions take effect. We have only implemented about half of our planned pricing investment so far and are still building awareness of the actions in many markets, so we would expect to see an overall transaction lift for the Western Union brand beginning in the second quarter and then see acceleration as we go through the rest of the year. To increase productivity and fund a portion of our growth base spending, we're implementing additional cost-savings initiatives. Net impact of these cost-saving initiatives is expected to be negative in 2013 due to the upfront costs but beneficial to margins and profits beginning in 2014.","The outlook includes approximately $45 million of expenses from new cost-savings initiatives this year, which is in addition to the $31 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2012. These initiatives include expenses such as severance, outplacement and other related benefits, and expenses related to relocation of certain operations to existing company facilities or third-party providers.","Cost-saving initiatives are expected to generate approximately $30 million of savings in 2013 and approximately $45 million of savings beginning in 2014.","The 2013 outlook also includes approximately $20 million of expenses for continuing Travelex integration. As a result of all these factors, the outlook for revenue and margins in 2013 is: constant currency revenue down low-single digits, GAAP operating margin of approximately 20% and EBITDA margin of approximately 24.5%. Approximately 2\/3 of the GAAP operating margin decline compared to 2012 is attributable to actions being implemented to improve competitive positioning and mix.","Pricing investments are expected to result in higher variable cost from increased transactions and negative fixed cost leverage from lower revenue in 2013.","Average commission rates are also expected to increase this year due to mix, some large agent renewals and other factors.","The other 1\/3 of the margin decline is primarily due to a combination of growth investments and increased compliance and regulatory cost. The other growth investments include additional investments in digital and prepaid and the development of new products. These investments are largely infrastructure-related and are expected to be ongoing cost of the business for future years.","Net expenses for TGBP integration and cost-savings initiatives are expected to be lower in 2013 than prior year. This is being offset by changes in incentive compensation, which was at reduced levels in 2012.","The 2013 operating margin includes approximately $65 million of expenses, which should not reoccur in 2014. These include the approximately $45 million of expenses associated with the cost-savings initiatives and approximately $20 million related to TGBP integration.","Turning to the tax rate. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 15% in 2013, which is higher than last year due to benefits and favorable settlements in 2012.","In 2012, we provided both GAAP EPS and EPS excluding TGBP integration expense. For 2013, we are only providing GAAP EPS.","GAAP earnings per share outlook for 2013 is a range of $1.33 to $1.43, including an approximately $0.03 per share impact from Travelex integration expenses.","In 2013, earnings per share outlook also reflects an approximately $0.06 per share impact from expenses related to the new cost-savings initiatives.","Compared to 2012, the EPS range includes an increase in other expense net of approximately $0.04 per share primarily due to higher net interest expense from incremental long-term debt at higher average rates and other miscellaneous changes.","Cash flow from operating activities is expected to be approximately $900 million or $1 billion excluding final tax payments of approximately $100 million related to the IRS agreement, which we expect to pay in 2013.","Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 4% to 5% of revenues in 2013, although we anticipate they will average closer to 3% over the next few years.","As Hikmet mentioned, we expect to return approximately $700 million to shareholders in 2013 through repurchases and dividends, including approximately $400 million of share repurchases.","We will remain committed to consistently generating and deploying strong cash flows for our shareholders while also maintaining an investment grade credit rating. We would anticipate continuing to increase the dividend in future years consistent with business performance.","In 2013, we expect our actions to have the most significant negative impact on our financial results in the first half of the year.","Revenue is expected to decline in the first half based on current trends and the initial impact of the pricing investments. We will also continue to face challenging comparisons for Vigo and Orlandi Valuta until the middle of the third quarter. Much of the spending for the cost savings initiatives is expected to be in the first 3 quarters of the year.","As we move through 2013, we expect financial trends to improve sequentially due to the timing impact of pricing investments, incremental customer acquisition and cost-savings initiatives. Operator, we're now ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","On your pricing investments that you've made this year, your -- if you -- your pricing gap, I think, versus competitor's has narrowed or is narrowing but is still relatively wide. How confident are you that you won't need abnormal levels of pricing investments beyond what you've announced so far?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, Bob, thank you for the question. If you look at our business, we are pretty confident that the existing pricing action will work. We've done many pricing actions in the past. I've personally done about more than 100 pricing actions -- hundreds of pricing actions in my career. And typically, they come back after 12 to 18 months also to our revenue growth. The pricing actions we implement during the early signings, it's really too early. We started mid-November, beginning of December. But as I mentioned before, the U.S. to Mexico pricing is working so far so good pretty well. We see the price indications in December. Bank of Mexico data shows that there's a decline on principal, but we have a mid-single-digit growth, right, Scott?","Scott T. Scheirman","In Mexico.","Hikmet Ersek","In Mexico, that corridor, so we are beating the market's earlier indications. We've been -- being in so many corridors, we adapt pricing actions to the customer needs. But we are pretty confident that we are turning back in 2014 to 1% to 3% our usual pricing investment. And so the first indications are so far, so good.","Glenn T. Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. On your westernunion.com business, I mean, obviously, great transaction growth, 46%. Revenue growth at 16%. First, what percentage of that business is card-based, credit or debit versus ACH?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, first of  -- we don't -- I don't think we give the numbers here, which percentage is credit cards and ACH. But many is used by the cards. And are -- we are very [indiscernible] despite the growth rates here. We are getting new customers. Just a reminder, 80% of the customers are new to our brand, new to the westernunion.com. Never used Western Union, but new to Western Union data they are using. And we grew 46% on transactions. So that's the current environment, the number that's expected in westernunion.com.","Glenn T. Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Last question just related to that. Are there additional pricing investments in the westernunion.com sector to come?","Scott T. Scheirman","Bob, this is Scott. I don't want to get ahead of myself as far as what pricing we might be doing in certain markets for competitive reasons. But we feel like we're well positioned in westernunion.com, 80% of the customers are new. And to circle back on your one question, just to add -- to color what Hikmet said that as far as the funding methods, it's primarily credit cards for us today. But that's where we see an opportunity as we think about growing this business to provide our customers with different funding sources and payout sources, not only leveraging our 500,000 location network that being able to drop money in the bank accounts, but allowing customers to pay through ACH and other ways. So that's one of the things that allow us to get to that $500 million business by 2015.","Operator","And our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about -- I know there's a lot of detail shared here. Just -- I'm curious, the loss of Vigo and the OV business, were you able to recapture that with your pricing initiatives? What's -- what are you -- most of the intelligence telling you in terms of recapture of share?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, we are basically growing on the Western Union brand business. We did not capture that on Vigo and Orlandi Valuta. We still have location loss last quarter. As you know, Tien-Tsin, about 7,000 locations in Mexico. We are very focused to expand our location network in Mexico. But the pricing actions that we did is -- was on the Western Union branded transfers, and that's working pretty well. The loss of Vigo and Orlandi Valuta is still here, and it's the majority of why the corridor is losing on the performance. But I'm very pleased with the Western Union branded price actions.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, good to know. And just on the -- I'm curious, just with all the price cuts, it sounds like you still have a little bit more to do, and we'll learn more about that. But what's been the agent response to the price cuts? And I'm curious of the higher commission comment is tied in any way to the pricing investments that you're talking about or if that's separate?","Hikmet Ersek","I think that's 2 separate things, Tien-Tsin. The agent response were quite positive because our brand attracts traffic to the retail network. And agents were very pleased that they can gain. Again, our ultimate goal is to grow, and it brings traffic in 2013. And they are pretty pleased on that. I did not see any agent negative reaction from market or from somewhere, I didn't hear it so far. Regarding on the agent commission. As you know, that we have the agent's commission -- agent agreements for 5 to 7 years in average. And over the few years, it has been declining. '13, we have a little bit higher commission rates, Scott, right? But generally, our goal is, as you know, bringing down the commission rates and have been situation. I don't see as an early signing that it's a competitive issue or pricing issue. I see that as agent renewal timing issue.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so it's just timing. Very good, that's good to know. Last one and I'll jump off. Just the -- you've returned a lot of capital to shareholders, obviously. But I guess the implication for '13 is a stepdown in buybacks. Is that just a -- again, is that a timing issue or a little bit of a pause, or could that actually step up as the year progresses?","Scott T. Scheirman","Tien-Tsin, this is Scott. We generate strong cash flows historically, $1 billion plus for sure and, historically, have been very committed to getting cash back to our shareholders. Just in 2012, between dividends and buyback, over $1 billion. In fact, in the fourth quarter, $350 million of buybacks. So we're committed, between dividends and buyback in 2013, to return $700 million. We want to continue to target an investment grade credit rating as we move forward. And Hikmet and I continually have dialogue with each other and with the Board discussing our cash flows and how to best to deploy those for our shareholders as we move forward. But our track record has been strong, and I think $700 million is a strong step forward right now.","Operator","And the next question is from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David Chu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is David Chu for Sara Gubins. What percentage of your agent base is WU branded versus non WU branded?","Scott T. Scheirman","David, a majority of the agent base is WU branded, if you will. The revenue that we called out for the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta is about 2% of our revenues. So the rest of the network is really, it's a Western Union network primarily.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. And as you know, Vigo and Orlandi Valuta is mostly Mexican, Latin America.","David Chu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And is there -- can you share kind of your expectations for B2B in 2013?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, David. In simple terms, we expect the revenue growth rate and profitability to improve in 2013 compared to 2012. And a couple of things have been really driving that. And first I would say is that we're in a market that's growing. The global market for trade, if you will, is probably growing anywhere from the mid-single-digits to the high-single-digits, depending upon the period. And then the team in London around the globe is very focused on driving increased sales effectiveness, so we're getting very customer-focused there. We're going to expand to more countries. A year ago, we're in 23 countries. Today, we're in 30. When we have this discussion a year from now, we're going to be in more countries. And then we also have an opportunity to diversify our product offering. An example I would give you is we have option products, forward products, but not in all countries. We have opportunities to move those products into other countries. So the simple answer coming back to it is we expect to see revenue growth and profitability improve in '13 compared to where we were in 2012. On a long-term basis, we expect our top line to grow that business in the low-double-digits from a revenue standpoint.","Operator","And the next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick question first on the corridors that you've actually addressed. I know you can't specifically mention all the ones by name, but just give us a sense maybe how many you've done or how many you still have to do as part of this pricing initiative this year? Can you just tell us maybe percentage-wise how many actual corridors have more to go? And then just a follow-up on pricing.","Hikmet Ersek","So corridor-wise, we won't disclose it. But there's 25% -- we plan about 25% of our revenue -- of our business putting some pricing actions. Some are related to the compliance issues, like in -- some regulatory compliance issue and U.S. to Mexico. But some of them like U.S., the Europe to Africa, and especially France to Africa. It's working pretty well. We did some in westernunion.com, the transactions growth lifted very well, and the -- we have a good traction there. And also, we are planning some U.S. to Latin America. It's in early stages. We started quite late. We do some marketing programs behind that. But please understand that for competitive reasons, I don't want to give more corridor-specific...","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's fine, I understand. Just a quick follow-up to that, though. I mean a couple of years ago, it sound -- I remember you changed domestic pricing, and the result is very solid. You had great transaction growth pretty immediately. I think it lasted about 1.5 year, where transactions were well above what you'd even -- 20%-ish type range, and then it came down and moderated. And it seems like it's now slowing to -- I mean, you tell me, I think it was down to low-single-digit. I don't remember what you said exactly before, but it's down again. And is that because of just some of the pricing changes you're doing now that go sort of touch on the domestic corridor again and that's having an impact on revenue and transactions now? Or can you help us understand why it wasn't more sustainable, I guess?","Hikmet Ersek","I'm very pleased with the DMT -- U.S. DMT transaction growth. It's 7%.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. During the last 3 quarters, it's grown 7% and 8% for the year. So we've got strong, I'll call it high-single-digit transaction growth. Yes, and what you're seeing is some mix where we're seeing more growth in the lower bands, call it 0 to 50. Not quite as much growth in the higher bands. But as you think about what we've done to domestic money transfer compared to having maybe not done anything, now we're seeing more transactions, more customers in the franchise. So as we think about evolving our brand and evolving our product offerings, we've got more touch points with customers. So I still -- we're still very pleased with the success of the domestic money transfer repositioning and pricing that we've done.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. And 2 years ago, it was really going down.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But one last question on the dot-com channel. With regard to ACH, I think that came up before. I mean that's definitely one other alternative for help -- to help you price efficiently going forward. How far off do you think you are from getting that capability in terms of more real-time and authorization to go or some of your competition going forward?","Hikmet Ersek","It depends really on the countries. We are very far on the ACH in many countries, especially in the European countries to getting money from your account. It's very common and direct in real-time. And it has definitely better interchange fees with -- than the credit cards. But most of them are still credit card transactions. And the team is very -- it's going very fast, the ACH, and the direct debit is going pretty good. So I believe that will, long term, also help our profitability on the westernunion.com.","Operator","And the next question is from Tom McCrohan of Janney.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","What was the transaction growth this quarter adjusted for the situation in Mexico?","Scott T. Scheirman","Are you looking for the total C2C transaction growth or just for Mexico itself?","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","C2C. Total C2C.","Scott T. Scheirman","All right. Total C2C, it was up 3% transaction growth.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And how many of your customers for the C2C segment have a bank account?","Hikmet Ersek","About 70%.","Scott T. Scheirman","Of our senders.","Hikmet Ersek","Senders and...","Scott T. Scheirman","And the majority have a bank account.","Hikmet Ersek","Majority of the bank account.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","7-0?","Hikmet Ersek","7-0, yes.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","7-0, got it. And how does your pricing in that account-to-account corridor or segment compare to your competition with these pricing actions? Are you now in line or below? Just give us some sense.","Hikmet Ersek","It depends really on the corridors. It depends really -- I think they are too much gaining market share there. Just a reminder, our -- westernunion.com is growing 46%. Our account-to-account is growing 50%. And 80% of the customers are new. So we don't give specific corridor numbers, but I'm very pleased with the account-to-account transactions. You signed 115 banks and deactivated, out of the 115 banks, 60 of them and the transaction growth is about 50%.","Scott T. Scheirman","And, Tom, as you know, most of our business is really cash-to-cash or online-to-cash. So we're just really getting started on delivering 2 bank accounts, so not much of our business today actually goes to accounts.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, additional reports from [indiscernible].","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And so even the bank relationships that you've been growing, is that account-to-cash for the most part?","Scott T. Scheirman","Most of that, yes.","Hikmet Ersek","Primarily, yes.","Scott T. Scheirman","Account-based money transfer, which is primarily account-to-cash...","Hikmet Ersek","That it come to retail.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. As Hikmet and Mike mentioned, I think dropping funds into an account is an opportunity for us, for sure.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Great. And my last question is just on the regulatory side, with this pushout, I guess, in the deadline for Rule 1073. What -- do you have any insight into how that's going to impact Western Union? And it seems like the banks will have more of a problem complying with these new rules. I just wanted to confirm that with you in how do you -- do you view that new rule as an advantage or a disadvantage for you folks going forward?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, I want to make sure you're referring to Dodd-Frank, is what you're referring to?","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, yes. It's hard for me to speak for the banks, but I can speak for what we're doing at Western Union. And we're doing all the things that we need to be ready for that. The initial date was going to be early February, then the regulatory authorities have pushed that out. So probably at the earliest will be mid-summer right now, and the regulatory authorities are still working for that. But we've been working diligently on that and feel like when the time comes, we will be well prepared and our agents will be well prepared.","Operator","And our next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just want to ask, it looks like the pricing actions have kind of gone to your expectations. And I know it's early, but as we go into '13, obviously you'll implement more. But I guess how confident are you that you return to revenue growth and profit growth in '14 and '15? And maybe you can just give us why you're confident on that.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. Bryan, I am pretty confident because we did many pricing actions. And every pricing action, every big investment, of course, in the beginning has a question. But based on my experience, based on the company experience, it takes about 12 to 18 months depending when you start with the pricing. And the pricings we start, I'm confident that in '14, you will see positive impact here on the revenue impact. And so we are targeting 25%. And, Bryan, as you remember, DMT pricing investment, which we did about 2 years ago, in the beginning it has a transaction growth, high-transaction growth. And after about 12 to 18 months, the revenue came also. And we were very pleased and turned around this business. So based on all the experiences, I believe it will be successful.","Scott T. Scheirman","And, Bryan, the only thing I would add to what Hikmet said is pricing is one lever that we're looking at to grow the business in '14 and '15. But we're rapidly expanding westernunion.com. We're doing some really good things with account-based money transfer. We feel like we're on track to grow B2B faster in '13 than we did in '12. We expect some growth out of the C2B business. So I think all those things combined give us confidence that in '14 and '15, we can grow revenues and profits.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then thinking about pricing as we look out, it sounds like we're likely to go back to the typical 1% to 3% decline cycle that we were in previously. I guess, what gives you confidence that there's nothing in the compliance or something that -- things here that you don't know about? Or I mean I guess one of the ways to think about it, I guess, is there's probably -- is there anything out there that could be as large as the situation that happened with Vigo and Orlandi Valuta that could have that kind of an impact on price?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, from today's point of view, I really believe that we're going to come to 1% to 2% pricing environment. The regulatory environment is challenging. It's -- obviously, they are very [indiscernible]-regulated market. But all our investments, about $100 million a year that we invested to anti-money laundering compliance, are really putting us a industry standard. Being a market leader puts us in an industry standard, and we want to be a best-in-class and see that as a long-term competitive advantage. I think regulators are looking also on us, and we do have a duty to satisfy customer needs and we are working very hard on that.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly for me, just 2 macro questions. I know pre the Great Recession, WU quoted that the construction vertical was about 20% to 25% of revenue. I'm just curious what that number is now in 2012, after this year. And then secondly, immigration reform, a lot of talk about that in DC. Can you give us some thoughts on if you think that would be a positive or a negative for Western Union?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, Bryan. This is Scott. On the construction, what I would tell you just broadly is that if you think around the globe, our customers come from -- working on 100 different areas. So whether it's in nursing, the service industry, retail, construction, so I would say we continue to be diversified around the globe. I don't have a specific number to give to you on construction. On immigration, in general, what we'd say is that we're not just pushing for one side or the other. But for immigration reform, we think it would be good just so that everybody understands what are the rules, what are the regulations. So overall, we support immigration reform...","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think it's -- Bryan, I think it will have a positive impact. I think -- the support immigration reform, I think the people who are immigrated to the U.S. do have relatives, loved ones, and they would like to use a service like Western Union, I believe.","Operator","And the next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask a little bit more about kind of post 2013. And I realized it's really too early to be precise in some answers there. But it feels to me like probably one of the biggest issues for investors is what is the post 2013 earnings power of the company? I mean do you think, is it realistic at some point in time beyond this year for EBIT margins to get back to the mid-20s in a decent macro environment, or are we kind of going to be stuck down more in the lower 20s just given what the pricing environment looks like?","Hikmet Ersek","Scott, just jump in. But generally, what I would say that our business model is attractive too and is built to grow the top line. Every top line growth will help to increase our margins. And so we are -- we will set up in 2013 to bring higher growth, top line growth and profit growth. Scott, any...","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, there's a couple of things I would add, Jason, to build on Hikmet's point. The most important thing for us for profitability is driving the top line revenue. That is really key. And if you think about our business model, 65% of our costs are variable, about 35% are fixed. And then [indiscernible] that the broadview I put this around is that we're not providing any specific outlook for '14 and '15. It's just too early. But if you think about our business, our C2C cross-border business, we're in a healthy industry where the industry is growing principal in the mid-single-digits. And our long-term goal is we want to not only grow that rate but gain more than our fair share of growth there as we move forward. Also, the B2B business, it's in a market that's growing probably mid to high-single-digits, depending upon the period you look at with what we trade. And then finally, as you think about margins, and this is my -- probably more particular to 2014, is that there is about $65 million of cost that we're going to incur in 2013 that we don't expect to occur -- reoccur in 2014. And specifically, Jason, that's $45 million for the cost-savings initiatives that we're taking on in '13 that we won't have that expense in '14. And then there's about $20 million of Travelex integration that we're incurring in '13 that we won't incur in '14. And then the last thing I would add to that is as we think about these cost-savings initiatives, we believe that will drive about $30 million of savings this year. That'll ramp up to be about $45 million in '14. So we can get a little bit better on the cost savings. But back to the headline or the punchline. What's most important for us for margins and profitability is we want to optimize revenue growth, optimize profit growth. But the goal for us is to really drive that top line, we should be helpful to profit [indiscernible].","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, yes, that's a good color. And just to ask a follow-up on the electronic channels. I guess, we would estimate that in 2012, electronic channels in total was maybe about $200 million in revenue. And I know you guys are standing by your target of $500 million in 2015. I guess I mean do you need to grow this base about 35% or so CAGR over the next 3 years to get there? Is that achievable organically without any acquisitions?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, we think it's achievable. And, Jason, let me just throw a little bit color on your numbers just to make sure we're clear. The westernunion.com business that we believe can be a $500 million business in 2015 has about $150 million business today. So the 35% math is probably closer on round numbers to about 50%. But the punchline is that we think that, that is very achievable. And some of the reasons I would give you is we're going to expand to additional countries. We also have opportunity to give our customers more choice and convenience as far as how do they pay for that money transfer, but also how do their loved one pick up their money transfer. And we think there's additional opportunities to leverage not only the best of our cash network of the 500,000 locations but be able to drop money in the bank accounts and other things. So you saw a 46% transaction growth in the fourth quarter, and we believe that, that business will grow faster than the 40% overall rate that we had in '12 and 2013.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I mean, the short answer is yes. It is achievable. And our operating plan, incentives, everything is built on that.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. We just need to see, I guess, that gap narrow a bit obviously between the transaction growth and the revenue growth in that channel.","Hikmet Ersek","Absolutely, yes.","Scott T. Scheirman","Absolutely.","Operator","And our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's actually Phil Stiller on for Ashwin. Scott, I was just wondering if you can help us with the timing of the $65 million of one-time expenses throughout 2013, and what segments those will be focused on?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. Phil, primarily they'll be in the first 3 quarters of the year. So primarily in the first 3 quarters of the year. Clearly, the $20 million will be all in the B2B segment for integration, then the remaining $45 million will probably fall a little heavier to the C2C business. So that's about 80% of our business, and then lesser extent, to the C2B segment and the other segments.","Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just one other question on the C2B business. You talked about some investment that occurred in the fourth quarter that impacted the margins. I was just wondering if you can provide some more color around that and what the impact on 2013 will be.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, absolutely. We think that we had an opportunity to renegotiate a sales and distribution agreement that cost us some money in the fourth quarter. But we believe that, that will have benefits in '13 and '14 for sure by saving some distribution costs that we will no longer have to incur. As we think about the C2B business, it has probably a business that will have to in front of the margin on a go-forward basis and then probably have some revenue growth on a go-forward basis, too.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from John Williams of UBS.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just had 2. I don't want to harp on the westernunion.com thing. But you did talk a little bit about the delta between transaction and revenue growth. I just wanted to get some help from you on the margin structure of those transactions. Seems like they should be meaningfully higher given the lack of a send-side commission. But it seems like you might also have pricing impacting that and making it less of a factor. Could you just give a little bit detail on that?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think it's really a profitable model. But in the -- don't forget, as I mentioned before, the majority of the transactions are credit card transaction. It has the interchange cost fee, so it does impact. As we move more to ACH direct to bank and direct debit, the interchange fee should be more profitable. Long term, we believe that we have the savings on the send-side commissions. On the receive side, it depends on if you drop it to a bank account or if you pay it out in a retail money transfer as a cash, it differentiates from the commission side.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I know in the past when we've talked, you said that the margin profile is similar to the rest of the transactions that you typically see. Is that safe to say or are they somewhat higher still even after the interchange is taken into account?","Scott T. Scheirman","John, let me put it in terms of this that today, the dot-com business, even though we don't have a send-side commission, we are heavier in the credit cards and we're transitioning that model. But on a long-term basis, we do see the margins being, I'll say, closer to the company average on a long-term basis. Today, because we're making some investments and we've got to do some things to scale a little bit there, the margins are somewhat lower than the company average. But we believe we can get to the company average as we get into 2015. It is a profitable business today.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, so they're currently lower than your typical transactions is what you're saying?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, because of the investments, because of the credit card fees, they are lower than current margins.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Just one other question, just in capital allocation. Obviously, the business has a pretty consistent cash flow profile. The one question we constantly get from investors is just what's keeping you from taking a bigger step here and taking advantage of the dislocation in the share price and maybe doing a bigger buyback or something that's going be more weighty than executing against the current authorization?","Scott T. Scheirman","John, thanks for the question because we get that question at times, too. But we have been active in deploying the capital. Again, we -- to your point, we generated billion dollars of cash flow. It's very strong, it's very consistent. We did deploy $350 million just in the fourth quarter to buy back our stock. We plan to deploy about another $400 million in 2013 to buy back our stock. And then Hikmet and I continue to have discussions with our Board, with each other. We'll take into consideration our cash flows. We do want to maintain an investment grade credit rating, because that's important from a business standpoint. But we'll continue to have that dialogue with our Board and ourselves as move forward.","Hikmet Ersek","Also just as a reminder, a big part of our cash is growth. So that has also impact on our cash flow.","Before we close, I just want to thank you for attending this call. As I mentioned before and as Scott mentioned before, we expect that 2013 is really a transition year. We do reset the pricing actions in key corridors. We invest incrementally on the infrastructure to drive really the future growth. We believe that '13 is a transformation year, but we are confident that we have the plan, we have the strategic actions that 2014 and '15 will be future growth year. And I'm confident that we can execute against that. So thank you again attending this call, and we will talk to you soon.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

And good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter results and business highlights. Afterwards, I'll provide more information on the implementation of our new strategy that we announced today. ","Revenue trends were steady in the second quarter and we remain on track with our full year expectation for core business performance. Digital business continues to drive our results with 20% constant currency growth and 15% transaction growth in the quarter for westernunion.com money transfer. Declines in US domestic money transfer are impacting the digital results, however, westernunion.com cross border transaction and constant revenue are very strong, which with each growing well over 25% in the quarter. ","Total consumer-to-consumer revenues which represented 83% of company revenue in the quarter declined 1% on the reported basis or increased 1% constant currency while transactions grew 1%. Pricing in the quarter was favorable by 2% which has pressures driven by price increases in the US domestic money transfer, and we continue to believe that over the course for the pricing environment as stable. ","Geographically, our US outbound and US to Mexico money transfer business delivered good results. We continue to gain market share in the Mexico corridor base on the latest Banco the Mexico data and Latin America outbound also remain strong. The gains were partially offset by declines in Asia Pacific and US domestic money transfer. ","In Business Solutions, we achieved constant currency revenue growth for the fourth quarter straight quarter. Revenue increased 3% on a reported basis or 7% constant currency, driven by strong growth in Europe and Australia. Furthermore, we continue to offer our unique cross border platform to existing and additional partners. Recently, we announced collaboration that allows other financial institutions and global brands to leverage our cross border platform and compliance capabilities to make payments from almost any type of accounts to almost anywhere in the world. ","Today, we announced an agreement with Toronto Dominion Bank, the TD Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in Canada that give TD customers the ability to send money digitally from their accounts for payout at Western Union locations in over 200 countries and territories around the world. Last month, we announce an agreement with the UK Post Office which offers UK consumers and businesses expanded digital international payment services by integrating Western Union's cross border platform with the post office digital channel. Customers will be able to access international payment services via UK Post and Western Union branded online portal. Also businesses will be able to make near real pay payment in multiple currencies allowing them to expand their network and connect with new business partners across the world. ","These are only two prime examples where leading brands are turning to Western Union for our deep financial services expertise, digital know-how and leading compliance capabilities to expand access and create new choices for their customers. Financial institutions FinTech's and global companies like Amazon are also choosing our platform, global regulatory framework and network to offer our capabilities to additional customer segments.","We think this validates our model and market position and crucially underlines the principle upon which this business has been built. Convenience, the high standards of compliance and reliability for the users and communities who interact with the platform. We believe we have a responsibility as we evolve our business to maintain our commitment for those principles, both for the benefit of the customers that use our platform and because it's a competitive advantage for Western Union.","I'd now like to provide some additional color on the global strategy initiative that we announced today. We are very confident in the underlying strength of Western Union and enduring value of our unique cross border platform. This is a stable business with strong margins, but we believe we can deliver additional value to customers and shareholders through a new global strategy designed to drive improved efficiency, profitability and long-term revenue growth. This global strategy is the result of strategic review of the business that we will detail at our Investor Day on September 24. At Investor Day, we'll provide you with a full view of our new strategy, discuss new initiatives to drive growth, as well as detail additional opportunities for efficiencies.","We plan to give you an overview of how we expect to generate long-term growth by offering our more efficient and advanced WU platform an operating model to customers globally. As discussed on our last call, we identified opportunities to run our business more efficient -- effectively and efficiently. The global strategy is focused on executing on our opportunities through important changes to our operating model that will meaningfully reduce our structural cost base. Plan changes include a reduction in our total headcount by approximately 10% and the consolidation of corporate and business offices, while we continue to be a leader in the global cross-border money movement and payments industry.","We believe that these actions will have relatively quick return on investments for shareholders, while better positioning us to drive growth. Specifically only from these actions we announced today, we expect to generate $100 million in annual savings beginning in 2021, which should help drive significant margin expansion from where we are today. We have been working hard and planning these initiatives for some time. And we look forward to sharing more details on our Investor Day. Our goal is not only to drive cost savings and margin expansion, but drive growth by delivering the efficient and advanced WU platform to more customers, clients and global brands.","Now I would like to turn it over to Raj for a more detailed discussion of the second quarter financial results.","Raj Agrawal","Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter revenue of $1.3 billion declined 5% compared to the prior year period while adjusted constant currency revenue which excludes our divested businesses for both the current and prior year increased 4%. Currency translation net of the impact from hedges reduces second quarter revenue by approximately $74 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to depreciation of the Argentine peso. The decline in the peso negatively impacted reported revenue by 3% while the effective inflation on our Argentine businesses is estimated to have positively impacted both reported and constant currency revenue by approximately 2%.","In the consumer-to-consumer segment, revenue declined 1% or increased 1% on a constant currency basis while transactions grew 1%. The total C2C cross-border principal was flat or increased 3% on a constant currency basis, while principal per transaction was down 1% or increased 1% constant currency. The spread between C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 2% with a negative 2% impact from currency. Pricing and mix were offsets as pricing positively impacted revenue by 2% in the quarter compared to the prior year period, while mix had a negative impact of approximately 2%.","Turning to the regional result. North America revenue grew 2% on a reported and constant currency basis, while transactions declined 1%. The US to Mexico corridor delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter and the US outbound business also generated solid growth led by transfers to Latin America. These increases were partially offset by continued declines in US domestic money transfer. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3% or increased 1% on a constant currency basis with growth led by Spain and France Transactions in the region increased 4%.","Revenue in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region declined 3% on a reported basis or 1% constant currency, while transactions decreased 3%, primarily due to softness in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. And hard currency limitations in certain African markets. The Latin America and Caribbean region continued to deliver strong constant currency revenue growth led by Ecuador, Peru and Mexico outbound. Revenue in the region increased 4% in a reported basis or 16% constant currency, while transactions grew 11%. In the APAC region revenue declined 14% or 12% constant currency and transactions were down 9% with Australia, Korea and Malaysia contributing to the revenue declines.","westernunion.com revenue grew 18% or 20% constant currency with transaction growth of 15%. Westernunion.com represented 13% of total C2C revenue in the quarter. Business Solutions revenue increased 3% on a reported basis or increased 7% constant currency and represented 7% of company revenues in the quarter. Constant currency revenue growth was driven by increased sales of hedging products and strong growth in the education and financial institution verticals. Other revenues which consist primarily of our retail bill payments businesses in the US and Argentina decreased 31% in the quarter. The decline was due to the Speedpay and Paymap divestiture is in May, which was non-core domestic focused businesses. And the impact of the depreciation of the Argentine peso. Although the Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina grew transactions in local currency revenue, it declined in US dollar terms.","Other revenues represented 10% of total company revenues in the quarter. Turning to margins and profitability, we will focus on consolidated margins as segment margins are not comparable with a prior year period due to reallocation of corporate costs following the divestiture of the Speedpay business. We are also providing adjusted metrics to exclude the impact of the net gain on the Speedpay and Paymap divestitures, restructuring expenses, merger and acquisition cost and related tax effects.","The consolidated GAAP operating margin was 19.3% in the quarter compared to 20.1% in the prior year period. The decline was due to the impact of the sale of the Speedpay business, higher marketing spending and restructuring expenses which were partially offset by business solutions margin improvement and other operating efficiencies. We incurred $7 million of restructuring expense related to the operating model changes in the quarter. We anticipate approximately $100 million of restructuring expense for the full year and approximately $50 million to be incurred in 2020. These costs relate primarily to severance as we are reducing our headcount by approximately 10%. And also include costs for relocation of operations, facility closures consulting and other related expenses.","We anticipate these changes will generate $100 million of annual savings beginning in 2021 with about $50 million of the savings realized in 2020. And we expect these savings to contribute to operating profit and drive strong margin expansion over the same period. Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 20.3% compared to 20.2% in the prior year period. As business solutions improvement and other operating efficiencies offset the impact of the Speedpay and Paymap divestures, and the increase in marketing spending. Speedpay and Paymap contributed about 80 basis points to last year's second quarter margin, but had no contributions to the current period margin. While foreign exchange hedges provided a benefit of $6 million in the current quarter, compared to no impact in the prior year period.","The GAAP effective tax rate was 17.5% in the quarter compared to 14.8% in the prior year period, while the adjusted tax rate of 16.8% compared to 17.3% in the prior year period. The increase in the GAAP rate was primarily due to changes in estimates for Tax Act provisional accounting in the prior year period. The GAAP earnings per share in the quarter were $1.42 compared to $0.47 in the prior year period with the increase driven by the gain on the sale of the Speedpay business. Adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.45 compared to $0.46 in the prior year.","We completed the sale of the Speedpay business on May 9th for approximately $750 million in cash. And also completed the sale of our Paymap mortgage services business in the second quarter. The sale of these businesses generated a pre-tax gain of approximately $525 million with related taxes estimated to be approximately $145 million based on statutory rates. As we mentioned last quarter, the Speedpay gain also produced a favorable effect on our overall US tax position with respect to the BEAT provision in 2019 which should result in a separate tax benefit of approximately $50 million this year compared to our initial February outlook.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $403 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter were approximately $37 million. At the end of the quarter, we had cash of $1.2 billion and debt of $3.1 billion, as we paid down some notes that matured in May. We returned $246 million to shareholders in the second quarter including $86 million in dividends and $160 million of share repurchases, which represented approximately 8 million shares. The outstanding share count at quarter end was 426 million shares and we had $1.2 billion remaining under our existing and new share repurchase authorizations. The majority of which expires in December 2021.","Turning to our financial outlook. We are updating our full-year GAAP financial outlook to reflect the restructuring expenses related to the operating model changes we announced today. We are also providing adjusted operating profit, tax rate, and earnings per share and operating cash flow outlooks which exclude the net gain on the Speedpay and Paymap divestitures, the restructuring costs, merger and acquisition expenses and all related tax impacts, including the BEAT benefit. We continue to expect GAAP revenues for the full year to decrease mid-single digits due to the divestiture of the Speedpay business in May.","On an adjusted constant currency basis excluding Speedpay and Paymap from both years, we expect low single-digit constant currency revenue increase which is unchanged from the previous outlook. GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 18%, while the adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 20%. The change in GAAP margin from our prior outlook reflects inclusion of the $100 million of expected restructuring expenses. We expect both the GAAP and adjusted effective tax rates to be in the range of approximately 18% to 19% in 2019, and continue to expect the effective tax rate in 2020 to be in the mid-teens range. GAAP EPS for the year is now expected to be in a range of $2.47 to $2.57. Down from the previous $2.66 to $2.76 to reflect the restructuring expenses, which impact the full-year outlook by approximately $0.19 per share on an after-tax basis.","Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.70 to $1.80. GAAP cash flow from operating activities for 2019 is expected to be approximately $800 million, while adjusted operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $950 million. We continue to expect to spend between $500 million and $600 million on share repurchases in 2019, and we already spent $335 million in the first half of the year.","In summary, the quarter's results were stable with improved pro forma revenue growth compared to the first quarter and solid margins. Excluding the cost related to the restructuring, we remain on track with our full-year earnings outlook. We continue to return significant funds to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet and we begin implementing our new global strategy designed to drive profitability, efficiency and long-term growth with immediate changes that will generate $100 million of annual savings.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","The first question comes from Tien- tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","TientsinHuang","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks as always for the time. On the savings makes sense, I'm sure you'll give us a lot more at the Analyst Day but is that a net number that we should expect in savings, net of any kind of incremental investments that you might make for growth? I just want to clarify that to begin my question.","RajAgrawal","Yes. We expect most of the $100 million of savings to go to the bottom line and to impact positively our margins. So it is a net concept, yes. ","TientsinHuang","Okay, terrific. And then if you don't mind, Hikmet, I want to ask you a crypto question because we've been getting that question a lot since the Libra news came out and then MoneyGram with Ripple and in light of some of these savings you're highlighting, I'm curious how crypto might fit in your roadmap something around a fiat currency, et cetera, what that might mean? Anything to say there? Thank you.","HikmetErsek","Sure. Actually all the discussion shows how valuable our platform is, it really is built on that and all the discussion shows how valuable is to be in 200 countries and moving money in 137 currencies. It shows the value of our platform and the regulatory challenges that many environment has but West Union has that right and we are also at the same time, we are looking at the innovation on the crypto industry. And we are basically the cross-border machine for many FinTech companies, many global companies, and many financial institutions. And I think it's a very important, the question is always what is the crypto currency. Is it a fiat currency or is it a settlement currency?","I think the differentiation has to be done in a very good way and understood by the industry. I think there's a lot of noise there. They're mixing everything between fiat currency and the settlement currency. I think that needs more discussion, but most important thing is that it is a regulated environment. And West Union has all the framework. It has the settlement machine and we can offer our settlement to many FinTech companies.","Operator","The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","DarrinPeller","Hey, thanks guys. Just to take the other side of Tien-tsin's question on the margins. I guess in terms of investment and growth that we might want to hear about it at the Investor Day, first of all, can we expect to hear some greater discussion where you're going to invest for purposes of accelerating growth or is it really going to be more of a margin focus? And maybe just give us a preview of a couple of areas you're hoping to talk about on enhancing growth. And then I just have a quick follow-up on the westernunion.com business.","HikmetErsek","Yes. I think that's a great question. This initiative is really making our platform more efficient and really looking at additional growth opportunities. And we believe that we can run this business especially core business more efficient way. And we've been thinking about that for a longer time. We were planning about that and we are very confident that we could do that. So this is very important that we'll also --this platform running in a different way with all WU Way activities with all our performers gives us also growth opportunities.","As I mentioned on the call in my script, as I mentioned many companies turning to us, financial institutions FinTech companies, Amazon, global brands are using our platform to achieve also new customer segments. That means for us also growth opportunities, long-term growth opportunities. I think besides serving the Western Union CTC customers, we believe there are also big opportunities to serve with our platform new customer segments. And this is something that I would like to share at the Investor Day. The other thing is also the growth opportunities in our existing business like artificially, using artificial intelligence for more dynamic pricing.","We are today at 20,000 corridors but we could be more with artificial intelligence with more corridors more dynamic more growth opportunities I believe that are there.","DarrinPeller","All right. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just my quick follow-up is on the westernunion.com site, but obviously revenue growth continues to hold up well and I think it accelerated a little bit this quarter. But I know this transaction decelerates. So I am just curious if that-- you may -- I have missed some of the prepared remarks So I just ask was there -- are you finding ways to have a higher revenue yield on certain transactions?","HikmetErsek","Yes. I mean as Raj and I mentioned earlier, I think the transaction growth was impacted by the US modern domestic money transfer declines as the US domestic money, US domestic money transfer has been quite under pressure for a while. And that has been but it's 80% of our revenue and westernunion.com is cross-border and that has been very well growing 25% accelerating even transaction and revenue. And we are now in 71 countries with our outbound business and we believe that we can expand even more there. So it impacted mainly for US domestic.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","BryanKeane","Hi, guys. I want to ask about the global strategy and how it compares and contrasts with Wu Way?","HikmetErsek","Wu Way as you know was driving the lean operating principle throughout our organization to enable that our platform is much more better. And we operate in a more efficient way. And we did find significant increases in productivity on areas. What we have done is that over time over the Wu Way activities, we learned a lot and we really taking this Wu Way activity to the next level. During our first phase of Wu Way we invested back in the compliance, in GDP, in privacy, in marketing activities growing the westernunion.com to more countries. Here what we have done is really taking this Wu Way, our learnings and taking the Wu Way to the next level actually.","And we train 6,000 people. They are all in manager trained. We trained, looking at the process in a different way and we found, identify to last -- we've been working longer time on those really identified additional opportunities around this business more efficient. And using more technology, in a technology in a more efficient way, consolidating some of the offices and using more artificial intelligence, we really identify them and that's a result, or first results of the global strategy. There are more to come at our Investor Day to share with you, Bryan, and I'm looking forward to that actually. I'm very excited because the team is really very motivated and they really -- managed with those share more detail on that.","BryanKeane","Got it, got it. And then post-2021 when you expect-- after you expect to generate the $100 million in savings I think that'll be starting in 2021. When you look a little longer term then what does the global-- what is the operating margin and profit look like in the global strategy longer-term? Does it have leverage or is it more stable margins as we've seen post the Wu Way originally?","RajAgrawal","Bryan, we will give you more color on our growth strategies, obviously that plays a big part in where the margins go beyond 2021, but we do believe that there are additional opportunities for efficiencies that can drive further cost opportunities and margin expansion beyond what we announced today. But obviously revenue plays a big part of that. And that's something we want to give you more color on, but we feel good about the longer-term opportunities here.","Operator","The next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","StevenWald","Hey. It's a Steven Wald on for James. Just a couple questions. And we've been seeing Visa and MasterCard and some of the other diversified payments names make some more cross-border moves recently. Just wanted to get a sense of how you view the competitive environment on the cross-border side from the more diversified players?","HikmetErsek","Well, competitive environment has not changed in the cross-border and we are really -- we are a leader on this area. And these are expertise, this is our sweet spot, this is being activated really in that area. I think the others are catching up on that one and really trying to acquire things but what I see here is that our new cross- border is really a competitive advantage because we are building on our existing strengths and existing values and we really want to expand that to new customer segments. Like today, we are serving a certain customer segment, C2C customer segments with Western Union brands. The examples I brought before and other examples are really serving also additional businesses, additional brands for their customers offering our platform.","And the big difference probably in our is that not many companies owned end-to-end processes. We do end-to-end processes, not many companies have the compliance programs we do have the compliance programs. Not many companies can settle in 137 currencies, we do settle in 137 currencies, so it is a big advantage and we additionally have our network, the people can walk in to our network, but we also have four billion bank accounts and wallets we build that.","I think in the future we're going to talk more about the Investor Day but I'm excited also how we offer the network to new brands and new customer segments, and really using our facility. Others have to build that; we have it.","StevenWald","Okay, great. Yes, thanks for the color. And then just maybe one more quick one there. I think I might have missed earlier on, but when you guys are talking about the headcount reductions and the relocation, can you give us any additional granularity on where some of those account reductions are going to focus or be focused on in terms of like job function?","RajAgrawal","Yes. It really is the best way to answer that it really is throughout our entire business. It's not focus on any particular area. There are some more senior type roles that we are taking out in places, but we're consolidating corporate and business offices in different parts of the world. So it's not particularly focused in a particular area and we're still in the process of notifying employees over the coming weeks. So that's -- it's really a global effort on our part.","HikmetErsek","It's also really finding the right place to be operating the right way. That doesn't mean that we're going to have closing some corporate office that you're not going to operate in 200 countries. As I said that's our strength you are continued to operate even more efficient there, but really consolidating some of the offices where the experts are, where we can really get more efficient go-to-market activities, that's what we are doing.","Operator","The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Please go ahead.","DamianWille","Hi, guys. This is Damian Wille on for Ramsey. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask on this recently announced partnership with Visa. How much of your volume do you think could ultimately be sent through cards instead of bank accounts and paid out in cash? And do you see this sort of opening up a new service potentially for your customers?","DamianWille","Ramsey, this is Raj. We look at that as just being another channel for our customers to use. Customers will have the ability to initiate a transfer online and send it to somebody's Visa debit card in many, many different countries around the world. And we're going to start piloting it later this year and roll it out more broadly next year. So it's still early stages but for us it's another channel. We're trying to have account capabilities all over the world. And this is just another angle to that. So we're pleased to have an opportunity with them. And we'll see how it transpires.","HikmetErsek","It shows also how companies like Visa cooperate with us; it shows also our competency where we can -- Visa strength combined with our strengths and really reach out to new customer segments.","DamianWille","Okay. That's great to hear and maybe a little bit more unlike on the US domestic money transfer business. I know you previously mentioned that despite the competition from folks like Zelle and Venmo, that there's still the need for cash to cash payments. Do you see the declines are stabilizing in the near term or maybe a broader question, do you see that this P2P app phenomenon occurring in other geographies around the world?","RajAgrawal","Yes. I would say on the domestic money transfer side in total last year it was about 7% of our revenues. The year before it was about 8% of our revenues. So it has been a gradual decline for the digital business as Hikmet mentioned DMT is about 20% of the digital revenues. So that's seeing more of a decline, but overall we've taken those things into account in our outlook and we assume that the domestic business will continue to decline. It's not very large in any other part of the world other than in the United States. So that's really where we have the most material revenue. In other markets, it's still relatively small and our most of our businesses are still really cross-border in nature.","So I would say it's on a more stable basis, the digital part, we did see a little bit more of a decline in the quarter than last quarter, but we certainly managing that and we see good things overall for our digital business. And Hikmet mentioned, 80% which is cross-border for our digital businesses growing well over 25% in both transactions and revenues. So we feel very good about that part of the business.","Operator","The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead.","AshwinShirvaikar","Hi, Hikmet. How are you? Hi, Raj. I'm good. Thank you. Thanks for asking. I guess the question I have is as I look at the last five, six years there have been multiple transformation initiatives, restructurings including Wu Way for a prior question. And frankly, it's kind of in some ways creditable that you're maintaining a stable rev growth and stable margins, but none of these initiatives have actually managed to increase either of those even with the benefit of the cycle.","So I guess I'm a little bit confused with regards to, again, if you could just explain to me why this is different and why they should improve margins or healthier growth rate?","HikmetErsek","Yes. This is different, Ashwin, as you know in the past we announced several actions, but we also had savings and we use them for regulator, mainly for the regulatory environment, upgrading our regulatory framework, upgrading our technology, upgrading our-- investing on the westernunion.com which you could see already it's paying back, right. I mean how strong our westernunion.com is, other competitors are far away from the growth of westernunion.com and from the business of westernunion.com. This is different because we are also committed to margin expansion. ","In the past, we said that we're going to do further investment in the business where we need it, and where we had to upgrade our some of the things we --because the regulatory environment has changed and technology has changed, but this is really different, this is really commitment to our shareholders. This is really a commitment that we're going to have $100 million run rate savings and that's a big difference than in the previous one as you recall, Ashwin.","RajAgrawal","Yes. And Ashwin, we have set up specific processes internally to ensure that we-- the savings that we've identified we are able to capture and take to the bottom line. We have different things in place, controls in place that we are driving for these savings. So we feel comfortable and confident that we will be able to get these savings. And then as we mentioned earlier, as we talk over the next few weeks and at an Investor Day, we do want to talk about the growth opportunities because we still see more growth opportunities and we see further efficiency opportunities beyond the scope of what we announced today. So I would just say -- ","HikmetErsek","Definitely further opportunities on that.","AshwinShirvaikar","Got it. And I guess a quick follow-up if I can. Are you seeing any kind of benefit then, I mean the question still is why now? So are you seeing a benefit from maybe the ID requirements that one of your--actually two of your competitors have talked about it at a major retailer? I mean any optionality for agent gain as well anything like that you seen change in the market.","HikmetErsek","Yes. I think this is an issue for the other competitors not for us. We have the right compliance programs into place. We use a lot of investment that you mentioned earlier what happened to the Wu Way savings. It went to the compliance investment part of it, part of it to the artificial intelligence. I think this is particularly for one area for the competition to have an ID requirement. We do have our control programs. We have our business model which is really very compliant. I don't see any changes there from that. The first question was why now, Ashwin? ","AshwinShirvaikar","Yes. Why now? ","HikmetErsek","Because I mean now it's because we are coming from position of strength. We feel really very comfortable with our business. The pricing environment is stable. This quarter was even -- there were some parts that of was mix and some US domestic price increases, but pricing environment is stable. And we feel really we are acting from position of strength. We are not leaning back. We are looking forward. That's why we are doing also the Investor Day to show you, to investors and to analyst how that company will look in the longer way. How the -- our platform will be slimmer and more agile and more effective to goad for new opportunities and our commitment on the savings.","Our commitment to the shareholders for margin expansion. Of course, we need also revenue growth, right. That's exactly what we are focus, all this based on our today's economical view. Of course, you never know but we feel very confident about our future.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","JimSchneider","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Hi. I just wanted to ask on the performance in Latin America that continues to improve relatives I think last couple quarters. You just call out a couple of countries including Ecuador, Peru and some others but I'm curious is the improvement more a statement about the market and the macro trends or is this statement about your market share within it?","RajAgrawal","I believe it's a little bit of both; the economic conditions are generally good in the markets that we called out. We also see good amount of business going to Colombia as a result of the exodus from Venezuela. So though the market-- the inbound business to Colombia is also benefiting us there. And so it's been a good grower force as you mentioned, Jim, for quite some time now. And we hope to keep that going as much as we can. So it's been performing well as you said.","JimSchneider","Great and then just curious so in terms of making the network more efficient from a delivery perspective any examples you can give us in terms of what cost might be rationalized? And whether that would in any way kind of reduce the span or footprint in any way on the receive side of your network?","HikmetErsek","We are not reducing network. ","RajAgrawal","No, it's-- I think the --what we talked, what we've announced today is really more around the headcount reduction throughout the globe. And then also some corporate and business offices. We are going to look at other components of our cost structure, which would include commissions and other things. And that's some of what we want to lay out for you as we get to Investor Day. But it does not sacrifice the quality of distribution that we have around the world.","HikmetErsek","It is opposite actually, right. ","HikmetErsek","Yes, exactly. We're also driving for account payout, Jim, that that is going to be a big part of our distribution strategy both funding and payout. So that along with other commission strategies, we believe have some additional opportunities which we want to talk to you about.","HikmetErsek","Remember, Jim, we announced even the wallet strategy, which had good result in Kenya with Safaricom. All these things dropping money not only on the retail also in an account, but also in a wallet. It's a big competitive advantage. That means that our network looks totally different than it was in the past because we are serving new use cases with our agile platform. That's the story we want to tell you also on September way how we can see the opportunities for the future.","Operator","The next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","DavidTogut","Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you provide a little detail behind the 2% price increase in the quarter? I thought I heard you say domestic. Is it all domestic or is some of it cross-border? And if there are any specific quarters to call out that would be helpful.","HikmetErsek","David, as you know, we operate in 20,000 cross-border corridors. And we have a domestic money transfer business which is about 7% of our revenue. And we did do some price increases there as the transactions are going. I think but our competitive advantages in the cross-border, in the 20,000 corridors we sometimes increases prices; sometimes decreasing prices and we've been doing that for a lot of time; it's a really portfolio management and we use dynamic pricing actions like an airliner right. And we really use different straight street corner pricing, different band prices that impacts to our revenue. And in this environment actually the last quarters, last two years, the environment has been very stable. The pricing environment and we mentioned that several times.","RajAgrawal","Yes. And the pricing list was primarily focused in North America, David which, and the single biggest area was domestic money transfer. If you look around the world and the other regions there were other factors like in Asia-Pacific the transaction growth got worse, but it doesn't have much of a revenue impact because it's mostly around the intra business there. So most of the pricing list was focused in North America.","DavidTogut","Thank you. That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up question. On the competitive front, Zoom announced an expansion to more than 30 European countries in the second quarter. How do you assess the competitive threat from Zoom? Is there any -- are there any counter actions you need to take to protect and continue to grow Europe and CIS which was particularly strong in the quarter?","RajAgrawal","Yes. We feel very good about our long-term growth opportunities in our digital business. Particularly the international business. We said that the cross-border part is growing above 25%. The international part is growing even faster than that. And the one differentiating factor compared to others who are in the market is that we have most of our revenue even today being paid out at a retail locations or even though it's being initiated digitally, it's still paid in retail. So for us, our growth opportunity is to go account to account and look at digital ways of sending and receiving money, which is where other people, other companies are also trying to play.","So we really believe that we're going to be able to create a better overall, global cross-border digital business then anyone else will have over the next few years.","HikmetErsek","And long term, I'm going to share more at the Investor Day, but long term I believe is that our network coming such a competitive advantage, is it account, is it wallet, is it the retail, many companies are turning to us; want to use our services. And it's really thinking about our strategy giving you more color on that on September 24th. But the European environment has been doing very well actually. And it's continued to doing well. We do have our regulatory framework there. We have our bank license there and our compliance programs. And we are now in 71 countries and it's just the beginning.","I mean in the US digital business, we have been a longer time; European and other countries are new to us and growing that fast. So we feel very comfortable with the growth rates in international environments.","Operator","The next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","KartikMehta","Hey, Hikmet and Raj. Raj, in the past you've talked about needing a certain type of revenue growth to get the margin expansion. I understand this new cost-cutting will help you get to margin expansion. But is the formula change at all once you put in these efficiencies in terms of the revenue growth you need to really drive margin?","RajAgrawal","Yes. I mean, Kartik, what I tried to say in the past is that all else being equal revenue growth needed to be in the mid to -- low to mid single digit type of range to drive margin expansion. Here, we're focused on taking some cost out so in terms of margin expansion, we do believe we're going to get quite a bit over the next couple of years. And we've assumed a normal level of growth I would say in that regard. Normal meaning it's not too extremely high or too low. It's sort of low single-digit type of growth needs to be there for us to get this margin expansion with the cost savings initiatives that we've announced today.","HikmetErsek","And additional importance also. ","HikmetErsek","Yes. ","KartikMehta","And then I think on Wu Way you had talked about Wu Way doing two things. One was obviously reducing costs; the other was helping you drive revenue. I think, obviously, the cost-cutting has really gone through But as you look back at the program, did it help drive revenue for you?","HikmetErsek","Yes. I mean it's initially--it's not that big but all the new initiative probably launched 27 countries internationally with dot-com that was a lean management process behind that. We wouldn't get Amazon on our network if we wouldn't have the Wu Way mindset lean management operating activities. These are all examples which are also driving the revenue. It's really a new way of going to the market being more efficient and really offering our platform to the customers. That has been definitely driven by Wu Way initiative. It's not only a program; it's really how we operate is the Wu Way and for that it was --it's a multi-year training, multi-year way of thinking differently and operating differently.","KartikMehta","And then just one last question, Raj. I know you're now giving adjusted EPS guidance. I guess if you compare that to, if you had given that in the previous quarter how would it compare it?","RajAgrawal","Not much has changed, Kartik. We're adjusting for the restructuring charges and M&A as well as the game just to call it out because there are so many moving pieces. So largely our outlook that we began with at the beginning of the year has stayed relatively consistent. With the Speedpay divestiture, we mentioned last time that that was worth about a $0.10 dilutive impact this year. And then our tax rate is slightly higher. So if you actually look at the range that we initially gave, we're right on track with what we thought at the beginning of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Jennifer Dugan of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","JenniferDugan"," - SunTrust hi it's Jenny Dugan on for Andrew Jeffrey. If you look at the growth in your big four receive markets, how does that growth compared with say the combined growth trends in all the other quarters? I'm just-- I'm wondering if there's a meaningful disparity with faster growth outside of those four main corridors?","HikmetErsek","Four main corridors, tell it again Jenny I'm a little -- ","JenniferDugan","Yes. If you look at -- ","RajAgrawal","Yes. I mean if you, US to Mexico for example are one of our key corridors. And we had very strong growth in the US to Mexico corridor. Obviously, we have other corridors like the Middle East to India that are also large that are having their own issues. So you have some large corridors that are performing well, but you also have some large corridors that are not performing so well. So I would say it's a mixed bag. There's not a clear differentiation there.","Operator","The next question comes from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","UnidentifiedAnalyst","Hi. Thanks. It's Jamie for Susquehanna. Raj, I want to revisit the tax conversation. Thank you for those helpful comments that you made, I heard you say something about the $50 million adjustment to beat from the Speedpay sale. You made some comments about the trajectory for next year. Where are we generally in the tax journey? I know it's a question you get a lot from investors.","RajAgrawal","In the tax journey, well, this year as we mentioned, we expected 18% to 19% tax rate. And that includes a number of different moving pieces. Whether you look at GAAP or GAAP tax rate or adjusted, next year we do believe that the tax rate will be in the mid-teens range. We have solved the most of the BEAT issue going forward. And so we're comfortable that we will be back down to the mid-teens level next year for our tax rate.","UnidentifiedAnalyst","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I just was wondering it's not that intuitive that you would have raised prices domestically at a time when there was seemingly some pressure on the business. Maybe I'm just oversimplifying, but was there any elasticity there? Or am I just - am I on the wrong track?","RajAgrawal","No. I mean domestic money transfer is not a business. We've assumed that business will continue to decline for quite some time because it's not a business that it has key competitive advantages to it. Our competitive advantage is really cross-border in nature. And so we are trying to maximize our cash flow in that business. And so we do a good balance. We have to make sure we're aware of what the market is like, but we also want to maximize the outcome for our business. And so we try to balance both factors.","Mike Salop","Andrew, I understand there's one more question in the queue. So we'll take the final question.","Operator","Yes, sir. That question comes from Vasu Govil of KBW. Please go ahead.","VasuGovil","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first I had a quick follow-up on the Visa direct partnership that you guys signed. I understand that it's opening up more channels for you, but is it also an incremental cost saving opportunity where you can maybe complete transactions for cheaper using the Visa rails? Or it's just traditional means of moving money?","HikmetErsek","Well, obviously, I mean as Raj mentioned earlier, the Visa direct and we came together. We looked at our competency. They looked at their competency. With Visa direct you're obviously coming to new customer segments, additional customer segments where you can drop money. And this link directed to an accounts with Visa numbers. Our capability to move money in 137 currencies and Visa also global brands. And we believe that there is an additional opportunity on that. So grow this business even stronger. And I think that shows again our capability to offer another brand to our customers that they can move money globally in an easy way, and in a compliant way and in a regulated way. And that's probably the most important part on this agreement.","VasuGovil","Got it, that's helpful. And I guess just a quick one. I know we'll get more detail on the growth opportunities under this new global strategy at the Investor Day. Should we expect to get long-term growth targets both for revenue and margins at the Investor Day as well?","RajAgrawal","Vasu, we don't really want to get into what we're going to talk about there. But we recently want to talk about our long-term growth objectives. And how we see the growth playing out and then we also want to talk more about additional opportunities that we may have for efficiencies. And sort of give you more of the full picture there in just a few weeks.","End of Q&A","Mike Salop","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us. Have a happy -- have a pleasant afternoon.","Operator","Once again the conference has concluded. Thank you for today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Mike Salop","Thank you, Laura. On today's call Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will discuss the Company's third quarter results, and then we will take your questions.","The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations tab, and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.","Today's call is being recorded and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2014 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibly for any recording, replay, or distribution of any transcription of this call. I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered another good quarter, especially considering the challenging environment in many parts of the world. In constant currency terms, all three of our business segments produced good revenue growth. westernunion.com and the U.S. outbound market continued to provide good growth in consumer money transfer, offsetting economic softness from Russia and the impact of market restrictions in Greece.","Net pricing in the quarter was minimal. We continue to believe the environment remains stable, and we do not anticipate significant changes in pricing in the near future. Our retail commission rates have also been running slightly lower than a year ago, and we expect those to remain fairly stable, as well. Consumer bill payments growth in the quarter was again driven by Argentina and the U.S. electronic bill pay and business solutions constant currency revenue also increased, despite global trade weakness.","Our margins were strong. Operating margins were consistent with last year's third quarter at 21.8%, while EBITDA margins increased 70 basis points. And we continued to generate strong cash flow and distributed to our shareholders with over $200 million returned through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. Year to date through September, we have now returned $670 million to shareholders.","There are some micro challenges. With uncertainty about global economic growth and trade, and geopolitical tension in many parts of the world, but we are confident in our execution and the resilience of our business, and we are pleased to affirm the full-year financial outlook we provided last quarter.","We're also excited about the future opportunities, and we continue to make progress on our strategy growth priorities. I have spoken to you in the past about how we plan to expand our cross-border network into new areas in the future, providing more ways for funds to enter our network, and more ways for funds to pay out. We are leveraging our many strengths. Obviously, our global brand and our existing networks of retail agent locations, ATMs, kiosks, online sites, mobile wallets and accounts, and our regulatory and compliance programs around the world, and the technology, foreign exchange conversion and settlement and data management that make up our platform.","On the promising side of the network one area of expansion is westernunion.com, where we continue to add new transaction sites, which are now active in 33 countries. We also recently launched a mobile app in France. Another opportunity is to open our network to new types of players, which we are enabling with the introduction of the WU Connect platform, which can be aimed our money transfer capabilities into third-party digital platforms.","For funds out, a key growth opportunity is being able to move money into accounts. Transfers into bank accounts represent a significant portion of the cross-border immigrant market, plus it's an area where Western Union has limited participation historically. We believe we can capture some of this market by allowing senders the optional sending to an account from westernunion.com, agent locations or third-party platforms such as banks and social media et cetera. One of our strategic priorities has been to develop an expansive account pay-out network, where we can transfer funds into accounts around the world quickly and cost efficiently leveraging our platform and compliance and regulatory capabilities and giving consumers the opportunities to send to an accounts from our various channel choices.","I am very pleased with the progress we are making in this area, and we are currently have the ability to access hundreds of millions of accounts globally, including not only bank accounts, but also mobile wallets, and other account forms, such as cards.","We are still expanding these relationships, and we will embarking on marketing and awareness programs to drive the account payout business as the network unfolds. It will take some time to develop the business, but we believe this is a great long-term opportunity, and we are focused on executing it well. We will talk more about this and others strategic initiatives early next year, but now, I would like to turn the call over to Raj, to discuss the third quarter in more detail.","Raj Agrawal","Thank you, Hikmet. Third-quarter revenue of $1.4 billion was down 3%, compared to the prior-year period, due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, but revenue on a constant currency basis increased 3%. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced third-quarter revenue by approximately $85 million compared to the prior-year period. In the consumer to consumer segment, reported revenue decreased 3%, but increased 3% constant currency. Transactions grew 2% in the quarter.","Business trends were generally similar to the second quarter, but transaction growth rates came down slightly, due to the impacts from the Philippines and Greece. The Philippines was impacted by reductions in new intra-country business, banned by compliance-related actions. The Greece decline was caused by government-imposed restrictions on money transfers, which have now largely been lifted, so business in the country is improving in the fourth quarter.","In the quarter, total C2C cross-border principal declined 6% or increased 1% constant currency. Principal per transaction was down 7% compared to the prior-year period as a result of foreign exchange translation, and was flat in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 5 percentage points. The differential was due to a negative 6% impact of from currency. Mix had a positive impact of approximately 1% in the quarter, while the net impact from pricing was minimal.","Turning to the regions, due to the significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates compared to last year, as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results, I will be referring to constant currency movements. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 10%, but was flat constant currency basis. Transactions declined 3%. Strong revenue growth in Germany was offset by continued weakness in Russia, and the previously-mentioned declines in Greece in the quarter.","North America revenue declined 1% or increased 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 4%. U.S. outbound growth was strong in the quarter, driven primarily by sends to Mexico and Latin America, and our Mexico business continued to grow faster than the market, based on the latest Banco de Mexico data for the first two months of the quarter. Total domestic money transfer revenue declined 1%, while transactions increased 5%, an improvement in both measures compared to the second quarter.","As we previously reported, in early April we implemented some price reductions in the high-principal bands of our U.S. domestic money transfer business in parts of the country. We had transaction growth at all of our principal bands with growth rates compared to the second quarter improving in all bands below $1,000 and we saw improved trends in both priced and non-priced markets in the quarter.","In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 2% or increased 3% constant currency, and transactions were flat. Growth in the region was driven by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which is partially offset by continued weakness in Angola, caused by limitations on access to dollars and euros. In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 8%, or down 2% constant currency, primarily due to declines in the Philippines while transactions in the region decreased 6%. Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region was flat, or increased 3% constant currency, while transactions increased 7%. Growth in the region was driven primary by strong inbound business from the U.S.","Westernunion.com C2C revenue grew 22% in the quarter, or 28% constant currency. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25%, and U.S. originated online transactions grew 32%. Electronic channels revenue, which includes WU.com, account-based money transfers through banks and mobile money transfers represented 7% of total Company revenue in the quarter.","In the consumer to business segment, revenue increased 6% or 10% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Argentina walk-in and the U.S. electronic businesses, which was partially offset by declines in the U.S. cash walk-in. Business solutions reported a revenue decline of 4%, or an increase of 6% constant currency. The revenue growth was driven primarily by Europe and Australia and led by strong sales of hedging products. The consolidated operating profit margin was 21.8% in the third quarter, which is consistent with the prior-year period. The operating margin benefited from hedge gains, cost savings initiatives and efficiencies, which were offset by increases in technology expense and the negative impact of currency translations. While the overall impact of currency translation negatively impacted revenue and profitability in the quarter, the impact on margin percentages was essentially neutral, as the hedge gain impact was offset by negative translation.","In the quarter we recorded approximately $21 million of hedge gains on our revenue line, which also flowed through to operating profit. Cost savings initiatives contributed about $6 million of incremental savings in the quarter, which brings the year-to-date total to approximately $27 million. We expect fourth-quarter savings to be the same as in the third quarter, similar in the third quarter. Technology spending and investment have increased compared to last year, as we continue to invest in enhancements to our platforms, digital capabilities, settlement systems, and data center transformation.","Compliance expense was approximately 3.6% of revenue in the quarter, compared to 3.2% in the prior-year period. We still expect a range of 3.5% to 4% for the full-year as we are 3.7% year-to-date. EBITDA margin of 27.1% in the quarter increased from 26.4% in the prior-year period. The difference between the 70 basis points EBITDA improvement and flat operating margins was due to an increase in business solutions amortization, which was driven by a write down related to an anticipated contract termination.","Our tax rate was 12.5% compared to 14.2% in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, we are benefiting this year from some non-recurring items. We continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13% for the full year, and we would expect the rate to be in the mid teens range next year. Earnings per share were $0.45 in the quarter compared to $0.44 in the prior-year period. The C2C segment operating margin was 25.5% compared to 24.9% in the prior-year period. The C2C operating margin benefited from hedge gains and cost savings initiatives and other efficiencies, which were partially offset by increases in technology and the negative impact of currency translation. The consumer to business operating margin was 16.4% in the quarter compared to 15.4 % in the prior-year period. The margin increase was driven by higher revenue and benefits from cost savings initiatives, which were partially offset by increased technology expense. Business solutions reported an operating loss of $3 million for the quarter, compared to breakeven profit for the same period last year.","Operating profit declined due to increased amortization expense related to the write down and the value added tax recovery in the prior year period, partially offset by cost savings initiatives. Depreciation and amortization for business solutions was approximately $20 million in the quarter, compared to $14 million in the prior year period. EBITDA margins for business solutions improved to 17.4%, up from 12.8% in last year's third quarter.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $804 million year-to-date through September. Capital expenditures were $84 million for the third quarter. At the end of the quarter, the Company had debt of $3.5 billion and cash of $1.4 billion. The Company utilized US cash to pay off their $250 million debt maturity during the quarter. As a result, approximately 20% of the cash was held by United States designates as of the end of the quarter.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares for a total of $125 million. Our remaining authorization of $781 million expires in December 2017. We also paid $79 million in dividends in the quarter, and at quarter end we had 506 million shares outstanding. Despite uneven global economic conditions, we continue to get solid performance from the US and other key spend markets, and strong digital growth, and our margins have tracked largely as expected.","Based on our results year-to-date and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are affirming our full year outlook including the adjusted EPS outlook that we raised in July. ","Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys. Just want to start off with the competitive dynamics and pricing for a moment. Hikmet, you mentioned, so far it looks like stability is what you're seeing across pricing. Can you just comment on really little more granularity on that by region, and if there's any regions that stand out versus others? Domestic obviously was a big area of concern. There's been a lot of innovation around domestic. Are you seeing any more of that, or is it still stable?","Hikmet Ersek","I think generally I don't anticipate big changes on pricing in the near future, as I mentioned earlier. I think the market is quite stable, even though it's in the domestic we are really improving our transactions. Even in the priced places where we put pricing, but also in the non priced corridors in the domestic, in the cities, we are really improving our transactions here. That's a good news.","The market is stable. As, our pricing is different from channel-to-channel, corridor-by-corridor. We are operating in 16,000 corridors. We have different channels, we do different pricing. That is a bit of our business, but overall, I feel quite comfortable with our pricing strategy.","Raj Agrawal","I would just add that the transaction growth that we see this year is more result of global economic conditions around us. We have seen some positive growth in areas, but we also have some markets like the Philippines and Greece and other markets that are --","Hikmet Ersek","Greece was closed last quarter.","Raj Agrawal","That are having an impact, but that's some of the impact you're seeing in transaction growth.","Darrin Peller","That is helpful. I want to hit on just the overall channel for growth online. It continues to be very strong, despite being off obviously an increasing base. And in terms of just the acquisition, the customer acquisition patterns vary. Do you have enough channels to keep going at this rate for a while? It's a big market, but without cannibalizing your core business, which you continuously say is not happening, is there enough out there and enough channels?","And on that note, we've heard of some of your other competitors buying assets like XE out there, that are enabling unique customer acquisition channels. If you could just comment on your strategy around that to enable that to continue to grow with these trends? And on the margin part of that, just given that your margins are holding up pretty well, as the margins been coming up in that area versus where they were, given the scale on that?","Hikmet Ersek","Let me start with the overall digital performance. I would say that westernunion.com is doing pretty well, as you know that our transactions are growing. Even in the U.S. where we have been longer in the market, we have been 32% transaction growth last quarter, so very strong growth. But we\u2019re also expanding to the new countries. So the growth will continue to come in the new countries. We are in 33 countries now, and these countries are just on the start on the westernunion.com site, which is Western Union branded, but also non-branded like account-based money transfer, transaction, online transactions, bank-based transactions growing very well. So are pleased with our online trends.","Darrin, you're absolutely right these are new customer segments, still new customer segments. They didn't use the Western Union on the retail the last 12 months, so it is 80% the, there is a little cannibalization if you name it as cannibalization. I am pleased with the strategy. So what we did also with our new Western Union Connect is that opening our platform, which is a unique platform as you know with compliance with regulatory license in 200 countries with multi currency settlement, it paying out in 131 currencies, we are opening our platform to new digital players also.","I think that in the near future, you will see some partners here, new digital partners, we are working hard on that to announce, but our WU Connect platform is really the capability to move money globally, not only to a retail, but also to an account, to a mobile wallet or to any type of electronic way, to a mobile wallet in a way that not many companies can do that. On the margin side, I just want to add was that the margins are improving here, also on the digital side, but we're still investing here. We're going to continue to invest. Raj, do you want to add on the margin side?","Raj Agrawal","Margins were strong overall in the Company, probably in this quarter, WU.com itself was not a big contributor, but we see better margins in that business over the next few years because as we get the leverage in the marketing and technology spend that we're doing, and as we have additional funding vehicles from a bank account and paying out to a bank account we should be able to drive better margins in that business. Right now, the focus has really been on driving top line growth and expanding the distribution. But it is going to be a bigger margin contributor over time.","Darrin Peller","Last question, and I'll turn it back, the margin side overall, as you have said it has been pretty stable, and pretty strong this year versus some expectations before the year. Are there any variables you see outstanding that in front of you in the next few quarters that could derail that, or does the margin look like it should hold up, other than maybe FX hedges?","Raj Agrawal","The FX hedges as you say, is going to be where we'll have less of a gain next year, assuming rates stay where they are. The part we don't know about currency is the overall currency translation impact. But the other factors that will impact margins are obviously overall revenue growth, and in our commission line, this year, as Hikmet mentioned in his comments, we have been able to bring commission costs down a little bit this year, and we're getting some beneficial mix impact.","Compliance costs have been more stable this year then we see them being more stable in the 3.5% to 4% range, that has been a drag historically. We don't think it will be as much of a drag as we look forward. We also are looking for also opportunities to reduce our costs in our fixed and variable cost. Those are some of the factors that will impact margins overall.","Hikmet Ersek","We are going to continue to invest in the growth areas like digital and the technology. That we will continue to do but the improvement of the margins are quite promising, and overall stable.","Operator","The next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins","In Asia, we've seen the transaction trends declining a bit more, and you talked about it weakening, is there any -- are there any other particular issues that are worth mentioning, just to explain what the worsening trend is coming from?","Hikmet Ersek","It's a really geopolitical issues, economic issues, we don't see major issues here, Sara.","Raj Agrawal","In the Philippines we put some new compliance rules in place earlier this year, and that has continued to impact the intra-business in that market, which is a bigger impact to transaction than it is to revenue overall. Greece was closed for a lot of the quarter, even though it's a small portion of our revenues, it does have an impact. Greece is coming back to more normal levels, so that should help us in the fourth quarter. But those are couple of the reasons that transactions were down a little bit from the prior quarter.","Hikmet Ersek","But the market is stable, we don't see any pricing pressure on that, so that we would lose transactions or something like that. In many general corridors, we are pleased with the transaction growth.","Sara Gubins","And then within the U.S. and online, can you update us on where you are in terms of doing immediate send? And is that something that is still an area of focus? ","Raj Agrawal","If you talking about instant funding in the US?","Sara Gubins","Yes, meaning from WU.com --","Raj Agrawal","No real change from what we said before. We do have instant funding capability. We do evaluate all customers who want to do a bank funded transaction in the US for instant funding, but as I've also said in the past, we're creating a global business and it's not just a US concept that we're trying to build out. We have bank funding and instant bank funding in many parts of Europe and other parts of the business, and that's really what we're trying to do is provide services all over the world, not just in the US.","Sara Gubins","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Good. Thank you, good afternoon. Just I want to ask about Western Union Connect, which looks interesting here. Just curious that the partner pipeline. At this point, what level of interest are you getting, Hikmet? And I get that it's going to take time to scale obviously, but I'm curious, are you going after big partners to scale quickly? Or should we consider more local partners to build it out?","Hikmet Ersek","As bigger as better, I would love to get big partners. Obviously, we're working on many partners globally. The good thing is that WU Connect, it's not like I was sitting in a corner office and came up with the idea. The idea came up from the market, and there are some partners who want like social media partners or some while the customer communicates with different parts of the world, they want to do all the other things like sending money or sending a gift, or something like that.","This has been definitely something that we've been seeing in the market. The capability we have is unique, though. Having license in 200 countries and having that engine in the middle, having the compliance programs and the right time to invest as we started two or three years ago investing in our compliance programs, making a global compliance programs, and also the multi-settlement program is unique. Not many people can do that.","So opening that platform to new partners is definitely something, we are working on it. It will take some time, though. It's a total new customer segment. It's building trust. It's building brands. It's a long term opportunity but I'm quite excited about that.","Tien-tsin Huang","That sounds interesting. It makes sense that there'd be some natural demand there. I guess, just shifting gears as my follow up, the liquidity or cash question. I suppose US cash, or $200 million or so at this point, does this impact your ability to continue buying back stock? Should we think you'll reload on the debt front to replenish there?","Raj Agrawal","No real impact. We had $1.4 billion, and as you mentioned, we did pay down a debt maturity, but we have plenty of cash. We still have some debt capacity to the extent that we need it. We have another debt maturity in the fourth quarter which we'll likely refinance with commercial paper and maybe some cash as well. But we still have our intercompany working capital programs that also help us to bolster our US cash balance. So we have plenty of opportunities there.","Hikmet Ersek","We typically repatriate some foreign earnings yearly, right? Around $200 million to $300 million. I think these programs are going away and we don't see any hiccups there.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay. That is great. Thank you.","Operator","And next we have a question from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Just looking at the Latin American market, I noticed in the second quarter, transactions were at 7% and revenue in constant currency was 13%. This quarter, they were a little bit tighter together with transactions at 7% and constant currency at 8%. Just trying to make sure I understand what drove the differences between the second and third quarter there.","Raj Agrawal","It's mostly from the grow over from last year. Last year, we had strong growth in the Argentina business, we had done some pricing in the business. So you're seeing a grow over impact on that, and that's really what's impacting the growth there. We've got transactions more in line with overall revenue growth there.","Bryan Keane","And the pricing actions that you guys did two years ago, are you still seeing an impact in the transaction growth rates from that, are those all anniversaried, and it's pretty steady state on the transactions, where you would be on the normal cycle for Western Union?","Raj Agrawal","You're talking about overall or for Argentina?","Bryan Keane","Overall.","Raj Agrawal","Yes I think it's a pretty steady state. This year we're really being impacted more from the conditions that we see around the world, more than anything related to pricing. So it's really that we're seeing in the transaction growth levels.","Bryan Keane","Okay and Hikmet, any thoughts about giving a long term constant currency revenue growth and EPS growth, just so people can plan a little bit and expect for the model?","Hikmet Ersek","Definitely not on this call. We want to give we will definitely give some outlook mix in February, around February for 2016. Obviously we can give also our strategy, long term strategy. We will have some strategy updates in our investors call obviously. But currently, I'm not going to give any long term guidance in this call, Bryan.","Bryan Keane","Maybe think about it for next","Bryan Keane","Maybe think about it for next quarter. It would just help investors understand what to think on a longer-term basis. Obviously if you pulled out the economic volatility, if you to stay in a status quo, in an economic environment, you can expect this kind of revenue and EPS growth, I think it would help people get some confidence in what the long-term outlook is for the business model, so maybe give it some thought.","Hikmet Ersek","Good suggestion, Bryan, thanks. I will have a look.","Operator","And next we've a quarter from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg","I was just curious, based on where you're at year-to-date, do you feel like the higher end of the EPS guidance is more likely? I think if you need, just to get to the midpoint it looks for EPS, I think you only need to do about $0.39 in Q4 versus the $0.45 you just predicted. I just wanted to test how you're feeling within the range with just a couple of months to go here?","Raj Agrawal","Jason, I would just say that we raised our outlook in July because we saw more positive trends in the business, and that's really what we're just reiterating right now. We're positive on the outlook, and we feel good about the year.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. But is there anything we should be thinking about as far as quarter-over-quarter declines in the P&L from Q3 into Q4? ","Raj Agrawal","There are some things that could impact margins, but our margin outlook is for 21%, that\u2019s about where we are year-to-date. We know that the hedge gains could be slightly lower in the fourth quarter because are starting to grow over some of the bigger currency movements that happened last year, marketing could be back up. It was a little bit lower in the third quarter.","Some things like that, that could impact the business. But there are number of different factors that we've taken into account to get us down to the EPS line. That's how we've thought about the overall outlook for the year.","Mike Salop","And Jason in the last couple of years we've taken cost actions in the fourth quarter, so we will continue to look for opportunities there where we may be able to attack some efficiencies for the future.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Good to know. And then just on WU Connect, as far as how economics will work there, will it be similar to typical agent commissions, if we think about how you'll interface with these technology partners?","Hikmet Ersek","I think our business model won't change obviously. It will be definitely something transaction-based, revenue generating with consumers. That will continue to happen. I think you could find some efficiencies here dropping money on our retail or dot-com, or to an account or a bank or to a mobile wallet or to a prepaid card. Definitely there are some efficiencies here we can find to the business model, but generally it will be the similar business model that we have today.","Jason Kupferberg","Just last one from me, I know you had mentioned a contract termination in business solutions, any other color around that, or any information on just materiality from a revenue or earning standpoint?","Raj Agrawal","Sure. That's a contract it's a business partner that we have today. We anticipate that we are going to lose that contract. It's worth about $10 million to $15 million of revenue. We are looking for ways of replacing that revenue.","Operator","Next we have a question from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Hussain","This is Daniel Hussain calling in for Smitti. Just another question on outlook, similar to Bryan's question, actually, but in the latest World Bank remittance forecast from about a week ago was stable versus their prior report, and this is the first time in a while that they kept it stable. Hoping to get your perspective on migration and remittance growth in a broader sense over the next few years.","Hikmet Ersek","Globally I think by year end there will be about worldwide, World Bank estimates about 250 million immigrants worldwide, people who moved to another country where they were born. The migration will continue to happen. I believe that we are in a good market, generally. But it's also very much dependent on the economical development on some countries, how much they invest. Is it in the service industry, if it's in the construction industry or is in different industries. So job creation is definitely something that is important that is related to that.","I'm staying cautious on the global economic development, you saw that our U.S. numbers are seeing a good transaction growth, and also on Saudi Arabia, you see good numbers, Germany we see good numbers, so I think there some, but there are also challenges in some parts of the world, and that balances that. I would generally say that we are in a good market, remittance market will continue to grow. There is a demographic needs in Europe for migrants. There's demographic needs in Japan. There's a demographic needs in South Korea and Russia for migration. Overall, I would say, long-term, it's a good market to be in.","Daniel Hussain","Sorry if I missed this, Raj, but did you quantify the hedge benefit for Q3 and are you still expecting $70 million for the full year?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. $21 million gain in the third quarter from the hedges. And again from a margin standpoint, that was largely offset with the negative impact of translation. We are still expecting about $70 million for the full year, as well.","Daniel Hussain","Great, thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Tom McCrohan of CLSA.","Tom McCrohan","Hi thanks. How much hedge related gains are left to recognize for this year out of the $70 million?","Raj Agrawal","We've achieved about $57 million in gains thus far. We still expect about $70 million and that's going to be dependent ultimately on where the exchange rates are for the fourth quarter. So there's a little bit more to be gained in the fourth quarter, assuming rates stay exactly or roughly where they are today. Maybe $16 million, $15 million or so.","Tom McCrohan","That's about $0.12 for the year, the $70 million tax adjusted adding to EPS and more on the high end of your guidance you're probably going grow EPS $0.07 versus 2014. So you enter 2016 with $0.12 headwind, plus the tax rate going up to the mid teens from a very low tax rate now, so and cross border principal decelerating 1% this quarter, which is down from 2%, down from mid single digits only a year ago. How should we be thinking about 2016 now? I know you're not giving guidance for 16, but where is the earnings growth going to come, from given the high tax rate, given the exhaustion of the $70 million in gains, and given the cross border principal is really not growing that much?","Raj Agrawal","We had a negative this year the overall impact of currency is negative. Even though from a margin standpoint it's neutral, the negative translation impact. As we look at next year, there are a number of factors, we can't really give you an outlook for where we're going to be next year. At this early stage.","But there are a number of different factors. Obviously revenue growth is still the number one factor for us, so we need to get good revenue growth. This year we feel that are being impacted more by the economic conditions around us. The World Bank has said that the principal growth should rebound next year so that should be positive for our business.","Currency is an unknown in how it's going to impact. We know hedge gains will be less next year but currency translation, which has been a negative this year, may not be negative, and we have to see how that plays out. And then it's all the other big cost items. Commissions we've been able to bring under control this year, they are down slightly, and we're getting some beneficial mix impact. Compliance costs, that I mentioned earlier are in the 3.5% to 4% range, so a little bit more stable than we've seen, and I don't expect that to be as much of a drag. These factors, along with any other cost savings initiatives that we might have in place, we're going to have the overall impact as we look at next year.","Mike Salop","And Tom, the $70 million doesn't go away. We did have hedges in place for next year at some good rates, so based on current rates, we think that $70 million probably is cut in half in terms of hedge gains for next year, but it doesn't go to zero.","Tom McCrohan","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Rayna Kumar of Evercore.","Rayna Kumar","Are you gaining or losing share in cross-border money transfer?","Raj Agrawal","Last year, Rayna, we grew our principal by 5% and our cross border principal by 5%, and based on the World Bank data, their most recent estimate is for 4% growth from last year. We believe we are doing well, and our focus continues to be, as Hikmet has mentioned in our digital business, because we believe that's where the fastest part of the growth is coming from and will come from. That's why we've also expanded into other potential kinds of partners. Our digital business grew by 28% on a constant currency basis last quarter and 25% on transaction growth.","Hikmet Ersek","Why don't you give the example of Banco de Mexico?","Raj Agrawal","Mexico, we haven't given you the specific data this quarter, but we're growing faster than the rest of the market there, based on the first two months of the quarter in terms of the data and year-to-date, we been doing quite well there. We have some very solid examples. Our US outbound business has continued to grow very well. Germany and even parts of the Middle East, so we're seeing some good performance. We think that digital will also be a key driver of growth for us.","Rayna Kumar","What are your current views on the competitive threat created by PayPal's acquisition of Xoom?","Hikmet Ersek","I can't make a comment on PayPal, and I will let Dan talk about that, and John, on Xoom. But we are very focused on our business and I believe that no one can be active no is active like us in 33 countries on online, dropping money to 200 countries. So we are serving already many, many corridors, and many customers, and our goal is to expand our online business to every country where we are present, because we have the regulatory license, we can drop money in a way that not others can drop. I am pleased with my team, digital team, they are doing a good job, and we're going to continue to expand our activities there.","Rayna Kumar","That's very helpful. And just one final question. Do you anticipate any additional price cuts in domestic money transfer?","Hikmet Ersek","We see a comfortable result, as I said, in US domestic money transfer business, we are growing, we are improving our business quite good. Even in the non priced cities where we implemented, we are growing. It's very pleased. We always as, we are always, Rayna, we are always looking on pricing actions constantly, right? But it's not like something that it's day-to-day business. Being active in 16,000 corridors and so many bands, so many different things, we are always looking at that. I don't see any big significant investments in the pricing, and as the market is really stable.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","Jim Schneider","I was wondering if you could comment or provide a little more color on your point that you made regarding agent commissions coming down. Is that just a timing thing, in terms of in terms of signings, or is there something else in that, is there any kind of change in the exclusivity in the existing agent base, or can we talk a little bit more about why those rates are coming down?","Hikmet Ersek","You're absolutely right, Jim, it is really depending on seasonality. Generally it is stable. I do see stability here. We don't see anything of an increase of agent commissions. The other one is also the mix we sometimes drop money in a different account which is a different economic model, dropping money to an account than paying out in a retail location. That part of the mix and that part of the environment helped us to bring our cost for servicing down. I would say that long-term we don't see -- I see it quite stable.","Raj Agrawal","We also went through some larger renewals in the last couple of years and we're just -- we don't have that many larger deals at this time and we're just getting some beneficial mix impact as Hikmet mentioned.","Hikmet Ersek","Average agent contract is about three years, five years or seven years, within three years to seven years. It is not that every day is the same and we have every year some renewals. That's a quite good balance. That shows the stability of the business, also of the agent commissions.","Jim Schneider","And then as a follow-up, regarding business solutions, the operating margin ticked down to minus 2.7%. Is that business cash generative at this point, and can you maybe talk about are there any cost levers that you might pull to get it back to break even, if it's not already, and maybe just talk about the overall prospects long-term for the business structurally?","Raj Agrawal","Jim, the operating margin and operating profit was down this quarter because we took the write down for an anticipated contract loss. But from an EBITDA standpoint, the EBITDA actually improved by a few million dollars from last year and the EBITDA margin also improved to 17.4% versus 12.8% in the same quarter last year, so the business is actually tracking well from a profitability standpoint, and it's making a good amount of progress. So we feel good about that. Longer-term, we still believe in the growth opportunities for business solutions. Over the last year the business has improved its performance. The growth rates are higher than they were in prior periods. So we are pleased with our overall performance and believe that the business is tracking well.","Operator","The next question is from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.","Kevin McVeigh","Any sense from a capacity perspective, given the step up in compliance, have you seen the competitive dynamics change in terms of capacity starting to come out in the system? It seems like it is in Mexico, but in any other areas of the world at this point?","Hikmet Ersek","You mean capacity wise, --","Raj Agrawal","Are you referring to competitors leaving the market, or is that what you're referring to because of compliance?","Kevin McVeigh","Yes.","Hikmet Ersek","You'll see in some markets that companies are finding it difficult to operate in the market because the regulatory environment is quite asking a lot of questions, and a lot of demands for them. As you recall, we invested it starting about three years ago heavily into compliance and obviously we do see the payback. We do see investments grew by about, it's currently running about 3.7% of our revenue. It's a competence for us.","Running the transactions to our compliance programs in a way that like an engine makes us definitely that way being competitive advantage. It means also that regulatory environment will be in 200 countries. The compliance and regulatory challenges won't be less in the future, that will continue. We are committed to be in 200 countries where we operate and comply with the regulators, and it means also that we will be there, and that could be long term a competitive advantage.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. In the C2B business, those margins bounced back nicely sequentially and year-over-year, any thoughts there in terms of what's driving that?","Raj Agrawal","Year-over-year margins improved, that's related to our revenue growth, some cost saving initiatives, and that was partially offset by higher technology expense. Sequentially, the margins were down a little bit in the C2B business, and that was largely related to technology investments we are making throughout the company.","Hikmet Ersek","And the growth comes mainly from U.S. electronic bill pay and our Argentina business. Our Pago Facil business in Argentina was offset a little bit by our walk-in business in the U.S. and the U.S. built walk in business, to electronic business in the US is doing pretty well.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta","Raj, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the online business. You said the margins are improving. Do you think the margins in that business could get to the margins of the traditional business, and if so, what type of scale would you need to see in that business to achieve that target?","Hikmet Ersek","I think you said the right words scale, scale, growth, growth, growth, growth, right? It's a balance. We are investing because it's a growth business, and we continue to invest in expanding the new corridors in new countries. We also see good growth, it's still small but good growth in new countries, helping us to grow this business. As this business is growing and we are expanding, that will definitely help us our margins. We are very pleased with also with numbers where we would countries where we've been present for a longer time like in the US.","The 32% transaction growth last quarter in US was impressive. New customer acquisitions are impressive, 25% overall transaction growth was impressive, and that growth will definitely help us to grow us in revenue terms, and that will help us to increase the margins. It depends also how we drop money. It depends on the corridor. If you drop money into an account it is in a different margin, if you drop into a retail location is a different margin. It depends everything what the customer wants and we do serve that. But the expansion of WesternUnion.com, this new business will continue.","Kartik Mehta","Hikmet, so far, pricing this year has been stable. It seems like you have been very vigilant watching it. How can you make sure, what are you doing to make sure that you don't have to drop prices significantly, not like you did a few years ago. And play catch-up?","Hikmet Ersek","I think what we do is that, since we dropped the price about three or four years ago, and it's also three years I guess, and we've been very diligent, right? We are looking at 16,000 corridors daily, not only the 16,000 corridors, we really look into different channels daily the customer needs, and the customer spends, watching the competition, and we have a great pricing tools that helps us. The other thing is also, as, being in 200 countries, we have great people on the market, with our 75 offices with multicultural team, they do mystery shopping, we look at pricing, how the competition is reacted to that.","If there is need, we do corridor-by-corridor pricing. But as, it's all not about pricing. Our prices are 15% to 20% premium overall in some corridors, and some corridors flat, some corridors lower, but overall 15% to 20% and we know from customer service is that the customers are paying for the convenience, for global brand, for the trust, other things. It's a whole package product that we offer to the customers and that has been quite stable, and I believe for the near future, it will stay stable.","Kartik Mehta","One last question, Raj I think you talk about a headwind to margins, there's been some technology spend that you had, is this a onetime issue, or do you think the spend you are doing for the technology will be ongoing?","Raj Agrawal","We've been spending or investing in our technology upgrades for some time now. It's not something that's going to go away because these are typically multiyear projects. These are it's our settlement system, it's our data centers we're upgrading as well as our core processing platforms. We have had older technology in place and we really want to make sure that we're fit for growth for the future as we have additional kinds of partners, and we want to be very flexible in the market with the different requirements that we're going to have. So that's really what were doing Kartik, and it's in our spending this year. But I expect the spending to continue for the next couple of years.","Hikmet Ersek","I think also Kartik just some industry standpoint, I think that the industry will continue to invest in the technology as a requirement from regulatory environments increasing, digital environment is increasing, the data search is increasing, know your customer, know your agent, all of this environment is increasing, and we did invest in the early stages. It's not only about investing in the technology, technology is helping us to enable our presence in this country, making the transaction easier, giving us a unique presence, which we can serve the customers. The technology is definitely supporting our day-to-day business.","Kartik Mehta","Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","And the next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.","Tim Willi","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a follow up, I had a couple topics around margin and the outlook. With WU Connect, I just want to clarify, this is not something that you think next year is going to result in an elevated level of spending that would put the current margin story at risk? It sounds like you feel pretty comfortable about the scalability and the ability to not have headwinds around compliance and things like that, so you be able to invest in the business and not really derail the margin story? I just want to clarify that particularly as it pertains to building out WU Connect?","Hikmet Ersek","Tim, actually I see that WU Connect is the ideal platform to scale that in a way that will bring us additional growth opportunities long-term. It won't, suddenly you won't see our revenues will go up on that, but I believe it's a long-term to Connect partners -- it's like an agent connection which we did in retail in the past. It's now opening our platform giving the ability to huge databases to connect to our platform, and using our capabilities. I don't see that it will have a significant changes on our business model, it will be more efficient. We will be in a way that we can drop money for these partners that others will have issues to do that. We could do it the best way, I guess.","Mike Salop","Laura, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","That final question will come from Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research.","Matt O'Neill","I was curious, I understand you're not talking about discrete guidance for next year, but if you could address longer-term discussion you have had over the years about 1% to 3% pricing contraction? This year, it doesn't look like that will happen, barring material pricing in 4Q. So just maybe how to think about that commentary going forward, or if it is still applicable?","Hikmet Ersek","It's always hard to predict the future, but from current environment, as I said earlier, operating in 200 countries, 16,000 corridors, looking at the market by market gives us the capability to predict our forecast pretty well. We feel confident that we are in a good position, we feel confident that it's not all about pricing. We feel confident that our product is well-positioned to serve also in the digital environment, to serve in the retail environment, to serve in the account-based environment, in the mobile wallet environment. I believe that we have a great product and customers are choosing for that, so I feel comfortable.","Mike Salop","Matt, this year we are doing pricing in some corridors as we always do, but we also have some price increases in other corridors, so they're netting to zero this year, but there's still some price decreases going on in different corridors around the world.","Mike Salop","Well thanks everyone for joining us, and have a good afternoon.","Operator","The conference is now concluded.

Overall, we delivered another solid quarter to start the year as our business continued to show resilience in the face of uneven global economic conditions. First quarter trends were generally similar to the fourth quarter. Our consumer money transfer business posted steady results. The consumer bill payments business provided good constant currency revenue growth and Business Solutions increased as well. Although the stronger dollar continued to impact reported results, total revenue increased 3% for the quarter in constant currency terms.","In consumer money transfer, westernunion.com, U.S. outbound, and Germany continued to provide good growth, although we did see some softer business in the oil-dependent markets. Business Solutions constant currency revenue increased 6% in the quarter and consumer bill payments increased 12%.","Operating margins were a healthy 19.9% despite increases in technology investments and negative impacts from currency. We also continue to generate strong cash flow and return over $300 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases.","So, the year is starting as expected. As we think about the next several years, as we highlighted at our Investor Day in March, our focus is on maintaining leadership in the traditional retail money transfer business, extending leadership in digital money transfer, and leveraging our cross-border platform to serve new use cases and customer segments.","Our traditional retail business continues to deliver steady results and we are making progress on our global digital initiatives. A few digital examples this year include the launch of our mobile app for westernunion.com in Italy, which will allow Android and Apple users to access our money transfer services, a refresh mobile app in the U.K., a new mobile remittance receiving service in Bangladesh which was launched with MasterCard, bKash, and BRAC Bank, two new westernunion.com transaction sites in Europe, raising our total to 36 countries globally with online money transfer sending services.","In Western Union Business Solutions, we introduced WU EDGE; a new service brings buyers and sellers together on one digital B2B platform where they can easily arrange and complete cross-border invoicing and payments. The platform also provides added foreign exchange and cash management tools for users.","In addition, as we previously announced, we added the Viber social messaging app to our WU Connect platform this year. Viber has been in beta mode until last week, but we now added account payout capabilities and are excited to begin a full launch to build awareness and drive usage. We also remain focused on expanding our pay-in options and account payout network and initiating more corridor connections to bank accounts.","I have spent a lot of time over the last several weeks travelling throughout Europe and Asia, including attending the European Money20\/20 Conference in Copenhagen. These trips reinforced my belief in the importance of the end-to-end capabilities that Western Union provides in cross-border money movement and in our ability to leverage our assets for more funds-in and funds-out use cases.","I saw an example of this in China where we work with ChinaPay to offer a fast cross-border payment for business customers in the country. We also provide many other digital services in China with Western Union money transfer available on several online and mobile banking platforms. Our collaborations in China, and all other examples I have mentioned, further convince me that our services can provide very valuable connections to partners whether they are financial institutions, social media or messaging companies, mobile operators or more traditional retailers.","So, we see many opportunities, and I believe we have the right strategies to address them. Thus far in 2016, our business performance has been solid, and we are on track with our full year expectations while we continue to make progress on our long-term strategies.","Now to discuss the first quarter results in more detail, I would like to turn the call over to Raj.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Hikmet. Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter results. First quarter revenues of $1.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period, while reported revenues declined 2% due to the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $57 million compared to the prior-year period. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, constant currency revenues increased 1% in the quarter, and reported revenues declined 2%, while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was driven by westernunion.com and continued strength in U.S. outbound particularly to Mexico and Latin America.","Total C2C cross-border principal declined 2% compared to the prior year period or increased 1% constant currency. Principal per transaction was down 5% or down 3% in constant currency terms with the decline driven by several oil-related markets.","The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 5 percentage points, including a negative 3% impact from currency. We continue to view the global pricing environment as very stable. The impact of net price decreases was 2% in the quarter, but this was primarily related to Argentina, where we took significant reductions on our outbound pricing in response to the economic and currency deterioration in the country and from the actions we took in our U.S. domestic money transfer business in April of last year. Outside of these two actions, our pricing impact would have been neutral in the quarter and mix was also neutral.","Turning to the regions, as we did last year, due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. Also, as previously mentioned, we have made a change to our C2C regional reporting effective in the first quarter. We are now including the westernunion.com business within the regional numbers, splitting the revenue 50-50 between the send and receive regions, which is consistent with how we treat the retail business.","The comparable quarterly numbers for 2015 can be found in our earnings release attachments, and we will also continue to report westernunion.com revenue and transaction growth rates in our supplemental information.","In the quarter, North America revenue grew 3% or 5% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. The region benefited from strong growth in U.S. outbound to Mexico and Latin America with our Mexico business again outpacing the market based on the latest Banco de M\u00e9xico data for the first quarter. Total domestic money transfer revenue was flat in the quarter on transaction growth of 5%.","In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3% and was flat on a constant currency basis while transactions increased 3%. Similar to previous quarters, Germany delivered strong growth but the positive impact was offset by continued weakness in Russia.","In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4% or 1% constant currency, and transactions were down 3%. Low oil prices are affecting the region's result as many Gulf States have experienced slowdowns in investment and hiring. Main declines were from Nigeria, where the inbound business has been affected by wide divergence between market exchange rates and official rates, resulting from oil's impact on the economy. Saudi Arabia revenues increased, but trends were not as strong as previous quarters.","In the Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 4% or down 1% constant currency, while transactions decreased 4%, primarily due to continued weakness in the Philippines. In addition, some received markets in Asia have been negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries.","Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region was down 5%, but increased 1% constant currency. Transactions increased 11% in the quarter. Revenue growth was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., but this was largely offset by the pricing reductions in Argentina.","Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which is included in the regional numbers just discussed, grew 16% in the quarter or 18% constant currency and represented 7% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25% with U.S. originated online transactions growing 28%.","Mobile trend \u2013 mobile continues to be a fast-growing area for wu.com with over 55% of U.S. transactions being initiated on a mobile device in the quarter. The online business is also gaining good traction on sends to accounts through our expanding account payout network. The spread between transaction revenue growth for wu.com in the quarter was primarily due to lower principal per transaction and other mix. This was driven by the high growth in mobile transactions, which tend to have a smaller principal amount.","As Hikmet mentioned, we now have online transactions sites in 36 countries which allow us to send to over 200 countries and territories. And we expect strong growth from wu.com as the year progresses as we expand our presence and further enhance our service offerings.","In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 1%, but increased 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which was partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk in. The depreciation of the Argentine peso drove the differential between reported and constant currency revenues. Business Solutions reported revenues increased 1% or 6% on a constant currency basis, aided by strong sales of hedging products in Europe. The consolidated operating profit margin was 19.9% in the quarter compared to 20.6% in the prior year period. As expected, the operating margin was negatively impacted by incremental technology expense and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by benefits from cost savings and operational efficiencies and the timing of certain expenses.","Hedge gains in the quarter were similar to the prior year, with $15 million of gains in the current quarter compared to $16 million of gains in the first quarter of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to prior year. Compliance expense was approximately 3.6% of revenue compared to 3.8% in the prior-year period, EBITDA margin of 25% in the quarter compared to 25.5% in the prior-year period, and as expected, our tax rate of 14.6% increased from 12.3% in the first quarter of last year. In combination with share repurchases, these results generated earnings per share of $0.37, down slightly from $0.39 a year ago.","The C2C segment operating margin was 22.7% compared to 23.1% in the prior-year period. The C2C operating margin was negatively impacted by higher technology expense and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by benefits from cost savings and operational efficiencies and the timing of certain expenses. The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 14.6% in the quarter compared to 18.7% in the prior-year period, with the decrease primarily due to increased technology expense.","Business Solutions operating profit of $2 million was consistent with the prior-year period, while EBITDA margins improved from 14.6% to 15.1%. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $213 million for the quarter, while capital expenditures were $48 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.2 billion and cash of $1.2 billion. Approximately 35% of the cash was held by United States entities.","In the first quarter, we paid $79 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 13 million shares for a total of $240 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December of 2017, was $472 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of March was 492 million shares. Based on the first quarter results and our recent business trends, we are affirming our full-year financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin, earnings per share, and operating cash flow. We have maintained our constant currency revenue outlook at a low to mid-single digit increase, operating margin at approximately 20%, and earnings per share in a range of $1.58 to $1.70.","The GAAP revenue is now expected to be approximately $50 million higher than our initial outlook based on the recent strengthening of several currencies against the U.S. dollar. Compared to 2015 rates, we now expect currency to have a negative impact on revenues of approximately $200 million for the full year. This equates to a GAAP revenue change of 300 basis points lower than the constant currency increase, rather than the 400 basis points in the prior outlook.","The impact on operating profit from the increased revenue is expected to be partially offset by a reduction in hedge benefits, with hedge gains now projected at approximately $40 million compared to $50 million in the prior outlook. The new projection for total negative impact on operating profit from currency net of hedges is now approximately $90 million, a slight improvement from the approximately $100 million negative impact anticipated in our prior outlook.","Since the impact on EPS was relatively small and we are still early in the year, we did not change our EPS outlook. As exchange rates stabilize or move during the year, we will update our outlook accordingly.","So, to summarize, the first quarter results were solid, and we are on track for the year. Cash flow and the balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to return significant funds to shareholders.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, guys. I just saw that pricing was down 2%. It sounds like that's U.S. domestic pricing actions and also Argentina. Just thinking about going forward, what can we expect to going into quarter two and then throughout the year on the pricing actions?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Bryan. As you said, it was Argentina and we had last year, as you know, some U.S. domestic pricing; that's a little bit impact on that. But I see the pricing environment very stable. I don't see big changes here. Looking around the world, I think we have \u2013 our pricings are stable and I don't see big changes. And I'm quite confident that we're going to keep the pricing as we guided in the beginning of the year.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, if you exclude those two items, the pricing was flat in the quarter which is consistent with prior trends.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But going forward, the Argentina pricing will impact another three quarters. U.S. domestic pricing will anniversary this upcoming quarter. Just trying to (18:17).","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Argentina will continue to be in the pricing numbers. It's just \u2013 it's related to the devaluation that took place in December. And then, DMT pricing actions that we took last year were in April. So, that will start to anniversary.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And, Raj, just incremental technology expense that weighed on the margins, is there a way to think about that how much that was in total versus the year-ago period? And kind of thinking about that going forward versus some of the offsets from some of the restructuring and cost saves. Just to think about the operating margin and some of the puts and takes there.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Yeah. The operating margin was impacted by a few things. Technology was one of them and then we had some negative foreign exchange impact, and then we have some benefits from cost savings and timing of expenses as well. The technology expense, we said, when we came into the year that we expected to spend well over $50 million incrementally on technology. And that's on a base of a few hundred million dollars. So, if you just take that in each quarter, that's roughly the impact \u2013 some of the later quarters will start to go over, if you will. But in total, for the year, we see over $50 million of incremental spend on technology.","And then some of the cost savings, if you recall, we had \u2013 we took about $11 million of costs in the fourth quarter, and that's going to translate to a few million dollars of savings this year. And then we also are just managing the business very tightly and efficiently on the expense side, and we've also had some timing specific (19:49) expenses as well that helped us in the first quarter.","And so, the primary negative impact was around technology, which again for the year will be well over $50 million incrementally and then some of the negative foreign exchange impact.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just last question for me, Hikmet, just looking at the C2C line, it was at 1% constant currency revenue growth. Is there anything you can do to stimulate that line to get stronger growth going forward this year, or are you going to be \u2013 it's going to be dependent upon economies and what's going on in oil that is just going to keep that languishing as a growth rate? Thanks so much.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Bryan, I think our forecast didn't change as we gave it in the beginning of the year. I see \u2013 the answer is digital, digital, digital. Westernunion.com expansion, the answer is it's growing very strong. Actually, we had 25% transaction growth. And within that, within the digital is the mobile. 55% of our transactions in the U.S. are initiated by mobile phones. It's a little bit lower principal amount, with respect to a little bit \u2013 revenue per transaction, a little bit lower. But generally, that's the direction.","I'm also excited about the new social media partnership like Viber. Let's see where it goes. It's too early to tell that, but I believe that the digital is the \u2013 will begin growth on the C2C, and digital connection to 200 countries. Digital connection to retail locations, digital connection to our account payout network, which we are more than 1 billion accounts. That will come \u2013 growth that will accelerate over the few quarters, I believe.","On retail money transfer, I think that that will continue to be flattish. It will continue to be slow. And \u2013 but, it's \u2013 I think the team is doing a great job there also keeping the retail money transfer very strong. In fact, recently today I just saw the Mexico numbers came out and we are winning, I saw again, market share there. So, that's the thing.","But the global economy, the oil-producing countries like Russia, like Saudi Arabia has a little bit impact to our growth and that's \u2013 I would be cautious there. Other side, the Germany did very well. We didn't \u2013 even within the Gulf States, Europe (22:19) did well. I mean that's really differentiated country by country.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color. I'll pass the line.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","And our next question will come from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, guys. It looks like overall outside of the callouts you had on pricing in Argentina, et cetera, that pricing has been relatively stable in most cases in the last couple of quarters. The one thing I just noticed, though, and I want to ask about it is on the wu.com business looks like the transaction growth has held up in the mid-20%s but I think the revenue growth decelerated to more of a mid-teens growth rate. Is there anything maybe specifically that \u2013 I might \u2013 maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks, that's causing that?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think first of all, as you know, Darrin, it changes quarter by quarter, the revenue growth. But the main impact there is the mix and the mobile. As I mentioned earlier, the mobile is growing very fast, mobile transactions. And within the mobile transactions, the revenue per transaction is lower than in an online transaction. So people are using really strong mobile transactions, but the revenue per transaction has an impact to the revenue. So, that's the gap part. Over \u2013 it's also quarter-by-quarter. I believe that we planned to have a strong growth here also in revenue coming over. And the other thing is also we just launched on two new countries in Europe. We are now in 36 countries. Having the sending capability to 200 countries, so that will bring also. But the differentiation \u2013 answering directly to your question is, definitely the mix here.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So (23:57)...","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And just to add, Darrin, we had 55% of our transactions here in the U.S. initiated on a mobile device and so that's driving significant transaction growth in mobile channel.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So I mean the good news generally of mobile is that it'll come with more frequent transactors, right?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","In other words, the transactor will do (24:16).","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Well, it's a new customer base too. It's largely...","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...incremental opportunity for us, and so that's good. I mean we still had 25% transaction growth...","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...and we still expect very strong growth for the rest of this year as well.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So despite the lower revenue yield, it's actually coming with a more sticky and a better transaction growth rate is basically the way we should look at it.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Darrin, there are also new (24:39) cannibalizing our business as you know. There are new customers; we didn't have that.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up. And I asked this a couple of times before, but it's always impressive to me to see the growth rate of the C2B business. I know that again you talked a lot about what's happening and some of the market drivers, but just give us some color again on the sustainability into that growth rate on a constant currency basis.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Again, digital, digital, digital, with Speedpay growing very fast.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Our U.S. digital business on the payments are growing really good. That drives the growth. The other one is also Argentina. The Argentina transactions have been coming very well. It's a very sticky business. People are using with their barcodes going to the locations and using our Pago F\u00e1cil payments. It's a very sticky business. People like the convenience. It's fast and biller like the convenience also because they get the money immediately. And it's a win-win situation. And that has been a good business. However, saying that, Darrin, our retail business there has been slowing as you know. Not significantly slowing, but it's been on a slower growth, negative growth over the last quarters.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. In the U.S. retail business?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In the U.S. retail, yes.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, makes sense. Very quickly, Raj, on the tax rate, 15%, is that still a good number for the year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We said, mid-teens, Darrin. So, yeah, mid-teens is still a good number for the year. And in any given quarter, it's going to be up or down from that number. But mid-teens is a good number.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right, guys. Thanks very much.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Darrin.","Operator","And the next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America.","David J. Chu - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi. This is David Chu for Sara. You mentioned...","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, David.","David J. Chu - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi. You mentioned that timing of spend helped 1Q a bit. Can you just discuss this?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, that wasn't the biggest factor. It was really related to cost savings that we had from last year's actions and then we've just been managing other efficiency opportunities within the business. We had some timing of spend, but we also had other things that, like technology spend that were higher than we would have thought in the first quarter. So, it's sort of netted out to zero. That wasn't the primary driver of the margin impact this year \u2013 this quarter.","David J. Chu - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. And then, in regards to these oil-producing countries, I mean, do you expect trends to weaken in upcoming quarters because it seems like to-date you hadn't seen a major impact in Europe \u2013 it sounds like you're calling it out now when you hadn't in previous quarters.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. You got that, David. I mean, first of all, I always called Russia out, right? Remember, Russia was also and we have some \u2013 also oil-impacted issues like in Nigeria with the currency. But Saudi Arabia, for instance, still growing, but the pace of growth has been a little \u2013 slower than in previous quarters. Within the Gulf States, though, there are still countries growing very strong and I would say that the growth comes currently from U.S. outbound from Germany, from Europe, parts of Europe and our digital business has been performing very well.","And so it's going to continue. That's the beauty of being in 200 countries having that portfolio that we have. And just say it again, you know it anyway, but none of our countries out of the U.S. are bigger than 7% of our revenue, so which means that we have really a huge portfolio. Some of the countries which we call it out has less than 1% of the revenue. And so, it is \u2013 we see some impact, but I wouldn't say that it's major.","David J. Chu - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Actually a related question because everything else seem pretty stable or consistent. Just on the oil-dependent regions, what can you do to revive growth there? I mean, it sounds like pricing is not a tool you will use, anything else that's available to Western Union?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think \u2013 as you know, our business, sending and receiving, we just \u2013 for instance, in Russia or in Nigeria or all these countries, not only on the send countries, Tien-tsin, it's also on the receive countries we see something. We do inbound. We changed our marketing activities to inbound instead of outbound, and we really do some promotions about that, if the outbound export related oil-producing jobs get less. Besides that, obviously, it's an industry issue if there are less jobs about that, it's economical impact. But I would say that we called it out now. We see the first signs. I'm not sure if that's going to continue. It can turn around back again and I don't see a major issue but we called it out because we feel the first slowdowns. And Russia, we always called it out.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're going to continue to benefit with low oil prices in other parts of our business, as Hikmet mentioned earlier. And we continue to get really strong growth in the U.S. Germany was very strong for us again. The U.K. did well. In our dot-com business, we continue to see very strong opportunities there. So, these other areas will be an offset to some of these other softer areas.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. All part of the portfolio. So my only follow-up, maybe for you, Raj, is just you bought back a lot of stock, it looks like this quarter, which is great. It looks, at least mathematically, just over $400 million in cash left in the U.S. So do we need to expect that the buybacks to slow or do you have some other levers to pull to keep this pace up?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, Tien-tsin, we have about $470 million left on the authorization which goes through the end of next year. So the current \u2013 we have enough capacity to be able to buy for this year and next year and we have enough sources of cash and other capacity to be able to continue to buy back our stock.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Good to know. Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tien-tsin.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. How are you?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jason. How are you?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","How are you?","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Good. Good. I just want to ask a follow-up question on wu.com because I can appreciate the mix dynamics here. I'm just thinking about sort of rest of year and constant currency revenue growth potential of the business because I noticed the year-over-year comparisons on that metric are going to get tougher the rest of the year, and it probably wouldn't be surprising if the mobile mix continues to accelerate versus the 55% levels you saw in the U.S. this quarter just given the way consumer preferences are trending.","So, just so we've got the expectations teed up properly, I mean, this 18%-ish number we saw in Q1, is that a decent run rate or are we going to see some natural slump in the rest of the year because of the tougher comps and because of some potential acceleration of the mix shift to mobile within the wu.com channel?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Jason, you know me. It's more, more, more is better. Obviously, we want to grow faster. I think our plans are we want to grow revenue, accelerate the revenue growth, and we are working on that. Especially also, the expansion on the new global \u2013 new geographies will help that also because these are just starting the new geographies. Once the customer gets sticky, they started to get revenue also there, right?","And I believe that our plans are built on stronger growth definitely here also. And the mix is definitely something that the customer behavior is changing. But I believe also that we just launched in Italy a new mobile app. We have also in U.K., we upgraded our mobile app there. People are using more mobile, and they are more sticky and we are responding to the customer needs, and I think that will grow stronger.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then can you quantify on average how much lower the principal per transaction is on the mobile wu.com transactions versus the non-mobile?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I can't really \u2013 I mean I can try to quantify it for you, but it's not \u2013 I mean it's a little bit of a difference. I don't think we have the real data behind that, but it's enough to make a difference because of the significant growth that we are getting on mobile.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Right.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's probably $20, $30 difference, so it doesn't make a big difference on each transaction. But when you have such strong growth on each transaction, that's where it's making a difference on the overall picture. And I would just say that as we add new features, as we add new geographies, more channels, more bank funding, and more bank payout, all of these things are going to layer in more growth opportunity for us as we move forward.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And just last one for me, I know that FX volatility can have some impacts in your business, and FX vol was peaking last year; it's going to start to probably anniversary some of those peak-ish levels. I mean is that essentially what you've baked into the outlook for the year? Or how should we be thinking about that dynamic?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Yeah. Just \u2013 Jason, just on the actual difference in principal, it looks like it's about a $100 difference in principal. I was just trying to remember from memory between mobile and the web channel, just...","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...so you have that. And then, on the foreign exchange volatility, it doesn't really have a big impact to the overall business. It may have some impact in our B2B business in the short-term. And we \u2013 whatever we're seeing right now, we've generally tried to take into account in our outlook for the year.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That makes sense. Thank you, guys.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","And the next question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, Hikmet. Hi, Raj. How are you?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hello, Ashwin. How are you?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good. How are you, Ashwin?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I'm good. Thanks. A question on wu.com, is it possible to break that out in terms of how much of the growth is from adding new countries versus sort of a same-store type of growth where you already are? And also, from a geographical perspective, is it safe to say that the North America piece primarily benefited, given the same 50\/50 principal that you used in terms of splitting out revenue contribution?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Ashwin, on your 50\/50 question, I mean, are you asking why we did it or how does it fit into the (35:56)?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","You always do it, but that would imply that if more of your \u2013 I guess the question I'm asking is from a geographical perspective...","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","... (36:03) America-centric from an outbound perspective.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me give a shot on that \u2013 try to answer your question. Raj, feel free to jump in. But on the \u2013 most of the transaction \u2013 on the first part of your question, most of the transactions are generated in the countries where we've been longer, obviously, like the U.S., U.K., like the countries we've been \u2013 like Germany, we've been longer with our online services.","And the new countries, it takes a while to \u2013 when they come to at the portfolio. And it's a promotion part \u2013 it's the customer (36:38). So, most of the part \u2013 the majority of the transactions are definitely from the countries where we have been. And it's good also because it's more \u2013 we see also one phenomenon on the digital is that the customers use more often our services when they use online, when they want to register. They stay there and they use it. So, that's great news.","The second part of the question is on the 50\/50. It's basically the combining our efforts, marketing efforts and our branding efforts, our go-to market efforts together with the regions. As you know, we were very much focused with the digital. Do we have a good start-up with our $300 million revenue approximately a year? We are, I believe, the market leader in the digital pace and we are growing strong here.","And now, it's time to really \u2013 expanding that faster globally using our agent network. Within the agent network also, we are promoting our westernunion.com and combining our agent activities, regulatory activities in the regions with our dot-com digital business. That's the positive side. That's why we are putting that also on the region.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Understood. Sort of a follow-up on the tech expense. Raj, was your comment that tech expense got pulled forward. Was that what you're saying and the rest of the year is going to be a lower level or were you saying basically that you decided to now spend more on technology?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I \u2013 let me just restate. We're going to spend an incremental amount of money this year well over $50 million. The timing of that will vary by quarter as some of the spending started to ramp late last year. So, we may start to grow over some of that towards the end of the year. But that's really what I was trying to say.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And the incremental spending, I mean in the past, Raj, you had mentioned obviously investing in the core platform, investing in big data. What is this incremental investing for? Is it more \u2013 I mean I saw that you guys did a block-chain investment, but that seems more like a financing type of thing, but (39:04).","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The block-chain investment is a nominal investment. We make investments like that from time-to-time just to stay close to things that are happening in that space. But the technology spend, the incremental spend is really upgrading our legacy platforms, our settlement system, our data centers, and our core processing capability. And so, it upgrades those systems. It allows us to be more nimble in the market. It also allows us to be better fit to serve digital partners as we add them. And some of these are multi-year programs, right, so they're not going to be done in a one-year period. They're going to continue on for a couple of years. And so, that's really where the spending is geared towards.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. When you say multi-year, can you put a timeframe? I mean is it, say, middle of next year or...?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's just multi-year in nature. I mean some of these programs will go away at the end of next year or sometime next year. Others will continue on for a couple more years, so it's hard to say exactly when they're going to fall off. And we're going to continue to invest in our digital area too. So as we add new digital partners, we may launch new upgrades or new programs in that regard, so I don't see us fall off in spending in the technology side anytime soon.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, Raj \u2013 Ashwin, sorry \u2013 as you know that parts of that really finding efficiency for existing IT, parts of that is really investing in the new part on the digital environment and on really the WU Connect or also connecting the banks. If I connect part of the banks to our system and we see \u2013 as I was recently in China, really the ChinaPay connection to us needs some investment and examples like ChinaPay or examples like big banks connecting our systems (41:07) like Viber, social media connecting the system needs some upgrade and required some investment. That's the part of it, the innovation part of it.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Understood. Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ashwin.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","And the next question comes from Danyal Hussain of Morgan Stanley.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Hikmet and Raj.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","(41:31).","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Now that you have another quarter under your belt, can you give an update on how WU Connect partnerships are tracking versus your initial expectations? And at this point, do you have a better sense for how many of those transactions are incremental?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think it's too early to call, Danyal. It's still very small. But I'm very excited actually about the Viber. We just finished the beta test. The results are very good. Actually, the beta mode was last week and so we went to full market launch. Let's see how that works. It's too early to call from revenue and transaction side, but I'm excited about that. The other thing is also what I'm excited also we have some other partners in the pipeline. We are developing \u2013 that's a part of \u2013 as Ashwin asked the question earlier, that's a part of our also investments in the technology to be ready for the new partners also and maybe additional focus on that is required. So I'm not going to share with you the transaction numbers because it's too early to call. It's new use cases. But we'll see and hopefully when it comes, I can report then better news, good news here about our partners.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And the Treasury departments then pretty active in clamping down on inversion, Raj, but do any of their actions have implications for your working capital strategy potentially in the future?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","They should not. And these are not rules yet anyway. They're probably going to go through a lot of evolution before anything actually comes to market, but even in its current form, it should not have any impact to our working capital strategies or tax rate or what's been discussed recently.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","And the next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good evening.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey. How are you?","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good. Maybe, Raj, I wanted to ask you about the Business Solutions segment and maybe what type of revenue growth you think we need to \u2013 you need to see there to really start seeing improvement in the operating margin?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, as you saw that, we had some improvement in our margin side, but on the revenue side, we definitely want to see better revenue here. 6% we had \u2013 despite the global trade issues, despite the global economic issues, despite the currency volatility like in U.K. against other currencies, we did have a 6% growth in revenue terms. And I think that the global trade will help us once it gets picked up, new customers. But the other thing is also, our market share is quite low here, and we see an opportunity here to grow that on our market share. So, it is \u2013 definitely, growth will help to expand the margins, but the team is doing a good job. We even saw this quarter a margin expansion. Right, Raj?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean margins were up a little bit, 15.1% EBITDA margin versus 14.6% in the prior-year quarter. And then last year, Kartik, we improved margins to around 15% again on an EBITDA basis and that was higher than the 11% that we had in the prior year. So, revenue growth really is the key for us to be able to drive better profitability there. That business has relatively larger proportion of fixed costs than the rest of our company. But it's heading in the right direction at least from a margin standpoint.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And then just what pressures, if any, are you seeing from the other online money transfer companies that are out there, either from a pricing standpoint or any other competitive pressures that you might be witnessing from them?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, nothing different than the retail competitors, I would say. As you recall, Kartik, at our Investor Day, we had a chart representing the branded money transfer companies, digital companies, what our market share is, what we believe that their revenue is. So, I believe that given our fundamentals, given our global reach, we do have a quite good expansion. We are growing very fast. We are winning market share here. So, comparing with that, I think also there's still growth opportunities that we can capture growth opportunities with new customer segments, but also on the financial institutions. More and more financial institutions are looking at us, saying that can you process the transaction from the U.S. to Vietnam or from Germany to Peru? And all these things with our compliance programs, with our platforms, we can expand our opportunities here. So, I think we are gaining market share in the digital environment.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Kartik.","Operator","And next we have a question from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I appreciate it. A couple of actually housekeeping questions, I guess. One is on the cost of goods this quarter, I saw it was up as a percent of revenue year-on-year. You're obviously doing a nice job on SG&A. I just wonder if you could give a little color on sort of gross margin trends.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, on cost of goods, specifically, the two things that impacted \u2013 the reason why it's higher is that it's largely related to technology expense increase in the quarter, as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange. And then we had some offsets from cost savings. But those are the primary drivers there. Commission rates were relatively flat year-over-year in the quarter, and that continues to be the case and in line with our expectations. So it was really driven by these other factors.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. So, over time, you should see some gross margin expansion?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we'll be at around 20% overall margins this year, and that's still consistent with our outlook.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And with regard to cash flow from operations, noticed it was kind of flattish year-on-year, maybe some growth in other assets or working cap. Can you just elaborate a little bit on what's going on there?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, it's just a result of \u2013 I mean, we have lower net income, but then we have some positives in net working capital side. So, we're relatively flat overall. So, nothing special there going on in operating cash flow.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And would expect those trends to just sort of normalize as the year goes on.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, our outlook for cash flow \u2013 operating cash flow is around $1 billion, so it should follow a similar kind of pattern that we've had historically. So there's nothing really special there to call out.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then one last one, I know account-to-account is a pretty important growth thrust for Western Union. And I heard you mentioned it, Hikmet, can you talk a little bit about on how we might see account-to-account really kind of play out as a potential long-term revenue driver.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think there is opportunity. The reason I'm mentioning is that more financial institutions are also start to use our platform because of offering their customers capability on compliance, on technology, on settlement, on multi-currency payout.","So, walk in a small financial institution somewhere in the U.S. saying that I want to send money to Nigeria, we can able that, right. I mean, it's hard for them \u2013 others. So, they are using us as partners. And that goes \u2013 that starts to be more not only on the retail side being cash-in, start to be account-to-account. So, the funds in, coming from an account then going to an account somewhere in the world. Recently, we are seeing very strong growth in India. Westernunion.com transactions \u2013 billed transactions through an account is growing very well.","Or \u2013 and a recent example, there is very \u2013 you know it is our bKash model, and it's kind of mobile wallet in Bangladesh, which you can send, it's like you can see that there's an account where you can send money to a bKash account mobile wallet. That was a cooperation between BRAC Bank, MasterCard, and us, bKash together. So, I see there are growth opportunities for us to grow that. And our goal is \u2013 we have more than 1 billion accounts now globally; our goal is expanding that \u2013 also reaching out to new customers and being more in more countries with our account network.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Would you anticipate that we could think about that perhaps moving the needle at some point for Western Union in the back half of 2016 or 2017 or did it have a longer tail on it?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's early to call it. Probably, I'll give \u2013 I can give you more color next year about that. But I would say that I see it as a growth opportunity and I will leave it here for now because it's too early to give you a direction here.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And the next question comes from Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research.","Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP","Good afternoon, guys. I was hoping you could just help us think about the C2C transaction growth rate, broadly speaking, particularly in the quarter considering the extra day benefit or probably what is roughly a percentage point from leap year and just how you guys think about that metric going forward for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Matt. The transaction growth was 3%, which is consistent with the fourth quarter. The leap year probably helped us a little bit but we also had a negative impact from the Easter holiday which fell into the first quarter this year versus second quarter last year. So, there's probably some offset to that and that doesn't change our overall outlook for the year. We haven't given a transaction growth outlook for the year but our revenue growth is low to mid-single-digits. And it's just reflective of the things that we're seeing around the world. We have some pockets of strengths and some of pockets of weakness. And some of the differential that you saw between revenue growth and transaction growth in the first quarter was related to Argentina, where the transaction growth continued but revenue growth fell off a little bit. So, that's really what we're seeing.","Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And then the next question comes from Rayna Kumar of Evercore ISI.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","Good evening. Do you intend to bid for a Walmart cross-border contract now that Walmart has gone non-inclusive with MoneyGram?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, as you can imagine, I won't give any details on our negotiations or any potential partners or any market environment. Look, we've been doing that for years. We're going to expand our capabilities to get any partners within our terms, which has to be \u2013 fit in, in our strategy, which has to serve our customers. It could be Walmart, it could be someone else, but it has to fit in with our business strategy and within our guidance. That would be my answer.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","Okay. Got it. And one last follow-up. When will the board next meet to discuss an update to your dividend policy and what do you expect the board to decide?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, our board meets on a regular basis and I won't call out exactly when they discuss specific topics. But as you know, dividend payout for us is a key, important part of our overall capital return, Rayna. We're paying a \u2013 we have a payout ratio of in the high-30% range. We are paying back almost \u2013 or more than $300 million a year in dividends. So, it's going to continue to be a key important part of our overall capital return strategy.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Rayna.","Operator","And next, we have David Scharf from JMP.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, David.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Hey, first, I might have missed it, Raj, but I believe you made reference to a little bit of a benefit from expense timing in the quarter. What did that refer to, and should we expect that to show up in the second quarter?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, there is always going to be expense timing from year-to-year versus what we had planned for, so you'll see it sometime during this year. But our outlook for margins are around 20% and that has not changed for the full-year. So, there is some variability in timing of certain expenses and that's all I was referring to.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. It was nothing specific. Got it. Secondly, can you just remind me, of the roughly $1 billion of cash from ops, maybe around $830 million, $850 million of free cash flow, how much is generated in the U.S. in that forecast?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we generally have about 25% of our cash flow available to us in the U.S. through our normal repatriation that we do and about 75% outside the U.S.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. And that mix isn't expected to be any different this year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, it's going to vary a little bit year-to-year but that's the general mix.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. And just lastly, a bit of an open-ended question that will maybe put you in the spot a little, but you've obviously provided a lot of detail on your plans and the developments of wu.com mobile initiatives and the like. Just wondering, in your opinion right now as you look at the competitive landscape, what do you think is the most formidable new technology or offering out there in the industry that obviously \u2013 that Western Union doesn't own?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mobile, mobile, mobile, right? I mean the use case \u2013 the customers tell us that they want to use their mobile while they walk to an underground and send money to Mexico, or while they are sitting in a meeting they want to use their iPad and send money to England. So that's what we have to upgrade our mobile applications on their Android or on their Apple devices. I think that's something \u2013 and I believe that we are really seeing \u2013 looking at the numbers and comparing it with the competition and comparing with our prices, we are really leading the industry here.","And the team in San Francisco and my team is doing a good job. There will be always a competition on the \u2013 technical competition on the corridor by corridor. I recently was in Copenhagen at Money20\/20. There are a lot of FinTech companies coming with ideas, but nobody can really offer the end-to-end solution. No one of them can say that, okay, you can send money from 36 countries on many mobile apps to 200 countries and pick up the money in minutes and do the compliance and pay out in 131 currencies and to a good price. So that's definitely the technology. We are looking at it. That's definitely the way we are investing. That's definitely the way we are upgrading our technologies.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. It doesn't sound like any particular vendor out there springs to mind in terms of...","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't see it. I don't see it. I just was \u2013 I did, again, a market tour with my team, I don't see it yet there something. So we are \u2013 so it's not only the technology only, it's also the end-to-end process. As I said, it's the regulatory environment. It's a complex business. It's being a global, having the brands, all these things got together and packaging in a way that customer feels simple from sending money from a mobile phone to 200 countries.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Michael Alan Salop - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Laura, we'll take one more question?","Operator","All right. That final question will come from Alex Veytsman of Monness, Crespi, Hardt.","Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.","Yes. Hi, guys. A quick question on North America. Could you discuss the trend you expect for the rest of the year? It looks like Q1 was strong driven by Mexico and Latin America. Could you expect similar outbound trends to continue?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right. North America, we've seen \u2013 I mean, this has continued from last year, we've seen good trends to Mexico and to Latin America. And then the DMT business, we saw a flat revenue growth. The North American business by all indications should continue to perform well. I can't give you a specific number, but we continue to see good growth in the North American market at least for this year.","Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.","Sounds good.

Our first quarter results are largely consistent with our expectations and have provided signs that we are making progress against our key strategies. As we outlined last quarter, we expect 2013 to be a transitional year as we make pricing adjustment and other investment to enhance our competitive position and drive future growth.","We are focused on 3 main strategies in 2013: strengthening our Consumer Money Transfer business; driving growth in customers and usage in business-to-business; and generating and deploying strong cash flow for our shareholders. So far, results are in line with the expected impact of the initiatives, although we are also being impacted by some compliance and regulatory-related actions in various parts of the world.","In Consumer Money Transfer, our experience shows that price reductions lead to revenue declines in the initial 12 months and revenue increases thereafter. Early transaction results indicate our strategic pricing actions are working as planned, and we feel positive about the results.","For example, in November of last year, we implemented the U.S. to Mexico pricing change. Banco de Mexico recently reported there is a softening in the Mexico remittance market in early 2013. However, our Western Union brand transaction growth has accelerated from a 2% increase in the fourth quarter of last year to 9% in the first quarter.","We are also seeing very good results on our Africa inbound pricing actions and recently started to see improvement from Latin American and Caribbean pricing as awareness is beginning to spread.","The westernunion.com online pricing actions are yielding very strong results, and overall, westernunion.com Money Transfer transaction growth accelerated from 46% in the fourth quarter of last year to 60% in the first quarter.","As of end of the quarter, we had initiated about 75% of the planned pricing investment for the year, and overall, we are meeting our transaction objectives. Entering the first quarter, we had completed about 50% of the planned pricing investment. In the quarter, transaction in these priced corridors increased in the low teens. Excluding the digital pricing actions, transactions in this quarter increased in the mid-single digit, up from flattish prior to the pricings.","So just to state again, our pricing actions are working as planned so far. Our overall Consumer-to-Consumer transaction growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by the Vigo location closing last year, softness in some markets and other compliance-related actions.","I should note that in addition to the Southwest Border, we have been implementing compliance and fraud prevention enhancements in various other countries, and we are continuing to expand them. These actions have impacted our results, but we are committed to best-in-class programs and we believe, over the long term, enhancements in these areas will be beneficial for our business and customers. Aside from pricing and compliance actions, we made progress in many other activities designed to strengthen Consumer Money Transfer. We are expecting our -- we are expanding our global network.","As the regional leadership teams around the world are now reporting directly to me, we have further increased our emphasis on aggressively adding new points of presence. I just visited Mexico last week and saw that we are starting to gain traction, rebuilding our agent network there.","We recently signed several new agents, including financial institutions such as Bancoppel and Banorte, as well as nonfinancial national retailers. Combined, these signings will give us over 10,000 additional agent locations in Mexico once they're fully implemented, which means doubling our network in the country. We also recently signed Carrefour, a major retail chain in Argentina for both money transfer and bill payments, and we also will soon be adding Alexandria Bank in Egypt, which nearly triple our location network in this country. In addition, in the U.S., we completed multiyear renewal agreements with Safeway, adding bill payments and money orders to our existing money transfer service and with Pay-O-Matic also.","We are seeing money transfer services are now available for bank customers at over 103,000 ATMs, and we continue to add access through mobile phones. We now have 19 active mobile phone partners. And mobile apps access to westernunion.com is available in the U.S. and Australia. We continue to explore new ways to leverage our network and assets to provide more services.","For example, I recently visited Haiti, where we are adding a new type of service allowing government social payments to be distributed to Haitian parents, students and senior citizens through Western Union agent locations across the country. And we are further expanding capabilities at our electronic channels, which had 18% revenue growth in the quarter.","westernunion.com is acquiring customers at a fast rate, as evidenced by 60% increase in money transfer transactions in the quarter. Even our U.S. originated online transactions increased over 70%. We are consistently seeing over 80% of first-time online customers being new to Western Union, meaning new online customers in the past 12 months had not used our brand in the prior 12 months. This gives us confidence that our online channel is not significantly impacting our traditional retail business. Many capabilities are being rolled out, which should further aid our online growth, including new platforms, new mobile apps, direct-to-bank payouts, more funding options, new countries and more robust risk management tools. These features help drive customer acquisition and conversion, and we expect westernunion.com transaction and revenue growth rates to accelerate as we move forward.","Our electronic account-based Money Transfer transaction through banks increased 45% in the quarter. We now have almost 70 banks active with the service, including most recently, Bank of Montreal in Canada.","Overall, we expect Consumer Money Transfer trends to improve each quarter throughout the rest of the year. This growth should be driven by completion of our pricing actions, increased traction from the actions, added capabilities in online and agent location expansion. We continue to expect our Western Union brand C2C transaction to increase mid- to high-single digits for the full year with good momentum in the second half.","Our second key strategic initiative for 2013 is to drive growth in customers and usage in business-to-business. I am pleased to report that Western Union Business Solutions revenue increased 7% in the first quarter. Although global trade growth is still restrained, our business improved as we benefited from enhanced go-to-market processes. The quarter's growth was driven by incremental hedging activity from customers and the addition of the French Travelex business, which we completed in the second quarter of last year.","While Travelex integration continues, we now have a strong business team in place focused on driving new sales and retention. We continue to introduce new products and services, such as a new cash management dashboard tool for SMEs, new NGO and university-focused services and currency options in the U.K. And we plan to add new markets this year as well. There are still many actions to be executed in Business Solutions and quarterly results may vary, but we feel we have started to gain some momentum with our teams and sales processes and still believe this is a great long-term opportunity for Western Union.","Our third strategic initiative for 2013 is to generate strong cash flow and deploy it for our shareholders, a key part of our commitment to deliver increased shareholder value over the long term. In the first quarter we generated $237 million of cash flow from operating activities and returned $260 million to shareholders. This consisted of $100 million -- $190 million of share repurchases and $70 million of dividends. We expect to generate $900 million of operating cash flow for the year, with $700 million returned to shareholders. This represents returning to shareholders over 8% of the current market capitalization.","Overall, we are on track to meet the full year financial outlook we provided in February. We expected the first half of the year to be challenging due to impact of the pricing actions and other investments and initiatives. As these actions take hold, we are beginning to see positive trends develop, and we believe transaction and revenue growth rates will improve as we move through 2013.","In the second quarter, we will complete our planned pricing investment and continue to market our actions. We will also execute against our many growth drivers in online money transfer at strategic agent location and implement the Business Solutions strategies to add customers and usage.","Since we are uniquely positioned to be in 200 countries, we have a view of the mix indicators of the global economy and global regulatory environment. This makes me believe the 2013 environment will be challenging, like last year, but I remain confident that the actions we are taking will lead to return to revenue and profit growth in 2014. We believe we will exit 2013 with strong momentum, and we look forward to reporting on our progress throughout the rest of the year.","Now to give you a more detailed review of the financial results for the quarter, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott T. Scheirman","Thank you, Hikmet. As mentioned, our strategic actions are tracking to our overall objectives, and we have affirmed our full year financial outlook for 2013.","In the first quarter, we reported total consolidated revenue of $1.3 billion, which was down 5% compared with the year-ago quarter or 4% on a constant currency basis. As expected, the revenue decline was driven by the C2C segment as a result of the price reduction in compliance-related changes.","Business Solutions delivered a solid quarter with 7% revenue growth. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue decreased 7%, primarily due to the price reductions. The C2C revenue decline also included negative 1% impact from currency and a negative 2% impact from the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, which are still being impacted by the compliance-related changes from last year. We will face negative comparisons for Vigo and Orlandi Valuta until we anniversary those actions in the middle of the third quarter.","Western Union branded transactions increased 2% in the quarter, although overall transactions declined 2%. Year-over-year comparisons in the quarter were challenging as we had relatively strong transaction growth of 7% in the first quarter a year ago.","As Hikmet mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we are making on the pricing actions. Total transactions in the corridors where we initiated price reductions prior to the beginning of the first quarter increased in the low teens in the quarter. Excluding digital, transaction in these corridors increased in the mid-single digits, and we expect trends to accelerate as we build awareness. In the first quarter, the transaction growth benefit from the price reductions was partially offset by the impact of compliance-related actions and some general softness in certain markets.","In addition to the Southwest Border change that's affecting Vigo and Orlandi Valuta, we continue to invest in and enhance our anti-money laundering compliance and fraud prevention practices in the U.S. and other markets around the world. These actions include enhanced procedures around areas such as real-time risk assessment, customer callback and verification programs and other fraud prevention activities.","Overall, C2C cross-border principal declined 3% in the quarter with no impact from currency, while Western Union branded cross-border principal increased 1%. Total principal per transaction declined 1%.","Global agent locations increased to 515,000 as of the end of the quarter. Increasing the expansion of our points of presence going forward is an important part of our strategy to provide more choice and convenience to our consumers.","The spread between C2C transaction and revenue declines in the quarter was 5 percentage points, including a negative 1% impact from currency. For C2C, the impact of net price decreases was approximately 6% in the quarter, while mix had a positive impact of approximately 2%.","Turning to the regions. C2C revenue in the Europe and CIS region, which represented 21% of total company revenue, decreased 6% year-over-year with no impact from currency. Transactions in the region were down 1% compared with the year-ago quarter. Germany continues to grow, and pricing actions from Europe to Africa are working well. But Southern Europe and Russia remain challenged, and business was also impacted by some compliance-related actions in the U.K. and Spain.","North America revenue declined 15% from the prior year, while transactions were down 7%. The region represented 19% of total company revenue. The transaction decline in North America is primarily driven by the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, where revenue was also impacted by price reductions and declines in higher principal sends in U.S. domestic money transfer. Domestic money transfer revenue was down 2% on transaction growth of 5% in the quarter. Although we continue to see growth in the low principal bands of domestic money transfer, from a revenue perspective, this is offset by declines in high principal bands.","Mexico revenue declined 32% and transactions decreased 16% in the quarter, as expected. The revenue decline was driven by the compliance-related reduction in Vigo and Orlandi Valuta locations last year and by pricing investments. For the Western Union brand, Mexico revenue declined 20%, while transactions increased 9% in the first quarter. The Western Union brand is growing faster than the market, which declined slightly in the first 2 months of the year according to Banco de Mexico data, and our pricing actions are providing the lift in transactions we expected.","Revenue in the Middle East and Africa region was flat compared to the year-ago quarter with no impact from currency, while transactions grew 4%.","Asia Pacific region revenue was down 5% in the quarter with no impact from currency translation on flat transactions.","The Latin America and Caribbean region revenue declined 7%, including a negative 3% impact from currency. Transactions declined 10% in the quarter. Trends in the region were negatively impacted primarily by Vigo declines and further limitations we placed on our business in Argentina to manage currency exposure.","westernunion.com C2C revenue increased 13% on a reported basis with no impact from currency. Transaction growth accelerated significantly to 60% as customer acquisition continues to be driven by new capabilities and marketing, customer conversion improvements and pricing investments to enhance the value proposition. Total electronic channels revenue, which includes westernunion.com, account-based Money Transfer through banks and mobile, increased 18% in the quarter. Electronic channels represented 4% of total company revenue, up from 3% of revenue in the year-ago period.","In addition to the strong growth from westernunion.com, transactions from account-based Money Transfer through banks increased 45%. Prepaid revenue, including third-party reload, was flat in the quarter. Our prepaid cards were available at approximately 44,000 retail locations globally at the end of the quarter, including approximately 2,500 locations outside the U.S. And we continue to explore new avenues and partnership models to introduce our cards around the world.","Moving to the Consumer-to-Business segment. Transaction trends were similar to the fourth quarter. Revenue declined 1% in the quarter, including a negative 4% impact from currency translation. Continued growth from South America and the U.S. electronic business was offset by declines in the U.S. cash walk-in business and some lower pricings as a result of pass-throughs to customers of Durbin-related savings.","Business Solutions revenue increased 7% compared to the first quarter a year ago with no impact from currency translation. Business Solution services are now available in 31 countries, with China being the most recent addition.","Turning to the consolidated margins. The first quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 22.4% compared to 23.9% in the prior year period. Compared to last year's first quarter, the margin was negatively impacted, as expected, by the pricing-driven revenue declines, as well as increased compliance costs and strategic investments, primarily in Digital. These impacts were partially offset by improvements in Business Solutions profitability. We continue to expect the full year operating margin to be approximately 20%, which is lower than the first quarter due to the timing of expenses around cost-savings initiatives and other investments.","There were approximately $4 million in expenses related to cost-savings initiatives in the quarter, while the full year projection remains around $45 million. EBITDA margin was 27.1% compared to 28.4% a year ago. Reported earnings per share in the quarter was $0.37 compared to $0.40 from the prior year.","The C2C operating segment margin was 25.4% compared to 27.7% in the same period last year. The margin was impacted in the quarter primarily by pricing-driven revenue declines, digital and other strategic investments and increased compliance costs.","The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 24.7% compared to 26.5% in the prior year period. The margin was negatively impacted by Durbin pass-throughs and mix compared to the year-ago quarter. Business Solutions operating loss improved to $6 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $15 million in the year-ago period. The current quarter was positively impacted by revenue growth, cost synergies and lower Travelex integration expense.","The first quarter $6 million loss includes $15 million of depreciation and amortization and $4 million of Travelex integration expense. Depreciation and amortization in last year's first quarter was $15 million, while integration expense was $6 million.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million, while capital expenditures were $38 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.7 billion and cash of $1.4 billion. Approximately 40% of the cash was held by United States entities. As a reminder, we have approximately $100 million of remaining tax payments related to the IRS agreement announced in late 2011, which we expect to pay in the second half of 2013.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 13 million shares at an average price of $14.30, totaling $190 million. In addition, we paid $70 million of dividends. In March, we also paid off $300 million of floating rate notes when they matured. As of quarter end, we have 559 million shares outstanding and $200 million remaining under the repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2013. As a reminder, we expect to generate approximately $900 million of cash flow from operations this year or approximately $1 million excluding the IRS agreement payments.","Turning to our expectations for the full year. We are affirming our outlook that we provided in February. As we stated, we expect 2013 to be a transitional year as we implement our strategic actions, and we are making progress. We continue to expect transaction revenue growth to improve sequentially through the year as the pricing and other actions take effect and we drive the business towards our objectives of revenue and profit growth in 2014 and beyond.","Laura, we are now ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Hikmet, I heard you mention compliance and regulatory actions a few times. Anything new that wasn't contemplated before? I heard U.K. and Spain, I think. Any other countries that are new that are putting in some changes around remittances? And can you size maybe at a high level what the impact was on transactions, if possible?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, let me give you an overview and maybe I can give it also to Scott and he can be more in detail. But we, as a leading company of -- Western Union, are very committed to compliance, and we see that as a long-term competitive advantage. We do have some short-term adaption on our rules and changing the rules in some countries. It is no secret that the financial service overall gets more regulated. And within that also, we want to be best in class. We create this culture of compliance within our company. And we -- so that's the environment we are in currently, and we see that as a long-term competitive advantage. But we did have some impact in our business like Vigo. Maybe, Scott, you can give a little bit of color?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, Tien-Tsin. let me give you a little bit of color. And as Hikmet said, that we're committed to a strong culture of compliance and invest in compliance programs. And let me give you a flavor of maybe some things that have been ongoing, not only in the first quarter but prior quarters, too. We're doing things that really protect the customer and protect the business. It might be things such as real-time risk assessment when the transaction happens at the point-of-sale, verification programs related to high principal transactions whereby we call back the sender and make sure the transaction is appropriate. But as Hikmet mentioned, we believe this will be a long-term competitive advantage for us. Near term, there are some headwinds, but it's the right investment to make in the business. We believe it will be a competitive advantage. And we continue to work towards that. As far as specific models or specific countries, we did mention the U.K. and Spain. Another one I might highlight is Venezuela, where we had to do some things to reenroll or reregister our customers, and we're largely through that in the middle of March -- were, in the middle of March from that standpoint. But we will continue to comply with the letter of the spirit of the law and really see that as a competitive advantage long term.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay, that makes sense. And just to be clear, these are broader sort of changes that apply to remittances? Or are they changes tied more towards broader payments, if you will? I'm just trying to understand how specific or narrow some of these rule changes are.","Hikmet Ersek","I think it's general, Tien-Tsin. If you look at the regulatory, it starts with consumer protection, which we are very focused on that. It's not only remittances, it's just general. In the U.S., you are more familiar, is the Dodd-Frank issues, also the compliance issues. But also internationally, it's more on the compliance but also consumer protection activity, plus also the regulatory environment, right? I mean, we are fortunate that we are licensed in 200 countries. And so we are working very close to expand our relationship and adopting the regulatory environment. And it's not only in the U.S., it's globally. Everywhere, it's getting more -- all in financial service that general trends to more regulated.","Scott T. Scheirman","Tien-Tsin, everything isn't necessarily black and white in a rule, but we work with regulators in countries around world to try to do the right thing for our business and for our customers.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood, understood, and that's good to know. Just quickly, just B2B, obviously, up 7. That was a pleasant surprise. We think C2B margin also improved a lot. Curious if both of those metrics are sustainable given what you saw in the first quarter.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think we are very focused. The team is working on the sales and the team is very -- we have a new process. The integration process is still going on, but we are in much better environment. The team is very focused on sales. And I would generally say that quarters may vary depending on the FX rates, everything. But generally, we are on the good path. I'm optimistic that it's a long-term good growth opportunity for Western Union.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, Tien-Tsin, I would just add. Compared to 2012, we expect the revenue growth and the margin of the profitability profile of this business unit to improve. And long term, we expect this business to grow revenue in the low double digits. We only have a 2% share today.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, no, glad to hear, glad to hear. Lastly, I promise, just buybacks, dividends going forward, given your U.S. cash situation. I mean, can you drive your future buybacks and dividends from operating cash flow? Or do you -- are you going to have to tap into the debt markets to do that or borrow to do that?","Hikmet Ersek","Scott, maybe you can jump in. But first of all, we are very committed and glad to see that our strategies are working and we are performing against our strategies. As you know, Tien-Tsin, we are constantly, Scott and I, talking about our capital allocation and we are looking at -- we are constantly talking with the board. And we are very committed on our long-term shareholder value. And Scott?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. What I'd add, Tien-Tsin, is that in the fourth quarter, we did buy back about the $350 million of stock. In the first quarter, $190 million. And in 2013, we've been very public about that we'll return about $700 million to our shareholders, roughly $400 million through buyback and $300 million through dividends. It now represents about 8% of our market cap. So pretty healthy return of capital. Specifically, coming back to your question, we do generate -- excluding the IRS payment, we'll make this year about $1 billion of cash flows. Now about roughly 3\/4 of that is international, about 25% is U.S. So we do have cash flows from the U.S. that can fund buybacks. But we also have some room on our balance sheet. We're going to continue to target investment-grade credit rating. But we'll continue to have some room there as we think about it. But as Hikmet mentioned, we'll continue to talk with our management team and have periodic discussions with our board. But we have had a rich history of returning capital to our shareholders. We've got a franchise that does generate very strong cash flows.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, it's a percent of market cap, that's right.","Operator","And our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You seem to have been showing some good early traction with regard to the pricing changes and elasticity around it. Can you give us a sense, first, how much of the price changes relative to your goal of the 25% of revenue change has actually been completed? And then really as a follow-up to that is how much have you actually marketed around it? In other words, while the changes could have occurred, is there a lot more to go in terms of awareness for your customers?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, Tien-Tsin, if you look at our pricing actions, we are very pleased what happened currently. We implemented about 50% of the pricing actions, which are fully in the market -- starting to execute it. We are marketing it. And still, we started to have 75 initiatives -- 75% of our pricing actions, and more to come in Q2. We are looking by corridor by corridor. We are -- understand the customer needs. And I think the pricing action we put in place are working in high teens. And so I'm very pleased with the actions we're having in the place. And I think they are looking corridor by corridor. And as we outlined in the fourth quarter, we started to do that and it's working. And the learnings are -- we did hundreds of them, and these are the big ones. And we are focused on the issues and they are paying back.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. And I would just add, Hikmet, we did start the first quarter with only about 50% of the pricing actions implemented. By the time we got to the end of the first quarter, about 75%. And those pricing actions that we just put in place in the fourth quarter drove low-teens transaction growth. And so we continue to see more traction being built, more awareness being built. We'll continue to push more behind the marketing programs. And we expect those pricing actions to gain momentum and accelerate as we move through the quarters.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. Do you believe that the 25% number you originally quoted is still on tack? In other words, is it still just 25% of the business? Or is there any more than that now?","Hikmet Ersek","No, I think it's the 25%. We do it. We affirmed also the 2013 numbers. As you know they're in and I believe we're going to have a strong growth here, transactions growth, as projected Q1 numbers looks like very good. I mean, the rest of the corridor is business as usual. As you know, we do hundreds of them. We have 16,000 corridors globally. And our teams on the field are looking on that. So I don't see any additional pricing action -- investment than we said in last quarter from today's point of view.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just one quick follow-up, and then I'll turn it back to the queue. But on the online business, have there been any more -- how substantial are the pricing changes online? And have there been any promotions going on, let's call it, like 1 month free for a certain corridor, something along those lines? And if so, I mean, is that -- how long is that? Is that a way to just operate the business because once you gain customers online, they stay, they're sticky and they stay with you?","Hikmet Ersek","Absolutely, Darrin. You are absolutely hitting the right point here. First of all, it's all about customer acquisition. We have 100 -- last year, we had $150 million revenue business. And I think we are expanding very fast. The strong growth on the transactions is the customer acquisition. And we see, once customers begin with us, they use us more. And we are still on track with our $500 million 2015 goal in revenue. And I think it's a great business. I think the team is doing a great job. I mean, even in the U.S. -- even in U.S., we are growing 70% transaction-wise. Globally, we are growing -- westernunion.com is growing 60%. So that's great numbers.","Operator","And our next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I know we talked about, this year, pricing for the C2C business to be down 6% to 7%. Now that you've gone through a lot of the pricing actions and are 75% through, does that look like the right number? Do you think it'll be -- does it have to be more than that? Or is that right on track to be what -- you're getting what you expected?","Scott T. Scheirman","Bryan, it's tracking well to our expectations. Our pricing initiatives to improve our consumer value proposition are working. So as we communicated about 90 days ago, it's about 5% of our total company revenue, $300 million, or to your point, 6% to 7% of our C2C revenue from that standpoint. So we're seeing good progress in Mexico, from Europe to Africa, in the digital business. And again, I would say pricing is just one driver of how we're going to grow the business. We're going to add more locations. We're going to expand westernunion.com. We're going to evolve our product offerings so we can drop funds in the bank accounts and so forth. But what we feel like is the pricing we set is in the right range. And then longer term, we feel like we're going to be in that 1% to 3% range as we turn the calendar to 2014.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. I just want to add on that, Scott. Bryan, as you know the business very well, its pricing is not the only thing we do. I'm very pleased with our expansion policy also on the network. I mean, we have more than 600,000 touch points if you exclude -- include also ATMs here. And recent signings, 10,000 additional locations are coming in Mexico. And that's doubling our Mexico network. Also, Egypt is a huge signing and Carrefour in Argentina. I think these are big signings coming and also more to expect to come. The teams are focused, and that will give us also the expansion and getting -- gaining more transactions.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. No, that's good to hear. And then just, Hikmet, it sounds like we've troughed in the transaction growth numbers. You expect them to improve in the second quarter and then improve especially in the back half of the year. Just your confidence level. I know that I've asked that question before, but I think it's key to see the transition. Are you -- how confident are you that the transaction numbers will start to turn? Because you've had a full quarter, well, at least a partial, a pretty good sized quarter to see the pricing actions take place. But the key to the story now is going to be to see the transaction numbers get better and that the first quarter was the trough.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I'm glad you're asking that question, Bryan. I am very confident about that. And the transaction -- we -- don't forget, as I mentioned earlier, only 50% of the pricing actions has been implemented in the market and 75% just started to be activated. And the early signings are very, very much looking very positive that -- as you know, usually, after 12 months, the revenue also picks back and comes back. One of the biggest we did that 3 years ago at DMT pricing actions and it came back revenue. I am very confident that 2014 and '15 will be a great growth years on revenues.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Last question for me. I guess, Scott, just when you're talking about some of these compliance changes, I know that's been going on throughout the world over the last probably couple of years, almost. But I noticed the guidance didn't change. So it doesn't seem like there's any change in the guidance due to kind of that ongoing kind of regulatory compliance issues that are out there.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, Bryan, you're right. We reaffirmed our guidance today. And again, the regulatory environment continues to evolve and change. And it's based upon what we know today as we reaffirm our guidance and so forth. But our goal is to comply with the letter and spirit of the law, have best-in-class compliance programs and really protect our customers and protect our businesses. Near term, it has been a little bit of a headwind. But we think that longer term, it will put us in a better competitive position.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Do you think those comps get easier in 2014 for those -- on a year-over-year basis for those compliance and regulatory charges?","Hikmet Ersek","Bryan, I think the general financial service industry is getting more regulated, and we are very focused on that. I think we have a great compliance team in place, and they are working hard. Generally, I see also being a market leader here as a competitive advantage. It's one of our investments. We don't see that as a cost or something, it's our investment to protect our customers and protect the company brand. I believe that's going to be a competitive advantage long term.","Operator","And the next question is from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Have you seen any pricing reaction from competitors at this point? And do you have any sense where you're beginning to see the traction in transactions? Do you have any sense of where you're taking share from?","Hikmet Ersek","Sara, generally, as you know, we have competition always. And as you know, this business is so complex. In 200 countries, we always have corridor specialists. Competition is always there. But on the big thing and the actions, where we've put in place, we did not see big competition reaction here yet. And we feel confident that we're going to gain market share there and we are going to transfer -- have more transactions. We see good pricing actions on U.S. to Mexico. We see U.S. to also Latin America corridors. And we do see Europe to Africa. And especially, our online transactions are growing very well. I mean, as I said, 60% growth in westernunion.com, 45% growth in electronic money transfer, account-based money transfer. These are good numbers. So where we put pricing and where we also expanded our network availability. I mean, you have to -- especially in dotcom, it also needs the physical location to send money. And that's -- you can send money from 23 countries to 200 countries via Western Union in minutes. So that's a big competitive advantage.","Scott T. Scheirman","And the color I would add, Sara, is where have we taken market share. I'll give you a couple of data points. But Mexico, it's early days. But when you look at the first quarter, we grew at 9% with our brand, and Banco de Mexico reported the market for January and February had been down a couple of points. So we're gaining share there. When you think about Digital, Digital being up 60%. We know the electronic market's growing a little bit faster than the other market, but growing 60%, we're clearly taking share. And 80% of those customers are new to the franchise.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then separately, do you have any sense of how long it will take to get reported transaction growth in Mexico to turn positive as you benefit from the lower pricing?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I mean, in Mexico business, in total, we have also Vigo and Orlandi Valuta, which would impact our transactions. And that's -- as you know, we believe that, that will take a few quarters to overcome that. But on the westernunion.com -- Western Union branded transactions, I believe that we are going to continue to grow our transactions. And our revenue will usually catch up about 12 to 18 months. And so that will be approximately the timing, right, Scott?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, yes. What I'd say on the transactions, if you will, the Western Union brand is already positive. It's growing 9% in the first quarter. And then the key thing we have to do, Sara, is we have to anniversary the Vigo and OV compliance issues we had in the third quarter of '12, where we took down 7,000 locations. So if you will, think about the fourth quarter for total company and transactions growing.","Operator","And our next question is from David Togut of Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Could you quantify the actual physical agent locations at the end of the March quarter and how much they were up or down year-over-year?","Hikmet Ersek","We had 515,000 locations, and we added 20,000.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, compared to a year ago, we had 495,000. So we're up about 20,000 locations in the last past year, if you will. I think what's important is not only the locations that we've added, David, but we've got some rich pipeline, whether it's the bank in Egypt or in Mexico, where we're going to bring probably within a year, bring on another 10,000 locations online. We've got a good pipeline with signings, too.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. And then sticking to agents for a minute, can you quantify for us the increases in agent commission rates that you started to institute 1 quarter or 2 ago?","Hikmet Ersek","As you know our business, David, it depends on the year and quarterly agent renewals, right? Generally, not every agent renewal is in 1 year. It's spread over the years. It depends on the year. We had some increase on the CapEx this year due to agent signing bonuses. But generally, I would say that we are very focused on the agent commission and on our cost of services. I believe long term, we believe it will go down. And it's a win-win situation, right, David? I think -- but long term, we are very focused also to look at our variable costs.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Would you expect agent commissions to go up this year as a percentage of revenue?","Scott T. Scheirman","David, we are somewhat, if you will -- from our Q1 remarks, agent commissions did not impact the margins in the first quarter. So they were flat, if you will. We did renegotiate some agreements, primarily in the U.S., to really increase our competitive position. So we do expect that to pick up somewhat. But as we reaffirmed our guidance and in having approximately 20% margins, it's all baked in there.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","A quick final question on capital allocation, Scott. When does the board next take up the future dividend policy?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. Well, let me first talk about our philosophy and then -- and specifically to the board. But our goal is to have a balanced payout between buyback and dividend. And our goal with the dividend is to grow the dividend consistent with our business performance. And with that said, we did a large dividend increase in October, about 6, 7 months ago. And Hikmet and I periodically have discussions. We have 4, 5 board meetings a year. So we periodically have discussions with our board. And we'll continue to allocate our capital to invest in our business but also to get cash back to our shareholders. So it's probably worth repeating that our goal is to grow the dividend consistent with the business performance.","Hikmet Ersek","I think it's 3.5% currently with...","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, it's about 3.5% yield on the current stock price.","Operator","And our next question is from James Friedman of Susquehanna.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Scott, you had mentioned some of the new capabilities on wu.com. wu.com transactions accelerated, on my math, about -- was that 60% from 40%? Could you elaborate on what the source of some of the transaction volume acceleration might be?","Scott T. Scheirman","Sure. We're very pleased with that business. In fact, Hikmet and I were in San Francisco last week, and the business team continues to perform really well there. So we're very excited. But there's a number of things that are driving it. One, I would say our pricing actions are helpful, that we have a strong consumer value proposition. We've also enhanced the website, if you will. So if you have an opportunity to use it from a consumer standpoint, the flow, the pages are better. It's more intuitive. We're also giving our customers -- we're not fully implemented yet, but giving our customers more options of how to pay in or pay out from a cash standpoint. And we continue to get more sophisticated from a risk management standpoint. So all of those things are helpful. It's hard to point to any one thing in particular. But all of those things are helpful. And we'll continue -- the good news is there is even more progress that we can make behind those. And that gives us confidence of being at a $500 million business top line in 2015. And I've said it, but it's worth repeating, that 80% of the customers are new. So we're attracting new customers into the franchise.","Hikmet Ersek","One thing I would like add on that also, don't forget that we are in 23 countries, currently originating westernunion.com transaction to 200 countries. As we speak, James, the team -- we just came from San Francisco. We just got back. The team is expanding new countries -- to new countries, and that will also gain -- have even a stronger transaction growth long term.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","With regard to the $500 million target in 2015, I was just wondering, what happens then?","Scott T. Scheirman","Well, we want to grow further from there. That's just -- in my view, just the starting point is $500 million. We know the electronic market is growing a little bit faster than the other markets. We're growing at 60%. But again, we think there's a lot of opportunity to grow there, that we're seeing new customers come in. We can leverage our brand, leverage our global footprint. And where we're excited is we want to offer more payment capabilities such as a same-day ACH, we're not there. Or being able to drop money into a bank account around the globe. So the $500 million is just a data point, 2015, but we've got aspirations to grow well on that.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. I think it also reminds me on the retail Money Transfer. As we build the retail Money Transfer, we expanded country by country by country. And as we do the retail Money Transfer expansion, the same goes with the westernunion.com expansion. And combining these 2 things, I think it's a huge opportunity also for the future.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Last thing for me, with regard to the new Mexico affiliates, this is encouraging to see you investing in that market again. I was just wondering, are those arrangements exclusive? And if that's not the appropriate question then, could you talk about who you may have taken those relationships from?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, as you know, parts of them -- I can't go into details, but parts of them are we have good, strong -- let me leave it there. We have good, strong relationship. More to come on that, more in detail. For competitive reasons, I don't want to talk about the details of the agreement. But I'm very confident that we did the right steps. We worked very hard. And I personally was there last week, and I'm very confident that we are -- you're going to see more growth coming from Mexico.","Operator","And our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Phil Stiller on for Ashwin. I guess I wanted to first ask about the margins, which were better than we expected. Scott, how much of that was due to timing of some of the onetime investments you were planning to make in the quarter versus kind of sustainable actions in terms of simplifying the business over time? And how should we think about the progression of the onetime costs as we move through the year?","Scott T. Scheirman","Sure. Phil, it was really -- it was primarily timing, if you will, of some of our investments but also our cost savings initiatives, the cost related to those. So as you recall from the call, we did reaffirm the full year EPS and the approximate 20% margins, if you will. Our cost savings programs are tracking well. In fact, we expect to spend about $45 million in 2013. And Phil, I'd have you think probably more so in the second and third quarter, where you'll see a lot of that being spent with our actions. That will generate about $30 million of savings in 2013, and importantly, if not more importantly, about $45 million in savings in 2014. So we're tracking well there.","Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is that $45 million number different than what you've said in February? I thought we had $65 million.","Scott T. Scheirman","No. Let me give you the color. The $45 million is the same. We also will incur $20 million of Travelex integration expenses in 2013. We don't expect that $20 million to repeat in 2014. That's probably where you came up with the $65 million.","Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood, okay. On the -- going back to the transaction trends. Do you guys have any data that would be helpful in terms of understanding the momentum through the quarter, either by month or what you've seen through April so far, so we could get a sense of how the pricing actions are gaining traction?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. Probably as you know, Phil, consistent with our past practices, because of calendar impact and other things, we don't necessarily talk about any given month or the month that we're in as we release earnings. But what we've seen through the first quarter, through April, clearly gives us confidence, early indications that our plans are working. We're seeing those markets we priced in the fourth quarter with high-teens -- or I'm sorry, low-teens transaction growth. And we reaffirmed our guidance today. So we're tracking well to our expectations on the plan with pricing.","Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then last question on the buyback. I mean, you did a lot in the first quarter. Should we expect it to be a little more ratable as we move through the course of this year? And what was the share count at the end of the quarter?","Scott T. Scheirman","As far as the buyback, we did buy back 350 million in the fourth quarter, 200 million -- or 190 million in the first quarter. We have 200 million remaining. So we will take a number of things into consideration as far as uses of our capital, other factors from that standpoint. Hikmet and I continue to have dialogue with our board around buyback and capital deployment. So we'll continue to deploy the capital. We think given where the stock price is at, it's a good investment, if you will. To your question on how many shares were outstanding, we have 559 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter.","Operator","And our next question is from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the principal transaction account and principal mix, can you just talk a little bit about what drove that, the slight dip there on the principal? I think you guys you mentioned something on the call. I might have missed it upfront.","Scott T. Scheirman","You're looking at principal per transaction? Is that what you're asking, Julio?","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes, yes, sorry.","Scott T. Scheirman","It was down 1%, although when you look at the last 3 or 4 quarters, that's an improvement where it was down 3%, down 2%. So some of the pricing actions that we've done, we've seen some new customers enter the high principal bands. And so we've seen some -- in certain quarters, some uplift with the higher principal bands, but that is actually trending a little bit more favorable compared to what it was the last 2 or 3 quarters.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then looking at the percentage of revenues. I think you guys disclosed a eChannels versus a wu.com segment. What's the difference between those 2? Like what other revenue contributors would be in the eChannels versus the wu.com revenues?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. In the eChannels, it's 4% of revenue. If you just look at westernunion.com, it's 3%. So the simple delta is account-based Money Transfer. That business was up 45% in the first quarter. But it represents about 1% of our revenues. So westernunion.com is 3%, account-based is 1%, gives you the 4%.","Hikmet Ersek","4%, yes. Electronic Money Transfer, Julio, as you recall.","Scott T. Scheirman","Through the bank, over on the online banking platforms.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just lastly, profitability on Business Solutions. Is there a target for the year when you guys expect to see that turn profitable again?","Scott T. Scheirman","Well, we're pleased with where we've been. If you just take the first quarter EBITDA and if you exclude integration costs, the margins were up 14%. Comparable period a year ago, the margin was 8%. So we've made good progress. Our goal in that business is to improve the profitability in 2013 compared to 2012. And longer term, as we've mentioned, we believe this business can grow in the low double digits and can have EBITDA margins comparable to the company. So we'll kind of take it one quarter at a time. But we do like the revenue growth we saw. We like the profitability improvement. And we think it's a very leverageable business model from a scale standpoint.","Operator","And our final question today will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up question on wu.com. As we think about 2014 and 2015, as you guys march towards the $500 million target, which is encouraging to hear you reiterate that, are you assuming stable pricing, more or less, for wu.com beyond 2013 as part of that $500 million target?","Hikmet Ersek","As you know, Jason -- thank you for asking the question. I think that's a great question. We are currently only on 4,500 corridors with our westernunion.com. As we expand to the corridors, we always adapt our pricing corridor by corridor, as you know, and that may change. But I would say that generally, we have the right pricing now that attracts so many transactions. And I know that the customer, once they join us, they use us much more often. So I believe that the pricing strategy is in the right moment. And as we expand to new countries, we will adapt our pricing to the countries. And I think it's, long term, a profitable business. Especially -- today, we are using the credit card payments mostly. And once we also adapt our payments via comp payments, we have also lower interchange fee. And on the send side, we don't have the agent commission. So I think it's -- long term, it's a very, very profitable, very great business.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, the reason I asked, just thinking ahead about the pricing, obviously, the gap is huge right now between revenue and transaction growth because of the price cuts. And I know you had a tough comparison on revenue growth here in Q1. It just -- it seems like even if you accelerate the full year revenue growth in wu.com this year to, I don't know, call it 25% or so, from 13% in Q1. I think you still need a CAGR north of about 60% over 2014 and 2015 to get to the $500 million bogey. But it sounds like a lot of that growth, you would expect to come not necessarily from just more transactions and revenue in the existing markets, but as you had alluded to earlier, just expanding wu.com to a lot more countries. That's clearly part of the story here?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, Jason, yes, you're absolutely right. I think by expanding -- and I think we have a roadmap, and we are checking this monthly and daily against our $500 million goal. And we are reconfirming the goal of $500 million again.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one for me. I think in the past, you've made some general comments that Western Union carries approximately a 20% or so price premium to the competition. And obviously, that varies by corridor. But curious kind of how that figure looks after all of the current price cuts are implemented. And would that current or new premium be more or less sustainable over the longer term based on how you see the market right now?","Hikmet Ersek","I think yes, we deserve a premium because of -- given our global reach, given our quality, given the protecting the customer brand. I think our brand deserves a premium. And don't forget that we don't do everywhere-pricing, right. In certain corridors where we have to adjust the numbers. And I believe that we deserve a premium price and that it's going to continue.","Michael A. Salop","Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us for the call today. And have a good afternoon. We'll talk to you soon.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, EVP, Chief Financial Officer in Global Operations, will discuss 2012 second quarter results.

We remain focused on delivering on our vision to become the premier financial service provider for the underserved under the globe -- around the globe, as we outlined at our recent investors day in May. Our foundation is strong, with a solid core business in consumer money transfer and significant competitive strength, such as our agent network, our high brand awareness with the underserved around the world, our global compliance capabilities and our global organization and resources.","We have the right strategies in place to capitalize on these strengths and drive accelerated growth over the long term by focusing on expanding our network and increasing consumer retention in Global Consumer Financial Services; expanding penetration and adding new services in Business Solutions; and developing and growing new services for the underserved in Ventures.","Investments we have made in Business Solutions and Ventures are providing us diversified revenue streams. And as we accelerate growth over the long term, we expect to drive margin expansion. We also continue to focus on generating strong cash flow and deploying it for our shareholders.","In 2012, we remain on track for the revenue, earnings per share and cash flow outlook we provided at the beginning of the year despite economic challenges.","In the second quarter, our consumer money transfer business, which represented over 80% of revenues, continued to deliver solid results, We can see constant currency revenue increased 3%, with consistent year-over-year operating margins. There were some very strong large markets, such as Germany, Saudi Arabia and India, that helped offset economic softness in southern Europe and expected challenges in Mexico and Russia.","westernunion.com online money transfer also continued to deliver strong growth. Interestingly, we are seeing some changes in consumer movements developing from the economic situation is southern Europe. Portugal, which was historically being primarily a send market, is now almost even split between inbound and outbound. Although Greece is still primarily an outbound market, the inbound business increased significantly and represented almost 30% of the country's mix through the first half of the year.","Through our global network and local market expertise, we are very well positioned to react quickly to these changes in patterns. We are also making more progress ramping up our agent location expansion, including some key retailers in Europe, such as Lottomatica, in terms of locations, one of the largest retailers in Italy.","We now have approximately 510,000 agent locations globally, but there are also an additional 50,000 money transfer touch points throughout ATMs and other transaction-capable spots. It is a great base to achieve our long-term goal of 1 million touch points. Our access to consumers is even higher when you consider the millions of account holders that can utilize our services throughout online banking and mobile phones.","We have agreed to add account-based money transfers with large banks in India and China, and we will continue to expand our services to offer even more convenience and choice to our consumers. Our account-based money transfer momentum remained strong, with revenue growth of 34% in the quarter.","Turning to Business Solutions. Pro forma constant currency revenue growth was the same as the first quarter at 4%. Although we have tempered our 2012 expectation for this business, primarily due to the impact of slowdowns in global trade, we have not changed our long-term outlook.","B2B business development remained strong, as we recently signed new partners, such as ICICI Bank, through which we will transact international student tuition payments from India on behalf of our university customers; and IBInvestor in the U.S., a global business incubator for media companies. We also expanded Business Solutions to its 26th active country by partnering with our agent in Chile.","We continue to believe we will obtain double -- low double-digit revenue growth in B2B over the next several years as the global expansion and new customer acquisition become more material components of our business.","In Ventures, westernunion.com continues to deliver strong growth while we invest in new capabilities. We are piloting new strategies and pricing actions to drive customer acquisition, upgrading platforms to increase functionality and improve the consumer experience and building highly skilled team at our new San Francisco office.","There will continue to be enhancements to our services throughout the year, which will position us well for the future growth. There's also major activity in our stored value business. Our U.S. prepaid card distribution will be getting a boost from the signings of retailers, such as Dollar General, which will add thousands of locations over the next several quarters. And our global expansion continues as we'll shortly be launching special receiver-focused prepaid cards in the Philippines. We are building a solid foundation for stored value, and these recent actions are major steps to drive growth in the future.","Finally, we continue to deploy our capital for shareholders, buying back over $160 million of stock and paying over $60 million in dividends in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have now returned over $430 million to shareholders through our buyback and dividends and plan to continue to pursue strong deployments throughout the year.","So our core business is sound, and our cash generation is strong. We are executing against our strategic plans and look forward to advancing them further to accelerate our growth over the long term.","Now to give you a more detailed review of the quarter, I would like to turn the call over to Scott.","Scott T. Scheirman","Thank you, Hikmet. Overall for the quarter, we reported consolidated revenue growth of 4% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency. Consolidated pro forma revenue increased 2% constant currency, including Travelex Global Business Payments in the prior year period. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, reported revenue was flat with the prior year period on transaction growth of 4%. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 3% in the quarter.","Second quarter constant currency growth rates were below first quarter trends, primarily due to some additional economic softness in southern Europe and the expected challenges in Russia and Mexico. We had slightly lower growth in the U.S. Global distribution of our portfolio helped stabilize us against isolated regional dynamics, and strong growth in countries such as Germany, Saudi Arabia and India helped drive overall growth.","B2C cross-border principal declined 2% in the quarter, but increased 1% on a constant currency basis. B2C principal per transaction declined 6% year-over-year, with 3% on a constant currency basis, which was consistent with the first quarter.","Turning to the regions. C2C revenue in the Europe and CIS region, which represented 22% of consolidated revenues, decreased 8% year-over-year. This decline included a negative 5% impact from currency translation.","Russia is generally tracking to our outlook, as it will take 2012 to implement our turnaround strategies, including building a retail network. Germany  continued strong growth, while other large markets, such as the U.K. and France had been stable. Economic conditions in southern Europe have led to further declines in Italy and Spain.","Turning to North America. Revenue was flat with the prior year period on 2% transaction growth, and the region represented 21% of total company revenue. U.S. outbound revenue increased, although not as strong as the first quarter, while domestic money transfer revenue grew 4% on transaction growth of 7% in the quarter.","Domestic $5 for $50 continues to have strong growth even compared to very high growth rates in the prior year. Some of the higher-tier bands did not increase as fast, and we are implementing new marketing programs to drive further growth. Mexico revenue declined 7% and transactions decreased 5% in the quarter.","As you recall, we anticipated revenue declines and share losses in Mexico this year, as we implement changes to our compliance-related practices and business model.","Results were strong in the Middle East and Africa region. Revenue in the quarter increased 3%, including a negative 3% impact from currency. Transactions grew 9%. Saudi Arabia and much of Africa were key drivers of the growth.","The Asia Pacific region revenue grew 4%, including a negative 2% impact from currency translation. Aside from the currency impact, trends were consistent with the first quarter. India contributed strong growth, while the revenue decline in China moderated from the first quarter rate.","The Latin America and Caribbean region reported strong results, again, in the quarter. Revenue grew 5%, including a negative 2% impact from currency and improved slightly relative to the first quarter growth rate.","westernunion.com C2C revenue increased 23%, including a 4% negative impact from currency translation. We introduced some fee promotions in certain corridors in the quarter to attract new customers, which negatively impacted revenue in the short term, but should aid future growth. westernunion.com transaction growth was a very healthy 35% in the quarter. As a reminder, westernunion.com results are not included in the growth rates for the other 5 regions, although they are included when we discuss specific country trends.","Total electronic channel revenue, which includes westernunion.com, as well as account-based money transfer and mobile, increased 26% in the quarter and represented 3% of total company revenue. westernunion.com C2C revenue increased 23% in the quarter, and revenue from account-based money transfer through banks increased 34%. We now have nearly 100 banks signed for account-based money transfer, with 47 launched. We also have nearly 30 mobile network contracts, with 13 actively operating.","Prepaid revenue increased 6% in the quarter. And total prepaid, including third-party top-up, represented just under 1% of company revenue. We expect prepaid revenue growth to increase in the second half of the year, as we benefit from greatly expanded distribution in the U.S. and some of the international introductions.","We will roll out our cards to Dollar General's 10,000 locations, as well as adding Fred's general merchandise stores. We're also continuing to ramp up distribution at the 7-Eleven convenience stores. The prepaid cards were available at approximately 22,000 retail locations globally, including over 21,000 locations in the U.S. at the end of the quarter, and the new agreements will represent a significant step-up in our distribution.","Turning back to the total C2C business. Spread between transaction revenue growth in the quarter was 1 percentage point, excluding the impact from currency, which negatively impacted the spread by 3 points. The impact of net price decreases was approximately 1% in the second quarter, while mix was neutral.","Moving to the Consumer-to-Business segment. Revenue decreased 3% in the quarter and was flat on a constant currency basis. South American business continues to grow, while the U.S. revenue is still stabilizing, but was affected by business mix and the passing through of some of the debit fees savings related to Durbin  in the quarter.","Business Solutions reported revenue of $92 million in the quarter, which compared to $31 million a year ago. On a pro forma basis, including TGBP results in the prior year, Business Solutions revenue increased 4% on a constant currency basis, which was consistent with the first quarter. We are below our revenue plan in Business Solutions and have lowered our full year outlook to mid-single digits revenue growth. Although our transaction growth in the quarter was low-double digits, our principal per transaction was down, which is consistent with economic slowdowns in key markets.","In the near term, Business Solutions results are largely driven by the amount of principal existing customer sends. Over time, the new customer acquisition and geographic expansion will become more meaningful parts of the growth. When integration is completed and the new customer business grows, we remain confident Business Solutions can deliver revenue growth in low-double digits over the next several years.","Turning to consolidated margins. Second quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 24.3% compared to 25.7% in the prior year. Excluding $14 million of Travelex integration expenses, consolidated margin was 25.3% compared to 26.3%, excluding $9 million of restructuring expense in the prior year period.  Operating margin of 25.3%, excluding TGBP integration expense, is an increase from 24.3% in the first quarter. EBITDA margin, excluding integration expense, was 29.3% compared to 29.7%, excluding restructuring expenses in the second quarter of last year.","Consumer-to-consumer operating margin was relatively flat compared to prior year. Consolidated margins declined primarily due to the incremental $10 million of depreciation and amortization in Business Solutions.  Consolidated margin was also negatively impacted by investments in westernunion.com and additional compliance costs, mostly related to the Southwest Border. These impacts were partially offset by benefits from currency, lower bank fees related to Durbin, fuel costs in the prior year, restructuring savings and lower marketing expense.","We realized approximately $18 million in restructuring savings in this year's second quarter compared to $13 million of savings in the prior year period. As we mentioned at our May 9 investor day, implementation of the Dodd-Frank Consumer Financial Protection Bureau remittance disclosure rules is going to add some expense in 2012 that is incremental to our previous outlook. We have completed detailed implementation plans to prepare our systems, call centers and entire agent location network in the U.S. for adoption of these rules by early 2013.","We expect incremental expense of approximately $15 million in 2012 to cover the requirements for our consumer money transfer, bill payments, Ventures and Business Solutions businesses. These costs include expedited implementation of enhancements to our point-of-sale system at many U.S. agent locations, training for the agents, IT development, call center costs for new error resolution procedures, expenses related to the creation and distribution of new receipt forms. We'll have some small onetime cost to complete implementation in early 2013, that we estimate at around $5 million to $10 million of ongoing annual cost related primarily to call center time and additional forms.","We have also adjusted our full year 2012 outlook for operating margins to reflect higher spending for other compliance costs, primarily relating to the Southwest Border agreement. We're working on dozens of projects around enhanced risk controls and have continued to evolve. We have increased our projected spend in 2012 primarily for IT development and higher personnel costs.","We expect global spending on compliance activities over the next couple of years will not change significantly from the 2012 levels. While the breadth and complexity of requirements and sustainability around the globe continues to expand, we view our ability to adapt to this environment as a long-term competitive advantage.","Turning back to the second quarter. Other income and expense of $36 million of expense increased $17 million from last year, as the 2011 period included a $29 million gain on the remeasurement of our equity position in Angelo Costa.","Tax rate in the quarter was 12.5%, which compares to 21.1% in the second quarter of last year. Decrease in our tax rate is primarily due to the resolution of the treatment of our international operations, as we noted in the announcement of our agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service last December. In addition, in the current quarter, we had a non-reoccurring benefit related to favorable resolution of certain foreign and U.S. tax positions. For the full year, we now expect a tax rate of between 15% and 16%, which is lower than the previous outlook due to the non-reoccurring benefit in the current quarter.","Earnings per share in the quarter are $0.44 compared to $0.41 in the prior year. EPS was $0.46 excluding Travelex integration expenses, which compared to $0.42, excluding restructuring charges in the prior year. The prior year EPS included a gain of $0.03 related to the Angelo Costa remeasurements. Excluding integration expense in the current quarter and restructuring expenses in the prior year period, earnings per share increased 10%.","C2C operating segment margin was 28.5% compared to 28.6% in the same period last year and an improvement from 27.7% in the first quarter. Compared to prior year, the margin benefited from currency, lower average commission rates and lower marketing, but these benefits were offset primarily by higher compliance costs, Costa and Finint acquisition-related costs and investments in westernunion.com.","Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 22.4% in the quarter compared to 24.6% in the prior year period. Margin decreased primarily due to geographic and product mix and some higher bank fees, partially offset by decreased debit fees related to Durbin.","Business Solutions reported operating loss of $15 million for the quarter compared to an operating loss of $2 million in the prior year period. Last year's loss does not include Travelex Global Business Payments. This quarter's $15 million loss includes $15 million of depreciation and amortization, with $14 million of Travelex integration expense. There is approximately $1 million that is included in both amortization and integration expense.","Depreciation and amortization in last year's second quarter was $5 million. We continue to expect Business Solutions profitability, excluding integration expenses, to improve throughout the second half of the year, as we benefit from better revenue leverage and initial cost savings from synergies.","Turning to our cash flow and our balance sheet. We continue to have a strong position. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $446 million, which include the impact of approximately $100 million of tax payments relating to the agreement with the IRS. We currently do not expect to make additional payments related to this agreement until 2013.","Capital expenditures in the quarter were $46 million or 3% of revenue. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be 4% to 5% of revenue for the full year due to increased signing bonuses on some major agent contract renewals and new signings, as well as investments in technology. We expect capital expenditures to return to approximately 3% of revenue on average after 2012, although any given year could be impacted by additional new agent signings or other initiatives.","Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $59 million in the quarter. At quarter end, the company had debt of $3.7 billion and cash of $1.4 billion. Approximately half of the cash was in the United States. We continue our strong capital deployment policies. We repurchased approximately 10 million shares, totaling $163 million in the second quarter at an average price of $16.87. This represents approximately 1.5% of the total shares outstanding.","In addition, we paid out $61 million in dividends during the quarter. As of June 30, our shares outstanding were 604 million shares, and we had approximately $305 million remaining in our existing repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2012. We remain committed to continuing with strong return of funds to shareholders during the remainder of the year and beyond.","Turning to our outlook for the full year. We are affirming the revenue outlook provided on April 24. We are reducing our operating margin outlook due to the incremental compliance costs, and we are slightly increasing the earnings per share outlook, primarily to reflect the non-reoccurring tax benefit recorded in the second quarter. We have also increased the operating cash flow outlook due to the timing of tax payments.","For the company overall, we are maintaining our revenue outlook, which includes: 6% to 8% constant currency revenue growth, including a 4% benefit from the full year inclusion of Travelex; and GAAP revenue growth 2% lower than constant currency.","Turning to margins. We have adjusted our operating margin ranges for 2012 due to the increased compliance-related costs relative to our original outlook. The incremental cost include the $15 million related to Dodd-Frank and additional spending primarily related to the Southwest Border. The current outlook for margins is approximately 24.5% for GAAP or 25.5% excluding the Travelex integration costs.","The outlook for EBITDA margins, excluding integration, is consistent with our previous outlook, at approximately 30%. We are now projecting an effective tax rate of 15% to 16% for the year, down 1% from the previous outlook due to the non-reoccurring benefit recorded in the second quarter.","The high end of our earnings per share outlook has been increased by $0.02 compared to our previous outlook, as we have also -- and we have also narrowed the range, although our operating margin outlook is lower, which is being offset by the lower tax rate and slightly lower expenses in other income and expense.","Our assumptions for share repurchases have not changed. Our updated earnings per share outlook is GAAP EPS in the range of $1.68 to $1.72, which compares to $1.65 to $1.70 in the previous outlook; EPS, excluding Travelex integration expense, of $1.73 to $1.77, which compares to $1.70 to $1.75 previously.","Our outlook for cash flow from operations has increased by $100 million due to the timing of the estimated tax payments related to the December 2011 agreement with the IRS. The new outlook is a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, including payments of $100 million that have already been made relating to the IRS agreements. There are approximately $90 million in tax payments related to this agreement that remain to be paid, but we expect to pay the majority of those in 2013. Excluding these tax payments, our 2012 outlook for cash flow from operations remains consistent with the prior outlook of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.","Overall, we're on track to deliver our financial outlook despite the expected macro and other challenges and higher compliance costs as our diversified portfolio allows us to produce stable results and generate and deploy strong cash flow.","Operator, we are now ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tien-Tsing Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just want to -- I guess, first on Business Solutions. The lower guidance isn't a surprise, but I'm curious. Is it all macro-related? Or did you see some challenges in your sales efforts as well? I'm just trying to better understand if improved distribution in loan can get you to double-digit growth next year if the macro situation stays the same. So that's why I want to parse those 2 together -- or parse those 2 out.","Hikmet Ersek","Tien-Tsin, this is Hikmet. Mainly -- it's mainly driven by the global trade. Our existing customers revenue in some parts of the world has been -- especially in the U.S. and some parts of western Europe, has been depending on the existing customer. It has been lower, and that's because of the global trade slowness. We do have new acquisitions. We do have new clients. As I mentioned before, ICICI Bank and the universities in the U.S. and also, IBInvestor kind of -- and we also opened a new country. As you recall, we started after the -- about 8 months ago, 10 months ago, we had 16 countries. Now we are in 26 countries in the Western Union Business Solutions. And the new revenue take some time, it comes. And our aim is expanding on to new countries. But I would say that's mainly driven by global trade has impacted our B2B business.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then the compliance cost moving up. Do you think this will eventually apply to some of your smaller peers as well and perhaps ease some of the competition, especially in pricing, going forward?","Hikmet Ersek","I think, Tien-Tsin, it's upgrading our compliance. And as you know, we are very focused here, and we are very serious. It's a competitive advantage long term. I think we are investing heavily here to be really -- I think as an industry leader, we are setting the tone here. And I think we are very focused here, and I see that as a -- definitely a competitive advantage.","Operator","Next question comes from Glenn Fodor of Morgan Stanley.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just to follow up on Tien-Tsin's question on B2B. I mean, just on the whole market share issue. I mean, people, I believe, are expecting you guys to offset any macro weakness with share gains. So just straight up, I mean, do you think you're winning share yet? And if not yet, when do you expect this to happen?","Hikmet Ersek","I believe we are gaining share. We are getting new customers. We are really gaining share. I think in some parts where we had the existing customers, as I mentioned before, we had some global trade issues. But generally, we are expanding and we are gaining share. I just want to repeat again. We have only 2% market share globally, and it can go only up. And the team is very focused to signing new sales efforts. I think, Glenn, we are definitely on the road gaining share.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, on a normalized basis, excluding integration costs, it looks like you made some progress, by our calculations, in the operating margin in B2B from 1Q to 2Q. So can this trajectory continue even without an acceleration of the top line over the near term, just coming from synergies and cost optimization?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. Yes, Glenn. If you look at the first quarter compared to second quarter, if you just look at the EBITDA margins, excluding integration, EBITDA margins in the first quarter were about 8%. In the second quarter, they're about 15%. So they almost doubled it, if you will. And we did have some earlier upfront spending. We're beginning to see synergies. But it's a very leverageable business model. So as we bring the 2 businesses together to pick the best technology, the best products, get the talent aligned and go to market, we believe, over the years to come, this business can have EBITDA margins somewhere in the 30% range. And as we move through the year and move into 2013, we continue to expect to make progress. As we exit '13, we do believe we'll be on a run rate of about $30 million of expense synergies. So we want to continue to drive those margins north and believe we can.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This $30 million, just to be clear, expense synergies with overall company or within the B2B segment?","Scott T. Scheirman","Glenn, just within B2B. Within B2B, we see about $30 million of expense synergies, on a run rate, as we exit 2013.","Operator","Next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A little more color maybe on North America, Mexico and some of the troubled regions on some of the trends that you saw there. I mean, I think, you outperformed what you thought in the first quarter. You certainly had pointed towards trouble in Mexico in the second quarter. What were -- I mean, could you go over again the growth rates in North America, Mexico and what you expect over the next several quarters?","Hikmet Ersek","Sure. Let me start with some color -- more color on North America, Bob. I think, the Mexico business, North America outbound to Mexico business has beating our expectations. We were expecting some slowdown due to our -- some changes we implemented in the Southwest Border area. And don't forget that it's about 25% of our revenue is from the South -- from the U.S. outbound to Mexico is coming from the Southwest Border area, 25%. So it has slowed down. We've put some higher restrictions there. We put some higher requirement for the customer. And I think, it impacted, short term, our business. Long term, we believe that we're going to be upgrading, and we're going to set some industry standards here. That has been from Mexico. Our DMT business in the U.S. is still growing well. Don't forget, we started about 2 years ago. Our pricing $5 for $50 has been growing over the years and still growing pretty well. And I think DMT has been a very strong business for us in the U.S. You want to add something?","Scott T. Scheirman","The only thing I would add that the third component of the North America business is U.S. outbound. And it continued to experience growth in the second quarter, not quite as strong as the first quarter, but it was still growing. And just to reiterate, with Mexico, it's really what we expected to have some challenges in 2012. As we work through evolving the business model and so forth, we believe that'll put us in a much more stronger position on a long-term basis with Mexico.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","If I could just follow up on westernunion.com and the prepaid business. I mean, prepaid only growing 6%. I just like a little more color on that. It seems like the industry is growing much faster, obviously. And then on westernunion.com, the gap between transactions and revenue growth, do you expect that to continue?","Hikmet Ersek","Let me start with westernunion.com maybe. So our target, $500 million in 2015, is still on. We are currently about $150 million business, and we would like to have that at $500 million business in 2015. So we are in plan. We're are  growing transactions about 35%. We did some fee promotions in Q2, which, gained new customers, and we've been very happy with the results in westernunion.com. So I'm very confident that the team is doing the right thing to grow that business -- continue to grow that business. That's the gap. Mainly the gap is between -- due to price promotions we have implemented in Q2. On the prepaid side, we -- don't forget, we have been quite limited on our expansion in the past, and now we are starting to get new retailers. We have about 21,000 retailers in the U.S. We added Dollar General. I believe it's going to be -- have a huge impact. It's our customer segment that is looking for kind of -- retail segment that's looking of kind of customer segment. I believe that will help us to grow the prepaid business also. You want to add something?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, the only thing I would add, in the second quarter specifically, is we did do some incentives, and those incentives impacted the revenue line on prepaid. So it was the 6% growth. We do expect, to Hikmet's point, stronger growth in the second half of the year and adding Dollar General, Fred's, spin up of 7-Eleven stores and then just some of the international markets, we're in Germany, U.K. Austria, we think, all of those things will be helpful to grow that business a little bit stronger as we move through the year with prepaid. But it's a nice opportunity because it's 1% of our revenue and globally, can leverage our brand, our distribution network and the hundreds of millions of customers we see every year. So it's -- near term, it won't be as meaningful. But long-term, it is a nice opportunity for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Hikmet, in a slowing economy, does Western Union have an advantage in maybe signing new agents or renegotiating agreements with them? As you look at the last recession we had, anything you can take from that, that if we do go through another slowing that you could have some advantages?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I think, Kartik, our target signing new agents has not changed. If you look at that, we are at 510,000 locations. And we just have signed another 150 people on the sales force, on the market. And day-to-day, they are signing new agents, and we have been very actively purchasing that. I think I'm very confident that we're going to sign new agents. And definitely, in some environment it helps. Signing new agents means also adding new transactions. And we also -- besides that, we also added to going to new customer segment, about 50,000 ATMs globally. And if you go to Intesa Sanpaolo in Italy or if you go to 7-Eleven bank in Japan, the people are doing transaction via their ATMs. They use the ATMs to put their money transfer numbers, send or receive the money from that. So I believe I'm going to continue to, Kartik, look, to sign new agents.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then are you seeing any trends in the business maybe leading trends that would give you a look at maybe what's happening with the economy, something you saw last time the economy slowed? Anything in the trends that gives you concern?","Hikmet Ersek","No, I think the environment is tough out there, right? It has not been changed since our Q1. I think it's a tough environment. Southern Europe is definitely slowing down. We can see in our numbers. I would say the parts of the business are still holding pretty well. Germany, northern countries -- northern European countries, are holding. I mean, it's not that the major change happened since Q1 and Q2, but it's tough out there. And we are -- we believe that we are gaining market share by expanding our -- long term, I would say, we will gain market share by expanding our network. But it's tough there. I think the economy is not strong as that to help our business, right?","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last question, Hikmet. What do you see the impact on the industry from all these new regulatory and compliance issues in terms of consolidation or pricing? What do you think the overall impact will be on the industry?","Hikmet Ersek","I believe, Kartik, that industry will upgrade -- has to upgrade their -- adapt their -- to the regulatory requirements. As the industry leader, obviously, we are very active here, upgrading, investing heavily on that. I think the industry has to follow that. While I can't make any comments to the competition, but I believe overall industry has to upgrade their requirements and adapt their requirements to the regulatory environment. Don't forget, we are in 200 countries. And every country has requirements, and some countries are more visible, some countries less. But we are adapting constantly to our regulatory environment.","Operator","Next question comes from Tom McCrohan of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just circling back to the guidance questions. Again, given the macro headwinds, the slowdown in global trade and other challenges that are impacting the core consumer business, you still kept your full year revenue guidance unchanged. I'm wondering if there were some offsets that were not -- that you can call out as far as other areas of the business that were exceeding expectations. Or maybe just kind of add some other comments around why you kept the revenue guidance unchanged given those factors.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, Tom, thanks for the question on this. Overall, if you look at the C2C business, it's 80% of our revenues, and that's had good, solid, consistent performance on a year-to-date basis. You're seeing growth. They're very strong there at the 4% range. So we're at the higher end just on a year-to-date basis. westernunion.com continues to grow well. We've seen growth rates in the 20s and 30s from a revenue standpoint. And then, although Business Solutions has been a tad bit softer than we expected, it is about 6% of our top line. But we believe long term, only having a 2% market share, leveraging our brand, our distribution, our global footprint, we can continue to grow in the low-double digit on a long-term basis. But overall, the core C2C business is strong. It's solid. We had consistent margins with a year ago, and so we feel good about where that business is at and where we're heading.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Great. And if I can ask a follow-up on westernunion.com, which seems to be a bright spot for you folks. What kinds of trends are you witnessing in that business in terms of some metrics, like customer retention and pricing? If you can compare that to kind of the traditional agent business. And although it's only 2% of revenue today, you have some potential growth [ph] there. Just trying to understand the economics there and some of those metrics, like customer retention.","Hikmet Ersek","Sure. I mean, what we are doing here is that building on our fundamentals of our global network, global compliance capability and global brands. We are connecting electronic with locations with retail. No one, as Western Union, can connect 16,000 corridors with electronic and locations. We can -- no one else can send money from U.S. to New Zealand in minutes, that or to Chad or to Morocco in minutes than us. We can do that. So what we are doing is that seeing here a huge growth and it's also a different customer. The cannibalization is very, very low here. It's not the customer who are using retail-to-retail money transfer, it's a new customer segment. The cannibalization is really very low, and it helps to grow our business. So that helps our patterns. The pricing-wise, it's the similar pricing. We use it here. We do use some corridors -- pricing in some corridors to respond, but that's a similar also in the retail money transfer business, right? Corridor by corridor, you adapt your prices. But generally, I would say the margins are similar and the -- excluding the investments we did, I would say, this is similar business.","Operator","Next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays Capital.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","While I think we all recognize there's been macro challenges impacting most businesses, you've -- and I think you may have touched on this in the -- earlier in the call a bit. But can you just perhaps call out and list off the issues that may have inhibited growth rates in C2C over the past year that are really not correlated with macroeconomic, such as regulatory issues, like those in Mexico and Russia or the pricing changes in Russia or the opportunities in Russia had an impact on market share? Anything else that may be unrelated to macro, but have inhibited growth and about how much it did sort of affect growth rate that could abate maybe and how that could trend better next year?","Hikmet Ersek","Sure. I can do that. I mean, no secret is the Mexico's Southwest Border investment that has been impacting our business. And we've been -- we think that, that has a part of our slowdown on our growth. And the other part is Russia. In Russia, it has been, as you know, we were kind of late to the market in Russia due to some regulatory changes. And since 1st of January, we could expand retail. We have team there. They are expending to the retail network like we did it in the PSD in the European Union. We had some issues in China. China slowed down, had impacted our business a little bit. Besides that, what else? I think 6% is only the B2B business, so global trades doesn't have an overall revenue impact. But on the C2C business, I would say these 3 areas had an impact to our business.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And if you were to sum up the impact of those 3 areas. And I think there's been a couple of other little smaller ones probably also. I mean, what would your -- what would you say was the total impact to your full year growth rate from those? If you can at least give us a sense?","Scott T. Scheirman","Darrin, it's Scott. I would just probably characterize that if those markets were growing versus where they're at, it would be helpful to where we're at. But I don't want to put a precise a number on that because we're in 200 countries, 16,000 corridors. There's always some puts and takes. But I think the good news with each of those 3 markets: China, Russia and Mexico, we've got plans in place. So it will take us 2012 to execute and work through those plans. But hopefully, on a long-term basis, we'll be in a much better competitive position there.","Hikmet Ersek","Just to add on that, Darrin, largest market out of the U.S. is 6% of our revenue.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, right. Understood. I guess I'm just trying to understand what a normalized growth rate would be even in a tough macro environment to compare now versus a normalized macro environment notwithstanding all the issues.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, sure. I know it's tough there. But we have, again, in the C2C a solid 3% growth, right? And I mean, I think that has been helping our business.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just one quick follow-up question on the capital side. Obviously, there are still around 2\/3, I think, of your cash flow generated outside the U.S. Any considerations recently by the board to adjust the strategy on capital? I know that you've been doing decently with the dividend and buybacks to some extent, but still a lot of cash can't be really easily used. And I know you have some near-term benefit from the tax benefit. But still, if you were to extrapolate or really just consider the repatriation of some of that cash more so maybe that would help or even leverage conditions would be considered differently that could maybe change the way some investors look at the story. Any thought there?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think, we, obviously,  -- as management, I am constantly, with Scott together, reviewing our capital structure with the board. We are constantly talking about our strategies, capital structure on the board. If you look at our -- we are a very strong cash flow company. But if you look at that, we are -- our aim is returning back share -- cash to shareholders. And we were very active in the first 2 quarters. And I don't see a huge acquisition coming up from that. We recently had the acquisition with Travelex. We are very focused on integrating Travelex to the B2B business and growing that business, expanding to new countries. We recently opened Chile as a new country. I think we are very focused, and we are constantly reviewing with our board our capital structure.","Operator","Next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about southern Europe. I mean, does it feel like that's going to get worse before it gets better on an outlook perspective?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, it depends on -- I mean, in part of -- some parts of, like, Spain is still an issue, right? Some parts of the southern Europe is changing. We can see Portugal being 50% inbound, 50% outbound. The southern Europeans are going and other parts of Europe sending back home to their countries. The typical outbound countries tend to be a little bit also inbound countries, even Greece is 30% of inbound now. And I think it's depending. It's hard to say that it will change dramatically. I don't see big changes since Q1 and Q2. It's -- the slowdown continues. But it's hard to say that's is going to be hard or not. It's, I think -- I would say, cautiously -- I would stay cautious.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then when you look at your guys' metrics versus the World Bank or other competitors, do you feel like you're maintaining share? Or do you feel like there are a few regions that you guys are losing some share?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, Brian, you've been following our business for a long time. And generally, since 2001, we gained share. It was 7%, and now we are at 17% cross-border remittance [ph] market, if you compare it with Aite. And I think, in some years, we are gaining market share. In some years, we are losing market share. In some corridors, we are gaining in market shares. In some corridors, we are losing market shares. And our principal, the last 6 months, has been flat in 2012, and constant currency principal growth was about 2%. And just the projection of Aite, for instance, was 5% growth rate, but that was July 2011 last forecast. So I would put things in perspective. As I said, in some corridors, yes, some corridors they're adapting their market share. But overall, our aim long term is getting market share.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And last question for me, Scott, I know I got the additional color on some of the compliance costs. Do you have any idea if you think that will be an ongoing kind of a future cost to the business there? I think you said there's an additional maybe 10 million in the business. But I guess any idea if you feel the environment is becoming more compliant -- there's more compliance costs that are going to be out there that are going to continue to be in the business model going forward? I don't know if there's any way to give your kind of big picture thoughts on the rising cost of compliance even that might not be in the numbers?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, Brian, as we've thought about that, it's hard to say for certain on anything because the compliance, the regulatory environment continues to evolve. But the overall spend in 2012, we think, comparable-wise, that's about where we're going to be in 2013 on a macro basis, specifically with Dodd-Frank. As an example, we think there'll be $5 million to $10 million of ongoing expenses  because of call centers and forms and so forth. But on a macro basis, we think the compliance spend '13 looks probably a lot like '12 just because of the broad global environment. But long term, we believe that will be competitive advantages for us as we move forward. And our goal is always to comply with the letter and spirit of the law, and we'll continue to drive that direction.","Operator","The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Hikmet, Scott, I just wanted to ask you to elaborate on the intra-quarter trend for C2C. Overall, the only geo with negative transaction growth was Europe. But -- just for Europe, as well as other geos, how did transactions trend each month in the quarter? And if you can possibly give some color on July, how it's looking?","Hikmet Ersek","Scott?","Scott T. Scheirman","Ashwin, yes. First I'd say the broad headline is we're confident with the guidance that we provided, the 2012 outlook we have provided today, for revenue growth, margins and EPS. So we're confident in the guidance that we provided. As you may recall, our historical practice is, we don't comment within a quarter or how the quarter looks because there can be seasonality, other things as you go within a quarter just looking at 1 month by itself. But the headline I would give you, Ashwin, is that we're comfortable with the guidance that we've provided today.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sure. No, I certainly understand that. But when you look at sort of the sequential, I mean, Q2 is not as good as Q1, which is not a surprise to anyone. But is it continuing to get worse? Or has it stabilized? Your guidance would seem to imply it stabilized.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, we're -- again, I'd probably go back to we're confident in our full year outlook. If you compare the first quarter and the second quarter, Europe and the Americas -- North America had some slighter softness. But if you look at Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, each of those markets had growth rates that were very comparable to the first quarter. So they were strong. We saw good growth with India, Saudi Arabia, Germany and so forth. So that's the beauty of our business. We're in 200 countries, 16,000 corridors. It's a portfolio approach. So from quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month, you might have some puts and takes. But overall, within the 200 countries, we feel like we're driving in the right direction and doing the right things.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. It's good to hear. I wanted to ask about pricing. It's still only a modest negative. It seems like it's lower than historical trend and except for sort of sporadic pricing initiatives. What's a good price trend line for the next 12 months? Negative 1 to negative 2 or will it get back to sort of the historical negative 2 to 3?","Hikmet Ersek","Ashwin, I think, generally, as you know, we are looking corridor by corridor in our pricing. We are going to -- in 2012, we're going to be around 1%, and 1% to 2% max, that will be the next forecast. I guess, given the environment, we are looking price and price action corridor by corridor, but I would say 1% to 2% around that will be in 2012 probably.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Scott, just a clarification on tax rate. Clearly, for this year, you get the non-repeating benefit. But the longer-term tax rate, should that still be in the 16%, 17% range?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, I would say directionally, yes, Ashwin, the only caution or caveat I'd put around that depends upon if there's tax law changes in any countries or how much cash we may repatriate. But your point is well taken. The benefit we have to the tax rate this year is more onetime, so we'll probably be closer to that 16% to 17% range unless other things might change. But there's a onetime benefit in the second quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from Jim Kissane of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Hikmet, can you provide a little more color in terms of your turnaround strategies for Mexico and Russia?","Hikmet Ersek","Sure. Let me -- I think 2012 will be still, both countries, a little bit challenging until we turn around. I think we are investing on the Mexico and there are 2 different issues here. In Mexico, it's more about upgrading our compliance in the Southwest Border and other areas and setting here the industry standards that, long term, we are leading the standard. And I think in Russia, the issue is more than signing new retailers, signing new -- you know that in Russia, we have financial institutions, and we are leading the financial institution there. And we have a very good business. Now we are going to the retail sector and adapting our pricing, and we hired new sales people. It will take some time in 2012 turning around Russia. It will take probably 2013. And once we have signed the retailers, then we will also start with some promotions to attract back the customers to our locations. So it will be -- we'll see the turn around probably in '13.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Hikmet, you think the compliance issues are the main problem in Mexico?","Hikmet Ersek","I think in Mexico, one thing also happened is that we -- as the exclusivity ended, we are starting to negotiate with new agent, potential agents. I'm very -- as we speak, the team is there in Mexico. And I think we are very aggressively purchasing new agents there in Mexico. That will help also to grow our business long term in Mexico.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And what's driving the stronger performance in Latin America? Any particular corridors?","Hikmet Ersek","I think, in parts of Latin America, we've been very strong in the business. And we did -- in Latin America also, we see new corridors sending intra-Latin America corridors, not only country, but intra-countries within the countries also growing strong. Our B2B -- our business -- bill payment business is doing very good in Argentina and other countries. That helps also to grow our business there.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just one more question. Did FX volatility in the quarter help Travelex or the B2B business?","Hikmet Ersek","Not really. I think it was really the transaction principal growth was the impact. But not really, we didn't see a huge change here.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I thought more volatility actually helps the business. Is that the right way to think about it?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, it does. If look at the VIX index, just as one indicator, Jim, Q1 and Q2 in round numbers, I'm slightly off in this, but that index was around 20 both Q1 and Q2. So I wouldn't say there was a lot of meaningfully different impact in volatility between the quarter, maybe some slight amounts, but not meaningfully.","Operator","The next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You mentioned in your prepared remarks that the higher-tier band in the U.S. didn't increase as rapidly. Do you think that's a function of the economy or more the competitive environment?","Scott T. Scheirman","On DMT, I think it's probably could be a little bit of each. It's hard to tell for certain. That business still had 4% growth. We are going to do some additional marketing there with the domestic business. But it probably could have a little bit economic impact. I'm not sure about the competitive side. And then, any corridor, any market, you do see some variability from quarter-to-quarter. Overall, I would say we're pleased with the business. It's growing. It's a 30% margin business, and we continue to see that as a growth business as we move forward.","Hikmet Ersek","And also, I think we are going to implement also some because $5 for $50 and the lower bands are growing very healthy, but it's also going after the higher bands, we may also implement some marketing promotion actions in the future.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then you mentioned some potential ramp marketing spend. Does that change your plans for marketing spend for the year as a whole?","Hikmet Ersek","No, no, Sara. I think we are actually the same.","Operator","Next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","You mentioned some relatively large agent re-signings in the back half of the year. In the past, you've done a good job of driving down commission rates upon re-signing. Is that the trend that we should expect to continue thereby being a little bit of a tailwind for EBIT margin longer term?","Hikmet Ersek","I think if you look at the last 3, 4 years, we've been driving our cost of sales down. I think from 44% to approximately some-41%. Was that right?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. In 2010, we're around 57%. 2011, round number, 56%. So it's been moving down.","Hikmet Ersek","It takes some time, Andrew, until it comes down. But I think, generally, I would say that we are signing new agents globally in a lower commission rate as we did it in the past.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So think about the trends continuing and the effectiveness of your efforts in that direction as well?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. Some years up, and some years down. But you're right, directionally.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, in a given year, there could be some variation. But long term, we believe there's opportunities to continue to optimize the commissions on a long-term basis.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And to be clear, just to make sure I understood you, Scott, in terms of long-term CapEx, '12, sounds like it's going to be above trend line.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, '12, our view is we'll be somewhere around 4% to 5% of our revenues. As we turn the calendar to '13 or on a long-term basis, we think it will be closer to 3%, which is where we run historically. Again, any given year could vary if there's an agent opportunity or some other initiative. But we think the normalized run rate looks closer to 3% long term.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one last one, if I may. On China, you mentioned that there's a little bit of softness there. Would you characterize that as competitive or macro? And do you still have a big ambitions for what could be a pretty significant market opportunity long term?","Hikmet Ersek","No, I think we are very committed to China. And I'd see there's a really long-term market opportunity in China, I mean, given our presence there, given our agents. And I think it has something to do with a little bit macro, and it's a mix of macro. I wouldn't see that as a huge competitive trend. I think we are very well positioned there. So I think I see China as an opportunity.","Operator","The last question comes from David Togut of Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Hikmet and Scott, EBIT margin, excluding restructuring and TGBP integration expenses, was down 100 basis points in Q2 versus 200 basis points in Q1. So as you look out to the balance of this year and 2013, can you give us sort of the puts and takes on margins? And I'm more focused on 2013 since you've already commented on 2012. I guess, specifically, what are your thoughts with respect to investment in electronic channels? And then, number two, can you dial back expenses if we remain in a tough global economy, particularly southern Europe?","Hikmet Ersek","I think we are very focused, obviously, on long-term margin expansion. That's clear. Revenue growth will help us to expand the margins. That's for sure. But once we have a strong revenue growth, the margin expansion is here. I would say that we did a significant investment in our San Francisco office, in our digital. These numbers are already showing that we are growing very fast here. We're going to continue to invest, obviously. But I'm not sure it could be higher or lower in the future, the investment in that part. I think I'm, long term, committed to grow this business and long-term margin expansion if -- once we grow this business.","Michael A. Salop","Yes. And I'll also add, David, as Scott mentioned earlier, we do have Business Solutions synergies coming. We'll have about $30 million of cost savings once we -- that's annualized after 2013. But we'll get a fair amount of those in 2013 as well.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","You spend about $200 million a year in advertising and marketing. Do you anticipate dialing that spend back next year if the economy remains weak?","Hikmet Ersek","No, I think marketing is -- obviously, our brand, our customer relationship, our expansion is very important for us. I think we are positioned. We want to expand. We want to gain market share. I think marketing is one of our tools to gain that.","Michael A. Salop","Thanks, everyone, for joining us.

On today's call Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will discuss the company's second quarter results, and then we will take your questions.","The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.","Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements.

I'm pleased with our operating performance as we posted another quarter of solid results with improved constant currency strength across all of our business segments. Excluding the one-time charge, profit margins expanded 90 basis points compared to the prior year. And we continued to return significant funds to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. While economic currency and geopolitical challenges remain in many parts of the world, we are pleased with our performance and business trends. As a result, we have raised our full-year outlook for adjusted earnings per share and constant currency revenue growth.","In the quarter, consumer money transfer was led by a healthy U.S. outbound business and good transactions growth in markets such as Germany and UK, which offset continued challenges in Russia and some African countries. Westernunion.com again delivered strong growth in the quarter not only in the U.S., but across most of the countries where we have transaction sites.","Customers using online or mobile to send money to bank accounts are providing incremental business. Improvements in mobile access such as with our new UK app are also producing results. Our consumer money transfer pricing has been stable as the net pricing investment for both the second quarter and the first half of the year was minimum.","Western Union Business Solutions delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth as we continue to focus on our strategy of providing specialized products and services. Consumer bill payments also provided strong growth with good performance from both our Argentina walk-in business and U.S. electronic bill pay.","Now before I turn to call over to Raj for the financial results, I would like to take few minutes to discuss the industry landscape and our strategic focus. As I have stated in the past, our vision is to be recognized leader in cross-border constant currency money transfer for consumers and businesses.","For the consumer money transfer market, we expect digital-initiated transaction will be fast growing over the next several years, and we also believe retail-initiated transaction will continue to provide a steady business and remain a very sizable portion of the market.","As you know, cross-border money transfer has different dynamics within the different countries and customer segments. On the receive side, we believe cash will remain critical in much of the world for the foreseeable future. At the same time, the account side of the receive market represents incremental opportunities.","Western Union has great global assets to leverage. We have a strong brand which stands for trust and reliability with our customers. We already have regulatory and compliance programs that allow us to operate in more than 200 countries and territories. We have an extensive funds-in and funds-out network the connects over 0.5 million diverse retail agent locations, ATMs, and kiosks, our own and third-party digital sites and mobile wallets.","We are adding direct access to millions of paying accounts, and our network also gives us the ability to offer tailored cross-border B2B, B2C, C2B solutions. We have a cross-border platform that provides the technology, foreign exchange conversion and settlement, regulatory and compliance infrastructure and data management that brings our network together. This platform allows an effective and timely money movement for multiple used cases almost anywhere in the world.","We are building on this strength to expand our network even further and open it to new types of players. Today, we are very well positioned as we have been heavily investing in our digital, compliance, and IT capabilities, for the last few years. And we continue to enhance our platform. Just in the first half of the year, we announced new agreements with MTN for mobile money transfer in Rwanda and in the Ivory Coast. New connections to the ATMs in Poland, new self-service kiosks in with WHSmith in the UK and new card and ATM based services through MasterCard at Banca Transylvania in Romania. Western Union Business Solutions formed a mass payment alliance with Hyperwallet, and signed agreements with Tower Watson for cross border payroll, and with North Western University for education payments.","We also entered other new Asian relationships such as with the Bank of China and Sainsbury's Bank, UK's first supermarket bank. And we renewed several other agents around the world, including the expansion of our long-standing relationship with Kroger here in the U.S. earlier this month. Our digital business is already strong with approximately $250 million in revenues last year and strong growth again this year.","We now have online sites in 29 markets to send money around the world, and we plan to leverage our brands, global presence and regulate the relationships to add even more markets over the next couple of years. We are opening a digital hub in Asia that will help us move faster to establish and develop online and mobile business across the Middle East, Africa, Asia the CIS and other international markets. While we have already an established retail payout, we will continue to add to the more than 50 countries where we can now deposit funds into banks and mobile accounts.","From this foundation, we believe, we are very competitive. And we offer a strong proposition that is difficult for others to replicate on a global scale. The payment base is clearly seeing some exciting developments. At Western Union, we are focused on innovation and new technology. And we are fortunate to already have a strong core asset that support global money movement. So I hope I was able to give you some brief insight into Western Union Brazilian global business model, our competitive strength and our future strategy.","Now coming back to the second quarter results, once again we are pleased with the performance and improved revenue trend and with the raised outlook for the year.","Now I will turn the call over to Raj to provide you a more detailed review of the quarter.","A - Rajesh Agrawal","Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter revenue of $1.4 billion was down 2% compared to the prior year period during - due to the strength of the U.S. dollar but revenue on a constant currency basis increased 4%. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $85 million compared to the prior year period. In the consumer to consumer segment, reported revenue decreased 3% but increased 3% constant currency. Transactions also grew 3% in the quarter.","B2C cross border principal declined 5% or increased 2% constant currency. Principal for transaction was down 7% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to foreign exchange translation as the decline was only 1% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately six percentage points. The differential was due to a negative 6% impact in currency. Both net pricing and mix impacts were minimal in the quarter. We did implement some price reductions in the high principal band of our U.S. domestic money transfer business in early April. These were implemented in certain parts of the country where we were seeing competitive impact. While it would take several quarters to fully judge the results, we are seeing improved transaction trends in the price stand, which contributed to a 4% in [indiscernible transactions in the quarter.","Turning to the regions. Due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates compared to last year, as I've discussed individual country contributions to the regional result, I will be referring to constant currency movements.","In Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 9% or increased 2% constant currency while transactions increased 1%. Germany and the UK delivered good revenue growth in the quarter, which partially offset by continued declines in Russia. I also want to give you a quick update on Greece. The money transfer industry was affected by the government mandated bank holiday implemented in late June and money transfer transactions were not allowed, midway through July, some inbound business was reopened with limitations on withdrawal. We are very pleased that starting this week, we've been able to reopen our services in many agent locations without limitations on inbound transfers, so our valued customers in Greece are now able to receive much needed funds. For reference, Greece represents just under 1% of company revenues last year, and prior to the current crisis, the business was split 50\/50 between inbound and outbound.","North America revenue declined 2% or 1% on a constant currency basis while transactions increased 3%. The U.S. outbound growth was strong in the quarter, driven primarily by spends to Latin America and Mexico. Our Mexico business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico data that the first two months of the quarter. Total domestic money transfer revenue declined 4% while transactions increased 4%, an improvement from the first quarter's 2% transaction growth. In the Middle and Africa region, revenue declined 4% or increased 1% constant currency and transactions reflect. The region benefited from growth in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and the Nigeria outbound business, which was partially offset by continued geopolitical driven weakness in Angola and Libya. In Asia Pacific revenue was down 5% or flat constant currency. Transactions in the region declined 3%.","Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region increased 6% from the prior year quarter or 13% constant currency, while transactions increased 7%. Strong inbound business from the U.S. as well as outbound strength from Argentina drove the growth in the region.","Westernunion.com C2C revenue grew 22% in the quarter or 28% constant currency. Westernunion.com transactions increased 27%. U.S. originated online transactions grew 33% and the U.S. outbound quarters were even stronger. Electronics channels revenue which includes WU.com account-based money transfer through banks and mobile money transfer increased 19% in the quarter and represented 7% of total company revenue.","In the Consumer-to-Consumer business segment, revenue increased 8% or 12% on a constant currency basis driven by strong growth in the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which is partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. Business Solutions, reported a revenue decline of 1% or an increase of 9% constant currency.","Revenue growth was driven by Europe and led by strong sales of hedging products. As we discussed margins and earnings per share, unless otherwise noted, my comments would exclude the impact of the settlement agreement reached between our Paymap business which is part of the Consumer-to-Business segment and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. During - due to this agreement, we have accrued $35.3 million in the course results claims regarding the marketing or Paymap equity accelerated service after tax, the impact was $24.2 million or $0.05 per share. The consolidated operating profit margin excluding the charge was 20.7% in the second quarter compared to 19.8% in the prior year period.","The operating margin improvement was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and the net impact of foreign currency movements which are partially offset by increases in incentive compensation, compliance, and technology expense. While the overall impacted currency translation negatively impacted revenue and profitability in the quarter, the operating margin percentage benefited from hedge gains as profit was proportionately less impacted by currency than revenues.","In the quarter, we recorded approximately $20 million of hedge in our revenue line and these also flow through to the operating profit. Excluding all impacts of currency, operating margin still improved compared to the year-ago period. Approximately $9 million of incremental savings were identified in the second quarter from cost savings initiatives. We continue to expect approximately $15 million to $20 million of savings this year from programs implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014, and another $10 million to $15 million of incremental savings from the 2013 programs.","Compliance expense was approximately 3.7% of revenue in the quarter, compared to 3.2% in the prior year period and we still expect the range of 3.5% to 4% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.2% in the quarter compared to 24.7% in the prior year period. While our tax rate of 11.8% was down from 16.5% in the prior year. Including the impact of settlement charges, the reported tax rate was 3.5%.","Adjusted earnings per share are $0.41, increased 14% from $0.36 in the prior year period, driven by the operating margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate, and your shares outstanding. GAAP earnings per share which includes the settlement was $0.36. The C2C operating margin was 23.3%, compared to 22.7% in the prior-year period. The C2C margin benefited from cost savings initiatives and the net impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by increased compliance and incentive compensation costs. The consumer to business operating margin was 18.3% in the quarter, excluding a settlement charge, compared to 16.2% in the prior-year period. The margin increase was driven by higher revenue and cost savings initiatives.","Business Solutions reported breakeven profit for the quarter, compared to a loss of $3 million for the same period last year. The improvement in operating profit for Business Solutions in the quarter was primarily due to lower amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization was approximately $12 million in the quarter compared to $15 million in the prior year period.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $466 million year-to-date through June. Capital expenditures were $78 million for the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.7 billion, and cash of $1.6 billion. Approximately 40% of the cash was held by United States entities. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares for a total of $156 million. Our remaining authorizations of $906 million expires in December 2017.","We also paid $79 million in dividend in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had 512 million shares outstanding. Based on the results for the first-half and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year outlooks for adjusted earnings per share and constant currency revenue growth. We now expect, low to mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth for the year, compared to low-single digit growth in our previous outlook.","Our operating margin outlook remains at approximately 21% excluding the Paymap settlement or approximately 20% including the charge. We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 13% although the GAAP rate is now projected at approximately 12%. We've raised the adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.02 to a range of $1.60 to $1.67. On a GAAP basis, the range would be $0.05 lower. We are pleased with the second quarter results including good revenue trends and cost management and are confident in the outlook for the remainder of the year.","Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Just wondering of your big picture question, Hikmet, lots of M&A activity in this space - remittance space. It seems like Western Union is kind of wants to stay away from making any acquisitions of any size, of any materials. So could you maybe just give us some thoughts on acquisition strategy and kind of your thoughts Western Union kind of doing this on a standalone basis?","Hikmet Ersek","Great question, Bryan. First of all, we're very pleased with our performance, obviously we are really executing on the markets. Again another quarter, solid quarter, and I believe also our digital strategy and our portfolio expansion is working, core business delivering. And that's great. Build on that strength, we are always looking for acquisition opportunities to enhance our cross-border money movement capabilities our platform and also expanding our portfolio, we're always looking at that, but we've been - we are pleased with our, we're focused on our performance, we are pleased with our performance. If you look at acquisition, we'd need to have a strong cash-on-cash returns, and we believe also the acquisition candidate should be really has to fit within our strategy, has to really help to us to execute good in the market and long-term has to benefit for us. So, we're always looking at the acquisition possible, it is but, it has to fit, and we're going to continue to execute with our business.","Bryan Keane","But it doesn't seem like anything eminent or there are bunch of big deals that are close to looking at?","Hikmet Ersek","We're really looking always, all possibilities, but, we're very much focused on as you know the company policy, we don't make any comments on the acquisitions. And so, I think we are very much focused on the, our execution.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then just Raj, obviously volatility in FX is playing a role. Can you just may be help us understand how that's influencing the model kind of the puts and takes for the both revenue and margin.","Rajesh Agrawal","I'm sure, Bryan, the volatility itself has more of a direct impact, in our B2B business, we see that impact the business in the short-term , long-term results in the B2B business are really driven overall market growth and the things that we're executing upon. From a volatility standpoint, for the consumer business, there's not much of an impact, we have seen some additional movement there in certain markets like the U.S. and the UK to India or the U.S. to Mexico as those currencies have moved. But nothing dramatic on the consumer side of the equation. Just generally, our trends have been improving. We've seen good U.S. hop on fund trends, we've seen good performance in parts of Europe, although with challenges in Russia obviously. But even in the Middle East, we've seen good performance with the UAE and Saudi Arabia, and even in Nigeria, our hop on business is there.","So, pockets of strength around the world, not necessarily driven by currency volatility, really just by good performance in those particular geographies.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hi, great. Thanks, good quarter here. Just building on Bryan's question, on just on hedge gains then. I guess, $36 million year-to-date, what's sort of the second half outlook on the hedge gain front if rates hold there?","Rajesh Agrawal","Sure. Tien-tsin, this is Raj. We still expect to achieve about $70 million in hedge gains for the year. $16 million in the first quarter as you know, and then $20 million in the second quarter, and then still $70 million, and that's assuming that rates stay roughly where they are today. We had assumed about a $1.10 coming into the year for the euro and that's roughly where the rate has been.","Tien-tsin Huang","All right. Terrific. Just wanted to check there. Just I guess back to the business on the pricing front, good to hear everything is holding stable. What sort of the outlook for the year specifically I guess for the second half you had some price actions, embedded in the outlook, do you have that lead or ready to pull or does it feel like we're more of in a stable environment here?","Rajesh Agrawal","Well, generally as you know, Tien-tsin our business, we do a pricing actions as we did it also in the U.S. corridor. But we do it corridor-by-corridor, selective pricing actions. I believe that the business is quite stable, we are wining, we're quite competitive. The people really trust our brand, trust our network, trust our capabilities on the multi settlement and everything. Our platform is really working pretty well, within that environment, we feel currently quite stable on the pricing investment. So, I think we're going to continue to do corridor by corridor and area by area pricing investment as we did in past always, but I don't feel that for this year we're going to do big pricing investments.","Tien-tsin Huang","All right. That was great. Great quarter, thanks.","Rajesh Agrawal","Thanks","Hikmet Ersek","Thanks, Tien-tsin.","Operator","And the next question comes from Smitty Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley.","Smitty Srethapramote","Great, thank you. So this was the first quarter where I think I've noticed that constant currency revenue growth in WU.com was higher than transaction growth. Can you talk just talk about that this, I guess this development? Are you guys falling back on promotions and what kind of growth rates should we be expecting WU.com in the going forward [indiscernible].","Rajesh Agrawal","Hi, Smitty. This is Raj. We are very pleased with the growth that we've gotten in the WU.com business and the strategies that we've put in place that are really starting to work for us. The business has really been focused on expanding geographically and you see that in 29 markets now. We are also improving upon the customer experience by adding more features and functionality to our platforms and ultimately getting more conversion of customers, and we're also expanding channel capabilities. So more bank funding, more bank payout. We also have mobile capability in the U.S., UK, and Australia. So all of those things put together are really helping to drive good revenue growth. Having said that we continue to look at opportunities to do price promotions that's an ongoing activity that we have, and - but you're seeing those two things tighten a little bit. We're pleased with the 27% transaction because that just gives you an indicator of how healthy the business is. And I would say our principal growth has been even far above our revenue growth. So we're gaining share in that part of the market and we feel really good about where that business is headed.","Hikmet Ersek","I think also to add on that our mobile strategy is working pretty well there. We're going to expand that mobile strategy also to the other countries. And one thing also you heard that me saying that, we're going to open an digital hub in Asia. We want to go to new countries also with that one. And basically we are going to use our existing business model, which we create in San Francisco, which we've been so very successful. And really taking that and opening new countries to expand our digital. And the trick is obviously combining digital and with retail payout different dynamics. Our omnichannel strategy is working. So I am pleased with that also.","Smitty Srethapramote","Great. Thank you for that. And maybe just a follow-up question. Just wondering what kind of reactions you have to the proposed PayPal to combination?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I can't make a comment on PayPal or nor Xoom obviously. But I think that we are pretty much, we our business, our visual business is really pretty good as I mentioned earlier. But I think we are going to concentrate. I'm going to expand our digital business. It has a very strong growth. We are also with our platform. We are looking also at different customer segments, different players, which joining an example is, one of the examples which is growing very well is our financial institutions web pages like Scotiabank or like Swiss Post bank. They are using our platform to send money worldwide. So it's bank [indiscernible] standard on their webpage using Western Union, dropping money to 200 countries. That's the platform strength we have it. I think we're going to concentrate on that. So this platform is, it didn't happen to us yesterday, right? We build at over years, it's very strong, and it is - you have to - it's a really competitive advantage and the cash payout is extremely important in different parts of the world, as you know, and that's definitely we feel quite competitive to be successful in the market.","Smitty Srethapramote","Okay. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you, Smitty.","Operator","And our next question is from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider","Thanks for taking my question. As more you if you can follow up on the previous one, if in fact PayPal does expand the zoom offering into more markets than the U.S. outbound. Can you maybe talk about what's required in your online business to drive kind of more marketing dollars and what the historic relationship you've seen, is between our marketing dollars spent in the given geography for online channels versus transactions?","Hikmet Ersek","Jim, you will understand that I'll keep that in a general comment, I won't keep it my secrets - company secrets away. But to build up online business is not that easier and propping money there is not easy. You need some countries of bank licenses, you need to compliance requirements, you need to register customer, know your customer, know your age on the receive side. It's a quite complex part which we have been doing that for many years and very successful.","What happens is that, it's not only in the send side, you also have to understand the dynamics on the receive side of the customer behavior, customer segmentation on the receive side. And what we do with our platform, as you saw in my - one of my charts, I explained it. Western Union has a diverse payout options - and because it's a choice of the consumers how they want to pick up the money, and how we want to send that. That's the biggest advantage we build over the years, and we're going to concentrate on that, on the send side maybe particularly answering that questions, you're going to concentrate on the royalty programs, on the corridor-by-corridor actions. Is it a promotions, Mother's Day promotions or is it a Christmas promotion or is in the ethnic marketing, you'll continue to be very, very focused. So, I believe that, we are very well positioned here.","James Schneider","That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe a follow-up for Raj. On the compliance spending, 3.7% in the quarter. What's the visibility outlook into the back-half of the year? Do you think, there is an opportunity to sort of bring that down or do you think that kind of stays at the same level or even at higher level and can you maybe talk about some of the programs that are new, that are ongoing there?","Rajesh Agrawal","Sure, Jim. We still believe that our spending this year will be in that 3.5% to 4% range, I don't have a tighter range to give you the than that. In any given quarter, the level of spending is going to vary depending on what activities we actually have going on. We're - I do believe that, we're in a more stable place this year than we have been historically on - in terms of the level of compliance spending.","What you're really seeing coming through in the higher spend this year is all of the people that we've hired, we have over 2,000 employees in the compliance organization which is helping to strengthen our compliance capabilities, but that is adding cost to the equation issue, and that's really the step up that you're seeing. At the same time, we're also trying to optimize our spend. We're spending money in technology, we're trying to automate processes, automate activities wherever we can.","And that's something that will make us more efficient over time. But we still are in the right range for the year of 3.5% to 4%.","Hikmet Ersek","Raj, I think, we're going to continue to enroll compliance programs worldwide. There will be investments, continued investments, that's also I see as an investment, because it's really a competitive, it's starting to be a competitive advantage in some countries. And the more your customer know your agent programs, it will be expanded into several countries over the coming years. To protect our customers, to protect the company, to work with the regulators to - and this is a complex business money transfer business, and within that environment, we're going to continue to invest.","James Schneider","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","The next question is from Darrin Parrell - Darrin Peller, I'm sorry of Barclays.","Darrin Peller","Thanks, guys. My just first question on pricing again, I mean again it came up before, but good to see stability there, just Hikmet, a big picture, not necessarily this year, but used to be something that you guys would guide towards being a 1 to - maybe 1 point to 3 point pressure per year, in terms of just expected headwinds on the revenue side. We obviously haven't seen that for the last couple of quarters. Do you really think that continues or comes back in a couple of years, is the environment competitively going to cause that or is it a little bit of a better competitive landscape now?","Hikmet Ersek","Darrin, as you know I'm not going to give guidance for - longer guidance, but I see where we are today and you could look also the last quarters, we've been very competitive within that environment with our pricing. Darrin, as you know that doesn't mean that we're not going to do pricing, right. So, I mean we're going to really focus quarter-by-quarter. As you recall in 2012, we had one correction about our product reposition and pricing reposition, a bigger one.","Darrin Peller","Yes.","Hikmet Ersek","But since then as we said that come back, transactions and revenue will come back, and that happens. And if you do also quarter based pricing or area pricing, it takes about 18 months or something like that, the revenues also come back, you would see sudden - suddenly the transactions are coming back on the quarter-by-quarter, but we've been doing that for many years, and I believe that given our global reach, we can really do that quarter-by-quarter pricing investment. I feel comfortable where we are today.","Darrin Peller","Okay. All right, then just a quick question for Raj on the tax rate. I think you came in at 11.8% adjusted for the settlement. And so I just I think you had guided initially to a 13% tax rate for the year with it first half is coming in, I think about 100 basis points better than that. I guess first question is just should we still expect that for the year and then why would it increase in the second half? And then going forward, I mean is your normal tax rate still 15%.","Rajesh Agrawal","Yes. You should still plan for about 13% adjusted for the year. There is just some geographic and business mix assumptions that we have in the full year outlook for the tax rate. So that's approximately what we expect for the year. And on a longer-term basis, assuming no other tax law changes, which is something you can't really predict and we would expect in the normal year to be in the mid-teens range.","Darrin Peller","Okay, guys. All right. Nice job. Thanks.","Rajesh Agrawal","Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","And next we have a question from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon.","Rajesh Agrawal","Hi, Sara.","Sara Gubins","On pricing, you did lower pricing to some extent in the high principal bands in the U.S. I know it's on a selective basis. Was the impact of that just so small that it doesn't show up when we look at the overall pricing impact? Or are there some regions where pricing is coming up?","Rajesh Agrawal","Yeah, Sara. This is Raj. We did do some price increases and decreases around the world. And that's why you see the net impact being 0% pricing for the year quarter and actually for the first half of the year. And as we've always said, we look at pricing opportunities all over the world. And how - what it takes to be competitive in certain geographies and so that can go up or down direction. So that's really why you have 0% pricing?","Hikmet Ersek","Just to add on this, Sara, you're right. We did some pricing investment [indiscernible] selected locations where we feel that we did that. I think [indiscernible] and car transit team did a good job to selecting the locations to very minimal pricing investment. So, we feel quite competitive and in the lower bands and also general and the U.S. domestic money transfer and U.S. outbound, and U.S. origin, the digital money transfer is doing fantastic actually. The team is doing a good job to respond to the market need. So I feel generally that we are, our pricings are stable and good for this year.","Sara Gubins","Great. And then a question on Europe. Transaction growth came down, when we look at year-over-year transaction growth, it came down about 300 basis points versus last quarter. You mentioned strength in Germany and U.K., and of course weakness in Russia offsetting that. But did anything change sequentially from the first quarter that might explain the weaker transaction growth?","Hikmet Ersek","Yeah, Sara, the transaction growth was largely impacted by a declines in Russia. But if you look at the revenue growth, that's very consistent with the first quarter. We still had 2% constant currency revenue growth in both the first quarter and second quarter, and the transaction growth, because of the declines in the Russian business, which is at a relatively lower revenue per transaction in the rest of Europe. That's why you see the mix change happening there. So that's more of an impact on transaction growth and really not much impact on the revenue growth.","Sara Gubins","Great. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Thanks Sara.","Operator","And next we have a question from Tim Lilly of Wells Fargo.","Tim Lilly","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon.","Hikmet Ersek","Hi Tim.","Tim Lilly","Just had a question on the consumer business and the B2B, that consumer business growth rate of 12 constant currency is pretty strong. I guess I just want to make sure there is nothing with the U.S. transitory in the quarter that, it's not indicative of their underlying business sort of, should we think about that's really sort of the trajectory the growth rate is for the consumer to business right now.","Hikmet Ersek","Yeah. Tim, that's slightly more than the first quarter, but it's pretty consistent. In the first quarter, the business grew at 11%. So nothing unusual there. We've had good performance in our Argentina business and also in our electronic payments business here in the U.S. And those are the two key growth drivers and then cash. Walk-in business here in the U.S. declined as it has in the last few quarters. So nothing really has changed in terms of overall trend there.","Tim Lilly","Okay. And then my second question I guess sort of that ties into the whole enterprise. But obviously the transaction growth rates and the revenue and the consumer to consumer are what they are in that low single digit give or take. A lot of people talking about pricing, but you got these two other businesses of the B2B and the C2B that are growing faster than the consumer. So I guess my question with that as a backdrop is if you can maintain transaction growth and the consumer to consumer where it's at. And there's not any kind of real degradation. Does that alleviate your concern or your willingness to cut prices, but actually focus more on the other two businesses to sort of pick up the slack? Or do you feel like if you can't reaccelerate the transaction growth in the consumer, it's somewhere, pricing would have to occur again like we did a couple of years ago.","Hikmet Ersek","Yeah. I think I got your question. Let me try to answer it. So first of all if you compare our retail money transfer business is a big part of that. That's a different base than on our digital business and the business solutions. The growth rates are - they are different bases, right. One is a huge billion dollars of business. The others are known last year this will be $250 million. But, it's very strong growth, and it helps to grow the company. So, as I said in my opening comments also, we believe that, retail money transfer business continue to, retail instant, continue to be stable, and will have a lower growth rate than the digital business, which is going to be very strong growth rate, but that will, it's a different base, and it's a different customer segment.","One good thing is also that, the digital business consumers are new to Western Union. These are new customers, we're adding. We wouldn't be so successful, if we - in digital business, if we wouldn't have that retail payout network worldwide. The connection between digital and cash payout it's really the one of the strongest growth rates, we have it globally, than the combination of omnichannel makes is successful.","Saying that, on the digital-to-digital, it's -that's a different customer segment. We do that also if we do have a good growth rate, digital to bank accounts payout. But, generally I would say that, with the different customer segment, we have a good price positioning, to go after them. So, I don't see the big pricing investment to catch up there or to change the environment. I think, I feel comfortable with our omnichannel strategy with customer segment base pricing, promotions works pretty well, to go to the market.","Tim Lilly","Okay. Thanks, that's very helpful. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Hi, Hikmet, hi Raj, and how are you guys?","Hikmet Ersek","Hi Ashwin, how are you?","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Good, thanks. I had one question on the FX line in the C2C segment. Last quarter, you had mentioned there is some rebalancing between fees and FX. But, when I look at it in FX as a percent of C2C revenues is now up to over 24% of revenues, 18 months ago, it was less than 22%. I'm kind of wondering how sustainable is this. Do you pay commission on FX? And the pricing calculation, does that include this or not?","Hikmet Ersek","Yeah. Ashwin, if you recall in the first quarter we began some and we did some rebalancing between CCs and foreign exchange. So we shifted some pricing in certain parts of our business from CCs to foreign exchange. No, overall impact to consumer pricing and no real impact on our revenue line. So it's been - you're going to see that impact throughout this course of this year until it anniversaries into next year. But that was just to realign with the market pricing and why we did the rebalancing.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","But on the FX component, do you pay commission to your agents? I mean what's the contribution margin of FX versus transaction? Just curious.","Michael Salop","Yeah. Hi, Ashwin. This is Mike. To answer your first question. It is included in our pricing numbers. So the changes in the FX price is part of the pricing calculation as well. It depends on the country. In some countries, we pay commissions on the FX, in other countries we don't. So it just depends on which corridors we are talking about.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. And sort of a broader question. You guys have had a very stable call it 3% transaction growth in North America now for many quarters. Is this a looking at sort of a late [indiscernible] business. Is this the right level of transaction growth for our modeling purposes or can you accelerate it, or is it sort of the stable network?","Michael Salop","In the U.S. market, it has been pretty consistent transaction growth. This year it's really about the economic conditions that we see. We've seen continued good growth in the U.S. market. U.S. outbound LACA has continued to stay strong. U.S. to Mexico has also been very strong for us. And we have our TMT business that we just saw some acceleration in transaction growth. So that's a component of it as well. It's hard to predict exactly where with the transaction growth will be for that business, but we're pleased with the direction that it's had in the last few quarters.","Hikmet Ersek","Yeah, I think - also all the promotion actions and all the online business doing very well, especially the mobile is a big step in the U.S. I'm very pleased with the mobile penetration and the lower bands the people are really using it. And it is very convenient. It's nice you have the mobile app, you send money and somebody anywhere who lives in the 50,000 locations in the U.S. can pick up the money immediately. So that's something that we'll debt and it's also outbound business is very strong. And I think that it's a good market.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Right. So sounds like, you guys can keep it stable going forward. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Thanks, Ashwin.","Rajesh Agrawal","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","And we have Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey, guys. How are you?","Hikmet Ersek","Hi, Jason. Good.","Jason Kupferberg","So on WU.com, I was curious to get a sense of what percent of the volume going through there is now paid out in cash versus being paid to an account? And where might you like to see that metric get over the next year or two? Obviously, it would be advantages if you guys can avoid some of the agent costs there?","Hikmet Ersek","Yeah. The vast majority of the business is still paid out to an agent location. However, the bank payout and the bank funding of that - of those transactions is one of the faster growing areas is still small portion of the business, but still the largest used case is to pay out in cash, and again we're trying to create this omnichannel capability where consumers have an opportunity to use this however they want, whether it's cash at a retail location, or mobile, or bank, or our online business, so however they want to transact with us, that's really what we're driving towards. So cash is still obviously a very important component of the equation, but bank payout, and bank funding are going to become more part of the mix as we move forward.","Rajesh Agrawal","Especially in the sense, it really depends on the country, it depends on the corridor, right. In countries where you send money, where the people need to pay out in cash in the corridor, it's extremely high growth rate but in the sense that there is a different use case, that people want to use online maybe sometimes credit card fund it, sometimes ACA, sometimes especially in Europe, debit cards and debit accounts funded but on the receive side, we see a huge, the agent locations advantage is huge to cash payout, but as Raj said that it's small, but we see also very fast growth rate on the bank account and mobile wallet payout, so that's something that we're also focused.","Hikmet Ersek","It's largely an incremental opportunity for us. The bank payout. We typically don't see a shift of preference there, it's really an incremental opportunity for us.","Jason Kupferberg","Yeah, that's the way it sounds. And then just a follow-up question generally on costs, I know you're still working your way through some of the cost savings from prior actions, should we think of your overall cost base is being pretty well optimized at this point, obviously you made the investments in compliance for example, and you've done a good amount of cost take out in prior years or do you still think that you can sort out some additional opportunities that might even be significant enough for you to be able to call out at some point.","Hikmet Ersek","Yeah. I mean Jason, we're always looking for opportunities to take some cost out and optimize and we, we continue to evaluate opportunities, as you said, we've done in quite a bit already. We still are looking at ways of optimizing our overall distribution cost. So we really look at the mix of that business and how that's going to drive distribution costs down over time, and that is our single biggest cost item in our cost structure as you know. And then we, the compliance has certainly become more stable, I would say this year than we've seen in the last few years, we have a better handle on it. And then in our fixed and variable cost structure, other variable costs, we're also looking at opportunities. So, certainly if there is something of significance, we would definitely call it out to you, at some point in the future.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks guys.","Hikmet Ersek","Thanks Jason.","Rajesh Agrawal","Thanks Jason.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Macquarrie of Macquarrie.","Kevin Macquarrie","Great, thanks. I wonder if you could give us a sense, from pricing perspective. Is some of that being held by capacity coming out as a result just the cost of the compliant, being two ownership at this point for certain markets?","Hikmet Ersek","Kevin, on the compliance, we - if I understand your correct question correctly. We have compliance activities that are ongoing in nature. So we have many markets and geographies, where we're implementing programs. Even if we complete those activities,, we know that we have more regions and markets in which to go to. And so that's why we've continued to see some higher level of spending in the compliance side, and that's where we are today. But, if things don't necessarily just drop off.","Michael Salop","I think if you're referring to the industry in general, Kevin yeah, we do think costs are going up for competitors most probably playing into pricing in the industry.","Kevin Macquarrie","Yeah, with more along those lines, Mike. And then just any thoughts on Hyperwallet the JV has that been going?","Michael Salop","Yeah, it's early in the relationship. It's within our B2B business that we've entered into this relationship and it allows us to deliver mass payments around the world in an easier way. Hyperwallet has a receiver-oriented portal that ultimately requires the beneficiaries that input their information. So it makes it easier. The sender doesn't have to know every single beneficiary detail. And so instead of having to put thousands of data points into a system, you can rely on the beneficiary to actually pull the payment to wherever they want to. So it's easier for them to do mass payments. And it's applicable in the B2C space mostly and pension payments or payroll.","Hikmet Ersek","I think it's C2B strategy also - it's not only - what we do is that it's not only sender decision, it's also, should be a receiver decision, how to pullout the money, where to direct the money? And this kind of relationships helps us as we expand our receiver driven products, also to different countries. And one thing we realize that the receiver wants to also have the choice, sending money at cash or account. Or even sometimes dividing the money, half of the money to an account, half of the payout in cash. So something like that. Relationships like Hyperwallet hubs on our future [indiscernible].","Kevin Macquarrie","Great. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Thanks, Kevin.","Michael Salop","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Veytsman of Monness, Crespi.","Alex Veytsman","Yes, well, guys, just wanted to ask about the C2B growth. There was strong acceleration at this quarter from the prior quarter. What were the main drivers in C2B and kind of where do you see it for the rest of the year?","Rajesh Agrawal","Yeah. The business grew 11% in the first quarter and 12% this quarter on a constant currency basis. The drivers have been the same that we've seen for the last few quarters. We had good growth in our Argentina business and we also had good growth in our electronic payments business here in the U.S. And we have a little bit of offset from the declines in our cash walk-in business in the U.S., but pretty similar components of growth as we see in the last few quarters.","Alex Veytsman","And then on the B2B side also some acceleration I think from 7% to 9%. Is it pretty much the same landscape as before?","Rajesh Agrawal","As the business continues to execute that's the fourth quarter in a row that we've had good constant currency growth acceleration. They're focusing on driving continued expansion of our hedging and risk management capabilities as well as driving growth in our integrated payments vertical. So university payments, financial institutions, NGOs, these are typically more sticky relationships. They require a little bit of more of an integrated solution and we've been quite successful and we continue to expand that into more markets.","Alex Veytsman","Great. Thank you. Thank you, Salop.","Rajesh Agrawal","Thanks, Allen.","Michael Salop","I think we have one more person in the queue. So we'll take the final question.","Operator","Your next question will come from Matthew O'Neill of Autonomous.","Matthew O\u2019Neill","Good evening. Most of my questions have been answered. But just wanted to get an update on the [ph] 12\/2015 pricing that you discussed taking in from geographies in the U.S. and any important dates there, another three months into that?","Rajesh Agrawal","So our pricing actions where we put in place in 2015 are working, and we've been seeing good response to our pricing action, but they're really corridor and corridor specific. The pricing actions we put in the U.S. is in the higher band and we see the early transaction growth, it will take some time until you need some core quarters to understand really the response on the pricing actions but we see early signs of good transaction growth, on the higher bands. Other than that, we did some - the usual pricing actions quarter-by-quarter and country-by-country, but it's not that big and the current business model is pretty much working and we are satisfied with that.","Hikmet Ersek","I mean, we didn't price very much of the higher bands. And if you recall, it was 25% of the above $200 principal band, which half of the business roughly is below $200 and half is above. And we only price 25% of the above - about $200 principal bands. So, relatively small amount of the business that was priced, and we're seeing good results as Hikmet said.","Matthew O\u2019Neill","Great. Thank you very much.","Hikmet Ersek","Hey, thanks.","Matthew O\u2019Neill","Thanks, everyone.","Michael Salop","Thanks, everyone. Have a good day.","Operator","The conference is now concluded.

You\u2019ll be hearing more from Brendan in the near future. Hikmet?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, thank you, Brad and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased to say that our business delivered solid results in the fourth quarter driven by continued strong performance in our digital offerings. Fourth quarter revenue increased 3% on an adjusted constant currency basis and the adjusted EPS was $0.38. For the full year, our adjusted results were in line with the financial outlook we provided with third quarter results.","Returning cash to shareholders remained a priority as we returned over $880 million to shareholders in 2019. I am pleased that \u2013 I am pleased that today, we also announced a 13% increase in the quarterly dividend, which reflects the strength of business and strong profit expectations for 2020 and confidence in our new global strategy. 2019 was a pivotal year for Western Union as we made significant progress towards our vision of being the leader in cross-border, cross-currency money movement and payments, and delivered strong financial results.","So, I would like to take a moment to review some of the key strategic accomplishments from 2019. First, we simplified and created a sharper focus for the business largely completing our exit from non-core operations with the sale of Speedpay U.S. domestic bill payment service and the U.S. payment mortgage service in the second quarter. The $750 million in proceeds funded enhanced cash returns to shareholders. With the divestitures and smaller domestic money transfers, our business is now primarily focused on cross-border services for consumers, financial institutions, banks and other businesses. Our focus aligns with our core competencies in foreign exchange, cross-border settlement, compliance and global retail and account payout network.","Second accomplishment in 2019 was we continued to expand our digital business. The westernunion.com service now accounts for 15% for consumer revenues and cross-border revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter. We also began unlocking the value of our leading global physical and digital cross-border, cross-currency platform opening into third-party partners. For example, we edit two significant customers among others, STC Pay and Sberbank. Our total digital money transfer revenues increased 24% reported or 25% constant currency in the fourth quarter.","Today, we operate one of the most extensive digital platforms for cross-border, cross-currency money movement whether branded direct offerings like westernunion.com or digital offerings like \u2013 that enable our partners like TD Bank, Sberbank or STC Pay. both westernunion.com and white label offerings continue to have very strong growth potential. We have recently integrated digital services with three of Europe\u2019s largest postal institutions, France\u2019s La Banque Postale; Italy\u2019s Postepay, and the UK Post.","We also recently announced a new partnership with Bharti Airtel, a global telecommunications company with operations across Asia and Africa. We will soon offer real-time payments into millions of Airtel payments at bank accounts in India and mobile wallets across 14 countries in Africa. They have established non-remittance white label payments use cases, such as our partnership with Amazon for global e-commerce payments further expanding our addressable market to consumer-to-business payments. And in business payments, Western Union Business Solutions continued its growth trend, led by strong performance in the education and financial institution verticals, which translated into solid revenue growth of 4% on a constant currency basis for 2019.","So, it was a quite good year. While we made significant progress in 2019, we are not content and we'll continue to drive our business forward in 2020. We laid out our strategic vision at our September Investor Day and I would like to highlight three key strategic objectives we will focus on in 2020, enhancing our global network, driving our digital growth and optimizing our organization.","We will work to enhance our global payments network, improving the cost coverage and quality and further leverage it with additional third-party partnership. Today, our vast platform capabilities include both digital and physical money movement networks with over 550,000 locations across more than 200 countries and territories. Digital send capabilities in an over 70 countries and bank account payout capabilities in over 100 markets offering across to billions of accounts.","We will continue to grow our network and we'll also improve the quality by adding new value-added services like real-time account payout, which we expanded during 2019. We now offer customers to have ability to transfer funds into an account in real-time in over 20 countries with plans to expand it to over 100 countries this year. The value-added payout services should help us gain new customers segments such as e-commerce and financial institutions.","We will drive our digital strategy forward to serve consumers whenever, wherever, and however they desire and expand aggressively over the next few years, including larger opportunities like the $120 billion outbound market in the Gulf States or the $25 billion outbound market in China and India. Our goal is to evolve in the world\u2019s ultimate agnostic network for payments and cross-border money movement.","We are also transitioning our Western Union branded consumer business from a transaction-based model to a lifetime value model, optimizing the customer experience and improving retention. To achieve this goal, we have further developing and applying strong data analytic capabilities to our rich pool of global data over 200 countries, allowing us to price dynamically, market more precisely and ultimately enhance our ability to drive revenue growth.","Our third strategic objective is to strengthen and optimize our organization. Western Union has tremendous talent, building on the foundation of WU Way Lean capabilities and the transformation office. We will leverage internal resources more effectively to improve execution, enhance profitability, and drive margin expansion.","In addition to that, we will continue to selectively add new team members, who can impact our business. A great example is the recent addition of Shelly Swanback, our new president of product & platform. Shelley comes to Western Union from Accenture, where she was instrumental in building the firm's digital services. Shelly reports directly to me and play a critical role in enhancing our global platform.","Finally, while we will continue to focus on driving shareholder value, its strong financial results, we will also focus on delivering value for all stakeholders to our environmental, social and governance efforts. The details of these efforts can be found in our 2018 ESG report. We planned to issue our 2019 ESG report later this spring","And one more thing, during the past month, we have also achieved a significant milestone in our U.S. Joint Settlement Agreements. The term of the deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice expired on January 19. under the DPA, to close our \u2013 to close out this matter, the DOJ has 90 days from the expiration to file for dismissal of the charges. We understand that DOJ will make emotion to dismiss the DPA promptly. We will continue to work to protect our customers and partners by maintaining strong compliance programs, which we believe give us a competitive advantage.","In closing, we made significant progress in 2019 and we begin 2020 better positioned than ever before to capitalize on the significant opportunity in the large and growing money transfer and global payments market. I'm confident in our ability to deliver the 2022 margin and EPS targets and our outlook this year reflects our expectations for a strong start to achieve our goals.","Raj, will discuss our financial outlook and long-term targets in more detail. I remain excited about our long-term prospects and we like thank to all our team members for their hard work and commitment. And a big thank you to our business partners, agents, consumers and shareholders from all over the world for your trust and loyalty. With that, I'll turn the call over to Raj.","Raj Agrawal","Thank you, Hikmet. I will focus my comments primarily on the fourth quarter, the similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules. Given the impact of the divestiture on prior period comparisons and restructuring costs from our productivity program, there are a number of puts and takes in our fourth quarter results.","Our adjusted results removed most of the impact of the factors which will not affect our future results. Fourth quarter revenue of $1.3 billion declined 7% compared to the prior year period, while adjusted constant currency revenue, which excludes our divested businesses in the prior year period increased 3%. Currency translation, net of the impact of hedges reduced fourth quarter revenue by approximately $42 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the depreciation of the Argentine peso.","The decline in peso negatively impacted reported revenue by 2% while the effect of inflation on our Argentina businesses is estimated to have positively impacted both reported and constant currency revenue by approximately 1%. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment reported revenue was flat or increased 1% constant currency, while transactions declined 1% primarily due to some civil unrest, macroeconomic and market specific issues in a few countries.","Total C2C cross-border principle increased 1% or 2% on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction was flat or increased 1% constant currency. The spread between C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 1% with a negative 1% impact from currency. Pricing was higher in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and was largely offset by mix. The net impact was positive on revenue in the quarter.","Turning to the regional results, North America revenue grew 1% on a reported and constant currency basis, while transactions declined 4%. Revenue growth in the region was led by the U.S.-to-Mexico corridor and other U.S. outbound businesses which was partially offset by continued declines in U.S. domestic money transfer.","U.S. DMT trends were similar to last quarter and we expect declines will continue this year as we manage the business for cash flow. Revenue in the Europe and CIS region increased 1% or 2% on a constant currency basis driven by Spain, Russia and France. Transactions in the region increased 5% aided again by the Sberbank white-label business. Revenue in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region was flat on both reported and constant currency basis. Revenue trends in the region reflected slower growth in Saudi Arabia and in the UAE in the quarter, civil unrest in Lebanon and continued hard currency limitations in certain African markets.","Transactions declined 1% and strong growth in digital transactions was offset by declines in retail, sends from the region to India were negatively impacted by a cash tax implemented in September that impacted our agent's ability to make cash payments. It was subsequently removed, but it may take some time to return to previous transaction levels. We are also making adjustments to marketing, pricing and other incentives in the region to improve growth.","The Latin America and Caribbean region delivered strong constant currency revenue growth led by Chile and Mexico outbound, despite civil unrest in multiple South American countries. Revenue in the region declined 2% on a reported basis or increased 6% constant currency, while transactions grew 4%.","In the APAC region revenue declined 10% on both reported and constant currency basis. Revenue trends improved compared to last quarter\u2019s rate, partially due to pricing actions in certain markets. Transactions were down 7% in the region, driven primarily by the Philippines domestic business, which has limited impact on profits.","Digital money transfer revenues increased 25% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, including westernunion.com and third-party white label services. Westernunion.com revenue grew 17% or 18% constant currency. wu.com now represents 15% of total C2C revenue in the quarter. Cross-border westernunion.com revenue increased approximately 26% which was partially offset by declines in domestic money transfer.","Business solutions revenue was flat on a reported basis or increased 1% constant currency and represented 7% of company revenues in the quarter. Constant currency revenue growth was driven by strong performance in Europe as well as strong growth in the education and financial institution verticals which were offset by slower growth in hedging services.","Other revenues, which consists primarily of our retail bill payments businesses in the U.S. and Argentina decreased 52% in the quarter, which reflects the impact of the Speedpay and Paymap divestitures in May. The Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina posted good increases in transactions and local currency revenue growth. Other revenues represented 7% total company revenues in the quarter.","Financial margins and profitability, we will focus on consolidated margins as segment margins are not comparable with the prior-year period due to reallocation of corporate costs following the divestiture of the Speedpay business. We are also providing adjusted metrics to exclude restructuring expenses, merger and acquisition costs and related tax effects.","The consolidated GAAP operating margin was 17.3% in the quarter compared to 19.3% in the prior year period. The decline was primarily due to higher marketing investment compared to the prior year period. The impact of restructuring expenses in the current quarter and the divestiture of the Speedpay in May of 2019.","We incurred $17 million of restructuring expense in the fourth quarter and $115 million for the full year, which was slightly higher than we expected in 2019 due to the timing of some items, but we continue to expect a total of approximately $150 million of restructuring expense with the remainder to be encouraged this year. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 18.7% compared to 19.9% of the prior year period with the decrease primarily due to higher marketing investment and the Speedpay divestiture.","Speedpay contributed about 60 basis points to last year's fourth quarter margin, while foreign exchange hedges provided a benefit of $7 million in the current quarter and a benefit of $4 million in the prior year period. The GAAP effective tax rate was 31.4% in the quarter compared to 9.8% of the prior year period, while the adjusted tax rate of 24.5% compared to 6.8% in the prior year period. The increase in the GAAP and adjusted tax rates primarily due to certain discrete benefits in the prior year period. Also, while we expected the fourth quarter to have the highest tax rate of the year, it was further increased by one-time settlement in certain geographies. The GAAP rate also included additional taxes associated with the May 2019 divestitures.","GAAP earnings per share in the quarter was $0.32 compared to $0.48 in the prior year period and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.38 compared to $0.51 in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in both GAAP and adjusted EPS was primarily due to higher effective tax rates, the divestitures and higher marketing investment partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. GAAP cash flow from operating activities was $915 million for the full year, which exceeded our outlook primarily due to favorable working capital items. Adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $1.1 billion in 2019. Capital expenditures were approximately $34 million in the quarter and $128 million for the full year. At the end of the year, we had cash at $1.5 billion and debt of $3.2 billion.","During the fourth quarter, we issued $500 million and 2.85% notes. We redeemed $325 million in notes due this year and reduce commercial paper. We returned $149 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, including $84 million in dividends and $65 million of share repurchases, which represented approximately 2.5 million shares. The outstanding share count at quarter end was 418 million shares, and we had $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorizations, which expires December 2021.","As Hikmet noted, we're off to a good start to deliver on our strategic initiatives and restructuring plans, which is reflected in our strong operating margin and EPS growth outlook for 2020. Our outlook assumes no material change from current macro economic conditions. We expect GAAP revenues for the full year to be a flat-to-low single-digit decline, primarily due to the divestiture of Speedpay in May 2019.","On an adjusted constant currency basis we expect low-single-digit revenue growth this year, which excludes Speedpay revenues and any benefit related to Argentina inflation. Operating margin on a GAAP basis is expected to be approximately 20%, while adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 21% as we continue to focus on generating efficiencies and we will begin to benefit from restructuring savings weighted toward the second half.","We continue to expect to realize approximately $50 million of annual savings from restructuring in 2020 increasing to $100 million in 2021. In addition to this, we expect to realize other efficiency savings of $50 million by 2022 for a total of $150 million of annual savings in 2022. We expected GAAP and adjusted effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens range this year.","GAAP EPS for the year is expected to be in a range of $1.87 to $1.97, while adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of a $1.95 to $2.05, which represents growth in the teens. Cash flow from operating activities is expected to be approximately $900 million, while adjusted cash flow from operating activities is expected to be approximately $1 billion. We expect to spend approximately $500 million on share repurchases for the full year.","In summary, we delivered our full year adjusted financial outlook in 2019. We made good progress in our restructuring activities and our new global strategy designed to drive profitability, efficiency and long-term growth. We generated strong cash flow and continue to return significant funds to shareholders. We look forward to delivering on our strategy and our long-term financial targets of operating margin of approximately 23% in 2022 and a low-double-digit earnings per share CAGR for the three years ending 2022 off of adjusted 2019 EPS.","Thanks for joining the call today, and operator we are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Korey Marcello","Hey guys, this is Korey Marcello on for Brian Keane. I wanted to ask; I guess first on the guidance, I know the three-year outlook is calling for 2% to 3% growth in consumer, but any color just for next year in terms of how you think business solutions and maybe other revenue will shape up. I guess in particular you're going to have some lapping impacts from the divestiture. So I didn't know if you had any comments on sort of the quarterly cadence of revenue growth for the year?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I can jump in, but let me start. Look in the fundamentals, nothing has changed. We really assume that our business will perform; especially our digital expansion will perform. The digital expansion for us is it branded or white labeling and Bill is going to go and that you saw the recent numbers on our \u2013 growth numbers are quite impressive and that's from a different base than the competitors have, right? We have been investing here for a long time and growing very strong in digital expansion, that continue to go.","The other part is that dropping money on real-time on accounts that will continue to grow. And offering retail cash payout and dropping money in real time. It's a huge competitive advantage within our capabilities. And look, we also started to drop money for businesses, right? I mean we are collecting for Amazon \u2013 from consumer in different countries, businesses. We are doing transactions for third parties and our business-to-business had a good year growing by 4%.","So generally I would say that nothing has changed from our Investors Day. We are in a good momentum. We like our business, we like how we are affirming, especially those are transformational activities and our efficiency activities are very promising. And we are still in targeted our 2022 goals. Anyone you want to add something?","Raj Agrawal","I think you've covered it. So I think we're good.","Korey Marcello","Okay, great. I guess just as a follow-up you mentioned obviously Amazon and third parties there. I guess, can you give maybe a broader update on kind of what the pipeline looks like for those third parties and in particular maybe the Amazon partnership, any update there in terms of like plans for the year and market go live. And is there anything kind of baked into the guidance from some of this stuff that you've called out as more longer term, I guess for next year? Thanks.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think it's as you said, it's a longer term. We started in a very good stronger digital growth; definitely our partnership helps on our strong growth, right? And look, we go-to-market, we are talking and in some countries we offering our dotcom business in some countries on our digital white labeling part, depending on our partner, depending on the legal environment, depending on the consumer relationship. But the good news is that the partners are choosing our capabilities to move cross border cross currency money. And that's \u2013 that capability having two countries and capable of operating in 200 countries is unique.","And so, I mean, it's still small but growing very, very strong and has good potential and we will definitely update with additional partners. I mean, we recently signed three big postal offices like the La Banque Postale, UK Post and the Italy Post. Italy post is for instance having access to 7 million consumers \u2013 Italian consumers with their mobile phones, right. And they will go \u2013 they do transaction cross-border by using our platform. So it's quite impressive and we dropped money in real time for them.","And that's going to continue. It depends really on the partnership how they choose, if they choose Western Union brand or being a partner like Amazon, which Amazon uses their own codes, we are referred them as service provider to collect money for their online services.","Korey Marcello","All right, thanks guys.","Hikmet Ersek","Thanks Korey.","Raj Agrawal","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, this is Andrew, on behalf of Darrin.","Raj Agrawal","Hey, Andrew.","Unidentified Analyst","I wanted to drill into North America. Hey, how's it going Raj? I want to drill into North America for a little bit. It looks like the Delta between transactions and revenues was relatively stable over the last couple quarters and widened a little bit this quarter? I was wondering, is there any impact of the digital transactions in that number or is that largely all domestic? And if you can provide any other additional color on what you saw in domestic in the quarter and further into the outlook for 2020?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. North America, I'd say that one of the key driver was really declines in our domestic money transfer transactions in the U.S. We also have a very small Philippines intra business that has a heavy number of transactions, which was also declining. So that has an impact on overall mix.","The U.S.-to-Mexico market also was just softer from a market standpoint, although we continue to gain share there. And then we\u2019ve also put new principal limits in place for U.S.-to-Cuba, so some of these things had an impact in the quarter. But overall I would say the digital part of the business, if you look at the cross-border part of wu.com again, which North America is a contributor there obviously that grew at 26%. So the digital part continues to do well. The domestic part of digital, certainly it was a little bit worse in the quarter than it was in the previous quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","And then that new metric, the digital revenues that you called out, how should we think about that mix across all the different regions that you have? I mean, I think it's the first time that you've really been able to separate them like that. So maybe just letting us get a better sense of how we should think about that across the segments? Thanks.","Raj Agrawal","Yes, I mean, right now, the digital, which grew 25% of the quarter includes wu.com and as well as the digital revenue for partners. We only have a handful of those right now. The two primary ones are Saudi Telecom in Saudi Arabia and Sberbank in Russia. So those are the two primary ones that are driving a lot of the additional growth. So there's not much to cut in terms of where it is globally, it's in those two regions if you will, in the Middle East as well as in Europe.","And, certainly we want to sign more partners and more opportunities. We really look at the total digital is being one type of offering, with branded and non-branded offerings and they're both leveraging our platform capabilities, right?","Hikmet Ersek","They basically use our same platform, go to market and it's the partner's decision if they use their brand, in that case in Saudi Arabia for Saudi Telecom user, but it's the westernunion.com platform and our platform, by seeing platform and our network, we dropped money in our network. So, it's really a digital transaction with different brands.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, thanks guys.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ben Budish","Hey guys, this is actually by Ben Budish on for Ramsey. I wanted to kind of follow-up on the white-label wallet you guys talked about and just kind of looking at the growth in Europe versus the Middle East. I know you called out some one-time factors impacting the Middle East growth, but, is there anything to read through there, like maybe growth in transactions that's perfect and are growing better than those STC or is that really all related to kind of those one-time factors that you called out?","Raj Agrawal","Yes, I would say most of it is related to the one-time factors and we'll see how long the Lebanon, civil unrest be called out, there\u2019s some in Syria and then obviously the India tax is also the other factor, which the issue was reversed. So that tax came into play late in the third quarter, but then it was reversed in the fourth quarter. But we did have some customer attrition and that's what we're working through right now.","So we've assumed that in the first part of this year we'll see some of that, but we should be able to work through that as the months come along here. So it's really related to those factors rather than any shift in mix if you will.","Ben Budish","Okay. And then just kind of following up on again on the white-labels, would you say that performance has been kind of in line with expectations? I mean, we've got like a little hint at the back of the Analyst Day and it looks like things were going quite nicely, is there any change to that or does it seem like things are kind of moving along according to plan?","Raj Agrawal","Yes, I would say things are moving along very much according to plan. They're doing quite well and we're very excited about them. And we want to continue to add more and more partners to the mix.","Ben Budish","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Raj Agrawal","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Vasu Govil of KBW. Please go ahead.","Vasu Govil","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one on the pricing front, it seems like clearly that's been a tailwind for a couple of quarters now. Can you talk about whether you are starting to see an impact from your dynamic pricing initiative or it's just the underlying trends are better. And then if you could also comment on what's enabling the stability in the pricing environment because it doesn't seem like the competitive environment is necessarily abated?","Hikmet Ersek","Well pricing environment obviously as we said earlier, partly impacted by mix, partly with the strong pricing environment. We feel comfortable with our dynamic pricing activities. As you know, we adjust our pricing corridor-by-corridor, even a ZIP code by ZIP code, customer behavior by customer behavior and this effort started and we start in few corridors and we will expand that globally. And that\u2019s something that we are very excited about that you can compare like a big airliner, you fly one direction. you have different customers with different needs, with different price payments. That\u2019s going to happen and that\u2019s what we are aiming to and we started in some corridors and we see good return on that. And that\u2019s just the beginning of the story though and we are quite excited about that.","Vasu Govil","Great. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up on the transaction growth trends, Raj. I think you mentioned on the previous question that you\u2019re assuming that, that will kind of continue to be weak in the first half. Is that true for just the India piece or all the various one timers that you saw this quarter? And then just to confirm, does coronavirus have any impact on your business, positive or negative?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. In terms of the one-time items that we called out for Q4, obviously, the ones that are under our control where we\u2019re auctioning those \u2013 there are some things that are more country specific issues, civil unrest. It\u2019s not really under our control, but we\u2019ve assumed that some of these things will continue for the first part of this year. We don\u2019t expect them to continue for the entire year. but certainly we\u2019ll update you as we at least see more. from a coronavirus standpoint, we have not assumed any material impact for coronavirus, China for us is about 2% of our total revenues and it\u2019s mostly inbound in nature. And that\u2019s, obviously the conditions that are evolving every single day. So, we need to see how that plays out.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. And China, I mean, first of all, we support our employees and look after them and it\u2019s very important those agent locations, but most of the agents\u2019 locations are active. And as you said, it\u2019s only 2% of our business. But at the same time, I want to mention that also we can drop money in minutes on an account in China. So, if people don\u2019t feel to go to the location and have a physical payout, they could also do it online and this is one of the growing parts of our business. And so we do really don\u2019t see big impact from coronavirus yet. Now, I can\u2019t judge it generally, what we\u2019ll have that go to general global economy, but at the specific areas we don\u2019t see big impact on our business.","Vasu Govil","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Raj Agrawal","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, good afternoon. Appreciate you guys taking the question.","Hikmet Ersek","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey","just conceptually, I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the business, Raj. I think you made a comment about the domestic business increasingly being a source of free cash and presumably, return of capital. it would appear that strictly looking at wu.com, it\u2019s 100% of your CTC growth today. should we think about that as sort of the feature and the balance of the business is really being a cash cow for lack of a better term and fueling investments to support digital and returning capital to shareholders. Is that a reasonable framework?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. I think Andrew, as we laid out at Investor Day, our \u2013 we said that our assumption was for 2% to 3% overall growth over the next three years and that has not changed. And the composition of that was a flattish type retail business. obviously, we\u2019d like to get a little bit of growth out of it, but we do believe that can be the case. And then we expected digital to grow in the 20% range and off of a base of $600 million last year. That\u2019s quite a bit of contribution. And then we also expected and continue to expect that the B2B business will grow in the mid single-digit range. So, those are the components we\u2019re thinking about. Obviously, we want to drive to more than just 2% to 3% growth, that\u2019s not satisfactory, and that\u2019s where really our platform strategy comes into play and signing more and more partners as we move along.","But just last point on the domestic business, it was about 6% of our total revenues last year. So, it\u2019s becoming a smaller and smaller piece overall of the company, and that\u2019s probably a trend we\u2019re going to see for a little while, so \u2013 and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve assumed in our outlook for this year as well.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. So, still hoping that that retail business I guess can turn the corner for you?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. Yes. Go ahead.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. I mean, we assume a flat business, but nobody has the strength of retail. The mix compared with our global coverage and most importantly, you connect digital with retail, that we can payout in different economical environments, different \u2013 we serve different customer segments on the send side. We do serve different customers on the receive side. And combining that, it\u2019s a big advantage for us, that drives the growth of digital paying out in cash or paying out in an account or paying out in a wallet, and that\u2019s in real-time, it\u2019s a huge, and that\u2019s definitely going to continue happening in the retail business.","Raj Agrawal","Yes. And I think as you saw at Investor Day and it continues to be the case, the opportunity on the retail side is to drive more dynamic pricing capabilities. So, time of day, day of week, location density, those kinds of things give us confidence that we can keep the retail business in the flattish type range, because there\u2019s more opportunity there that we haven\u2019t fully maximized yet.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And I apologize if I missed it, but it looks like yields on wu.com and improved again this quarter. What \u2013 what\u2019s driving that?","Raj Agrawal","Yes, I mean there \u2013 there was certainly some mix impact from the domestic business and things, because we\u2019re running the domestic parts of our business for cash, if you will. And so that certainly has a positive mix on the revenue side. There was also some pricing that we did as we\u2019ve mentioned, net pricing was beneficial net of the mix in the quarter, and so we feel good about where the overall digital business is. We had 25% revenue growth in digital, but over 30% transaction growth in that digital business. So, we\u2019re doing quite well overall on the digital side.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. So that\u2019s pricing specifically at wu.com or across\u2026","Raj Agrawal","On the branded wu.com offering? Yes.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Raj Agrawal","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Chiodo of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Tim Chiodo","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about the unit economics of some of the digital white labeling programs. I know, we\u2019ve talked about in the past that the revenue per transaction is obviously a little bit lower, but maybe, you could talk about the absolute EBIT dollars per transaction and how that might compare to a traditional Western Union transaction?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. First of all, I would say it\u2019s still early stages on the white label partners and we\u2019re going to continue to learn on what kind of economics they can provide, but you\u2019re absolutely right. You typically will have a lower starting point from a revenue per transaction standpoint, but we also don\u2019t have much cost in that transaction either as we do in our branded offerings. The wu.com transaction, we are paying, we\u2019re investing heavily in marketing to acquire customers. We also have fraud losses and other things that we\u2019re paying for. But in a white label transaction, we are being delivered a customer, who wants to do a transaction with us and has good funds, right?","So, we don\u2019t spend the marketing dollars there and we really have the processing costs. So, the margins in the white label offerings can be quite high actually and we\u2019re going to learn more as we launch more of these partners. But based on our early experience, that can be a very profitable business. And last thing I would say is that we see it largely as an incremental business, so incremental revenues and incremental profits.","Tim Chiodo","Right on, thank you. [Audio Dip] to get a little bit more at the absolute dollar. So, I understand that the revenue is lower and the margin percentage could be higher, but could be \u2013 could the absolute dollar actually be similar?","Raj Agrawal","It depends. It depends. I can tell you one of the examples we have that\u2019s currently going on is very profitable. The other one is not as profitable, but we\u2019re getting, again, incremental revenues and incremental profits. So, it\u2019s not \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s important on how much money we\u2019re making per transaction. But as long as we\u2019re getting incremental business for the company and it\u2019s within our overall framework that\u2019s the most important thing for us. So, we\u2019ll learn more overtime and we wouldn\u2019t be doing this if it wasn\u2019t profitable for us.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. it\u2019s both are \u2013 sorry, both are profitable and \u2013 but it depends on the partner, I mean also the new additions of our \u2013 the post offices will be very profitable, but it depends on the partner and the geography, and which corridor you are placing that, and it\u2019s like started our westernunion.com business. As you know, as we started, it was only \u2013 as we started to report, it was only 1% of our revenue. Now, it\u2019s about 15% of our consumer revenue. It\u2019s a huge part of that. And same approach, we think also could be done by our digital business like adding on the combining wu.com and digital business will be a big part of the future of the company and will be very profitable.","Tim Chiodo","Great. Thanks a lot. That\u2019s really helpful. I appreciate it.","Raj Agrawal","Sure, no problem.","Brad Windbigler","Andrea, do we have anyone else in the queue?","Operator","There\u2019s no one in the queue at this time. [Operator Instructions]","Brad Windbigler","Great. Okay. Thank you everyone for joining. We\u2019ll end it here. Thanks.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect."],"22693":["The Western Union Co.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Alan Salop - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Laura. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's 2016 second quarter results, and then we will take your questions.","The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.","Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2015 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We've reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section.","All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of The Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased with our second quarter results and with the resilience of our business. Revenue increased 3% on a constant currency basis, consistent with the last several quarters, despite the challenging global market environment.","Our consumer money transfer business was once again led by strong performance from westernunion.com, which delivered 20% constant currency revenue growth. Regionally, the money transfer business was aided by continued strong results from the U.S.","The international picture was more mixed, with growth in some key European countries but continued challenges from many oil industry dependent markets. In addition to consumer money transfer, our business solutions and consumer bill payments businesses each delivered solid constant currency results.","Overall, we continued to invest heavily in our technology infrastructure and currency remains a negative, but despite these factors, we generated solid profitability in the quarter. We also returned over $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which means in total we returned $475 million in the first half of the year.","Before discussing our strategic progress, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the global geopolitical environment, including Brexit implications for Europe. As you know, the world has experienced significant geopolitical turbulence in recent months, in addition to what we have seen the last couple of years.","Terrorist attacks in many countries, the attempted coup in Turkey, elections focused on immigration, currency volatility and many other such events have created headlines just over the last few weeks. There's a long list of countries dealing with major issues across the Middle East, Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere.","Despite the uncertainties surrounding these events, our business has remained stable, thanks to our global reach and diversified portfolio of countries, as well as resilience of our consumer base.","While these types of events will likely have more impact in the coming years, we will continue to adjust our resources appropriately and work through the challenges to provide our needed services around the world.","As for Brexit, U.K. is an important market for both business solutions and our consumer money transfer business and the country represented almost 7% of total company revenues last year.","In the short term, we saw reduced trading activities from our Business Solution customers in the U.K. in the weeks leading up to Brexit vote, but a heavy increase in the last week of the quarter following the decision.","Overall in the quarter, we saw good growth in the U.K. B2B business and the C2C business increased as well in constant currency terms. Longer term, the impact of Brexit is still uncertain as we like others must wait for the U.K. and the European Union to negotiate the exit agreements. However, in the near-term we do not expect Brexit to cause significant disruption to our businesses or operations in the U.K. or Europe.","Turning now to our strategic initiatives: we continue to make progress on several fronts. With westernunion.com, mobile continues to lead the way in the U.S. with nearly 60% of the countries westernunion.com transactions initiated on mobile in the quarter. Internationally, we introduced upgraded mobile transaction apps for westernunion.com in eight markets. Overall, we now have online transaction sites in 37 countries, with mobile apps in 11 of these. Additionally, similar to what we have done with Viber and WeChat in the U.S., we just added our money transfer services to the Yandex.Money mobile app in Russia. So Yandex consumers can now initiate the transfers on their phones to Western Union locations around the world.","As I have mentioned in the past, one of our key growth initiatives for the future is to capture some of the cross-border business being delivered into accounts around the world and we continue to build out our network. Currently, we have the capability to deliver funds into billions of accounts in over 50 countries.","On the retail side, we recently signed several key agent agreements including a renewal with Rite Aid in the U.S. and the new agreement with Walmart de M\u00e9xico. And in Western Union Business Solutions, we have activated over 6,000 business clients on our new integrated digital platform, WU EDGE, and we'll continue to roll out enhancements and build the importer and exporter network.","Finally, I would like to mention the recent announcement that we have successfully completed the primary recommendation for our Southwest border settlement agreement. Our teams have worked very hard over the last several years to reach this stage and the actions taken have contributed to an overall strengthening of our compliance programs. While compliance enhancements are a part of our business model and a long-term competitive advantage, we are pleased to be able to complete this important milestone for the company.","So to recap, we have continued to produce solid results and are on-track to deliver our business outlook for 2016. We are making good progress on our strategies and have made strong advances in our compliance programs.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the second quarter results in more detail.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1%, or increased 3% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $49 million, compared to the prior year period.","In the Consumer to Consumer segment reported revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 2% constant currency, while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was again led by westernunion.com, with regional growth led by North America and Latin America.","Total C2C cross-border principal declined 1% compared to the prior year period and was flat on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction declined 5%, or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 4 percentage points, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from currency.","Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1 point in the quarter, while there was no net impact from pricing. While the previously implemented Argentina price reductions are still affecting the spread, these were largely offset by FX spread increases in other parts of the world. We continue to find the overall pricing environment to be stable and do not expect significant changes in the near future.","Turning to the regions, consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movement as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. In the second quarter, the North America business was strong. Revenue grew 6% or 7% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound growth was again driven by sends to Mexico and Latin America.","In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de M\u00e9xico principal and transaction data for the second quarter. The U.S. domestic money transfer revenue also grew in the quarter, posting a 4% increase on transaction growth of 3%.","We have begun adjusting prices in some additional cities to the same levels we implemented in part of the country last year. Due to the very limited amount of revenue that is affected, we don't expect these changes to have a significant impact on our pricing investment this year.","In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3% or 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 3%. Similar to prior quarters, Germany delivered good growth, but this was offset by continued declines in Russia.","In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4% or 3% constant currency, and transactions were down 5%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results, with Nigeria and Libya the main drivers of the revenue decline in the quarter. In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue was down 3% or 1% constant currency. Transactions decreased 3% as received markets in the region, including India continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittance system in oil-producing countries.","Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region was flat, but increased 6% constant currency on transaction growth of 12%. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., while the spread between revenue and transaction growth was caused by the price reductions and currency depreciation in Argentina.","westernunion.com C2C revenue which is included in the regional numbers just discussed grew 19% in the quarter, or 20% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. westernunion.com transactions increased 25% with U.S. originated online transactions growing 27%.","In the Consumer-to-Business segment revenue declined 2%, but increased 12% on a constant currency basis. The depreciation of the Argentine peso caused the decline in the reported revenues, constant currency revenue growth was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses which were partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. Business Solutions reported revenues increased 3% or 6% on a constant currency basis aided by strong growth from Europe.","Turning to margins and profitability: we did incur a $15 million accrual in the quarter, or $10 million after-tax for a legal matter. This relates to a Federal Trade Commission matter regarding our consumer protection and anti-fraud programs, as noted in our 10-Qs. The matter is still pending and the final resolution is still uncertain, so we will not be able to provide additional details at this time.","Including this accrual, the consolidated operating profit margin was 18.9% in the quarter, compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of last year, or 20.7% excluding the impact of the Paymap settlement in the prior year period. The FTC accrual negatively impacted the current quarter's margin by 110 basis points. Other factors affecting the margin included incremental technology expense, and the negative impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by reductions in compensation related costs and other expenses.","Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $11 million, compared to $20 million of gains in the second quarter of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $23 million in the quarter, compared to prior year.","Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue, down from 3.7% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 23.7% in the quarter, compared to 22.7% in the prior year period, or 25.2% excluding the Paymap settlement.","Our tax rate was 7.6% in the quarter, compared to 8.5% in the second quarter of last year, or 11.8% excluding the settlement charge. The tax rate in the current quarter benefited from changes in tax contingency reserves and other discrete items, including the impact of the FTC accrual which lowered the rate by approximately 180 basis points. Including all of these items, and some additional benefits expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 12%.","Earnings per share of $0.42 in the quarter, compared to $0.36 in the prior year, or $0.41 excluding the Paymap charge. The FTC accrual negatively affected the current quarter's earnings by $0.02 per share. The C2C segment operating margin was 21.5%, compared to 23.3% in the prior year, and was affected by 130 basis points by the accrual.","Similar to the company overall, other factors affecting the C2C margin included higher technology expense and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by reductions in compensation related costs and other expenses. The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 11.5% in the quarter, compared to 18.3% excluding the Paymap settlement charge in the prior year period.","The margin decline compared to the adjusted margin a year ago was primarily due to increased technology expense and customer mix. Business Solutions improved operating profit to $5 million, or a 5% margin from breakeven in the prior year period. Business Solutions EBITDA margin increased to 18.1% from 12.1%.","The operating profit improvement was driven by increased revenues and reductions in compensation related expenses. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter, compared to $12 million in the prior year.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet: cash flow from operating activities was $486 million year-to-date through June. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.2 billion.","Approximately 30% of the cash was held by United States entities. During the second quarter, we paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for total of $78 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $394 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at end of June was 488 million shares.","Based on the first half results and recent business trends, we are affirming our full year financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin, and operating cash flow. The GAAP revenue outlook has been decreased slightly to reflect changes in several key foreign currencies including the Euro and the British pound against the U.S. dollar and we now expect the GAAP revenue change to be about 400 basis points lower than the constant currency increase.","The impact on operating profit from the currency adjustments is largely expected to be offset by hedge benefits with hedge gains currently projected at approximately $45 million, compared to approximately $40 million in the prior outlook.","Also as mentioned earlier, we now expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 12%, which is down from the mid-teens expectation in the prior outlook as we are benefiting from several favorable outcomes relative to our reserves and discrete items.","We have also included the impact of the $15 million FTC accrual in our outlook although we still expect operating margins of approximately 20%. As a result of all these factors, the earnings per share outlook has been narrowed to a range of $1.60 to $1.70, up from the prior range of $1.58 to $1.70.","So, to summarize, we are pleased with the second quarter results, which came in largely as expected and our full year earnings outlook has been narrowed, primarily to reflect the lower tax rate and the legal matter accrual.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Tien-Tsin.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hello, Tien-Tsin.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hello. Good afternoon. Thanks for all the slides and the details. Just a couple questions. The digital piece, it looks like, accelerated a little bit here despite the macro. I think MoneyGram saw some decel there. What's driving that acceleration within the digital piece? Is it more distribution or are you seeing more effectiveness with your marketing?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's both, but mainly our strong growth comes from the U.S. and 60% of the transactions done in the U.S., westernunion.com are mobile transactions, U.S. outbound and U.S. intra was very good. But also the global expansion, Europe, we see also very strong growth on mobile and on the westernunion.com.","Currently, we do have about 11 countries grew mobile apps and as you recall, Tien-Tsin, we opened also an office in Singapore to expand our success, which Khalid and the team did in Singapore, sorry, in San Francisco, the same success, we want to do that also in Singapore, expanding globally and that has been paying off. So the growth has been very strong.","So \u2013 also I would say also the customer's staying loyal there. Once they are \u2013 they are still new customers, still we don't see cannibalization, 80% of the transactions looks like are new and the pricing has been \u2013 we did some pricing action but some pricing has been stable also. And I think we have the right strategy, Tien-Tsin.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. No, that's great. It sounds like it. Let me ask as my follow-up to both of you just on the revenue guidance. You're keeping it constant. It looks like you're running 2% to 3% FX-neutral revenue growth first half of the year. You're still guiding low to mid-single digits. Given what you called out in terms of the macro and the tax, what-not, is it more likely we'll see it at the lower end of that, or is there still potential for it to accelerate into the mid-single digits given what you see?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes Tien-Tsin, this is Raj. I would just say that we've given a range of possible outcomes. There's still potential for it to change. There are some components of our business that are accelerating. You saw digital accelerate in the second quarter. We have high growth expectations there. We have some other areas that are accelerating as well. But we're also cautious with some of the challenges that we see in other parts of the world.","So we'll see what happens in some of the oil-related markets like Saudi Arabia or Nigeria and Libya, and we're watching those very closely. So those will certainly have an impact and that will have an impact on the overall outcome in the end.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're overall confident with our outlook.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Could you give us an update on how your conversations on WU Connect are going, conversations with prospective social media companies, and the potential for new signings in the near term?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, good question, Sara. Hi. Viber and WeChat is still on. We have the U.S. agreements there. We just signed Yandex in Russia, which is also same like a mobile operator and a social media company, consumer do use Yandex and they can send also money from their mobile phones worldwide to 200 countries.","The other ones are \u2013 obviously we are not making a comment for the ongoing negotiations, but we are still in a testing phase. It's not material yet, right, Sara, but we are still learning. We started recently a few weeks ago with some of the marketing activities with Viber and WeChat. I think we can give you more color about how their customers are reacting in end of Q3, maybe end of Q4. It takes time, but we are still very excited and we are still also in contact with other social media companies.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. And then just a quick cost question \u2013 could you talk about the incremental tech spending, how that's been trending, if we're at a full $50 million (22:50) annualized run rate exiting the quarter? And do you get any benefit from having now successfully completed the recommendations made by the monitor?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Sara, this is Raj. The technology spend, I would say, continues to ramp and this year we'll be spending well over $50 million incremental to last year. In any given quarter it's going to be dependent on which activities we actually have going on in the technology area. But I would say we're seeing a good level of technology spend in the second quarter and we're continuing to ramp there.","From a Southwest border standpoint, we've been \u2013 our spending there has been coming down for the last couple of years as we've been putting some of these programs in place, and that's related to the primary recommendations, but we've also got secondary recommendations that we're putting in place where some spending will continue. And then obviously we have a global compliance program where we're spending in various parts of the world for various kinds of activities, so Southwest border was only a small piece of that.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","And next we have a question from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Bryan.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan. A question on the third quarter. When I look at the comps, the comps get easier in Europe and APAC. And you also talked about increased B2B transaction post the Brexit. So, as we think about the third quarter -- and I understand you don't give quarterly guidance \u2013 but should we just think about the comps being slightly easier, which helps you on the transaction side?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Ashish, as you said, we don't give a quarterly outlook, but the U.K. activity and Brexit, we saw strong activity in the last week, but eventually things will level out there. So it remains to be seen on how much heightened activity will continue, but we're watching that closely, obviously.","You have a lot of things that are going on around the world, a lot of different activities. We've continued to see good growth in our U.S. business. The European business, we've gotten good growth from Germany in the quarter, but that's been offset by challenges in other parts of the European business like Russia, given the situation there. So there are continued challenges in various parts of the world as well as in Europe that we're continuing to monitor.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No. That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe a question on Brexit. Just as we think about the longer term \u2013 and I understand it still all needs to be formalized \u2013 but what are the different areas we should think about in terms of the impact? Could there be any impact from a regulatory perspective, technology upgrades and the investment that's required, or any impact to the volumes as you think about it, like just longer-term impact from Brexit.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's hard to tell what the negotiations between European Union and the U.K. will be. I think I'm in the same boat with other CEOs, which are active in this area. However, I would say that as it is today it's really European Union and U.K. agrees on a separation agreement, it affects like licenses, passports, which you can use in different countries, European Union passports. Also immigration policies, it may have an impact on that.","So, we don't know. It's really early to say. We don't see any near-term impact on our business. We are pleased with our European \u2013 U.K. business. Just to put in perspective also including Western Union Business Solutions and the C2C business, consumer business, our revenue \u2013 it's about 7% of our company total revenue.","So the beauty of Western Union is how diverse we are, how big portfolio we have, and we can always organize our portfolio. But it's hard to tell. It's too early and I would say that it's not \u2013 we can't tell it from today. We have to wait and see.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for the color. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, guys.","Michael Alan Salop - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey, Darrin.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. It's good to see the results show no pricing impact on your revenue this quarter. I just want to get a quick update on your outlook around pricing, what you're really seeing from a competitive landscape, given it seems a little more stable than it's been in years past. And then the mix issue you called out that had the pressure, the 1 point or so of pressure versus transaction growth, was that just the online or the mobile mix or something? Can you give us a little more color? Thanks.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me give general market overview, maybe Raj, can give more detail to Darrin about that. Darrin, if you look at the environment, I think the pricing environment's quite stable. That doesn't mean that we are not doing pricing actions.","As you know, we are operating 16,000 corridors and we have different areas so we do pricing actions, but overall I would say that pricing is very stable. In some quarters, we even increase prices, in some quarters we decrease. We really react to our business intelligence and market environment, and we adopt the prices generally. I would say that I don't see any big pricing pressure near-term and we are confident with our programs, marketing programs and market environment.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and just on the second quarter specifically, Darrin, the pricing investment was flat for the quarter. We've had continued impact from the Argentina reductions, price reductions we took earlier in the year. That's continuing to show up in the second quarter. But we also grew over the DMT pricing that we did in April of last year. So we're getting some benefit from that. And then we did have some spread increases in certain parts of our business overall. And then on your mix question, that's just related to mix changes in our business around the world as certain parts of the business grow faster than others. So that has a mix impact on the overall growth.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on the margin side. The C2B margin was down a little more than we expected. I think you had mentioned technology investments and mix there, as well. Can you give us some sense or any more color on what we should expect there, what actually happened there and what we should expect going forward?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, on the B2B margins, the primary impact as I mentioned, was from technology, we're making technology investments throughout the company, as well as in the electronic business part of the C2B business, so that's what's impacting it. We also had some customer mix where we did have some success in signing new accounts, but they came at a slightly lower margin. But again, the biggest impact was from the technology.","We don't want the margins to be down at this level. We expect the margins to be better overtime, but it is going to take us some time to get through some of the spending that we're doing here, on the technology side. Ultimately the goal is to drive a better platform and have better opportunities on growth in this business. So we're pleased with the overall growth, but we want to drive more growth in this business.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Is that of decline \u2013 that's embedded in your outlook for margins anyway, though, right?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is embedded in our outlook for the year, yes, in our outlook.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sounds good. Thanks, guys.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys, this is Ryan Cary for Jason. I know you called out weakness in the petro-linked economies. And I think you said that Saudi Arabia, which had managed to avoid much of the slowdown, has also been starting to slow. Any update you can provide on your expectations for these regions would be appreciated. And then maybe remind us what percent of C2C revs comes from the primary corridors impacted by lower oil prices?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So good question. Generally the main impact on our business maybe on the weakness of the oil related countries were Libya and Nigeria. Saudi Arabia had a little bit slower, but it was not the major impact. The major impact was Libya and Nigeria and that's because of their oil-producing and oil-related economies. In general, OPEC countries, if you take the OPEC countries, it's about 10% to 15% of our revenues. So that puts also in perspective.","Some of the \u2013 we still see good growth in UAE. We still see good growth in some parts of the businesses. But some parts of the business I have to be cautious also because like Saudi Arabia, where some investments have been slowed down, some construction, some hotels, some big airports have been slowed down and that impacted definitely the workforce there respective to the remittance market. And that slowed down. We could see it. And once the oil prices are getting more stable I'm sure that that's going to go back again. But currently we do see a little bit impact from that area.","Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. And how should we be thinking about compliance trends going forward? It seems like this has remained relatively consistent at the lower end of the 3.5% to 4% range. Is that the right way to be thinking about it? And then anything you see on the horizon that could cause results to trend either above or below that range?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Generally, I would say that we see compliance as a part of our business, right, business as usual. And we see it also long-term competitive advantage. One example is the Southwest border primary agreement that we completed and we definitely upgraded our compliance programs and in many countries we also see that Western Union is a preferred partner because of the compliance programs we put in place.","I think the investment will continue. I don't see bigger changes. We operate in 200 countries and regulatory environment constantly changing and the team is doing a great job investing in the technology, but also in the people to extend our licenses.","But also you know, it's remainder in the country being active and being a competitive advantage and protect our consumers. That's our main goal. And since the last few years we increasingly invested in the compliance environment, $200 plus million every year and that probably is really also protecting our consumers.","Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Michael Alan Salop - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Sure.","Operator","And the next question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. So I guess Raj, you've given some of this information in the course of the call, but I just want to clarify. As I look at the next 12 months, we should continue from a cost perspective to see the impact of hedge rolloffs with minor uptick in the second half. Tech costs continue to go up. And looking at 1010 (34:05), compensation, restructuring continued to be the offset so that you can guide up on margins.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, our outlook for margins this year, Ashwin, is 20% and that's really based on everything that we know at this stage.","Clearly, we'll have some more hedge gains in the second part of this year and some of the hedge gains will continue into next year as well. But there are a number of other factors that are going to drive margins and profitability.","Hedges are just one component. You have cost savings as well. But commissions and compliance costs have been relatively stable. That should be \u2013 that's stable for this year and we've been able to stabilize those in the last couple of years, so that's positive. But we don't really have an outlook for next year if that's what you're getting at, Ashwin, but we feel good about the outlook for this year.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","However, we are very much focused, Ashwin, on revenue growth and profit growth, profitable growth and revenue growth, that's our focus.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes, obviously revenue growth also helps the cause. My next question for you, with regards to digital mobile becoming such a big part of how people access the network and the system, is there any change in how you think of your agent network with regards to the kind of deals you can structure with them with regards to their compensation, and so on and so forth? Any update there would help?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Ashwin, currently not. I think that our agent commissions has been favorable for Western Union over the years as you know, and definitely the new agreements we sign has not been signing at the \u2013 the rates we've signed years ago. Obviously, that helped also.","However, I would like to keep and grow my agent network because one of the biggest things we see is that the new customers, which we signed with mobile, want to drop money on a retail money transfer \u2013 retail locations worldwide, right. We do have, for instance, in India more than 100,000 locations. And you can send money immediately from Denver, from your mobile phone immediately to 100,000 locations in India, plus the thousands of millions of accounts in India in a moment (36:42); nobody else can do that, that big, as we can do it. That's a big competitive advantage.","Saying that also, we are always looking for optimization for our sales costs, for our retail costs, and I think the team is working very hard on that, and I think long-term definitely some room there to be more efficient.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very good color. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","The next question comes from Danyal Hussain of Morgan Stanley.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Daniel.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Raj. I wanted to clarify the $0.01 guidance change. It seems like if before we were assuming tax to be 15% and we lower that to 12% for the year, that's $0.06, when you factor in the $0.02 from the accrual. So, I'm looking for the other $0.03. Some of that looks like it may have been FX headwinds, but I'm wondering what else is in there.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Hi, Daniel, this is Raj. Our outlook for the full year, it does take into account the tax benefit. I would say the $0.06 that you're calculating is a little bit high. Our new outlook for the tax rate is around 12% and we had given a mid-teens level. So depending on what you assume for the actual tax rate, you'll have to walk down from that.","But I would say your estimate's a little bit high, and then we have a $0.02 offset to that from the legal accrual. So that's why we moved up the low end of the range by the net $0.02 effectively. And so that's how we look at it. Nothing really has changed from our operating outlook. We still have the same revenue growth outlook, low to mid-single digits constant currency, profit margins at around 20%.","And then our reported revenue is going to be a little bit lower than we thought in the last quarter, but most of that revenue change is going to be \u2013 the profit impact of that is going to be offset with the increased hedge gains. So we now expect about $45 million in hedge gains this year versus $40 million that we said in the last quarter. So all that is netting out to have no real operating impact. And so we've reflected the two key items, the taxes and the legal accrual.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. That makes sense. And I just wanted to clarify, so this quarter you were able to offset the Argentina pricing impact with FX spreads. I just want to understand better how sustainable that is and how those spreads \u2013 do they benefit, for example, when you have higher FX volatility, would we expect those to normalize or is this a more sustainable spread?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There are three things that are in the second quarter from a pricing investment standpoint. We are still seeing the Argentina impact as I mentioned. Secondly, we did grow over the domestic money transfer pricing that we did last year in April, so we're getting a benefit from that.","And then third, we did raise some spreads in certain parts of the world. I would say on the spread changes, we have 16,000 quarters that we're monitoring pricing activity in and pricing levels and we try to optimize those on an ongoing basis. So I wouldn't characterize these as things that stay forever. We may increase spreads. We may reduce spreads. It really depends on what those particular markets require. So that's really the way I would look at the spread changes.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Oscar Turner of SunTrust.","Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi.","Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. You talked a bit about your competitive advantage in mobile coming from allowing send to either retail locations or accounts. Can you provide any color into transaction or volume growth by payout method \u2013 so, looking at either transfers to retail accounts versus just to accounts, and how that has trended?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think one of the biggest competitive advantage is the retail and stays retail. Most of the transactions are paid out in money in minutes in retail in cash and that continues, especially international outbound ones are happening, but we do see very strong certain countries like in South Asian countries that the people do prefer also accounts and our promotions on the westernunion.com has been very successful there, that we can grow \u2013 we grew our account payouts also in some countries.","In some countries we are just building it. We have now billions of accounts worldwide in 50 countries. That reminds me a little bit, right, how we built the retail money transfer business. Build it, they will come. And we are really building it, now the account network worldwide. Now billions of accounts and now it's all about communicating and building the corridor, making marketing and promotions. But still the most of the payouts are on the retail payouts but very strong growth in certain countries, certain corridors, and also on the account payout.","Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then just looking at your account-to-account initiative, could you provide any color on account-to-account volume growth in the quarter? Also, at what point will this start influencing your revenue growth?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","When it becomes material definitely we will give you more color on that. It's in the beginning but it's a very strong growth. The big advantage here is that funding method is done by accounts. You have immediately the funds in mobile. You collect the money immediately from funds.","We do have it in the U.S. but also very strong in Europe where we have a direct ACH transact, direct debit they call it in Europe and we collect the money immediately from an account then drop in an account worldwide on a billions, which country, more than 50 countries.","And the other thing is that we see more banks calling us actually on that. Could you do this transaction for us because you have the technology, they tell us. You have the compliance programs which they have to build it globally. We do have it in 200 countries. So it started to be getting kind of advantage, kind of a focus, but again, we just build it billions of accounts and now we are really designing a product against this account-to-account transactions.","Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Rayna Kumar of Evercore ISI.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Good evening.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Rayna.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Now that PayPal has owned Xoom for roughly a year, have you experienced any impact to your online business?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think the results really speak for themselves. You can see the great growth that we're getting in our wu.com business, 25% transaction growth, and 20% revenue growth in constant currency.","And we have a business that's much broader than just the U.S., right. We have a business that's in 37 countries and we continue to expand those capabilities on an ongoing basis. We already deliver around the world in 200 countries and territories around the world and then our account payout capabilities are getting even stronger.","And the unique thing about the account payout is that it's direct delivery into these accounts. It's not going through the correspondent banking system. And so even the newer players, they're playing only in the online space, online to counter account-to-account. They're not playing in the retail space, which is where we have our brand.","So that's not the place they're coming after. And as you know, our digital business pays out mostly in a retail location today, right. But the growth opportunity for us is also paying \u2013 doing account-to-account or online-to-account and we think we're going to create a better and stronger business there than anybody else will be able to create.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","What progress have you made in offering instant ACH?","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Most of the transactions in the U.S. instant ACH is a very U.S. focused question I guess, and most of the transactions in the U.S. are still done by credit cards and the people prefer credit cards. We have it, but we see most of the people want to use their credit cards to fund the transaction. We do see also strong growth on the ACH on the \u2013 in Europe. They don't call it ACH there. There's direct debit. There are companies like SOFORT, they help us to do that, pull out money from the banks, from consumer accounts. And that's growing also very well. But most of the transactions on the send side is just still done by credit cards.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And next we have a question from John Davis of Stifel.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, John.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hikmet, I wondered if you could maybe comment on any potential impact of the EU's new AML directive that just came out recently. Any impact there or thoughts would be helpful.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think that has any impact on our business currently. We probably follow the European Union rules obviously, and we don't see any big impact to our business because we've been doing this already, the regulations, and we adopted them already. One of the biggest things also is that, don't forget that we forget sometimes to mention it we do have a bank license in European Union, which is licensed in 27 European Union countries. And that helps us also. That also is a competitive advantage here. And then we did invest a lot on our anti-money laundering activities in European Union and we work closely with regulators there. I don't see big impact here.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Raj, maybe a housekeeping item. I think, assuming that the tax rate is going to benefit from one-time items this year, is it safe to assume that it will likely trend back to the mid-teens next year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, yeah, I would even say for this year, if we didn't have the various discrete items that we talked about, we would be in the mid-teens range as we had originally thought. And we're not giving specific guidance for next year, but given what we know today and tax legislation's evolving all around the world, we would be probably in the mid-teens range for the next couple of years. But we need to see how things play out around the world. As you know, those things are evolving all the time.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, finally, I think, Raj, you mentioned on the call that 30% of the cash is in the U.S., so I think that puts it around $360 million. And then assume you're going to generate another $100 million-plus in free cash flow in the back half of this year. That gets you to a $475 million-ish cash number in the U.S. That's roughly what you paid out in the first half of the year. So, maybe just talk a little bit about the internal cash management policies and procedures you guys use and help give us comfort that there's plenty of cash in the U.S. to pay dividends and repurchases as we go into 2017.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Absolutely. Our dividends are easily payable, and that's something we have a heavy focus on obviously. We do have intercompany working capital programs that allow us to free up more cash here in the U.S. And I would also say that overtime we also will have more capacity from a debt standpoint. So there's plenty of availability of capital and the way we manage our cash overall. So I have no concerns there.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Rajesh K.

Third quarter results were solid driven by continued double-digit revenue growth from our digital westernunion.com business and strong overall profitability with operating margins just under 22%. Consumer money transfer and bill pay constant currency revenue trends were generally consistent with the second quarter, while Business Solutions delivered good improvement and returned to positive growth. Consumer money transfer indicators remain healthy with transactions growing 4% and cross-border principal increasing 6% in the quarter or 7% in constant currency.","And our digital business continued its strong run as westernunion.com money transfer revenue grew 19% in the quarter or 20% constant currency. Constant currency money transfer growth was led by Latin American, Caribbean and European regions with continued good performance from our U.S. outbound business, offsetting declines in the Middle East, Asia and U.S. domestic business.","The price reductions that we implemented earlier in the year in key Middle East corridors are generating positive results, as we started to see transaction improvement in the region. In addition, our operating margins increased substantially compared to the first half of the year, as expected, and cash flow generation was solid. Overall, we remain on track with our full-year financial outlook, with a narrowing of our earnings per share ranges and an increased adjusted earnings per share outlook.","Strategically, we made good progress on several key initiatives, including advancing our digital expansion efforts and adding new cross-border payment opportunities to our global money movement platform. Our digital westernunion.com money transfer service is now available in more than 50 countries and territories, including recent launches in Mexico and Malaysia, with the capability to send to Asian locations and billions of accounts around the world. We also launched a high-value service in the UK, where consumers can now send up to \u00a350,000 through westernunion.com to bank accounts in key receive markets. It's a part of our strategy to penetrate new customer segments in cross-border transfers.","In other strategic initiatives, we are very excited about our recent engagement by Amazon to launch a new payment option for their international customers. In this arrangement, we are leveraging our cross-border platform and network to allow shoppers to pay for online purchases in person at our agent locations in select countries for now. This will provide access to online shopping for millions of potential Amazon customers, who will be able to shop global and pay local. It is just one example of how we are leveraging our unique global platform in new ways, bringing value to partners through our technology stack, API, settlement engine, and compliance infrastructure.","Now returning to 2018 results, profitability was strong and consumer transactions growth remained solid. We are also making good progress with the WU Way, expanding lean and agile management throughout the company, which is contributing to increased efficiency and to strong margins. And we continued to deliver shareholder-friendly capital allocation, as we have returned over $600 million to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends through the end of the third quarter.","The Business Solutions results in the quarter were more encouraging. I assume you will have some questions regarding recent stories that we may be considering divesting this part of our business. While we will not comment on specifics, we have stated we will consider any strategic options for our business units that could benefit shareholder value. We are currently reviewing various alternatives, but do not have anything to announce at this time, and there's no assurance any transaction will occur. In the meantime, we remain focused on driving the long-term performance of all our businesses.","Now to give you more detail on the quarter's results, I would like to turn the call over to Raj.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Hikmet.","Third quarter revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1% or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior-year period. Currency translation net of the impact from hedges reduced third quarter revenue by approximately $53 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to continued declines in the Argentine peso.","The decline in the peso negatively impacted total revenue by 3 percentage points. This impact was partially offset by an increase in our Argentina businesses local currency revenue per transaction, primarily driven by the effects of inflation on our bill payments business. The increase in Argentina revenue per transaction benefited total revenue by approximately 1.7 percentage points.","In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, which represented 80% of company revenues in the quarter, revenues were flat or increased 2% constant currency, while transactions grew 4%. Total C2C cross-border principal increased 6% or 7% on a constant currency basis, while principal per transaction increased 2% or 4% constant currency. The spread between C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 4%, with a negative 2% impact from currency. Pricing and mix each had a negative impact of 1% in the quarter compared to the prior-year period. We did not have any significant new price reductions implemented in the quarter, as the 1% pricing impact primarily reflects actions taken in the Middle East in the second quarter.","Turning to the regional results, North America revenue increased 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, while transactions grew 1%. The U.S. outbound business delivered good growth again in the quarter, particularly to the Latin American and Caribbean countries. U.S. to Mexico revenue growth improved while U.S. domestic money transfer revenue declines were similar to last quarter.","In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 3% or 4% on a constant currency basis driven primarily by good results from France and Spain. Transactions in the region increased 8%.","Revenue in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia region declined 7% on a reported basis or 6% constant currency, while transaction growth improved 2% in the quarter. Revenue in the Middle East is being impacted by the previously implemented pricing reductions, which have helped volumes as transaction growth in the region turned positive for the first time in three years.","The Latin America and Caribbean region continued to deliver strong constant currency revenue growth, both driven primarily by Argentina, Peru, and Brazil. Revenue in the region increased 2% in the quarter or 16% constant currency, while transactions grew 11%.","In the APAC region, revenue declined 10% or 9% constant currency. And transactions were down 2%, with the declines driven by a number of smaller markets.","Westernunion.com continued to deliver strong growth as revenue grew 19% and 20% constant currency on transaction growth of 23%. Westernunion.com represented 12% of total C2C revenue in the quarter. Business Solutions revenues increased 1% or 3% on a constant currency basis and represented 7% of company revenues in the quarter. Revenue was driven by growth in payments, which was led by the education vertical.","Other revenues which consist primarily of our bill payments businesses decreased 9% in the quarter or increased 7% on a constant currency basis and represented 13% of total company revenues. The Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina experienced transaction increases and local currency revenue growth, but declined in U.S. dollar terms and our Speedpay U.S. electronic bill payments business also declined. The depreciation of the peso negatively impacted other reported growth by 16 percentage points while increases in revenue per transaction which were primarily driven by inflation benefited other reported and constant currency revenue growth by approximately 9.6 percentage points.","Turning to margins and profitability, the consolidated operating margin was 21.8% in the quarter compared to 19.4% in the prior-year period or 20.7% in the prior year on an adjusted basis. On an adjusted basis, the margin expansion was driven by higher incentive compensation rate of expenses in the prior year and timing of marketing spending, which was down 80 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter. Last year's reported margin also reflected WU Way expenses and an accrual related to the Joint Settlement Agreements.","Foreign exchange hedges provided a benefit of $4 million in the current quarter compared to a negative impact of $2 million in the prior-year period. We achieved approximately $8 million of incremental savings from WU Way initiatives in the quarter, which gives us approximately $36 million of incremental savings year-to-date. On an absolute basis, we are on track to generate approximately $60 million of savings from WU Way for the full year which is above what we expected. EBITDA margin was 26.4% in the quarter compared to 24% in the prior-year period or 25.3% on an adjusted basis.","The GAAP effective tax rate was 21.7% in the third quarter compared to 1.5% in the prior-year period. On an adjusted basis, the tax rate was 11.7% compared to 3.6% in the prior-year period. The increase in the GAAP tax rate was primarily due to non-recurring benefits in the prior-year period and adjustments to our prior-year estimates related to the Tax Act in the current period. As we previously stated, certain of the 2017 impacts related to the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December of last year were provisionally estimated and additional effects would likely be recorded this year.","In the third quarter, changes in our estimates related to the Tax Act resulted in a $26.6 million tax expense. The increase in the tax rate on an adjusted basis was primarily due to non-recurring benefits in the prior-year period.","We do not have any updates yet on how the BEAT provision of the Tax Act may impact our tax rate in 2019 and beyond. We are working on restructuring our internal business flows to fully or partially mitigate the potential double taxation impact of BEAT which could cause our rates to move up a few points from the mid-teens base, if there's no mitigation. Restructuring these flows have some complexity and requires different regulatory notices and approval and technology and operational changes, but we are making good progress. We should be able to let you know what we expect when we provide our 2019 outlook early next year.","Returning to the third quarter results, earnings per share in the current year quarter was $0.46, which compared to $0.51 in the prior-year period. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was $0.52 compared to $0.53 in the prior-year period. The decrease in reported and adjusted earnings per share was primarily due to higher tax rate in the current year period partially offset by increased operating profit. The C2C margin was 25.1% which compared to 23.5% in the prior-year period. The margin increase was primarily due to the impact of currency, higher incentive compensation related expenses in the prior year, timing of marketing spending and lower average retail commission rates.","Business Solutions operating margin improved to 14.2% in the quarter compared to 9.1% in the prior-year period. The increase in operating margin was primarily due to the timing of spending and cost efficiencies. Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 24.6%, which compared to 19.8% in the prior-year period. Operating margin for the businesses included in other was 5.9% in the quarter which compared to 10.5% in the prior-year period. The year-over-year margin decline was primarily due to lower overall revenue and higher bank fees as a percentage of revenue in our U.S. electronic business.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $518 million which includes the impact of an approximately $120 million in tax payments related to the agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service announced in 2011, a $60 million payment for the previously announced New York Department of Financial Services settlement and approximately $30 million of spending on prior year WU Way expenses.","Capital expenditures in the quarter were approximately $158 million. At the end of the quarter, we had cash of $768 million and debt of $3.3 billion. During the quarter, we returned $184 million to shareholders including $84 million in dividend and $100 million of share repurchases, which represents 5 million shares. The outstanding share count at quarter-end was 444 million shares and we had $594 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, which expires in December of 2019.","Based on the year-to-date results and recent business trends, we are affirming our full year financial outlooks for revenue, operating profit margin and operating cash flow. We have narrowed our GAAP earnings per share range and increased the adjusted earnings per share range primarily to reflect the lower adjusted tax rate. We continue to expect low single digit reported and low to mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth for the full year and the operating profit margin outlook remains at approximately 20%.","The GAAP tax rate outlook is unchanged at approximately 13% to 14% but we now expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 12% down from our previous outlook of 14% to 15%. The change is largely driven by improvement in maximizing our foreign tax credit position under U.S. tax reform and certain discrete benefits. Excluding these discrete items, we would have had a normalized tax rate in the mid-teens this year. The GAAP earnings per share outlook is now in a range of $1.85 to $1.92, while we have increased our adjusted earnings per share range to $1.88 to $1.95, up from $1.80 to $1.90 in the previous outlook.","Cash flow from operating activities is still projected to be approximately $800 million in 2018, which is net of approximately $200 million of outflows and the combination of tax payments related to the IRS agreements from 2011, NYDFS settlement payment and WU Way payments related to 2017 expenses.","So to summarize, we are pleased with the solid performance in the quarter and operating margin improvement. We are on track to deliver our full year financial outlook with an increase to the adjusted earnings per share range and we continue to return significant funds to shareholders.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session.

You mentioned recently you had taken some price actions to rectify some of the competitive pressures there. Curious if you think it's the main driver of the improvement in transaction volume you guys reported this quarter.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","It is the main driver. We took some price reductions in the second quarter this year just related to competitive reasons as well as the overall market environment. The market environment itself is quite negative just because the expats are leaving many of those markets. We have less jobs for expats in Saudi Arabia, for example. So not only competitive but also just the addressable market environment and we are seeing a direct benefit from the price actions we took, which is positive. Saudi Arabia in particular improved in the quarter.","Bill Schultz - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And just staying with pricing for a second, just touching on Walmart2World competition, you've talked in the past about taking some targeted price actions around Walmart locations to ensure you're competitive in those areas. How has that progress been, and do you feel like you're now priced appropriately in those locations?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","First of all, we have not seen any significant impact in our U.S. outbound business from Walmart. As you know, we have 50,000 locations in the U.S., and our pricing actions we can do is very dedicated and has been \u2013 our U.S. outbound business has been doing very well. U.S. outbound to Mexico business is growing, and I think we are very well-positioned in the U.S. Also, our U.S. outbound digital business, westernunion.com business, is showing good results. So I think we are very well-priced and we're going to continue to do, we call it street corner pricing or dedicated pricing around some locations we need it. And we have been doing that for many years and we're going to continue to do that.","Bill Schultz - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you for the color. I appreciate it.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Darrin.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. Hi, Hikmet. Hey, guys. I just want to start off on the Amazon announcement. I think that was a pretty interesting partnership and clearly underscores the magnitude of your network and the opportunity that you can pull around that. But I guess I just wanted to get more color on what the intentions are and what the opportunity is. First of all, maybe you can give us color on how many markets you see this rolling out into, what kind of economics this comes with per \u2013 how does it work per transaction. And then do you see this going into other types of e-com players as well?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think it shows really how global our network is and how we give access \u2013 Amazon wants to give access to millions of customers to buy their products and using our network, so customers can buy globally and pay locally. And that's a big advantage for us because we have already the platform. And the platform, the agent network, we did some adjustments on our systems, and we are now training some of the locations. And Amazon will announce in the right time the markets they want to open. We are ready to go and we are testing, and we have some real transactions starting and Amazon \u2013 we'll leave it to Amazon to announce that to their customers.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","So I guess just maybe, if you can, give us any more color on what you think there could be in terms of incremental here. This is all really going after the under-banked, I imagine, right, primarily?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yes, Darrin. It is, it is going really under-bankers. Also, maybe they have bank accounts, but it's only local, and they can \u2013 they really want to use cash maybe and they really want to use their local cards, so it is really a local currency. And they're going to the customers I believe that they don't have the access today to pay international payments.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then \u2013 thanks, guys. And then just quickly and I'll turn it back to the queue. But on the potential for any type of restructuring on \u2013 it looked like your B2B business actually improved. I don't know if that was just easier compares or something in the business. If you can, give us more color on that, on the growth rate.","And then the potential for restructuring and strategic alternatives, is it for the whole business you would explore either selling or moving around, or is it part of it keeping maybe the education side? Any more interesting \u2013 any more color would be great. Thanks.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think as you could see, we are very much focused on our B2B business and has been turning to positive growth again, so the team is doing a good job. We have seen good growth rates in certain markets. We do still have some challenges. But as you said, the education part of the business is, payments part of the business is doing very well. But also the trading parts of business showed positive results. So the transactions and the customers are really using it.","Please do understand that we don't speculate on any rumors on the markets. We will always look on any opportunity to divest or to buy any business to drive shareholder value. We will definitely look at that. But in this moment, I have nothing to say more about that opportunity or about the diverse in the business.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Darrin.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Darrin.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks, good afternoon. Hey, guys.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hello, Tien-Tsin.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hello, always good to talk. The margins coming in at 22%, I believe that brings your year to date closer to the 20% target for the year, so I'm curious. If we adjust the 21.8% for the 80 bps and the timing of marketing, why wouldn't 21% margin be the new level for margin to consider going forward? It sounds like WU Way is helping that. Just curious how much of that is sustainable.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","It's a good question, Tien-Tsin. You're right. The margin is running slightly above 20% actually for the first nine months. So depending on how the expenses play out in the fourth quarter, we can end up above 20%. We said approximately 20%, but it's running stronger, and I would say we're pleased. WU Way savings that we've been getting are showing up. They are showing up in the margin, and we're always looking for ways to continue to optimize the margin as we look at our cost structure, so it's going to be a positive.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think also, Raj, the revenue growth will help us of course given our cost structure being mostly variable. That will help us but, Tien-Tsin, I have to say that as we disclosed last quarter, the team is very much focused on the cost side, margin expansion, efficiency, and our lean management tools are helping the WU Way activities really helping to find efficiencies. And this quarter, we came on savings better than we expected. And so we hope that we continue to do that and the team is very much focused. The margin expansion is definitely something they're focused on.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, sounds good. It seems like there's a little bit of benefit there on the margins, which is encouraging. So my follow-up I'll ask \u2013 I'm trying to pick which question to ask. Let's do the peso question because that has a big impact. So I just wanted to clarify for modeling purposes because it is big. The peso was a 3-point drag on FX. And then the inflation piece helped, it was a 1.7-point benefit to revenue. Is that a good ratio to consider going forward? I know the peso is still volatile, but it's clearly having an impact on the whole P&L. So I'm just trying to understand how we should think about that dynamic of the FX and then the inflation.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","They don't always work in concert with each other. So for this year, that's probably a good ratio. But depending on where inflation is, it could be different from each other. So we're just calling it out just to give you more visibility on that market because it's been quite volatile obviously. We didn't necessarily see that kind of volatility last year, but we're certainly seeing it this year. The peso has devalued about 45% as of the third quarter, and inflation is probably running a little bit less than that obviously. and so it doesn't necessarily mash with each other the way it is right now.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","And one of the reasons we are calling it also is that, as you know, we have the Pago Facil business there, which is done in pesos, and that impacts the reported and constant currency variance there.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","And it's mostly \u2013 as Hikmet said, it's mostly in our bill payments business in Argentina, and it doesn't impact the consumer business as much as those numbers show.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right, thanks for calling it out.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just wanted to ask \u2013 just about that tax rate, the adjusted tax rate. It sounded like you're still trying to understand some of BEAT tax and some of the implications, maybe if you can just walk through some of the potential changes there that you're looking at that could move the tax rate higher?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I mean, Bryan, we don't have a definitive answer yet for next year. If you think about our base tax rate being somewhere in the mid-teens, this year we've been able to get some specific benefits, some discrete benefits that are helping us around our foreign tax credit positions. So that's why our adjusted tax rate is around 12%.","And then the BEAT issue for next year which is really an unwarranted double taxation as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform. We are trying to change some business flows internally to alleviate some of that pressure. So our goal is to solve it, not only for next year, but for the foreseeable future and that's the strategy that we're working on. That does require some regulatory approval, some operational changes internally. And so it's complex, but we're making good progress there and we can give you more color as we go into next year.","The other avenue that is not under our control is potential legislative change or guidance from Treasury on how to apply the BEAT provisions, because they \u2013 most agree that there were some unwarranted aspects of tax reform related to BEAT, and it's creating a double or even sometimes triple taxation in certain cases. So those are the two ways that we're looking at it, but we're making good progress, I would say.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, Hikmet, just wanted to ask about looking at your portfolio of assets, it sounds like you're looking at strategic options in the B2B business. Are there other things you're looking at to either divest or potentially even add to the portfolio of assets, as you see it in Western \u2013 yeah, on the Western Union books?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","As I said Bryan, good question. I will always look for an opportunity which is in \u2013 drives the shareholder value. Saying that is \u2013 on the market, if something on the digital environment pops up, which could be interesting for us and adds to shareholder value, we will definitely look at that. That could be interesting.","But on the \u2013 generally, I would say that we are very much focused on the cross-border cross-currency money movement and that platform as we also announced it, our relationship with Amazon has a value and we're going to continue to focus on the moving money cross-border cross-currency which fits in there. We will definitely be active there also. And so, I'll leave it there Bryan.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right, helpful. Thanks guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Bryan.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thanks Bryan.","Operator","And the next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, thanks, guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Jason.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, how are you?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Good. How are you?","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good, good. So just on C2C constant currency growth. It looks like it's been kind of slowing as we go through the year here I think from 5% to 3% to 2%. And there was a tougher comp in Q4. So just wanted to know how we should think about C2C growth for this current quarter. I mean, could it slow a little bit further? I know you still got some of the pricing headwind from what you did last quarter in the Middle East, but how are you thinking about the Q4 there on C2C?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yes. I mean just generally, Jason, the consumer business was relatively consistent, got a little bit slower. The strong growing areas continue to be strong like Latin America, Europe and then U.S. outbound or U.S. outbound to Mexico actually improved in the quarter. They were not as strong as we saw in the previous quarter, but still good strength there.","Middle East got a little bit worse, but the transaction growth is turning positive there and that's a good thing for us. And so, I wouldn't expect too much of a difference as we go into the rest of the year. We did have strong double-digit growth in our dotcom business, so that continues to be very strong. So we feel good about the overall trend.","If you look at the cross-border principal that we've gotten \u2013 in terms of growth that we've gotten year-to-date, it's been growing around 8% year-to-date which is above where the market is growing based on the World Bank estimates at 4.5%. So we're getting good principal growth around the world and we feel good about our positioning at this stage.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yes. We feel generally good about our year-end guidance as we also mentioned earlier.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just on wu.com. I guess the revenue growth \u2013 the constant currency revenue growth there has been lagging the transaction growth to some extent. Is that just pricing? Are there some other factors in there? And do you think 20% is sustainable for wu.com revenue growth constant currency going forward?","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","There's not a lot of pricing in there. It's more the geographic mix of the in terms of going forward.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","We continue to see good growth opportunities there. In any given quarter, the revenue growth or the transactions may be somewhat different, but we have a lot of things. We have more expansion around with geographies, more channels, more accounts, yeah, those types of things.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. Okay.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","One thing I would like to mention here is also \u2013 the outbound business is doing pretty well. We saw some softness at the domestic money transfer business at the dotcom business that impacted, but besides that within the real focus is, as you know, the outbound business from the U.S. or from Europe and the new markets long-term, will also add on to transaction growth which we just announced Mexico and Malaysia for instance, and we have about 50 countries now.","And we're going to focus \u2013 that's a long term opportunity. We're going to focus expanding them, but the growth is coming very strong also from the existing markets and we are pleased with our westernunion.com expansion.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rayna Kumar of Evercore ISI.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hi, thanks for taking my question.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Rayna.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","Could you update us on...","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Rayna, it's hard to hear you. Rayna, can you speak up? Sorry.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hello. Okay, great. Could you update us on your capital allocation priorities for 2019? Specifically when the board next meets do you expect them to approve a dividend increase? And how much of your cash flow you'll allocate to share repurchase next year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","I won't get into all those specifics, but if you just look at our history, Rayna, you can see that we've \u2013 for the last few years in a row, we've raised the dividend. Obviously, it's based on business performance, but we've been able to increase the dividend each year for the last few years. We've also been buyers of our stock the last few years and we've been typically in that $400 million-plus range for stock buyback. So, our capital priorities have not changed. We want to invest in the business to drive organic growth. We pay more than $300 million in terms of dividends and we want to continue to improve that.","We'd like to do the right kind of acquisition. And then lastly, we use excess cash to buy back stock, if it's at the right place. So those are really the capital priorities and you can see what we've done this year. We've already returned through both dividends and buybacks around $600 million. So..","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","And also I think we have a authorization about almost $600 million, $500 million left until end of 2019.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","That's very helpful. Could you also discuss the drivers to the improvement in your Business Solutions business? And could we see revenue accelerate further from here?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","We hope that we are very much focused on the Business Solutions. The team is doing a great job. Our payments business as I mentioned earlier is doing well, and we're going to expand that. And also, our trading business is doing well. The foreign exchange trading business is doing much better. We do still have some challenges in parts of the world with some volatility challenges, customer loyalty challenges. But besides that, I see a good path on the execution much better than earlier, and we hope to keep the momentum.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","We're moving customers to our EDGE digital platform, as we talked about before, and that continues \u2013 those are the lower-end or smaller customers, and that creates more stickiness with that customer base. It also frees up our sales resources to go after the larger-value accounts. We're also driving heavily into the vertical segments that have been more successful for us like education and financial institutions in more geographies. And then we'll always need good global trade growth as an underpinning to have good success in this business. And the margin improvement in the business has also been a bit positive this quarter.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi, James.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to just ask quickly about your new UK large transactions offering. And how do you think about the growth opportunity in this type of product and what the demand can look like? And then I'm also wondering. From a profitability standpoint is there any difference on compliance costs, et cetera?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","So, I think that's a very interesting opportunity for us. As you know, we were very much focused on our fast transactions payout in a location. But as we know how billions of accounts grow globally, we could do products like that with different \u2013 adapting our compliance programs, understanding the customer, know your customer.","And as you know, over the years we did invest a lot on our compliance programs. We use artificial intelligence, and we feel quite comfortable with our compliance and anti-money laundering program. The team is doing a good job there to offer new products to new customer segments.","Obviously, \u00a350,000 have to come from a bank account and go to a bank account. And doing that, we believe that we have a good competitive position, and the market circle shows that we could compete here. And we started now with the UK which there's a need on that. We ask the customers if they would like \u2013 they like that product. And based on the success story, we may go worldwide.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then on the compliance issue, it seems like there's a fair amount of variance among the different competitors for cross-border remittances in terms of who's doing how much compliance, and you guys clearly have been a leader in improving the compliance process. Is that still having an impact on customers and that kind of thing, or have customers and share shifts normalized or stabilized so that that's not much of an issue anymore?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think the customers like to use a trusted brand. In the beginning, of course, if you change the processes, it may have an impact, and the customer experience changes. But over years, one thing we learned is that the customers, when they move money, they really like the trust, and you want to trust the brand which the money really arrives. The sender feels comfortable or you feel comfortable to send that. That has shown the customer experience, customer surveys show that the customers actually like our programs.","We are doing it much easier now for the customers, especially the second transaction like staged transaction or mobile, when you stage a transaction go to a location and do your transactions. It's going very well actually. And all these paperless transactions, knowing the customer in advance, and also knowing the customer on the receive side helps us a lot. And artificial intelligence, what we invested in technology helped a lot.","And our biggest benefit is that we are in 200 countries with 131 currencies and combined in our more than 20,000 corridors. And you need definitely investment on the technology here. And so I think \u2013 also as Raj mentioned before, our principal amount is increasing. So we are gaining compared with the world bank market share obviously here based on our programs.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great to hear. Thank you so much.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, Hikmet. Hi, Raj.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, how are you guys?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Good. How are you, Ashwin?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good, good. Happy November. I guess let me start with \u2013 you have this $90 million capitalization of contract costs in the quarter. I went back quite a ways, and I don't see a capitalization of costs that large. So is that basically like a single contract like Amazon, or were there many like super-agent renewals, or is there something going on in terms of accounting assumptions, any color?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","I don't see this as a run rate of any kind. We have lumpiness sometimes in our agent renewals. In any given year, probably, 20% of our contracts are renewing. So we did renew a large agent with Safeway and we extended the Albertsons relationship, which gives an incremental 1,000 locations to be live early next year. And so that certainly was a key part of the agent bonuses.","But again, our total CapEx \u2013 if you look at the total CapEx, it's historically been in the 3% to 5% range as a percent of revenue. And this year we'll be at the higher end of that range, but the last several years in a row it's been always in that range 3% to 5%. So I don't see it being anything different there.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Okay. So it's a use of cash type of question.","On the tax rate, Raj, a couple of questions. You tried to explain the uncertainty with base erosion provisions and I get that. But if the opinion that you get back from the Treasury is a negative one, what are your other tax planning alternatives? I know you mentioned change in business flows, but I don't quite understand what that means. And I wasn't sure if you mentioned a timeframe to come up with this. And I'm only asking because it's material a few percentage points. So can you help from a modeling perspective?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Because of the way the principal flows happen from U.S. outbound to our international entities, and the way to BEAT provisions work without getting too technical, Ashwin, that creates the double taxation and even sometimes triple taxation. So we need to change the way the principal flows work in the company to alleviate some of those double or triple taxation. So that's what we're working on.","Our goal is to get at least part of it if not all of it solved for next year and beyond. We also agree that it's quite valuable for us to solve it, and we're looking at that and we're making good progress. So there's not much more I can say beyond that, and then there are a number of other tax planning strategies that we are working on like we do every single year. I mean, this year our going in position was we were in the mid-teens rate for attach rate.","We are going to end up probably around 12% on an adjusted basis. So we're always looking at some specific opportunity and we'll give you more color as we go into next year. But looking at our history of how we've managed our attach rate has been quite strong. So we have some of the best people working on that and we'll give you more color early next year.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you for that.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Operator","And next we have a question from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hey, Raj.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hey, Kartik.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","How are you?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hey, how are you? Good, good.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Raj, looking at the margin, obviously, exceeding expectations and you mentioned WU Way as a contributor. But is that the only contributor to the expansion you're seeing, or is there more to it? I know revenue growth hasn't gotten to where you wanted it. So I was wondering if there's other drivers maybe to that margin expansion?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. For the quarter, marketing spend was down from a year ago, so that was about 80 basis points lower. And that's certainly a key part of it. If you think about margins overall and I think, Hikmet, mentioned some of the factors that revenue growth is going to be a key driver because of our cost structure, which is 40% fixed. Then you look at commissions, which we've been able to do a really good job of the last few years including this year on bringing those rates down, and the overall mix impact is also helping us there. Compliance costs have been the same basically on a percentage of revenue basis the last several years. That's quite stable.","And then the WU Way efficiencies, that's above our expectations for this year, so that's also helping the margins. So those are the various factors. And as we look at fourth quarter and next year, these are the factors that will impact margins, and as Hikmet mentioned, we are absolutely focused on doing more with profitability and trying to find better opportunities for ourselves there even in the face of the growth levels that we have today.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","I know you, obviously, can't talk about transaction or divestiture. I'm wondering though if you're successful with divesting a business or two, what do you intend to do with the proceeds.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, I mean, we can't really speculate obviously Kartik as you said. So, in terms of use of proceeds if we were to have some kind of a transaction, all I can point you to is our capital priorities that I went through earlier. We've been very shareholder-friendly. We've given a lot back through dividends and buybacks, and we also have been investing in our business for organic growth, and we would like to do the right kind of acquisition if one presented itself.","So those are the choices we have, and we'll look at those very closely to see what makes most sense if we were to have some kind of a transaction which there's no guarantee of that. But if we had something, we would certainly look at that same lens that we do today in terms of capital priorities.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Operator","And next we have a question from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Andrew.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. It's Jenny Dugan on for Andrew.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Jenny.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Just following-up on the comments about lower average retail commission rates, can you talk about what's happening there? Are you gaining some type of bargaining power or leverage? What's driving those rates down?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I think that's part of it, right? So I mean, we have been very competitive in the market. As you know, we have more than 550,000 locations. That brings us a huge advantage over the years because we can really go after any market, we would like to see the opportunity where we see competitive advantage.","And in the beginning, as you know, as we enter in a market, you do pay higher commission. But as you generate revenue and you've been longer in the market, you'll have a deal with an agent that helps us to bring the commissions down. That's a part of that. It's not a onetime. It's a multi-year effort. We start about three to four years ago and it has been consistently going down. Sometimes in some quarters we may have a signing bonus or some higher effective rate, but generally the commissions will continue to go down.","The other part is also the mix. One of our strongest growing business is paying out on an account for an instance from westernunion.com to an account, and that helps also obviously I can't pay out as much lower commission rates than paying out manual on a location.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you. I think, Laura, we're just having one more question on the queue, so we'll take the final question.","Operator","Yes. That question is from James Friedman of Susquehanna.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in. It's Jamie at Susquehanna. Yeah. I just wanted to ask about what is the current temperature on compliance environment? I know you had put in a lot of automated initiatives. We're still thinking in the 3%, 3.5%, 4% range? Or is there an opportunity to scale that better over time?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, the answer is, yes, probably to both your questions. We're still in the 3.5% to 4% range this year. And if you look at the last three years, it's been the same range, same ballpark, around 3.5-ish type percent. And at some point, we will get leverage on our compliance spend, right?","And as we grow the business as we have more growth overall, we should be able to get better leverage there, because there is a portion of our compliance and that's fixed in nature, and then there's a portion that's going to be variable in nature that's more transaction related. So, we absolutely look at it that way and we've sort of stabilized out or leveled out after some initial increases a few years ago, but that's definitely how we're looking at it.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","And also artificial intelligence if you look at that data management helps a lot to being more efficient.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And then for my follow-up, I just want to go back to the exciting Amazon partnership and we were getting a lot of questions about it yesterday about the use cases. I know Hikmet you described some of them, the local and the global. Do you have any updated data about the unbanked population and the network? That's been a metric that you shared but only periodically. We are just trying to figure out like who's going to use the Amazon relationship and what the profile might be?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. So, generally as you can imagine there are parts of the world, which don't have the international cards. They want to use it and that helps a lot our platform. But we are a provider to Amazon. It's Amazon customers. They want to promote the product within the Amazon. I'll leave it really with Amazon there. We really provide our platform to them to serve their customers and they're focused on the \u2013 I guess they're focused on the market.","They want to launch and they want to promote it. And I really want leave it with Amazon and I believe that you're going to hear within the next few weeks several announcements on that. And the customer segment I will say that most of the customer, they would like to go to a location, pay cash or pay in their local currencies and the \u2013 you buy online and then you just go, and then the goods you bought online will be sent to you.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael A. Salop","Thank you. And good morning, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, EVP, Chief Financial Officer and Global Operations, will discuss 2012 first quarter results. Following the remarks, we will open the call for questions.","The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.","As we noted in our February earnings call, beginning with this quarter, Western Union has implemented a new segment structure to reflect the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments, management changes and strategic initiatives. We now classify segments as Consumer-to-Consumer, Consumer-to-Business, Business Solutions and other. The Consumer-to-Consumer segment has not changed from our previous reporting. Other primarily includes retail money order, prepaid and Mobile Money Transfer. Within Consumer-to-Consumer, we now provide metrics on 6 regions. These include Europe and the CIS, North America, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean and westernunion.com online money transfer. Our India and South Asia business is now included in the Asia Pacific region. As a result of reporting these additional regions, we will no longer be providing individual country metrics in our supplemental tables. However, we will give you color on country performance and will continue to provide domestic money transfer and Mexico results throughout 2012. We issued an 8-K last week, which describes the new segments and regions as well as provides historical reclassifications.","As a reminder, today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2011 Form 10-K, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We have reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section.","All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of The Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you, Mike, and welcome, everyone.","Overall, our performance in the quarter was generally in line with our expectations, and we made some good progress in our 3 strategic growth areas of Global Consumer Financial Services, Business Solutions and Ventures.","In consumer-to-consumer money transfer, our revenue growth accelerated compared to the fourth quarter as constant currency revenue growth increased to 5%. Our North American business was generally strong, and we also saw improved revenue trends in the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific regions. U.S. domestic money transfer continued to deliver good growth, and Mexico revenue increased in the quarter. The expected softness in Europe and Russia is here and we did see flat results for the region compared to a year ago, but revenue trends were slightly improved relative to the fourth quarter.","We made more progress in advancing our class-of-trade strategies in money transfer. We recently signed SunTrust Bank as an agent in the U.S., adding to a list that includes U.S. Bank, KeyBank, Regions, Fifth Third and others. Globally, almost 60% of our Western Union agent locations are banks and post offices, but we are also widely present in retail, supermarkets, travel agents, other financial services and many more classes of trade.","I'm also very pleased to announce that in April we reached 500,000 agent locations around the world. This is a huge milestone in Western Union's 160 years of history. We believe the expansion of our presence in 200 countries and territories will continue and it will remain a competitive advantage to grow our core money transfer and other products.","Beyond our core Global Consumer Financial Services, we are also making progress evolving our new businesses. Although our Business Solutions pro forma revenue growth of 5% was below our target due to some softness in North America and the U.K., our new customer acquisitions remained strong and our geographic expansion is progressing. Business Solutions is now able to offer services directly or through partners in 25 countries. Our integration efforts with Travelex are on track. Our growth strategies are being implemented, and we remain committed to low double-digit constant currency revenue growth for this business over the next several years.","In Ventures, we continue to make excellent progress with digital money transfer as westernunion.com revenues increased almost 40% in the quarter and shortly will again deliver double-digit revenue growth. We have begun our additional investment in digital. Our San Francisco office is up and running and we remain very excited about the opportunity and results we are seeing with this business. The innovation regarding additional channels and products at Western Union is happening.","I'm also pleased to announce the appointment of David Thompson as Western Union's new Chief Information Officer. David will serve as the company's Head Technology Officer responsible for building and supporting the next-generation payments, products and services. He was most recently Global CIO of Symantec and was previously at Oracle and PeopleSoft.","Turning to our results for the quarter. Our operating margins was below last year's level. It was primarily the result of the impact of Business Solutions and the Travelex acquisition, investment and some expense timing. However, we believe we will see the margin improve from the first quarter as we move through the year and are forecasting the full year margin to be similar to last year.","We resumed our share repurchase program in the quarter, buying back almost $150 million of stock and increased our dividend by 25% to $0.10 per share. In total, we returned over $200 million to shareholders in the quarter through buybacks and dividends.","I also want to mention a few events in the quarter that do not show up in the financial results but are examples of the many ways we are evolving our business for the future as we continue to add new services and customers. We recently introduced WU Pay, a new and innovative electronic payments platform that allows online shoppers in the U.S. to pay for purchases from their bank accounts or in cash at Western Union agent locations. This provides ease for consumers, many of them who are not comfortable providing credit card numbers or other personal payment information online. WU Pay is also being added as a payment option for consumers to fund money transfer on westernunion.com.","In Mobile Money Transfer, we signed a strategic agreement with Ericsson to integrate Western Union's Mobile Money Transfer services with Ericsson's platform. This will enable mobile networks operators who use Ericsson solution to easily add Western Union Money Transfer to their suite of offerings. And Ericsson has a relationship globally with over 450 mobile network operators.","In Canada, we are teaming with Acxsys, a leader in debit payment services. This agreement will allow customers of the bank that connect to Canada's Interac funds transfer system to access Western Union money transfer services. Previously, these customers had a domestic account-to-account money transfer system, but now they will also be able to send and receive international money transfer through their online and mobile bank accounts with funds for payout at Western Union locations around the world.","And in Business Solutions, we launched an exclusive agreement with Mercer Outsourcing in the U.K., the largest pension administrator, to handle payment to retirees living in 80 countries.","These are just a few examples of actions we have taken to evolve Western Union. We believe strongly in our core, but we also know we are -- have a great opportunity to leverage our assets and extend more services to more customers as we execute our vision to be the premier financial service provider to the underserved.","We hope you will be able to join us for our Investor Day on May 9 in New York City where you will hear much more about our strategies and plans to grow all of our businesses. However, right now, I would like to turn the call over to Scott to give you a more detailed review of the quarter. Scott?","Scott T. Scheirman","Thank you, Hikmet.","Overall for the quarter, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 9% on a reported and constant currency basis. Consolidated pro forma revenue increased 4%, or 5% constant currency, including Travelex Global Business Payments in the prior-year period. Consolidated pro forma revenue growth was driven by improved trends in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment.","The Consumer-to-Business segment again delivered a slight revenue increase in the quarter. And Business Solutions revenue grew 5% on a pro forma basis, adjusting to include Travelex in the prior-year period. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, constant currency revenue growth accelerated to 5%, up from 3% in the fourth quarter. Transaction growth also improved to 7%, up from 5% last quarter. C2C cross-border principal increased 2%, or 3% on a constant currency basis, which was steady with last quarter. C2C principal per transaction declined 4% year-over-year or 3% on a constant currency basis.","Turning to the regions. C2C revenue in the Europe and CIS region, which represented 22% of consolidated revenues, was flat year-over-year due to the expected softness in Southern Europe and Russia. This was a slight improvement from the 1% decline last quarter as the rate of decline in Russia moderated. Our turnaround strategies in Russia are being phased in, including adding a retail network, further developing our existing bank network with new locations, planning ATM kiosk providers, adjusting prices for various corridors and renewed marketing for the brand.","Turning to North America. The region's revenues increased 5% compared to 2% last quarter. U.S. outbound and Canada strengthened while domestic money transfer continues to have solid momentum with revenue growth of 9% on transaction growth of 12% in the quarter. Mexico improved from last quarter with both revenue and transactions increasing 3% in the quarter. As we mentioned in February, we are still determining and implementing changes to our compliance-related practices in Mexico. Although we still expect to see some negative impact on the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands as we evolve our business model and compliance-related practices throughout the year, our Western Union brand is performing well.","In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue increased 6% in the quarter, an improvement from 2% last quarter, with good growth from both the Gulf states and Africa.","The Asia Pacific region grew revenues 7%, which is up slightly from last quarter's growth. This quarter's results were driven by growth across the region, including India and the Philippines. China revenue declined, although this was primarily due to our decision to restrict transfer from Argentina to avoid currency risk on our cash balances in that country.","The Latin America and Caribbean region revenue grew 2%, which was down slightly from last quarter. Lack of revenue growth is being negatively impacted by currency translations compared to the prior-year period.","Westernunion.com, which we now report as our sixth region, again delivered strong results as revenue increased 39% in the quarter. Westernunion.com results are not included in the growth rates for the other 5 regions.","Total electronic channels revenue, which includes westernunion.com as well as account-based money transfer and mobile, increased 38% in the quarter and represented 3% of total company revenue. In addition to westernunion.com, we also continue to make strong progress with adding our services to online banking platforms.","Revenue from account-based money transfer transactions increased 43% in the quarter. We now have nearly 90 banks signed for account-based money transfer, with 44 active, including U.S. Bank and Regions Bank in the U.S.","Prepaid revenue increased 17% in the quarter. In total, prepaid, including third-party top-up, represented just under 1% of company revenue for the quarter. Our prepaid cards are now available at more than 20,000 retail locations globally, including over 19,000 locations in the U.S. We're now in 7-Eleven stores in the U.S. and have launched cards in the U.K., Germany and Austria. In the quarter, we had over $260 million loaded onto our cards through over 600,000 loads.","Turning back to the total C2C business. The spread between transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 2 percentage points, excluding the impact of currency which negatively impacted the spread by approximately 1 point. The impact of net price decreases was less than 1% in the first quarter, and mix was about 1%. For the full year, we continue to expect C2C price decreases to be in the range of 1% to 2%.","Moving to the Consumer-to-Business segment. This business continued to have steady results, with the revenue increasing 1%, or 3% on a constant currency basis, led by international growth in South America.","Business Solutions reported revenue of $87 million in the quarter, which compared to $28 million a year ago. On a pro forma basis adding last year's Travelex results back to the 2011 first quarter, Business Solutions revenue increased 5%, or 4% on a constant currency basis. Australia performed well where we saw some slower-than-expected revenue growth in our North America and U.K. businesses in the quarter. This was primarily driven by slower global trade growth and lower currency volatility in some markets. Currency volatility benefited Business Solutions in the second half of last year.","Despite the slower growth in the quarter, our customer acquisition remained strong and we're continuing to expand to new markets. And the integration of Travelex Global Business Payments is progressing well. And we remain committed to delivering constant currency revenue growth in low double digits this year.","Turning to consolidated margins. The first quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 23.9%, which compares to 24.4% in the prior year. Excluding $6 million of Travelex integration expenses, our consolidated margin was 24.3% compared to 26.3%, excluding $24 million of restructuring expenses in the prior-year period.","EBITDA margin, excluding integration expenses, was 28.9% compared to 29.7%, excluding restructuring expenses, in the first quarter of last year. The primary driver of the reduction in operating margin was Business Solutions and the impact of Travelex Global Business Payments acquisition, including an incremental $10 million of intangibles amortization.","The first quarter consolidated margin was also negatively impacted by higher marketing expenses, additional costs related to investments into new ventures and southwest border compliance, acquisition-related expenses for Costa and Finint and the timing of certain expenses. In addition, marketing expenses were 3.8% of revenue in the quarter compared to 3.4% in the prior year. For the full year, we expect marketing expenses as a percent of revenue to be similar to last year at around 4%. These impacts were partially offset by benefits from revenue leverage, currency, restructuring savings and reduced bank fees related to Durbin.","We believe our consolidated margins will improve as we move through the year, and we are still targeting GAAP margins of around 25% or margins, excluding Travelex integration expenses, of around 26% for the full year. Business Solutions margin should improve throughout the year as we benefit from revenue leverage and the beginning of some operating synergies in the second half. Consumer money transfer margins should also improve due to revenue leverage and timing of expenses.","There were no restructuring expenses in the first quarter of 2012 as we completed all of our activities in the third quarter of last year. We realized approximately $18 million in restructuring savings in this year's first quarter. We continue to expect approximately $70 million of savings in 2012, or an incremental $15 million, compared to 2011.","The tax rate in the quarter was 14.8%, which compares to 23.5% in the first quarter of last year. The decrease in our tax rate is primarily due to the resolution of the treatment of our international operations, as we noted in the announcement of our agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on December 15, 2011, and the benefit of some small non-recurring adjustments in the quarter. For the full year, we still expect a tax rate of between 16% and 17%.","Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.40, which compared to $0.32 in the prior year, or $0.35, excluding restructuring charges. Excluding last year's restructuring expenses, EPS increased 14%. First quarter 2012 EPS also rounded to $0.40, excluding the $6 million of pretax Travelex integration expenses.","The C2C operating segment margin was 27.7% compared to 28.6% in the same period last year. The margin benefited from revenue leverage, currency and restructuring savings and was offset by increased marketing, Costa and Finint acquisition-related expenses, investments in westernunion.com, compliance costs and timing of some expenses.","Within C2C, marketing as a percentage of revenue increased 60 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. Costa and Finint are currently negatively impacting margins, but once we complete the integration and begin to realize cost savings, we should see positive contributions to margins later in the year.","The Consumer-to-Business operating margin increased to 26.5% compared to 22.6% in the prior-year period. The margin increased primarily due to the impact of lower debit processing expenses related to Durbin. As a reminder, the reduction of debit fees due to Durbin is having a positive impact on our C2B margins, although it will negatively impact revenue in some cases as we pass through the savings.","Business Solutions reported an operating loss of $15 million for the quarter compared to an operating loss of $4 million in the prior-year period. Last year's loss does not include Travelex Global Business Payments. This quarter's $15 million loss included $14 million of intangibles amortization and $6 million of Travelex integration expense. Intangibles amortizations in last year's first quarter was $4 million. As mentioned, the Business Solutions profitability should improve throughout the year as we benefit from revenue leverage and cost savings.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. We remain in a strong position. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $215 million, which includes the impact of approximately $65 million of tax payments relating to the agreement with the IRS. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $76 million or 5% of revenue. As we noted in February, capital expenditures as a percent of revenue will be higher this year due to increased signing bonuses on agent contracts for several major renewals, and we are aggressively pursuing new agent signings. We are also adding to investments in westernunion.com and other new technology. We expect capital expenditures to get back to 3% of revenue on average after 2012, although any given year could be impacted by additional new agent signings or other initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $64 million in the quarter.","At quarter end, the company had debt of $3.6 billion and cash of $1.4 billion. Approximately 1\/2 of the cash was in the United States.","We continue our strong capital deployment policies. We resumed our share repurchase activities in the quarter, repurchasing 8 million shares totaling $147 million at an average price of $17.69. This represents 1% of the total shares outstanding. As of March 31, our shares outstanding were 614 million shares. We have approximately $470 million remaining under our existing authorization, which expires at the end of 2012.","We also increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.10 per share and paid out $62 million in dividends. We remain committed to continuing with strong return of funds to shareholders throughout the year.","Finally, we are affirming our full year 2012 financial outlook, including all the metrics provided in our February earnings release.","In summary, our Consumer-to-Consumer business has started the year well, and we believe we will see better results from Business Solutions and stronger margins as we advance through the year. We are making good progress with the Travelex integration and in establishing other new growth areas in Ventures. We will continue to deploy our strong cash flows to reinvest in the business and return funds to shareholders.","Operator, we're now ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It looks like the trends on the transactions were a little bit stronger than, at least, we expected, and I'm curious. I mean, a lot of the corridors that you had some questions about last quarter, including Russia and Mexico, seem like they've hung in there, especially Mexico. Your revenue is also a little bit better than your guidance range, your constant currency revenue at least at about 5%. So what's inhibiting you from bringing the guidance up? Or are we just too early at the point right now, given, I guess, last quarter was around 3%?","Hikmet Ersek","Darren, this is Hikmet. Yes, I think, generally, I would say that we have stayed too cautious because given the uncertainty in Europe. We do have some improvements in North America and in Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific regions, but I would say that I would -- it's too early to give a different guidance than it is. We are affirming our guidance. We are very pleased with the quarter with our -- especially in the C2C revenue. I think the transactions are coming. There are some positive improvements here. But given also with what yesterday announcement already, what happened to the stock market, right, on the -- about the U.S., about the European news, I would say that I'm staying still cautious here for generally, and we -- but I'm affirming the revenue guidance.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Hikmet, just to clarify: I mean, we're now at, again, a little bit of a higher growth rate. Can you just give us a little more color, specific color, on what actually might have surprised you this quarter versus what you had expected when you gave that guidance? Because it looks like some of the corridors certainly were a little better.","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I think I didn't -- nothing specific surprising. I would say that the people are on the field and they are really giving us good indications about that. I think we have the same challenges, like in Russia, like in Mexico corridor. Their continuance to softness in some parts of Europe is here. But also, that gives us how good our business, how good is that, to be in 200 countries. The portfolio, managing the portfolio being in 200 countries has up and downs. But also the -- within the Europe even, like countries like Germany are growing good and gives us a comfort zone to affirming our guidance.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just last question for me, and then I'll turn back to the queue. But on the margin side, you said -- I think, Scott, you said earlier the margin should show improvement through the year. Is it just growth on the top line and scale? Is it the timing of costs and marketing? Can you give us a little more color on specifically why through the year we'd expect it to ramp up?","Scott T. Scheirman","Sure, Darrin. If you will, on a full year basis, we're still targeting operating margins of 26%, excluding the integration costs and EBITDA margins of 30%, excluding the integration costs, if you will. So we see a path there. A couple things that will be helpful as we move forward the next 2 to 3 quarters: First, it's the fixed cost leverage from higher absolute revenue as we move through the quarters; and then also improvement in Business Solutions. We currently have some heavy upfront spending there. We'll see some cost savings as we combine Travelex and Western Union Business Solutions later on in the year and then just better revenue growth from Business Solutions as we move through the year. Also, there's other things, Darrin, to a lesser extent, but Costa and Finint will have a lower integration spending and begin to see some of the synergy savings in the latter half of the year. And then we just did have timing of operating expenses, some with IT and operations. So some of the timing was heavier in the first quarter compared to other quarters. And the other thing I would add is as we run the business, you'll see some variation in margins from quarter-to-quarter but really making the right investment decisions, the right business decisions to drive growth and market share.","Hikmet Ersek","Just on -- add on that, Scott, Darrin. Incremental investment in -- like in westernunion.com, right? I mean, it pays back. You could see there\u2019s almost 40% growth. And people. We opened our office in San Francisco. We are hiring people. I think they are growing, and we want to grow that business faster. We have a target about, in 2015, $500 million. And I'll give you -- going to give you more color on that at our May Investors Day, 9 -- May 9 Investors Day in New York. But I'm very pleased with the investments. And they are long-term investments and they are going to pay back.","Operator","And the next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to ask about any correlation to the improvement in the C2C transactions. But the margins were a little bit lower than we expected. Is that due to -- I mean, any of that pick up in transaction growth due to the marketing or anything we can point to exactly that actually hurt the margins but helped transactions?","Scott T. Scheirman","Bryan, not specifically, if you will. If you look at each of the regions, 4 of the 5 regions did see improved revenue growth Q1 over Q4, if you will, so it was very much on a global basis. And markets such as the Germany were strong, Philippines, India, U.S. domestic, so it was really around the globe where we did see strength for the most part. Again, there are some challenges in certain geographies, but as we look at the C2C margins, they were down about 90 basis points, if you will. Year-over-year, marketing was up about 60 basis points, but on a full year basis we'll run marketing right around 4% of revenue, so you will get some variation quarter-to-quarter. We also had some costs for the Costa and Finint integration. Again, as we move through the year, we think that will be helpful to margins. And then, just some timing of expenses. So nothing particular line of sight. I think it's a good execution around the globe and the benefit of having the portfolio of being in 200 countries. No country outside of the U.S. is greater than 6% of the top line, so the portfolio is definitely helping us.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just looking at the metrics, last year, C2C transactions started off the first quarter at 7%, then it went 6%, 5%, 5%, to fill out the -- 6%, 5%, 5% to fill out the rest of the year, so it decelerated slightly. I guess any thoughts on what the outlook might be for transaction growth? Will it remain at this 7% level? Will it increase; will it decrease a little bit, like it did last year?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, Bryan, in our business, it depends really change in by corridor-by-corridor and by quarter-by-quarter, right? But generally, I'm -- once again, I'm affirming my revenue guidance. I gave it beginning of the year. I feel quite comfortable with that. And we had a good quarter and a better quarter than last, Q4. And I think I'm pleased with the business results.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Last question for me, just on the Latin America region. I guess revenue grew 2% and then transactions grew at 8%, that's a 6-point delta, a little larger than typically we've seen. Can you just help us understand the delta there?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, Bryan. There definitely was some currency impact there. So if you were to currency-adjust the lack of number, the 2% -- I'm not saying it would be 8%, but it would be 2% revenue growth would be closer to 8% than the 2% that you're saying. The delta would be much smaller.","Operator","And the next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to ask about the B2B, the Business Solutions segment. I didn't quite hear. How did that perform versus planned in the first quarter? And I think I heard that it was cyclically a little bit challenged, but I also wanted to confirm if we're still looking for $400 million for the year in terms of revenue.","Hikmet Ersek","I think, first, Tien-Tsin, we are -- as I mentioned before, we are committed to our low double-digit growth for the coming years. I think we did some -- see some softness in our U.S. and U.K. business due to global trade and due to currency volatility and -- but we did also very strong growth in our Australia business. I would say that the quarter came a little bit softer than I expected, but I am committed -- we are committed for the low double-digit growth.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, the only thing I would add, Tien-Tsin, from quarter to quarter in this business, you do see some variation in revenue growth rates. If you look at the second half of 2011, because there was a lot of currency volatility in the marketplace, you did see some higher growth rates and some variations among the quarter. While we think, in the first quarter, we had good -- very good growth in Australia, Asia Pacific, some softness in U.S. and U.K. Some of that is really due to trade being a little bit soft and then just, I'd say, lack of currency volatility. But we are committed. I -- we see line of sight to growing that business low double-digit, pro forma revenue growth for 2012 and right around that $400 million of revenue that you asked about.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. So some of it is going be easier comps around FX volatility, but did you also sign some new distribution points as well? I'm just trying to...","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, absolutely, Tien-Tsin. We are -- as you recall, we were in 16 countries as we acquired Travelex and put them together. Now we are in 25 countries. We just announced the -- one of the biggest pension payments organization in U.K., Mercer, and they are paying out to U.K. pensions and retirement people in 80 countries, so I think we are getting new accounts here. So the -- we have sales people that are quite active. And our agents. I just came back from Asia, from Indonesia and I met some agents there. They are very excited about the opportunity to launch new services B2B.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. Last one, just sort of a bigger picture question, I'm sure you'll talk about this at the Analyst Day. But WU Pay, I've just been doing some work around that area. Is it fair, Hikmet, to call this your, I don't know, a digital cash wallet, maybe...","Hikmet Ersek","Yes.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I'm curious, is it live now? What's the activity like? How many billers do you have? And is it -- should we think about this potentially being added to other marketplaces in the future? I'm just curious what the quick plan is on that.","Hikmet Ersek","Absolutely. I think it's too early. We are going to give you more color, as you say it, in May 9. But you could -- you may call it a wallet, but I call it WU Pay. It really gives the capability to the -- to our customers to use also not only their account from a credit card fund, their account from a credit card, but also cash funding. Many customers are not -- don't want to give -- purchase online goods, don't want to give their credit card numbers or online account numbers. They can go through 1 of the 500,000 locations in the future. Now it's only in the U.S. but also in the future -- and pay their bills there. So that gives the capability. And the good thing here also, we want to also add that on our westernunion.com, which is growing, by the way, by 40%, as you know. And having direct access to the customers, their accounts, I think it's a -- that's the eBillme, which we acquired about 6 months ago, and now we changed it to WU Pay. We are using our existing brands, Western Union brands, and promoting that to our new potential customers.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. So Tien-Tsin, it's live for online payments to merchants. So we've got several hundred merchants there where they're connected to. And then it'll be live for payment on westernunion.com in the next couple of months.","Operator","And the next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess my first question is -- you do have, this year, several major renewals in C2C. What should we expect from that? I mean, lower commission rates, is that on the table? Exclusivity? Any comments yet on those things?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, we -- as you know, Ashwin, we have some principles. I think we like our brand, we like our exclusivity because I believe that our brand attracts customers to the point of sale. And we would like to protect our brand and protect our premium pricing. This kind of -- depending also about the market, of course, but generally we are in line with our principles here. Of course, we want to expand our -- we have now our -- today is a big day for Western Union. We opened our 500,000th locations. Actually, we are going to open in lunch time our 500,000th location with a press conference, everything. And I would like to expand our touch points. As I mentioned at the last conference call, we are having a target of what, 1 million touch points globally to reaching our bands. We are going to -- aggressively going to sign new agents. We're going to -- but also improving our margins. Over the years, our costs of sales have been decreasing, and we would like to go that path. And we hired new sales people. One of the biggest investments we did the last 2 quarters are hiring new sales people on the field and expanding our sales approaches. That's going to continue.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And moving to the B2B, can you comment on the relative importance to revenue growth of things like currency volatility versus new client signings, trade trends? What's sort of a -- actually, if you can just comment on the relative importance of that.","Hikmet Ersek","Well, obviously, the existing customers\u2019 revenue has to grow because it's a core in the B2B, right? I mean, that has -- we saw some impact here, with the exits in North America and U.K. Part of the world which the currency exchange rate was favorable to us with the -- where the -- our existing customer wants to trade, they use us, like in Australia and Asia. New agents, new -- sorry, new client signings are very aggressive. We are -- as I mentioned before, we are in 25 countries. We are signing new ones and it takes some time until they come up with revenues. But one of the new Western Union, you will see that be more aggressive at the market and signing new clients. And we are doing that, and within the -- it has been only a few months we acquired Travelex and we put it on the Western Union Business Solutions. We started with 16 countries; we are already in 25 countries. That impact will take some time, but you'll see it.","Scott T. Scheirman","And I'd just add, Ashwin, that our global market share is right around 2%, so we really have an opportunity to globalize this market. It's very underserved. And we believe our brand, our global footprint, our compliance capabilities, all those things play very well to globalizing this space over the coming years.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. One housekeeping question. Share count did not go down in spite of the buyback. Was that timing in the quarter, or issuance? I mean, can you comment on that?","Scott T. Scheirman","The -- it'd probably just be timing because what you're probably referring to is that both in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, we had roughly 622 million shares -- diluted shares outstanding that we are focused on. Yes, it would just be timing, if you will. What I will say with stock buyback, since we're on that topic, is that we bought back about 115 million -- I'm sorry, about 150 million shares -- $150 million worth of our stock. We plan to be active. Our buyback levels are probably somewhere in the range of at least on 2009, 2010, so $400 million to $600 million, somewhere in that range, from that standpoint.","Michael A. Salop","And Ashwin, we've called out, at the end of quarter there were 614 million basic shares outstanding.","Operator","And next question comes from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one quick housekeeping question. Can you go back through the domestic international and Mexico transaction and revenue growth numbers, per the old disclosures, so we make sure we have those mapping correctly?","Scott T. Scheirman","Sure. The domestic business had 12% transaction growth in the quarter and 9% revenue growth, so very solid in the first quarter. And then the Mexico business, Julio, had transactions and revenue both growing at 3% in the first quarter.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then the international piece? Sorry.","Scott T. Scheirman","Oh, the international piece, you would see 6% transaction growth and 4% constant currency revenue growth on the international piece.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And obviously, we've talked a lot about the Business Solutions piece. In terms of revenue improvement, it sounds like you guys reaffirmed the $400 million. I guess I'm just trying to get more specifics on what is it that gives you guys the confidence in the line of sight, if you will, on the improved revenue performance with Business Solutions segment.","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I think, first of all, we believe that the existing customers are going to use as we -- as the currency exchange rate changes. And it has -- it's nothing, Julio, it's nothing -- it happens in this business, depending on the quarters, depending on the months when the trades happening, that's one. And secondly also, the new signings are coming very strong and we are signing new clients here. That's makes me comfortable with $400 million.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Yes, I think I mean -- for us, I mean, obviously this is an area that's a little bit newer in terms of trending out and trying to understand what the drivers are. So I mean, at this point, if you had to make a suggestion on what we would -- what we should be focusing on, it sounds like FX volatility might be something to be tracking. Are there any other sort of macro metrics or external data points that you would suggest would also be important indicators for the business, though?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, that's the first one. And the second one, I will definitely add the global trade, especially for the SMEs. The global trade within the SME sector is something that you may have a look.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the bill payment business, obviously the -- well, that, the disclosure in terms of the margins does give us a pretty nice look in terms of the margin profile of that business now that we can sort of see that separate from the Business Solutions segment. I'm trying to understand what you guys think is kind of the margin profile of that business longer term. Obviously, some benefits post the debit interchange rule changes, et cetera and much stronger performance and, I think, what we were even thinking about here in terms of the model. But where do you think that margin goes from here? And what are the most important drivers over the longer term for the bill payment segment, if you will?","Scott T. Scheirman","The drivers, like it would be for most businesses, is top line revenue growth. And on a constant currency basis for revenues we\u2019re up 3% in the first quarter. Now as we move through the year, we may see some -- because of Durbin and some pass-through, may see some impact on the top line. But we see the C2B business as being steady, for sure, Julio, from that standpoint. And so a key driver of the margins will be the revenue growth. Without getting real specific, I mean I do feel comfortable that it's a type of business that it's going to have a margin that will at least have a 2 in front of it, as we move forward. It's a good business. It's in the U.S.; it's in Argentina and we're doing some things internationally, and it complements our money transfer business very well. And I think it will be a very profitable business with at least 2 in front of the margin as we move forward, for sure.","Operator","And the next question comes from Glenn Fodor of Morgan Stanley.","Vasundhara Govil - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Vasun Govil for Glenn. Can you just quickly update us on the compliance situation in Mexico, how that is progressing and by when do you expect to be in some compliance?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. I think, as we mentioned in our February Earning Calls, we have been working with the appointed external monitor very close and to terminate -- appreciate changes, which was outlined in our agreement, and improvements about anti-money laundering oversight along all the border. I think we did do some changes last year on Vigo and on Orlandi Valuta brands and also on our brand's ID threshold changes which has impacted our high-principal transfers which we still see it. And currently, we are also investing on the new technology changes. And we have other many projects underway. So we believe that these changes have affected our principal and market share in 2012, but we also believe that these changes are needed. These changes are happening and we've been -- we're going to be the -- as an industry leader, we are implementing the changes. And that will also impact all the industry long term, yes.","Vasundhara Govil - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just also recently, research piece by the Pew Hispanic Center seemed to suggest that migration from Mexico to U.S. has steeply declined and that there's actually a reversal of trend where Mexicans are leaving the U.S. and that trend has picked up. Can you comment on that and how you see that impacting long-term growth in that corridor?","Hikmet Ersek","I think we believe that Mexico corridor for us is a very important corridor, right? I think we are going to -- we believe there's still room to grow. I believe that we're going to continue to invest on that. I didn't see any big changes on our current business impacted by migration changes, but as I said, the biggest impact has been around our compliance programs.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. And I'll just say, as reminder, I think everyone probably knows this, but part of what we're saying is that Mexico is only about 6% of our top line, so it's one of many markets. When you think about a portfolio of business, Mexico is an important market but just 1 of 200 countries.","Hikmet Ersek","And these changes have been in 200 countries, and in many, many years, many migration regulations, all this has been here, so...","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Kissane of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Have you seen any improvement in Italy since the tax was rescinded, I guess, about a month ago?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I would say that, generally we don't give specific country numbers in -- but I would say, generally, this implementation has been for all country. It's -- doesn't impact Western Union or the others. And the Southern European area stays as a challenging area, still. We do see in total in Europe business a little bit improvement, but in Southern Europe, I would say that we are -- I'm still cautious there.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Scott, just to clarify: Higher FX volatility is actually positive for B2B, right, because you can generate a bigger spread? Is that the case? So you have actually more difficult comps in the back half of the year. Is that...","Scott T. Scheirman","What -- where volatility really helps us is it just creates, if you will, Jim, uncertainty in the marketplace. And so customers are more likely to be active trading forwards or options, if you will, if the currency\u2019s, if you will, moving all over the board. So it generally incites people to come into the market and, if you will, transact.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So you don't get a higher spread, is what you're saying when it's...","Scott T. Scheirman","It can vary a tad bit, but it's not a big factor. It's really just the volatility drives, if you will, customers into the market because of some uncertainty of where rates might end up, right? High or low, good or bad, depending upon where you're standing.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. And just longer term, where do you see B2B margins, say, 3, 4 years out?","Scott T. Scheirman","Jim, I think that is a very leveragable business model, so as we look 3 to 4 years out, I do see that the EBITDA margins can be somewhere around where we're seeing the company margins today of 30%. It's a very leveragable business model. We're spending $50 million to very well integrate the businesses in 2012. And I think that's going to give us really good technology, really good product offerings. And that fixed cost structure, if you will, we can leverage. And I see, down the road, we could have margins around -- EBITDA margins around that 30% spot.","Operator","And the next question comes from David Togut of Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Hikmet, at your Analyst Day in September of 2010, you highlighted reduction in agent commissions as these contracts come up for renewal as a major driver of a long-term margin expansion. How far are you through that cycle of reducing agent commissions? And can you quantify expected savings for this year?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, generally, as you know, over the years, our agent agreements are long-term agreements in 5- to 7-years agreement. And we have about -- it gives out many, many thousands of agents, which gives us 500,000 locations, so depending on the country, depending on the cycle of the agents. But generally, we are driving our costs down. We had -- cost of -- what was the costs on the...","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, if look at -- David, cost of services in 2010 x onetimers was about 57% of our revenues, if you will. And then if you fast-forward that to full year 2011, it's 56%, so down about 100 basis points, our cost of services as a percentage of revenue.","Hikmet Ersek","And as we move forward with the agent negotiations, we are still targeting lower commission rates. But it's also a win-win situation. Agents also have to win. We have to win. I think, generally, the direction is we are having lower costs of services.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Do you have a target for cost of services for this year and next?","Hikmet Ersek","We didn't disclose that, but generally, it's in line with our -- we are keeping it, let me say, lower.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, I'd say, David, we have a spot that we want to get to. We've got, like every business, a 3-year business plan, so we have a roadmap of where we want to head. But without getting into a lot of specifics, for a pot of reasons, one of our objectives in 2012 near term is to have 26% operating margins, 30% EBITDA margins. And a combination of revenue growth, productivity initiatives such as agent commissions offset by some investment spending will allow us to get to those 26% margins.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just finally, on capital deployment. You indicated a target repurchase this year of $400 million to $600 million. What should we expect for dividend policy this year? And are you done with big deals for now?","Scott T. Scheirman","I would say on -- let me start with the acquisition front. We'll continue to look at things, David, but near term, I don't see us doing any sizable acquisitions, if you will, from that standpoint. From a return of capital, clearly, investing in the business is important. As I mentioned, I don't see any large acquisitions in the near term. And then, getting our capital back to our shareholders is very important. About 60 days ago, early February, we increased our dividend by 25%. It has roughly a 2% yield right now, but we also believe, given where the stock price is at, that it's undervalued. We think it's important to being -- to buying back the stock. As we look forward, the management team will work with our Board. We continue to want to have a balanced payout, all things being equal. And if the business performs, we'd like to move the dividend along, too, if the business performs.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So does that mean the payout ratio will increase this year?","Scott T. Scheirman","No, I don't have --- I'm not giving you specific targets for 2012. We just did raise the dividend by 25% in February. And I think, historically, we've got a very good track record of raising the dividend at least annually.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to start with a question on the principal per transaction growth. I think that metric, even in constant currency, slipped a little bit this quarter, which you highlighted on one of your slides. I wanted to just get a sense of whether that was due to Europe or any specific corridors. And do you expect it to stay in slightly negative territory for the next couple of quarters?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, Jason. Really, I would point you to just a couple markets. And again, it's the portfolio approach of being in 200 countries. But Russia where we have some challenges, that carries a higher average principal per transaction. So when that business is soft, it has, if you will, a bigger impact on the consolidated number. And then, also China. For example, out of Argentina to China, we're seeing some very high dollar sends. And for a number of reasons, we pulled back on that business. So the Russia and the China corridors are impacting that principal per transaction. I think what's key with our business, the biggest driver behind our revenue is the customer and the transaction, getting the customer in the front door, whether it's retail or electronic, and that's what drives the revenue growth.","Hikmet Ersek","Also, DMT has an impact.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. And DMT had somewhat of an impact because of the $5 for $50. DMT continues to be successful, with 12% transaction growth and 9% revenue growth.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right, right. Okay, that's helpful. And just to pick up on a couple of your earlier comments. Scott, I think you had referenced your 3-year business plans and you did talk a little bit about, over the next 3 to 4 years, where you see B2B margins specifically could go. Just given the fact that you guys obviously are in investment mode as it relates to electronic channels and talking about some of the longer-term payoffs there, what will be the right time for you guys to talk about some longer-term financial targets in terms of ranges at least for overall revenue and EPS growth and potential margin trends? I mean, is that something that we can conceivably start hearing about at your analyst meeting next month, or are we going to have to wait a bit longer than that?","Scott T. Scheirman","Jason, I think you're going to -- at the Analyst Day, we've got our -- Hikmet and myself and our 50 business leaders. We're going to talk a lot about our strategy of where we're heading not only near term but long term from that standpoint. And the objective at the Analyst Day would -- is to, if you will, give you all the building blocks, if you will, so on a long-term basis, you can kind of take your view of what is the revenue growth, the margin profile, EPS. But we'll really give you those building blocks and strategies that I think will be helpful as you look out the next 3 or 4 years.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. As we stay still very optimistic, and we're -- I'm looking forward to the next years, coming years. I mean, we did give some indications, like the westernunion.com, like having a $0.5 billion business year 2015. We give some indications on the Western Union Business Solutions and all these things. And you're going to get more color. And I just wanted to extend my invitation to all on the call again for the Investors Day in New York, May 9. That will really give you more color about the new Western Union, about how we change and to take the company to the next stage adding new products and new services. I think that will give a kind of -- for you an indication of where The Western Union could be in 3, 4 years.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And just last for me. Any update on PSD initiatives in Europe perhaps in terms of incremental agent locations you've been able to secure or any other metrics you're in a position to share?","Hikmet Ersek","Certainly. On the PSD, we added about -- we're almost at 10,000 locations. We are at -- on 9,000 -- more than 9,000 locations. I think we are expanding very good there. So it's all -- the 10,000 locations are of course in only the retail locations, which we were not -- in the past, not allowed to open. Now we can open them. I think it brings us additional revenue. I'm pleased with the progress we are doing with the PSD.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","As a follow-up to Bryan's earlier question with regard to the branch buildout, Hikmet, I think you've been pretty clear you've -- that's one of your initiatives in terms of accelerating the growth and increasing the Western Union footprint. Do you have some thoughts as to when we may see the benefits of that initiative in terms of faster C2C revenue growth? Are we seeing that today? What kind of payback from a timing perspective do you expect on those investments?","Hikmet Ersek","First of all, our business is growing with the expansion of our network. I mean, that\u2019s very clear. We've been -- I've been now with the company 13 years, and I remember as we celebrate our 100,000 locations. Now we are celebrating today our 500,000 locations. So that has been -- without that expansion, we wouldn't be so successful. I just want to remind you that a few years ago we had a 7% market share, and we are now around 17-plus-percent market share on the remittance market, cross-border marketed. And that's due to expansion of our network. And we have this vision of having 1 million locations because that gives also not only on the core business, which we believe it's going to grow transfer location-to-location, money transfer, but it also has this big impact to our westernunion.com, WU Pay, really connecting electronic with locations. Nobody in minutes can pay for -- from so many countries to 500,000 locations from westernunion.com. I could, say now as I'm sitting in New York, send money to anywhere to 200 countries, to 500,000 locations in minutes money. So that's going to expand, that's -- we have these 1 million touch point. One other thing is also, as you know, recently we've launched ATM Money Transfer in Italy; we launched ATM Money Transfer in Japan; we launched ATM Money Transfer in Turkey. So it's not only working in other location, it's also using the electronic in a different way. And we're going to continue that. I mean, it's already paying back. Westernunion.com wouldn't grow almost 40% if you wouldn't have the location globally. So the team is very focused, and I'm very pleased with the progress.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So maybe think about the branch buildout strategy as part and parcel of the kind of growth we've seen in the last couple years, and maybe cyclical factors are going be more of an impact on the C2C transaction revenue growth prospectively?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I can give you more color in May 9 meeting and so you're going to hear it more. But the other thing also, what brings us the location expansion is adding new products like our stored value products, prepaid cards. I think we have -- and you're going to see that we have this vision, as we are the biggest money transfer network of the world, we would like to have been also the biggest pre-load and cash-out network of the world. And to do that, I think we have to expand on our brand health, our agent network health, our presence in 200 countries and the regulatory environment health.","Michael A. Salop","Great. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us. As Hikmet mentioned, we do have our Investor Day on May 9 in New York, so we hope you'll be able to join us there as well.

I'm pleased with our business performance in the fourth quarter. As we delivered 4% constant currency revenue growth despite continued macro challenges in several markets. Our U.S. originated consumer-to-consumer business once again produced strong results, and westernunion.com money transfer continue to excel, delivering 30% revenue growth in constant currency. These positive results have posted continued softness from the oil producing countries and the impact from the India government's demonetization program resulting in 3% overall currency revenue growth for our consumer money transfer business in the quarter.","For the full year, we delivered our financial outlook with adjusted earnings per share of $1.75 exceeding the high end of the original outlook driven by favorability in expenses and our tax rates. Our business again generated over $1 billion of cash flow from operating activities, allowing us to return almost $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Before turning to our 2017 outlook, I want to take few minutes to discuss the legal settlements with U.S. Federal and State government agencies that we recently announced. Late last year, late 2016 the Department of Justice provided us a proposal for a combined resolution of the U.S. Attorney investigation that were previously disclosed.","We then sought to coordinate a joined resolution with other potential government claims. After engaging in intense negotiations with multiple agencies, we reached the agreement that were announced in January. We worked hard to put this investigation behind us and we are pleased to move forward. These issues cited in these investigations occurred mainly over the 2004 through 2012 periods.","As most of you know, we made significant enhancements to our compliance programs over the last several years. Improvements that have been implemented includes adding more employees with law enforcement and regulatory expertise to our compliance leadership team, strengthening consumer education and agent training, bolstering our technology-driven controls and changing our governance structure so that our Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the compliance committee of the board.","We have over 2000 employees dedicated to compliance and spend approximately $200 million a year on these activities. Over the last 10 years, reported fraud represented less than one-tenth of 1% of our consumer money transfer transactions. We have also received praise and letters of commendation from many federal, state, local and international regulators and law enforcement agencies for our compliance innovations and corporations in the last few years.","As always, we are fully committed to vigorously protecting our consumers and we will continue to invest in these efforts.","Well, let's turn back to the business. As we entered 2017, we are facing many of the same micro challenges we saw last year including soft economies in oil producing countries and an uncertain geopolitical environment, as well as negative impact of the stronger dollar on our reported revenues and profits. We generally expect business conditions to be similar to last year and we're projecting low-single digit constant currency revenue growth with continued strong growth from westerunion.com.","We also remain focused on maximizing our long-term opportunities. Our global network is strong with a leading combination of locations, digital assets, partners, cross-border money movement expertise and regulatory and compliance infrastructure.","In 2017, we are emphasizing expanding online and mobile app offerings in two additional markets building the account payout business and increasing the footprint, improving customer experience through initiatives such as stage-and-pay, where consumers can initiate a transaction on a mobile device and paying in cash at retail, and leveraging the EDGE digital platform to acquire more clients and gain share in Business Solutions.","We are also embarking on comprehensive efforts to change how we work as an organization and how we can better maximize our opportunities. To accomplish this, last year we begun a program that we called the WU Way. The WU Way is a company-wise initiative designed to transform the company's operating model to better enable innovation, improve the customer experience and drive cost efficiencies. WU Way initiatives focused on technology transformation, network productivity, end-to-end improvement in customer and agent processes and organization redesign.","This includes transforming our technology group to create a more agile and centralized fintech organization that can better respond to the evolving digital focus of our business. We have dedicated significant resources to the WU Way and are investing heavily in the program in 2017.","In addition to technology, we are in the process of redesigning and creating new operating structures applying lean methodologies to streamline processes and driving productivity and efficiencies throughout the company. We will talk much more about these efforts in coming quarters.","Finally, we're very pleased to announce that our board of directors declared a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend and approved a new $1.2 billion share repurchase program. We remain confident in the cash flow generation of the business and firmly committed to strong capital allocation for our shareholders.","Now, I will turn the call over to Raj to further discuss our fourth quarter results and 2017 outlook.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Hikmet. As I review 2016 financial results, I will focus primarily on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules.","Fourth quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1%, or increased 4% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior-year period. The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits, reduced fourth quarter revenue by approximately $59 million, compared to the prior year. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenues were flat in the quarter, or increased 3% constant currency, while transactions grew 2%. C2C constant currency revenue benefited from strong growth in westernunion.com, while geographically results were led by the North America and Latin America regions. Total C2C cross-border principle declined 1%, or increased 1% on a constant currency basis, while principal per transaction declined 3%, or 2% in constant currency terms.","The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue growth in the quarter was approximately 2 percentage points including a negative 3% impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1% in the quarter, while pricing had a positive impact of 2% and we continue to view the current pricing environment as stable.","Turning to the regions, consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movements, as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. North America generated strong growth again in the fourth quarter. Revenue grew 7%, or 8% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound continue to drive the region's growth, led by sends to Mexico and Latin America. Our business in Mexico grew faster than the market again, based on the latest Banco de M\u00e9xico principal and transaction data for the fourth quarter. In the U.S. domestic money transfer business revenue increased 2%, while transactions grew 4%.","In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 1%, or increased 3% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 5%. In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 8%, or 5% constant currency, and transactions were down 9% as low oil prices continue to affect the region.","In the Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 7%, or 5% constant currency, while transactions decreased 9%. India was the main driver of the weaker trends in the region due to the government's currency demonization program, which began in early November and impacted cash availability in the country.","India revenues decreased about 25% in the quarter, although the decline was over 30% following the demonetization. Restrictions appear to be easing in India, and while we have not yet returned to pre-November levels, we are seeing some improvements in the business relative to the end of the year.","Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region grew 11% and increased 16% constant currency, while transactions grew 14%. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strong results from Argentina, as well as inbound business into the region from the U.S. Included in the regional numbers discussed, westernunion.com's C2C revenue continued a strong performance with revenue growth of 27%, or 30% constant currency, and it represented 9% of total C2C revenue in the quarter. Westernunion.com transactions increased 28%, while U.S. originated online transactions grew 33%.","In the Consumer to Business segment, revenue declined 4% or increased 9% on a constant currency basis. Constant currency revenue growth continued to be driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which was partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. The decline in reported revenues was a result of the depreciation of the Argentine peso compared to prior year.","Business Solutions revenues declined 3%. In constant currency terms, revenues increased 1%, led by good growth in Europe. However, the loss of the XE.com business negatively impacted results by approximately two percentage points.","Turning to margins and profitability, the consolidated operating margin in the quarter was negative due to the impact of the $571 million settlement charge with the government agencies. For the full year, the charge was $601 million, as we have previously accrued $30 million for the FTC matter.","The full-year amount consists of $586 million to be paid to federal government, $5 million for the state attorneys general settlements and $10 million for the estimated three-year costs of the independent compliance auditor.","In addition to the settlement charge, we incurred approximately $13 million of costs related to the WU Way business transformation initiative in the fourth quarter, primarily related to consulting expenses.","We have provided adjusted margins and earnings in our financial statements and tables, which exclude both the legal settlement charge and the WU Way-related expenses. For the full year, the WU Way expenses were approximately $20 million and we have adjusted previous quarters to isolate these expenses. The legal settlement charge and the WU Way-related expenses are not included in the operating segment results for 2016.","Excluding the impact of the settlement charge and the cost related to the WU Way, adjusted operating margin was 19.7% in the fourth quarter, which compares to 20.4% in the prior-year period. Compared to prior year, the adjusted margin was negatively impacted by foreign exchange and incremental technology expense.","Foreign exchange hedges in the quarter had a positive impact of $10 million, down from a benefit of $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $28 million in the quarter, compared to the same period in the prior year.","Compliance expense was 3.6% of revenue for both the quarter and the full year. EBITDA margin was negative due to the settlement charge. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.5% compared to 25.4% in the prior-year period, with the decline due to the same factors affecting operating margin.","The effective tax rate was negative in the quarter due to the net loss before taxes resulting from the settlement charge as we did not record any tax benefit associated with the $586 million federal government payments. Excluding the impact of the settlement charge and the WU Way-related expenses, the effective tax rate was 6.5%, which compares to 10.4% in the prior year period. The decline in the adjusted tax rate was driven by various discrete items.","The GAAP loss per share of $0.73 in the quarter included a negative $1.18 impact from the settlement charge and a negative $0.02 impact from the WU Way-related expenses. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.47 increased from $0.42 in the fourth quarter of last year. The C2C margin was 22.8% which compares to 24% in the prior year period, with negative impacts from foreign exchange and higher technology expense.","The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 5.7% in the quarter compared to 11.9% in the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to customer and funding mix in the U.S. electronic business. The mix impacts continue to relate to the addition of a large new biller at low margins, and general increases in credit card usage as a funding option by consumers.","Business Solutions operating profit was $10 million, or a 9.7% margin, compared to operating profit of $4 million, or 3.7% margin in the prior-year period. The improvement was driven primarily by lower compensation related costs.","Depreciation and amortization of Business Solutions was approximately $12 million in the quarter, compared to $13 million in the prior-year period. The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 21.8%, which compares to 16.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $1 billion for the full year. In the fourth quarter, capital expenditures were $53 million. At year-end, we had $2.8 billion of debt and cash of $878 million, with approximately 20% of the cash held by United States entities. In October, we retired $1 billion of maturing notes. These were partially replaced by a $575 million term loan. So, our debt balance at year-end was lower than previous quarters.","During the fourth quarter, we paid $77 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $79 million. At year end, we had $231 million remaining under our previous authorization which is in addition to the $1.2 billion new authorization just announced. The outstanding share count at year-end was 482 million shares.","Turning to 2017, as Hikmet mentioned, our outlook assumes a similar macro environment to what we saw last year. As a result, we expect GAAP revenue to be flat-to-down low-single digits, with constant currency revenue increasing in the low-single digits.","We anticipate foreign exchange rate changes and reduced hedge benefits will negatively impact revenues by approximately $140 million and operating profit by approximately $50 million, compared to 2016 rates. Included in these numbers, there's an expected benefit of approximately $25 million from foreign currency hedges in 2017, which is down from $48 million of benefit in 2016.","We will report both GAAP and adjusted margins and earnings in 2017. As we'll separate out the approximately $1 million of the anticipated spending on WU Way during the year, these costs will occur throughout the year and we will note them each quarter.","The costs related primarily to implementation, consulting and severance costs for the WU Way transformation program. We expect to generate savings of approximately $20 million in 2017 and an additional approximately $25 million in 2018 from efficiency actions included in the initiatives.","From a GAAP perspective, we expect the operating margins of approximately 18% in 2017, but we expect adjusted operating margins, excluding the WU Way-related expenses of approximately 20%. This is slightly below the 20.4% adjusted margin in 2016.","The 2017 margin outlook reflects a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points from foreign exchange, and increased compliance spending, partially offset by cost savings and tight management of operating expenses.","Compliance spending is expected to be in the higher end of the 3.5% to 4% of revenues range, compared to 3.6% in 2016. Our EPS outlook also includes the interest expense impact of issuing additional debt early in the year, which will help us fund the settlement payments.","The U.S. government settlements required us to pay approximately $150 million within five days of the agreement last month and the remainder with a 90 business days. Due to the planned debt issuance, we don't anticipate any limitations to our normal capital allocation programs for share repurchases and dividends in 2017.","The GAAP effective tax rate this year is projected to be approximately 11%, while the adjusted rate is expected to be approximately 13%, up from an adjusted rate of 10.5% in 2016. The GAAP rate is slightly lower than the adjusted rate as the majority of the WU Way-related expenses are expected to be incurred in higher tax countries.","The full-year tax rates are expected to benefit from some discrete items at the end of the year and the adjusted tax rates in the first three quarters are expected to be in the mid-teens. We expect full-year GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.48 to $1.60 and adjusted earnings per share, excluding the approximately $100 million of WU Way-related expenses in a range of a $1.63 to $1.75, both earnings per share ranges reflect an approximately $0.09 negative impact from foreign exchange.","GAAP cash flows from operating activities is expected to be approximately $200 million in 2017, due to the impact of the $591 million payments related to the settlement agreement with the U.S. and State government announced in January, and approximately $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to the previously announced IRS agreement in December, 2011, and the WU Way-related expenses, excluding these items, we would expect operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion.","So, to summarize, we are pleased to deliver solid performance in the fourth quarter of 2016 and meet our full-year business outlook in a challenging environment. We anticipate results in 2017 will again demonstrate a resilient business model and we expect to continue delivering strong shareholder focused capital allocation.","We are also continuing to execute against our long-term strategies, including implementation of the WU Way program to transform our operating model to drive efficiencies and future growth. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question is from Darrin Peller at Barclays.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. The trend seems fairly stable in the quarter. I just want to ask you a little more about the investments you're making in the business, what's actually included in your margins now? I know you mentioned, obviously, WU Way costs are backed out. If you can give us a little more color on what do you anticipate the effect of the WU Way investment to be on the business model's margins in the years after? In other words, not just the costs you're spending on that itself, but what that could do to the business model going forward?","And then, think about in terms of guidance, what's being impacted \u2013 what's impacting the margin that's going to repeat in the next two years versus potentially lighten up.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, Darrin, this is Raj, let me just start. The WU Way costs are, obviously, being excluded and we expect the margin of around 20% this year and that's down a little bit from last year, just due to the higher impact of FX, as well as the spending on some of the activities \u2013 so, on the compliance activity. So, I think for this year the margins are 20%. As you look forward in future years, I don't want to give you a margin projection, but if you look at the last few years, we've been in around 20% operating margins, right, and there has been some variability related to it, just due to foreign exchange.","As we look forward, we are going to get some benefits from the WU Way efficiencies, $20 million this year and then an incremental $25 million next year, and so putting everything else aside, we should get that benefit, but then to remember of other factors that were impact margins, like foreign exchange rates, like revenue growth, ultimately it's the key \u2013 number one driver for us, and then the various other cost items. So, there are number of other factors that again determine where margins end up being, but certainly from this activity just on its own, we should get some additional benefits.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then just lastly, on the competitive dynamics, I mean, obviously we had hoped that a lot of these investments we try to sort of push out and act as a barrier to entry for the competitor \u2013 competitive landscape. Can you just comment on that in terms of your expectations in the next one year to two years, once again, I mean, are these areas that you're investing something that, your competitors are at \u2013 had a disadvantage now at? And maybe talk about pricing in that dynamic or are we seeing more stable pricing, partly as a result of this? Thanks guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Darrin. That's a \u2013 let me start with the pricing. I think the pricing environment has been very stable in the few quarters and has not changed actually. We have been able to really adjust our pricing corridor-by-corridor and in some corridors even increased our FX rates, and in some \u2013 but the pricing has been very stable. We don't see big competitive changes here and I feel comfortable with our pricing strategy as it is today and I feel comfortable and it hasn't changed the environment. And we do still going to go do pricing quarter-by-quarter as we're operating 16,000 corridors and we will adjust our pricing to the environment, but I see in general very stable.","In general, I would say, this investment is really being more digital, faster, closer to the customer as you know the business evolvement has been, the business evolved over the years. We have been very successful with our digital expansion. Last quarter, we had a 30% constant currency revenue occurred from the mobile. Actually on the mobile \u2013 not on the mobile, westernunion.com it was 30%.","On the mobile side, the growth is coming from the mobile, 65% of the transaction generated in U.S. with westernunion.com are coming from the mobile. It's extremely strong growth. We are with our mobile apps already on 17 countries, with westernunion.com in 37 countries.","So the expansion is very fast here and that's going to continue to be here and we are going to invest also in the technology especially in the compliance environment, but also in the technology. The competitive advantage to be more \u2013 having the 200 regulator license worldwide, we would like to be a more technology-focused company that's all the investments really preparing also for not stable growth, stabilization of the business and being more efficient.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. It's good to hear. Thanks guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Darrin.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang at JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions on the WU Way program just to clarify, how much of that $100 million is one-time versus recurring? It sounds like some of it is consulting and severance, is there a better way to unpack that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. All right, Tien-Tsin, this is Raj. We \u2013 just reiterating, we spent about $20 million on the WU Way program last year and we're spending about $20 million of it this year. The entire \u2013 we're spending about a $100 million this year, all of that is related to the WU Way program. It includes costs that are consulting, severance and other program implementation costs. So we may have incurred costs like that in the pasts, but these are specific to this program and that's why we're breaking it out and have added that back to the non-GAAP measure.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I see. So I guess some of the benefits could drive some growth on the digital side, I think it's 9% of revenue now. Do you have a view on your digital revenue growth outlook for fiscal 2017? Can it be stable or could accelerate just...","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","While we do \u2013 we want to grow digitally even strong obviously, we want to expand globally. We are in 37 countries and we would like to expand that to more countries and we are on the way actually, one of our focus areas is the Asia environment, where we are pretty well in North America and in Europe.","In North America, we have customer they are coming back, they are using us really more often and Europe is still in a growth areas, still new customer, getting new customers, and in Asia-Pacific, it's untapped opportunity for us, that's going to happen, the digital expansion.","The other thing is also with that, combining the digital send with account payout. We have now about 2.5 billion accounts worldwide, we have over more than 100 banks, who are linked to the account payout in more than 50 countries, so sending money from your mobile device in minutes to worldwide to an account, it's one of our new strengths. And, we see a very good potential. It's definitely a focus area for us.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thanks. I'll let other ask, I appreciate it.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Operator","The next question is from Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just on the pricing on the quarter and C2C was up 2%. Was there anything in particular that drove stronger pricing?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","It's a mix, and it's the \u2013 in some quarters, we adjust the pricing. But there was nothing that particular. It's really the adjustment of the pricing. And...","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","...yeah","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","and the price over this mix. And FX increases has been driving that one.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. We changed FX spreads a little bit in some parts of our business. Nothing \u2013 no single action there. But, if you look at our overall price investment for the year, it's flat, and it was also flat last year. So, again we've always moved prices either up or down depending on specific markets. But overall, it's still relatively stable.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, just on the WU Way expenses. What makes those expenses one-time in nature and you adjust the amount of earnings? It sounds like a lot of those are just investments in the platform and the business that usually would be expense. So, what \u2013 how did you guys decide to exclude those costs rather than expense them in adjusted earnings?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. These are costs as we said, Bryan. These are costs similar to what we may have incurred in the past or may have in the future. But, we've broken them out because they are very specific to the WU Way program. And, it's a broad, large transformational activity within the company. So, we've broken them out just to give visibility to investors, and these are not necessarily costs that we would need to run the business on an ongoing basis. So, that's why we've really broken them out.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","It's like transforming our operating model really focusing on technology transformation like the network productivity and these are really very related to WU Way, that's a huge program. It's a lean management methodology we use here, given Bryan, you know me, even my background also with six sigma, it's a very \u2013 I'm a big fan of that. I think that's really a \u2013 really I think that we really much focused on the WU Way, it's a lean management here.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And $30 million of the WU Way expenses were excluded out of the fourth quarter in the adjusted earnings. I think there was a total of $20 million, so I guess that the $7 other million were those also excluded in previous quarters, or are those now going to be excluded going back to restate those quarters?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. We've restated, we've adjusted metrics for those quarters as well to break those out in the financial table. So, you'll see there were some costs in the second quarter and third quarter that add to $7 million for the WU Way.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But originally they were in the adjusted earnings?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Originally, they were in the earnings that we had presented.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's all I had. Last question just on stock buyback, it looks like you guys going to continue with that. Is that the cash flow from the core business providing the funding for the buyback, or is there anything specific there to think about how you'll fund the buyback? Thanks so much.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure. Bryan, no, it's just a regular ongoing cash flow. We are utilizing our intercompany working capital programs to enhance our U.S. cash flows, but it is ongoing cash flow, nothing specific there. Obviously we have to make some payments this year for the legal settlements and so we will be issuing incremental debt related to those, but otherwise it's normal cash flow.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks so much.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks. Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Schneider at Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, if you can maybe comment on the, the overall competitive landscape and how that might change with Ant Financial's announced acquisition of MoneyGram? Can you give us any sense about what do you think how that might play out over longer term and whether you think that might result in pricing pressure, either in the online or conventional venues?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Well, I think from the competitive environment, I feel quite comfortable that we can compete because the same questions I got was the \u2013 as the pay \u2013 Xoom was acquired by PayPal, are we going to compete there. I believe that also our digital growth has been impressive, and that we execute pretty well in the market. It's too early to talk about MGI and Alibaba acquisition probably, or Ant acquisition. But I think that we are looking at the environment and it's \u2013 let's see if that \u2013 how that acquisition goes through, M&A goes through or not. And we will see how that will affect our business. But I will say that we see it as very \u2013 I see comfortable on the market how \u2013 where we operate.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And then, maybe as a follow-up. Could you maybe comment broadly on the Trump Administration's kind of policy objectives and specifically related to potential corporate tax reform and, given your low tax rate, whether you would benefit or not at all in terms of lowering of corporate tax rate to 25% or something lower? Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Jim, this is Raj. Yeah. There are a number of different proposals that have been put out and it's actually hard to understand exactly how it would impact us. There are proposals that would potentially increase our tax rate, there are also proposals that would not necessarily impact us as much. So, we'll have to see whether that ultimately comes out. One benefit that's likely based on what we know is that if there is comprehensive tax reform, it should alleviate the ability to, or any issues with repatriating foreign cash, which would be very good for us in the long-term. So, we are standing by to see how things actually play out on the tax reform side.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","The next question is from Danyal Hussain at Morgan Stanley.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. With WU Way, are any of these costs, let's say the elevated technologies spend that you called out before. And then as a follow-up, just the $100 million, is it possible to quantify how much you expect would fall off in 2018?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure. Danyal, this is Raj. With respect to technology portion of this transformation, they are different from the costs that we've called out before. The costs that we've been talking about on the technology side have been \u2013 in the last couple of years have been for upgrading of our core legacy platforms.","We've consolidated our data centers, we are upgrading our settlement system and other things. The transformational costs for technology here are related more to consolidation of our footprint on the technology side and really finding more optimal ways of working with our third parties on the technology side.","So that \u2013 it's different, it's more organizational-related than platform related. And then the $100 million that we're planning on spending on WU Way this year, we don't currently anticipate expenses related to this next year. Obviously, there could be some timing shift with the $100 million, but that's our current plan to spend the majority of that this year.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then just on the settlement, it sounded like one of the conclusions from the FTC was that some of the agent locations warranting, they're properly vetted or should have been shut down. And then like that terminated, it seems like through the end of August 2015, at least that's when their study seemed to conclude.","So was there any impact on your agent location base following this settlement? Are you going to have to close down some locations, just any color there would be helpful? Thanks.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, let me start, it's Raj, if you want something. Well, as I mentioned earlier, the main issues were occurred \u2013 mainly it was 2004 to 2012. And the oversight investigation was till 2015, there were some cases also in 2015 obviously. But it was, we're in a much better position since we did the investments since 2012. As you know we do spend about $200 million every year.","And we have about 2,000 employees focus on the compliance environment. We are really focused on the compliance, we have a great team here, and we try to protect our customers. In some cases, we have to close some agents if that doesn't require, it doesn't fulfill our compliance programs and the regulatory environment. And that's what we do, we're very focused and we continue to advance based on our agreement, we're going to continue to advance our compliance programs. And in some location \u2013 we have to close some locations, if they don't comply with our regulations.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Kupferberg at Jefferies.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks, guys. I just had a follow-up question on WU Way. So I guess, by the time we're through 2017, you will spend about a $120 million in aggregate on the program, but it's sounds like you're only expecting cumulative savings of about $45 million through 2018. So just curious, if there is going to be another gap up in additional savings beyond 2018?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","That's all we're calling out at this stage Jason. It is definitely $45 million of run rate as we exit next year, that's definitely the opportunity. Obviously, we're going to look for more if we can as a result of these initiatives, and I would say it's also benefiting us beyond just the cost savings, we really are optimizing and making our organization more lean and streamlining operational activity within the company. And for example \u2013 how we handle customers within our business and how we handle agents within our business, and really allowing us to streamline how we go to market faster when...","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","So like in digital expansion, how we launch mobile apps, can we be faster?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yes.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Can we be getting more market opportunities? All these are based on this WU Way initiatives.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","But our minimum goal is to try to get to the $45 million and we're obviously, going to shoot for more if we can, but that certainly the goal.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","So you're going to be kind of beefing up your \u2013 I know you've got the center in the Bay area, where you're doing a lot of your digital work, you're going to be beefing that up, I mean, it sounds like kind of net basis head count will come down as a result of this, you talked about some severance, but are there going to be certain areas that you'll be beefing up?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Well, we have operations all over the world. So it really is looking at our global footprint and how we might optimize that, obviously, we want to focus our resources in the faster growing areas of our business and so digital is certainly an area of focus for us.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And just last question. I know you mentioned as part of the government settlement, you've got the independent compliance auditor, I think for the next three years. What exactly \u2013 what kind of powers does that individual have, who do they kind of report into, if you will, within the Western Union organization. I just wanted to get a sense of what sort of influence they may or may not have over the next few years?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. Obviously, we are still in the process. We just announced the agreement, we just signed the agreement, obviously, it's still in the process appointing an auditor together with the regulator \u2013 together with the agencies. Obviously, we have a Chief Compliance Officer, Compliance Department, it's quite independent and they have to report \u2013 the Chief Compliance Officer reports to the compliance committee of the board.","So, that's going to continue to happen. The agreement we signed, how we progress against the agreement, the programs we put in place and the programs already exists, how we can protect the customers and the programs, the items we agreed on that that will be audited and looking over that we really execute against that.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very good. Thank you for the comments.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi. And I'm sorry if I said that wrong.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","No, close enough. Hi, Hikmet. Hi, Raj.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Ashwin. How are you?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Ashwin, hi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. I don't care what you call me as long as you call me, right.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","I have to say miss you, I have to say most of the time to say miss you, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. So, a lot of questions have been asked on WU Way here. It would help if you gave sort of a better accounting of the breakout, because it's a large sum of money. The normal restructuring types stuff versus the consulting type thing, so we can determine for ourselves. What belongs in normal business course investments versus not?","Is there a possibility you guys could provide that, also any cash versus non-cash split for this? And if I didn't want to exclude these expenses, I want to treat them like normal business course investments, what is your effective tax rate today, so I could get a full normal P&L? Any help you can provide on those sorts of things?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. Ashwin, we wouldn't have broken out all of these costs unless we felt that it was different from our normal ongoing costs of the business. And we don't expect these costs at this stage to repeat for next year. That's why we broken that into a non-GAAP measure. So, that's really the way we look at it internally as I described the technology cost as an example, these are different from the other normal technology expenses that we've had in the business.","And with respect to consulting costs, the consulting costs are directly related to the WU Way program, right. The spending that we did last year related to this program as well as the spending we're doing this year, this is really to help put the programs in place and the lean processes in place as Hikmet spoke about.","With respect to cash component of this, we currently expect that most of this will be cash but it may \u2013 depending on the timing of the certain activities, the cash portion \u2013 some portion of this might pay out in terms of cash next year, although, we expect that the expense will really be this year. Now, as that changes throughout the course of the year and if it changes, we'll certainly update you on that.","And then the last question you had was around the tax rate. I mentioned in my comments that the adjusted tax rate is 13%, excluding these expenses. If you were to include these expenses, the adjusted tax rate or the actual tax rate would be 11%, because we expect that a lot of these costs will be incurred in higher tax jurisdiction. So hopefully that answers your question.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, it does. Just want to go back to the pricing comment because I wanted to understand, you guys have said stable pricing now for some time a couple of \u2013 more than a couple of quarters. But yet, your C2C principal per transaction is consistently negative, your transaction fees per transaction continues to turn negative.","The only offset seems to be the higher FX per transaction. And so, I mean, what I want to understand is, as the difference between what the user sees on the agent's store and the actually total fee that they end up paying when they come in, that keeps increasing. Is there any comment you can give me on market impact from either agents or users?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well. From a market impact, pricing I would say generally is stable throughout the business and we had some spread increases in the fourth quarter, but on a full-year basis when you look at our business on a global macro basis, it's relatively flat. The market dynamics, North America and Latin America, they continue to have very strong growth and the softness that we see in Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific are not really pricing-related.","We see transaction softness there because of the oil price situation and India, for example, in the fourth quarter, that also had a negative impact, and then just remittances to the APAC region from the Middle East. Those are all being impacted. And so from a pricing standpoint, yes, we took some opportunity in the fourth quarter and we changed some spreads. But, that's not necessarily a sustainable level that we would have and we really see the pricing environment are being relatively stable in our business.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Oscar Turner at SunTrust.","Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Good afternoon.","Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, I was just wondering if you could provide any color on which geographies are driving the sustained weak macro outlook? We're hearing from some other companies that the global macro is improving. So, just wondering what's driving the difference in outlooks?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I mean I can't see for other companies, but our global macro outlook is similar to what it was last year. You've seen it in our trends over the last 12 months, North America has been quite strong, particularly the Mexico and Latin America. Mexico, as we mentioned, has been growing faster than the rest of the market and we've done a lot of good things in the Mexico market to drive that.","Latin America has been quite strong. Europe has been relatively stable, some pluses and minuses within Europe. But that the softness really continues to be in the Middle East and Africa region as well as in the APAC. And the lower oil prices continue to impact that market.","We saw the OPEC related markets continue to decline in the fourth quarter. They were slightly better than they were in the third quarter, but they still declined quite a bit. And that impacts directly the APAC regions, all right, because remittances are going to the APAC region from the Middle East and Africa. And then, you have things like the India demonetization impact, which is something that none of us are coming, obviously, in the fourth quarter, but so it's things like that that have really driven our outlook for this year.","Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And do you think that the sustain rebound in oil prices could, I suppose, boost, I guess, spin trends in EMEA and APAC and other oil linked markets?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, sure that will help us. Of course, and the price goes up to $75, $80 or even $100 it was there, it will help, it's still at $50, $53 and it has to \u2013 it has to go up and it doesn't have any immediate effect. I mean, the job starts to create it again and that investments as we done in Middle East in Saudi Arabia, in UAE that all the infrastructure investment which create jobs, so the people have send money back home. And so that will take some time, but definitely oil price increase will help to drive the transactions again.","Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that color.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from David Ridley-Lane at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. When you say that the settlement in IRS payments will not impact your cash return policy, is that mean we should expect cash return in forms of dividends and buybacks to approximate the pace for the last three years?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, the dividend, as you know, we raise the dividend level today, so that's \u2013 you can \u2013 we've been paying a little bit more than $300 million a year on dividends and we're pleased to be able to raise that today. On stock buyback, the new program that was announced is good for three years, that's good through 2019, and as we have always done, we obviously, we plan to buy back stock, but it's going to be dependent on market conditions, it's going to be depended on the other cash priorities that we have within the business.","But the \u2013 our point in saying what we said was that the settlements themselves were not necessarily have a specific impact to our capital return, because we did have some debt capacity at the end of last year, as we paid down some debt. We ended at $2.8 billion and so we will be able to make the payments within our current debt capacity and then it continues to leave us flexibility to do other things that we've been doing.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And within the framework of your 2017 guidance, where would you expect to end the year at in terms of gross debt-to-EBITDA? And are you comfortable operating with that higher financial leverage on a go-forward basis?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I don't have a projection to give you on the exact debt level. But we've been \u2013 if you just go back to the last couple of years, we've been on a trend of paying down a little bit of our debt. So we're just getting back to where we were, now before in terms of debt levels. So we're not going outside of the balance of what \u2013 where we've operating anyway. And what you've seen is the some of the cash efficiencies that we've gained throughout the last couple of years, we've been able pay down some debt or we just taking the debt level back up to where it was. If you go back far enough, when we spun-off as a company, we had about $3.5 million of debt. So it's not too far outside where we've been in the past.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. And then, within your revenue guidance for the year, are you anticipating pricing being flat-to-positive?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","I think the pricing is going to be payable, right. And so, historically we've been reducing prices in low-single-digits, but it just depends on what the market calls for, what the competitor environment is like.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think from today's point of view, it looks stable.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you very much.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Rayna Kumar at Evercore ISI.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Good evening.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Are you seeing any pricing pressure specifically in U.S. domestic and U.S. to Mexico resulting from the new Walmart contracts with MoneyGram in Euronet last quarter? And then secondly, can you comment in which region you were able to increase prices in the quarter and if there was cash to cash and\/or online?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. First of all, we are very pleased with our Mexico business \u2013 Banco de M\u00e9xico had released again and you could see that quarter-over-quarter, we are really gaining market share and beating the market. So we are pleased with our Mexico business, especially from U.S. to Mexico. Generally, I would say that our business has been quite stable and on the 16,000 corridors, we do pricing, in some corridors we increase, some corridors decrease, it's really a portfolio management, where we see the needs of the customer, the used cases we adopt, sometimes we adopt the fees, sometimes the FX rates, and also we do have different prices depending on the customer needs on the digital, on the mobile apps and on the retail.","We do see sometimes even have street corner prices depending on the customer needs. So it's really \u2013 we are reacting to the market needs. So overall I would say though, we are stable with our prices, we are still 15% to 20% higher than the competition. The people are really \u2013 the consumers who use us paying for the convenience, for global reach, for the security, and for sending the money, so people comfortable with pricing environment.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","What are the next steps do you think you have to make with investments to your online business? And now are you able to do instant ACH in most corridors?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","So instant ACH as you know it's a U.S. thing. But generally, I would say that next investments are definitely mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile and being in \u2013 we are \u2013 as we started two years ago, we were in few countries, now we are in 38 countries, is it 37?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","37.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","37 countries on dotcom and we are going to expand our presence in more countries, sending money and receiving money with mobile and with digital expansion. The trick is that, what we have is fantastic actually. We are combining mobile with retail, retail with mobile, mobile to mobile, mobile to mobile wallet, mobile to bank account. So this kind of reach allows us and this kind of fundamental allows us to expand our digital growth.","On the ACH, as you know, it's a U.S.-specific thing, ACH. Where we need ACH, we have the ACH. But the most of our transactions are coming from credit cards in the U.S. But worldwide, we do also have direct debit from bank accounts to bank account. Debit card through bank account. So we do offer depending on the areas, the possibilities.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","And one final question from me. Do you expect the situation in India, as it improves, for people to play catch up on receiving remittances in India? And do you see that benefit coming in in the first quarter or second quarter?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Well, I mean, business have seen slight improvements already as it gets better. I can't say it's the first quarter or second quarter but the improvements are coming, and the beauty of our Western Union business is that we have almost 100,000 locations in India. As you know, some areas got more affected than the other areas in India. So, given our 100,000 locations, we, compared with the competition, had only 25% decrease on our business last quarter, and I think 30% total in 2017. But it's started to come back. I think people want cash, people want to go to a location, pick up their money and some locations the money has been stored there, they couldn't pick it up, but now they are ready to pick it up, and I think also in the same time our business to Indian corridors will be in a much better position.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Tom McCrohan at CLSA.","Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. On the compliance side, what business practice changes do you think need to be effected to bring your compliance up to FTC standards? For example, do you have to collect any incremental information either from the sender or the recipient going forward?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I think what we are doing is really analyzing our current situation and constantly upgrading our compliance programs. But one thing is also that we did invest since 2012 in our compliance program significantly. I think the base where we are acting now is different than it was earlier days. So it's \u2013 we have the fundamentals, we have a great team. We do implement all the compliance programs. So it's early to say, but there will be some changes. There will be some investments in that program to upgrade our compliance programs to respond to the agreement we signed with the U.S. government, and we will implement this over the coming months and years, about the compliance programs and I'm confident that the team will do a good job.","Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And then a follow-up on WU Way, I guess when you provided guidance for this year, WU Way was not contemplated in that guidance of the EPS range? So what is the right number to use for adjusted EPS? In your disclosure you had $1.75, but that excludes things that probably were not contemplated when you provided guidance, so I'm just trying to get an EPS number on adjusted basis that compares to your previous guidance?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. Let me see if I can address your question. When we gave our last outlook, we had not broken out the FTC costs that we accrued for in the second quarter and third quarter, as well as the WU Way costs that we're now breaking out for the full year. So FTC costs, we have previously accrued were $30 million and then the WU Way costs are $20 million for the full year. So those are two things that we had not anticipated in the last outlook that we gave.","Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And are there any, last question on WU Way, is there any pricing related investments that's incorporated in the $100 million number for WU Way?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Are there any? No.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","No pricing. You mean pricing investments?","Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes. Yes.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","No. No. No. That's separate. No. That's not.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","No.","Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from John Davis at Stifel.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just wanted to touch on the...","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Good afternoon, John.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","...just wanted to touch on the Digital business quickly. Revenue growth accelerated almost 1,000 basis points in the second half of the year from first half. And it looks like it's mostly driven by the gap between transaction and revenue growth closing. Just wondering how, what's driving that and do you expect that to continue in 2017?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","First, we're pleased with that. The customers are coming back, right. Especially the North American customers who been \u2013 we've been longer in the market with our digital or get used to it, and really using more often, which we're very pleased. But at the same time is on the growth side, it's the global expansion, the new countries we entered in Europe, and other parts of the world are showing already some good traction here. So it's really the repeat customer that to close the \u2013 in the beginning \u2013 that closes the gap. In the beginning as we started that initiative we did a lot of promotions and customer \u2013 we win customers now we really \u2013 our customers are using us and I think that closes the gap.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Raj, maybe just quickly on tax repatriation and potential tax reform. If I remember correctly, you guys repatriate currently couple of hundred million a year. Is that number right? I'm just trying to figure out what the potential impact would be if you do get some sort of tax break on repatriation on the tax rate going forward?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Right. Yeah, we do repatriate some cash every year, it's in the...","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","$200 million to $300 million.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","$200 million to $300 million we typically, well, repatriate and then we utilize other intercompany working capital programs just for U.S. cash flows. If there were a force repatriation, we don't have a lot of cash seating abroad, but we do have reinvested profits. So we have retained earnings that we have abroad, and that's over $6 billion. So depending on what is force, we'd have to certainly consider that. I think the positive is on two fronts. One is that even if there were a tax associated with that, it would likely be over a multiyear period that we would pay that. And then it should alleviate any restriction from bringing back future cash, if you will, if there was comprehensive tax reform.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And I assume guidance this year, obviously, implies the tax code and laws as they stand today. So what kind of drove the difference in the tax rate? I think previously with mid-teens was kind of the what you guys have talked about, 11% on a reported basis and 13% \u2013 just what's driving that little bit better tax rate?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. Yeah. We expect that where if there were no other discrete benefits, we would be in the mid-to-high teens tax rate. And this year as Mike \u2013 as we mentioned in our comments, we plan to have a higher tax rate in the first three quarters of the year and then a lower tax rate in the latter part of the year, which is being help us in discrete items. So, we will be at the mid-teens probably in the first two quarters to three quarters of the year, and then drop down from there.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","Okay. Amy, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Next question is from Eric Wasserstrom at Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks for fitting me in. Just one last question on WU Way, was the acceleration of \u2013 from $20 million to $100 million in 2017, what \u2013 was that always contemplated as part of the outlook, or was that part of some recent change in view? And if so what motivated that change to accelerate the investment in that way?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. No, we took \u2013 we've been thinking about that late in the year, last year. And we really brought together this strategy later in the year and even earlier this year, and finalized our outlook this year. And that's really where we come up with $100 million and it really is a lot of activities that we had in the fourth quarter and early this year to come up with a full view on what we were doing until. As you can imagine there is a lot of planning and activities that go into it before we actually get to a full outlook.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And, but just I understand the \u2013 are there specific factors that were motivating that significant acceleration or was that just as, as you did the budgeting, it simply worked out that the majority of that was going to be realized in the course of 2017.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","No, it was really just a planning around these initiatives. So, we were not necessarily trying to see which year we fell into was really about how do we get ourselves to the next level of efficiencies and growth of the company. And we thought it was the right time to actually go ahead and restructure components of the company to get to the right place that we want to.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael A. Salop","Thank you, Valerie, and good morning, everyone. We know many of you on the East Coast are joining us from home today, and we hope everyone is safe. We considered delaying today's release, but given the nature of the information being provided, we felt it was best to move ahead as planned.","On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, EVP, Chief Financial Officer and Global Operations, will discuss 2012 third quarter results. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions.","The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.","Today's call is being recorded and our comments include forward-looking statements.

First, I want to say that our thoughts are with those who have been impacted by Tropical Storm Sandy. As we always do in times of need, we are supporting our customers, colleagues and partners in parts of the Caribbean and the East Coast of the U.S. where the storm has caused damage.","As is our tradition, when disaster strikes, we will be working with our agents and partners to provide support to people and NGOs in the impacted areas.","Turning back to the third quarter results. Our revenues increased 1% in the quarter. Similar to what many other global companies have reported recently, we have felt the effect of softer global economic conditions.","Our retail money transfer business was also impacted by compliance-related changes in a number of markets and competitive pricing pressures in certain corridors.","In constant currency terms, our Western Union branded C2C revenues increased slightly in the quarter, but trends slowed from the first half of the year.","We are implementing a series of action plans to spur long-term growth in the current retail money transfer environment, which I will discuss with you in a few minutes.","Western Union Business Solutions, pro forma revenues were flat in constant currency terms, due primarily to soft global trade conditions and very challenging comparison with the third quarter of last year.","As you may recall, we had an extraordinarily strong third quarter with Business Solutions in 2011. We are continuing to execute our strategies for future growth in business-to-business, adding new customers and expanding to new countries.","Our Business Solutions customers count increased 5% from prior year, and we are expanding our presence to 3 new countries, bringing the total to 29. We are also continuing to make great progress in the fast growing electronic channels portion of consumer money transfer. Our digital business delivered another strong quarter of transaction and revenue growth, while at the same time, adding new talent and developing additional product capabilities.","In total, our electronic channels revenue, which includes digital and account-based money transfer through banks, increased 25% in the quarter. We continue to increase our points of presence as well. One example is in Brazil, where Banco do Brasil customers can now receive Western Union Money Transfers at 44,000 ATM machines across the country.","In stored value, we further expanded our U.S. distribution, and we just announced we are teaming with ICICI Bank and MasterCard to launch a unique prepaid card potentially to serve millions of customers in India.","Turning back to consumer money transfer. As we have progressed through the year, and especially the last few months, the market environment in retail money transfer has become more difficult, and we are facing market share challenges in certain key corridors.","While we believe we have gained or largely maintained market share the last several years, a combination of factors appear to be driving challenges this year, especially in recent months. These factors include the impact of compliance changes, particularly those related to our Southwest Border agreement; the level of our prices related to competitors in certain corridors; and higher market growth in the higher principal electronic segment. Western Union has relatively smaller presence here, although we are growing very fast and have a big opportunity.","We have made and will continue to make compliance-related enhancements and changes around the world to meet new and evolving requirements. These actions have had a negative impact on our revenues in some markets and have added expenses to our cost structure. However, we believe it is our responsibility to maintain our industry leadership by implementing rigorous compliance practices to protect our customers and agents around the world.","The biggest impact from compliance-related changes has been in Mexico and Latin America. In Mexico, our Western Union brand is performing largely in line with the market. However, our overall revenue decreased over 20% in the quarter, due to declines in our Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands.","We ended relationships with over 7,000 Vigo agent locations that could not meet our new compliance requirements. We also experienced operational challenges from related system implementations for our Vigo brand in Latin America, as we move this onto our Western Union platform.","We are executing action plans to address our challenges in this region. We are actively signing new agents for Mexico, including most recently, Banco Ahorro Famsa and implementing consumer and agent marketing initiatives to recapture customers.","We are likely to see similar revenue trends for Mexico over the next few quarters, but we believe we will emerge in back half of 2013 with a stronger network and better consumer proposition, allowing us to drive growth again in this important market.","Aside from compliance-related issues, we are also seeing market share challenges this year from competitive pressures in other parts of the world. We are implementing a series of strategic actions to quickly adjust to this environment and regain market share momentum. These plans are focused on: First, enhancing our value proposition in key corridors; second, accelerating investment in the fast-growing digital channel business; and third, taking steps to further optimize our cost structure.","Enhancing our value proposition will include steps to improve the consumer experience, as well accelerating pricing investment in key corridors. Our pricing investments have been relatively small the last few years, and we are now seeing some impact from differentials in certain large corridors, especially in this economic environment.","While our brand remains strong and stands for trust, reliability, speed and convenience, we need to enhance overall consumer value proposition in certain corridors. For competitive reasons, we will not disclose specific plans. But beginning in the fourth quarter, we will accelerate our pricing actions in key corridors.","In 2013, we will also address other areas of the consumer value proposition as needed. While not finalized at this point, we expect our 2013 pricing investment may be in the mid-single-digit range as a percentage of revenues, compared to 1% in both 2011 and 2012.","By implementing these immediate actions, our goal is to drive market share growth, gain customers and optimize long-term revenue and profitability. Pricing investments typically result in immediate transaction growth and a decline in revenues in the first 12 months, but this is offset by increased customers and usage, typically leading to revenue growth after the first year.","We know from experience that these actions have worked in similar situations, such as with our very successful U.S. domestic money transfer repositioning in late 2009. We have the results from over 100 other corridor pricing actions over the last 5 years to guide our expectations.","Additionally, we will also be improving our consumer value proposition. This will include a more attractive and easier to use point-of-sale process in key send locations, more tailored communication with each consumer and better overall customer service and support.","To remain a leader in global consumer money transfer, we must adapt quickly to the evolving environment. We have seen a significant decline in our cross-border principal movement in just the past few months. That is why we are implementing these actions for our business immediately.","In addition, there is opportunity for us to expand our presence in the digital and electronic channels. While the retail or cash-to-cash remittance market is growing, the digital and account-based segments are growing faster, and we are committed to increase our participation in these areas.","We are obviously very well-positioned and have been investing for the future with westernunion.com online money transfer. Even in difficult market conditions, this digital channel is executing against the plans implemented last year and remains on target to become a $500 million channel by 2015.","One of the key capabilities in the higher growth segment of the market is to be able to send online or deliver it into a bank account, and we are making progress in establishing these connections. We also continue to expand the world's largest financial service distribution network by integrating banks' online banking platforms for account-based money transfer.","We have now signed nearly 110 banks for online banking to connect to the Western Union network, including recently one of the worlds largest, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.","But having the largest network and expanding, it is not enough. It is our goal to build the best network with the best agents, the best products and the best consumer experience in the industry. Our strategy going forward continues to be to execute on our vision to be the premier financial service provider for underserved consumers and businesses globally.","Our plans for the remainder of the year and 2013 are intended to drive us closer to this vision in an increasingly competitive market. To help -- to fund the investment required for the strategic growth actions and to maintain future profitability, we will implement the first phase of new productivity and cost savings initiatives, which have been a focus area under my leadership. We will also implement changes to our management structure to better support our multi-product, multi-channel focus and improve customer focused decisions.","To better coordinate and manage all of our businesses as an integrated whole, I will be more directly involved in driving performance from our business units. To this end, we will no longer have a President of Global Consumer Financial Services, and Stewart Stockdale has left the company. We thank Stewart for his contribution over the past 4.5 years and wish him well in his future endeavors.","All global business leaders will now report directly to me. Change is always challenging, but I have a long history being in the market, and I believe it is time to adjust our structure to tie all of our channels and products in a seamless fashion moving forward.","Turning back to 2012 results, we have had to adjust our full year outlook to reflect softer revenue trends in the second half of the year, as well as anticipated fourth quarter expenses for the cost savings initiatives.","Our focus in 2013 will be on increasing customers and market share in consumer money transfer and continuing to execute our strategies in business-to-business, digital and stored value, while taking the steps to improve productivity and optimize operating expenses.","We remain very confident in the long-term opportunities for the business. We are a leader in a growing market. We have a strong global brand, a large and growing agent network, and a global organization with best payment capabilities and a local market expertise.","Our cash flows generation remains strong, and we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in our dividend and $0.50 per share annually, and a new $550 million share repurchase authorization, which gives us the opportunity to repurchase up to approximately $750 million of our shares through the end of 2013.","Although the strategic actions we are implementing now will likely negatively affect short-term results in 2013, we believe they are the right steps to position us for long-term revenue and profitability growth in the current environment, and we are managing this business for the long term. We believe our strategic actions will result in a return to revenue and profit growth beginning in 2014.","In summary, in this challenging economic environment over the past few months, we have seen a mix of positive and negative trends in our business. On the positive side, we have been successful in executing our strategy for providing our customers multiple products in the retail, online and mobile channels. However, we have also recently seen challenges in our core retail money transfer business in certain key markets.","We have recognized these issues and are in the process of taking immediate actions to address them. Our vision to be the premier financial service provider for underserved consumers and businesses is correct. Our strategy to diversify from a single product, single channel business is correct. We remain optimistic about the future opportunities in our core retail money transfer business, and we believe that our current plans are the right measures to keep Western Union as the industry leader for the long term.","Now to give you a more detailed review of the quarter and our updated outlook, I would like to turn the call over to Scott.","Scott T. Scheirman","Thank you, Hikmet. Overall, for the quarter, we reported consolidated revenue growth of 1% on a reported basis and 3% in constant currency. Consolidated pro forma revenue decreased 1% constant currency, including Travelex Global Business Payments in the prior year period.","Constant currency revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 2 percentage points due to declines in the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, which resulted from Southwest Border compliance-related changes.","In the consumer-to-consumer segment, reported revenue decreased 4% or 1% constant currency, while transactions were flat compared with the prior year period. Excluding the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, Western Union branded consumer-to-consumer constant currency revenue grew 1% on transaction growth of 3%. We are generally seeing softer economic conditions in much of the world, including continued weakness in Southern Europe and some slowing in the U.S.","C2C cross-border principal declined 7% in the quarter or 4% on a constant currency basis. C2C principal per transaction declined 6% year-over-year and 3% on a constant currency basis.","Turning to the regions. C2C revenue in the Europe and CIS region, which represented 22% of consolidated revenues, decreased 9% year-over-year. This decline included a negative 5% impact from currency translation. Transactions in the region declined 3%.","Germany continued to hold up well with strong growth in the quarter. And many other parts of Europe have slowed and Southern Europe remained soft. Russia is down, but tracking to our outlook, as we implement our turnaround strategies and build our retail network in that market.","Turning to North America. Revenue declined 8% from the prior year, while transactions were down 5%. The region represented 20% of total company revenue.","U.S. outbound revenue declined, while domestic money transfer revenue remained flat on transaction growth of 7% in the quarter. Domestic $5 for $50 program continue to have strong growth. However, there were slowing in the higher principal bands in the U.S. Mexico revenue declined 22% and transactions decreased 18% in the quarter. As we told you in February, we anticipated losing revenue and market share in Mexico due to compliance-related changes throughout the year.","In the third quarter, we implemented a series of new system requirements that impacted our Vigo and Orlandi Valuta agent networks. As many of our agents could not meet the new requirements to increase our real time transaction visibility, we had to end those relationships, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 7,000 locations or 40% of our network in Mexico.","New requirements and system conversions for Vigo also caused disruption to our business in several Latin American countries. We expect the Mexico trends to be challenging over the next 3 to 4 quarters, while we work to increase our agent base and implement other consumer and agent-focused actions.","Turning to the Middle East and Africa region. Revenue in the quarter was flat on a reported basis, including a negative 3% impact from currency, while transactions grew 4%. The Asia Pacific region grew 1%, including a negative 1% impact from currency translation, with transaction growth of 2%. China revenue increased slightly, excluding the impact of currency, following declines in the first half of the year. The Latin America and Caribbean region delivered revenue trends similar to the second quarter, with revenue growth of 4%, including a negative 3% impact from currency. Transactions declined 2% in the quarter and were negatively impacted by the compliance-related changes we made to our Vigo business, while revenue benefited from geographic and product mix.","Westernunion.com C2C revenue increased 22%, including a 4% negative impact from currency translation and remains on track to our targets. Westernunion.com transactions grew a very strong 40%, aided by some of our promotional activity to acquire new customers. As a reminder, westernunion.com results are not included in the growth rates of the other 5 regions, although they are included when we discuss specific country trends.","Total electronic channel revenue, which includes westernunion.com, as well as account-based money transfer in mobile increased 25% in the quarter. Electronic channels now represent 4% of total company revenue, up from 3% of revenue in the year ago quarter.","In addition to the westernunion.com growth, revenue from account-based money transfer through banks increased 32%. We now have nearly 110 banks signed for account-based money transfer, with about 1\/2 of the banks already launched. We also have 37 mobile network contracts, with 15 actively operating.","Prepaid revenue increased 9% in the quarter. In total, prepaid, including third-party top-up, represented approximately 1% of company revenue. Our prepaid cards were available at approximately 31,000 retail locations globally at the end of the quarter, including approximately 1,000 locations outside of the U.S.","Turning back to the total C2C business. The spread between transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 1 percentage point, excluding the impact of currency, which negatively impacted the spread by 3 points. In C2C, the impact of net price decreases was approximately 2% in the third quarter, while mix was favorable by 1%.","On a year-to-date basis, the pricing impact remains at approximately 1% of company revenue. Moving to the consumer-to-business segment. Revenue decreased 5% in the quarter, including a negative 3% from currency translation. The U.S. walk-in business declined, and the electronic business continues to be affected by the pass-through of some of the debit fee savings related to Durbin. The South American business continues to have steady growth.","Business Solutions reported revenue of $95 million in the quarter, which compared to $34 million a year ago. On a pro forma basis, including Travelex results in the prior year, Business Solutions' constant currency revenue was flat, although it did increase from the second quarter. The business was impacted by slowing global trade and high growth comparisons with the third quarter of last year, when Western Union Business Solutions revenue increased 31% or 22% in constant currency terms.","Our customer count is increasing nicely, up 5% from a year ago, and we continue to expand geographically. Transactions are growing in low double-digits, but principal per transaction is down in part due to de-accelerating trade growth.","We have updated our full year revenue outlook to low to mid-single digit growth for this business, which reflects the economic slowdown in key markets. The Travelex integration is on track and remains planned for completion in 2013.","Turning to consolidated margins. The third quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 25.7% in the current and prior year period. Consolidated operating margin was 26.4%, excluding $10 million of Travelex integration expenses, compared to 26.7%, excluding $14 million of restructuring expenses in the prior year period. EBITDA margin, excluding integration expense, was 30.7%, which increased from 30.0% in the third quarter of last year, excluding restructuring expenses.","Compared to prior year, the consolidated margin benefited from currency, lower compensation costs and Durbin, but these benefits were offset by Business Solutions amortization, incremental compliance cost related to Southwest Border and Dodd-Frank, and investments in IT and westernunion.com.","The tax rate in the quarter was 16.8%, which compares to 23.6% in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, the decrease in our tax rate is primarily due to the resolution of the U.S. tax treatment of our international operation, as we noted in the announcement of our agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service last December. Reported earnings per share in the quarter were $0.45, compared to $0.38 in the prior year.","EPS was $0.46, excluding Travelex integration expenses, which compared to $0.40, excluding restructuring charges in the prior year. Earnings per share increased 15%, excluding integration expense in the current quarter and restructuring expense in the prior year period.","The C2C operating segment margin improved to 29.4%, compared to 29.0% in the same period last year. Margin benefited primarily from currency and lower compensation costs, with partial offsets from IT and other investments and higher compliance costs.","The consumer-to-business operating margin increased to 25.3%, compared to 21.0% in the prior year period. Margin improvement was primarily driven by lower debit fees related to Durbin.","Business Solutions reported an operating loss of $7 million for the quarter, compared to a loss of $2 million in the year ago period. Next year's operating loss does not include Travelex Global Business Payments.","The current quarter $7 million loss includes $17 million of depreciation and amortization and $10 million of Travelex integration expense. There's approximately $1 million that is included in both amortization and integration expense. Depreciation and amortization in last year's third quarter was $5 million. Business Solutions EBITDA margin of 20%, excluding integration expenses, improved from 8% in the first quarter and 15% in the second quarter.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. We continue to generate strong cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $860 million, which includes the impact of approximately $90 million of net tax payments relating to the agreement with the IRS. There were approximately $100 million in tax payments related to this agreement that remain to be paid, and we expect to pay those in 2013.","Capital expenditures in the quarter were $62 million or 4% of revenue. Depreciation and amortization expense was $61 million in the quarter. At the end of the third quarter, the company had debt of $3.4 billion and cash of $1.4 billion. Approximately 1\/2 of the cash was in the United States.","During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares, totaling $112 million at an average price of $17.51. In addition, we declared $60 million in dividends.","Year-to-date, we've returned over $600 million through buybacks and dividends, while repurchases this year represent approximately 4% of the total shares outstanding. As of September 30, our shares outstanding were 599 million shares, and we had $194 million remaining under our existing repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2012.","Today, we announced a 25% increase of our dividend to $0.50 per share annually and an additional $550 million repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2013. We would anticipate continuing to increase the dividend in future years consistent with business performance.","Turning to the outlook for 2012. We have updated our projections to reflect lower second half revenue trends and the impact of expenses related to the productivity and cost savings initiatives. We are implementing some new cost savings initiatives in the fourth quarter to help fund growth investments and enhance long-term profitability. These initiatives contemplate a reduction of the company's overall headcount and the migration and consolidation of positions from various facilities, primarily within the United States and Europe, to regional operating centers and third-party providers, among other actions.","We have currently identified actions that should generate $30 million of annual savings by 2014. To realize these savings, we will incur pretax expenses of approximately $30 million in fourth quarter this year, which is now reflected in our margin and EPS outlook. We anticipate identifying and implementing additional cost savings initiatives throughout 2013.","As a result of these items, the updated 2012 outlook for revenue and margin is now 4% to 5% constant currency revenue growth, including a 4% benefit from the full year inclusion of Travelex. GAAP revenue growth 2% lower than constant currency. GAAP margins of approximately 23.5%. Operating margins, excluding TGBP integration expense of approximately 24.5%, EBITDA margins, excluding TGBP integration expense, of approximately 29%.","All the margin metrics are down 1 percentage point from the previous outlook, with 1\/2 of the decline due to the $30 million of expenses related to the cost savings initiatives and the remainder primarily due to lower revenue projections.","For the full year, we now expect a tax rate between 14% and 15%, which is down from our previous outlook, partially due to the expenses related to the cost savings initiatives, reducing U.S.-based income in the fourth quarter. We currently would expect the 2013 effective tax rate to be somewhat higher due to some nonrecurring benefits in 2012.","The updated earnings per share outlook for 2012 is: GAAP EPS in a range of $1.60 to $1.63, compared to $1.68 to $1.72 in the previous outlook; and EPS, excluding Travelex integration expenses, of $1.65 to $1.68, which compares to $1.73 to $1.77 previously. EPS was negatively impacted by $0.04 from our prior outlook due to the $30 million of expenses related to the new cost savings initiatives.","Our outlook for cash flow from operations is now expected to be approximately $1.1 billion or approximately $1.2 billion, excluding payments of $90 million that we've already been made relating to the IRS agreement. We will provide our outlook for 2013 when we announce our fourth quarter results in February.","As Hikmet mentioned, while we are still evaluating several potential pricing actions, we currently expect consumer money transfer pricing investments as a percentage of revenue to be in the mid-single-digit range in 2013. Pricing investments typically result in revenue declines in the affected corridors in the initial year, but they drive transaction growth and customer acquisition, leading to subsequent revenue growth in the future.","Based on current economic conditions and the expected accelerated pricing investments, we currently anticipate slight revenue declines in 2013 in constant currency terms. As part of our strategic action plans, we also anticipate significantly increasing investments in 2013 across IT and other areas to support digital, stored value, other new product development and innovation and the customer experience.","Combining revenue declines, cost associated with higher transactions and the incremental investments, we believe GAAP operating income in 2013 could decline 10% to 15% from 2012 levels, if all plans are implemented as contemplated and the economy remains soft. Business Solutions' profitability is expected to improve significantly in 2013, including the impact of lower integration expenses and higher synergies.","These are very high level expected projections, as we have not yet completed a bottoms-up financial planning process for 2013. But directionally, we believe these ranges reflect the expected impact of the strategic actions and current environment. We'll have a clearer picture of 2013 in February, and we will update you with a more detailed outlook for the year.","We expect our strategic actions to lead to positive revenue and operating income trends in 2014. To summarize, while some parts of our business are facing economic, competitive and compliance-driven challenges, we believe we have the right action plans in place to position us for long-term growth in retail and digital money transfer, as well as Business Solutions and stored value. We also expect to continue to implement productivity improvements and cost saving initiatives to drive our business and profitability over the long term.","Operator, we are now ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Hikmet, I'd like to just hear, if you don't mind your overview of long-term strategically where you these -- each of these businesses' growth profile looking like? I know generally and historically, you said this is a company you thought should be a growth company. Can you just tell us, the B2B segment at first maybe, where do you see that being kind of long-term average growth rates? And what can you do to get it back to that kind of growth rate that I think you initially thought it would be when you had bought Travelex? And then maybe just touch on similar answers for the other 2 segments, that would be appreciated.","Hikmet Ersek","Sure. Darrin, generally, I would say that the global economic environment, like with many companies, has been also challenging for us, especially the global trade has been slower than we thought. The transaction-wise, I think, the B2B business is doing pretty well, had a good quarter. Also comparing with the last quarter, quarter 3 2011, which we had a extraordinary, very strong growth there. So the revenues were flat, but it impacted also from global trade things. Don't forget that the principal amount in this quarter was quite flat, lower than we thought. So it was -- it impacted the revenue. But long term, we believe that our business in fact, the integration is growing very well. Our margins are increasing quarter-by-quarter on the B2B segment. We are now in 29 countries. As we started with the B2B business after the integration, we were at 16 countries, we're already on 29 countries. We recently launched India, which I believe that's a big opportunity also for the B2B segment. But globally, I would say that the economic environment is challenging. It reflects, not only the B2B, I would say, the total business also and the consumer behavior, the Southern European softness and European softness are continuing. And then also in the U.S., we see some economic challenges, it impacts our business.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I guess what I'm trying to just understand is though, let's just hypothetically say, if you were in a macroeconomic environment where GDP was growing at a more normal state, maybe in a few percentage points range, do you continue to expect you'd be gaining market share globally? And if so, what kind of growth rate should that generate for the company long term? And I know that's not -- I'm not asking for guidance, I guess I'm just trying to think about whether this truly -- how much of a growth story this could be down the road?","Hikmet Ersek","I think we will -- on the -- if you look at our business, generally, I think our business is built on growth. We have the fundamentals. We have the 500,000 locations. We are in 200 countries. We are expanding in electronic channels, very, very good. We have a 25% revenue growth in electronic channels. We've been investing in dot com. We have about 40% transaction growth. I think we are reaching new customers here. So digital is very good. I think I'm also satisfied that the B2B as we -- in the global trend -- global trade comes back, that will also be very good. We have only 2% market share at the B2B business. I believe there is a huge opportunity. We do have, current some challenges in certain corridors, which we are fixing and we are very focused on that. Long-term, I believe that, given our multiproduct, multichannel approach, I think we are on the road again, when -- economy comes back on the growth track. And we giving -- going to give you more color also on the 2013 in February numbers, we will give you also more color there.","Operator","The next question comes from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Hikmet, I'm trying to sort of get my arms around the organizational changes and what effect do you think these are going to have? Is the problem for you been lack of information or lack of real-time color in terms of what's happening on the field? Do you expect that having this direct alignment to you will fix that? Or is it more an information system seat back mechanism that you don't have to really understand what's happening with the business right now, because it really feels like a lot of things have kind of gotten away from you terms of having visibility into the model. So can help us understand how these changes, you think, will help you get a better feel for what's happening with the business on a real-time basis?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, Julio, first of all, as you know, I think the -- Stewart's position has been eliminated, right? I think these regions will direct reporting to me. And Stewart did 4 years of good job here, and we really wish him, really, everything best for his future. But what I would like to do here, also saying that I'm coming from the markets, as you know, I've been 14 years there. I know how that works. I know the agents very well. I've been, before I was coming over to U.S., I was running 125 countries. I built the international business. So also, knowing the regional heads very well. So I'm very confident that we have the right information with the market and with the regional leaders and with the agents to grow this, continue to grow this business. Also, I believe we are aligning the organization to multiproduct, multichannel organization in the future, regions will not only sell retail money transfer, we'll also have other products, like prepaid cards, which we -- it's happening currently, or stored value products selling on the regions, which is the alignment of the new organization. So I'm very confident that we are going to execute against our goals, which we just disclosed.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So having the people report directly to you in terms of alignment, what is -- what's different about that? Obviously, you don't have Stewart, that layer there anymore, but what do you expect to learn differently, I guess, from the alignment of the new alignment of these people actually reporting to you? And how much time do you think that's going to take for us to get a good feel, whether or not that's actually working?","Hikmet Ersek","I think, I'm very confident that regional heads know the business very well. So they're going to execute that, and they know the business very well and they're continue to execute very well. I think having also focus on the big part of our business, the retail money transfer, and having me personally involved here and I understand the business environment, then allocating the resources to the right part will definitely help us executing our strategy. And especially the recently announced price promotions, which we're going to launch immediately in the key corridors will help to drive the organizational alignment behind that.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to get your read on how much of all this change in the outlook is a function of industry wide factors versus company-specific? I mean it frankly sounds mostly company-specific, but you keep talking about macro softness. What's your take on that? I mean, how much of this is really specific to Western Union versus reflective of any broader industry trends?","Hikmet Ersek","Sure. I can't give you -- I think there are big, 3 big areas. First of all, as you said, it's the economic environment, macroeconomic environment does impact our business. We have some challenges in part of the world, which are increasing. And that unfortunately, don't look very bright for the future. The second one is the compliance environment. As we have regulatory environments changing, and we are investing more in being an industry leader, putting some compliance requirements for our customers, which are tougher and higher than it was in the past. And that's, I believe, also that's the, in the future, that the competitors will adapt to this compliance environment. We believe we as an industry leader, we are leading that, and I think we are protecting our customer. And the third part is definitely -- in some corridors, we do have some competitive pricing pressures, which impacted our business, and we recognize them. Just to give you some numbers in Q2, Scott, we were minus 2% on principal, right? In Q3, we had minus 7% on the principal. And that was under specific key markets. So we are reacting immediately to do some pricing promotions in that corridors to win the customer back. As you know, the last we've been investing only 1% in 2011. And on this year, it will also about 1%.","Scott T. Scheirman","About 1%, yes.","Hikmet Ersek","1%, Scott, in this environment from our revenue, pricing investments. But we were been a little concerned I think, but now we are reacting to immediate to the -- fix these key markets.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you just give us a little more color on which specific corridors had this sudden change in competitive dynamics over the last couple of months, it just seems a little unusual for things to change so quickly. Maybe you saw some initial signs of it a quarter or so ago. But can you just help us understand what specific corridors? Because the compliance stuff in Mexico, for example, I think was pretty well explained by you guys earlier this year, but it sounds like there may be some newer corridors that now are experiencing the need for a greater pricing investment. And if that's the case, can you tell us which ones those are?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, hey, Jason, a couple of things related to that. And prior that, to reiterate what Hikmet said a minute ago is that, if you look at the cross-border principal that we transfer, it grew 2% in the first quarter. It was down 2% in the second quarter, then it was minus 7% in the third quarter. So we did see some sudden changes. And there clearly had been some compliance challenges, as we've we shared, and as you alluded to, including, not only in Mexico, but we had to do things with the Vigo brand that impacted Latin America. So compliance is -- stretches beyond Mexico, if you will, into some other corridors. As far as pricing and actions, hopefully, what you appreciate from competitive standpoint, I'm not getting into a lot of detail of where we're heading with some of our pricing actions, but we know they were, we've done hundreds of pricing actions. We know how to do these. And the key for us, it's about getting more transactions, more customers, improving our share. We know near-term, that will impact the financial results. But long-term, that will help grow -- help revenues and profits. But I just -- I don't want to give a lot of color on specific corridors for competitive reasons.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It sounds like Mexico, obviously, was soft. What other corridors were kind of softer than you originally expected in this quarter?","Hikmet Ersek","Hey, Bryan. It was Mexico that was definitely soft. But also, resetting Vigo and Orlandi Valuta, especially Vigo, has impacted some of our Southern -- Latin American corridors also. Obviously, having, closing down also 7,000 locations, resetting Vigo in the -- and taking Vigo platform to our platform and putting different compliance regulations has impacted our business here.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And it sounds like, I mean, almost everywhere, U.S. sounded weaker. Asia sounded weaker. Middle East and Africa sounded weaker. What was the cause of those weaknesses in those areas?","Hikmet Ersek","I think part of this weakness was Europe, was definitely economic environment, part of it is competitive pressure. But part of this is in the Asia and it's economic environment. You could see that the softness of macro environment has impacted our business. But part of that, Germany's still holding. But part of the Western European countries started to soften also, given the global economical environment.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it sounds like, just looking back, the pricing actions were about -- will be about 1% this year and 1% in 2011. They rise to mid-single digits in 2013, which I think is probably the highest in the company's history. So I guess, 2 questions. One, should you have had more pricing actions earlier, when it was only 1% the past 2 years? And 2, it really feels like competitively, the environments changed a lot from what Western Union used to be?","Hikmet Ersek","Bryan, maybe, your pricing action maybe, we could do differently in 2010 and '11. Maybe, but these are really certain corridors, Bryan. They are key corridors, which has been under pressure. It's not -- don't forget that we are in 16,000 corridors in 200 countries. There is not overall price pressure, our presence [ph] is still here. The market is growing. And we are in a growing market. So I would say that, this has been certain corridors impacted our business. Now don't forget also in 2010, we had a pricing action about 2% to 4%, including our DMT business. So we had -- it's a very success story. You'd recall we turned around this business and has been delivering very good numbers. And we did -- I personally did more than 100 price actions in my career, and which has been paying back after a year. And I believe this pricing action we're going to do, immediate price action will pay back by 2014.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Just last question for me. Scott, I know in the Analyst Day we talked about maybe getting some margin leverage as we head into '13. And I know we're expecting some of the recent acquisitions to show some leverage in margin in 2013. But it sounds like from the comments today that due to some other activities, it doesn't look like we're going to see much margin leverage. So A, is that true? And B, what is -- what should we expect from margin expansion x restructuring costs? Will we actually be able to see margin expansion or more flat or down still?","Scott T. Scheirman","For 2013, and again, Bryan, we'll give more color in February. But margins will be down somewhat in 2013, if you will. And probably, one of the most important factors for us is growing the top line, growing revenue, it does help with margin leverage from that standpoint. So the actions we're announcing today is really focused at growing that top line and growing profits, if you will. But even though revenues will be slightly down in 2013, we believe, as we move into '14, we have the opportunity to grow revenues and grow profits. And when I get ahead of myself about talking about 2014 today, let alone 2013, but what we're very focused on is more customers, more transactions. We're regaining the market share. And we think we've got the plans in place to do that as we move forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a few follow-up questions. Just the first one, just the competitive pricing pressure. Is it coming from the usual suspects? Or is it from some of the newer digital players? I'm curious.","Hikmet Ersek","It's both. I would say that in parts of Russia, for instance, which we have told already, it's coming from new competitors, which it will take us about the next few months and the end of 2000, middle, I would say, second, third quarter of 2013, turnaround this business because we have the open retail here. But in some parts of the competitors, like in, with existing corridors, big corridors, key markets has been coming from existing corridors. It's a mix of parts. Parts of it also is digital, although we are growing the digital very fast in the higher principals, Tien-Tsin, like 5,000 plus principal has been a big growth in this area, and it -- we are very small here. And the lower principal a month, on the remittance market, is -- was not growing that fast, and we have a good market share there.","Scott T. Scheirman","We continue to see on our online businesses, mostly incremental consumers. We continue to see that 80% new consumers that are -- they're using our online business, that are new to the Western Union franchise. So we're not seeing a big crossover from digital to cash, if that's what you're asking. So the pressure is really, more from the cash to cash players that we're seeing around the world.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, got it, perfect. Just wanted to make sure. And just -- I know you can't give details on the pricing, but is there going to be -- it sounds like there's going to be still, sort of surgical promotions in key corridors but is it -- are we going to see a change in philosophy around pricing as well, and introduce new products like $5 for $50?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, obviously, every -- I can't give more color. But every pricing has a story behind that. And we are adapting our prices, in corridor by corridor obviously. In some corridors, we are aiding an account-based money transfer. In some quarters, it's cash-to-cash retail money transfer business. And -- but generally, from philosophy, we are a premium priced product, with stay service. We're going to stay at premium price. And because we can't -- we have the 500,000 locations, we are in 200 countries, we have a great compliance, we have a great brand, I think the premium price will continue, Tien-Tsin.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So far there's no change. Okay, good. Last one, just a quick one. Vigo,  OV, what percentage of revenue is that today? Have you given that before?","Hikmet Ersek","I don't think we have. Scott, did we given that?","Scott T. Scheirman","No. It's -- we haven't given it, and I'll put it out here. It's about 3%, 3% of our top line in 2011, but that business was hit hard in the third quarter with both Mexico and Latin America.","Michael A. Salop","It was about half of our Mexico business, prior, but it's less than that now.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I think you do with something like 3% or 4%.","Operator","The next question comes from James Friedman of Susquehanna.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I had a couple of questions, in particular about the margin. Scott, I was referring to Slide 16, and I think it's Slide 18. So in your margin comments, you highlighted that currency and the compensation in Durbin for their combined margin. I was wondering if you could proportionalize the impact of each of those?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. And have me probably work back from the consolidated margins, even though on Slide 16, C2C is 80% plus of our business. But if I had to give you a sense of the things that are helping the margin, directionally, currency compensation adjustments and the Durbin fee is where, directionally all having about an equal impact on the plus side. And then a few things that are impacting the margin the other way is the incremental amortization because of the Travelex acquisition. We've got incremental cost on Southwest Border in compliance. Then we have some more investments in IT and dot com. So each of those have pluses and minuses. And the pluses directionally cancel out the minuses, where the margins were down about 30 basis points for the quarter.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, I know. It was a good job with the margins. Just a follow-up on that with the Business Solutions. That's my fault for not understanding this, but why is it that there's $17 million in D&A now, whereas it was only $5 million in the Q3 last year? If you could share the timing on that, that will be helpful.","Scott T. Scheirman","Sure. We closed the Travelex Global Business Payments acquisition in November of last year. So if you go back to the third quarter of last year, we did not own that business. And that's where the amortization with the old Custom House Business Solutions, it was about $5 million. And because of the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments, we picked up an incremental $12 million in amortization expense as it relates to the purchase price.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then the last thing for me is, at the Analyst Day, you had shared what you felt were the long-term growth targets of the business. Could you repeat what those were, and just kind of contextualize if you're still comfortable with those long-term growth objectives?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, let me kind of give an overview of what the growth rates are, and then I'll let Hikmet give some color commentary. And I just say, on a macro basis first, key -- given the economy, the things we're seeing with compliance and the competitive dynamics, achieving some of those objectives, at least in the near term, could be challenging, if you will, for sure. Especially as we think about '13 and '14. But the color we gave, kind of set around a couple of things is that in the C2C business, at that time, back in May, we expected that revenue growth to be above that 4% range. In the C2B business, we saw single-digit revenue growth. In Business Solutions, we saw that as a double-digit grower, low double-digit grower on a long-term basis. And then in Prepaid, we had the top line growing 20%, if you will. But Hikmet, I'll let Hikmet give some color on the long-term objectives.","Hikmet Ersek","Sure. I mean, the current economic environment did impact, especially our retail money transfer business. We are on the digital, pretty much on the road to achieve our 2015 goal, about $500 million business, and it's growing very well. I think that we have the right fundamentals also on the B2B business. I am very satisfied here. I think the global trade will help us and Raj and the team is doing a good job expanding that business also. On the Retail Money Transfer business, we can -- we will give you -- given the current environment, we'll give you a more color in our February meeting. But we have to adjust some numbers, given the investment, given the slower revenue, given the economic environment, we have to adjust our numbers for 2013 and will have some impact on 2014. But I believe that we are doing the right things here to fix that, and to come back to the strong growth rates.","Operator","The next question is going to come from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had 2 questions. First was just -- wanted to clarify something on your preliminary '13 guidance. Scott, I think you referenced a decline in GAAP operating income of 10% to 15%. Do you contemplate any additional charges in '13? Or will this $30 million in 4Q sort to take care of these new strategic actions?","Scott T. Scheirman","We're -- Tim, we're currently evaluating and preparing our plans and so forth. We've got some overall strategies. And part of those overall strategies continue to be improving productivity, optimizing our cost structure and so forth. So right now, I'd say, yes, I would anticipate taking some additional expenses in 2013. And those additional expenses, I would take, you would not -- likely not see a net benefit until 2014 from an expense standpoint. But the -- yes, we'll likely take more charges as we look at the cost structure.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question I had, I think it's been touched on a couple of different times. But competitively, I guess thinking about what you're trying to do on price and product and consumer experience, all those things you referenced, but don't want to go on a ton of specifics on yet. When you think about MoneyGram and Ria and maybe some others who have greatly expanded their footprints, potentially I guess you can say I have a little bit more visibility with the consumer that might have really only saw the Western Union brand in select locations, and now they're seeing these other brands emerge with more signs, more locations. And when you talk about dropping price to win those customers back, it may have left you to go to other brands so that they become more visible. Where do you get that confidence that once you put the pricing in, and bring them back into your store, that they will stay, given that those 2 brands and probably others intend to continue to build out signage and store locations? And one would assume, continue to innovate their businesses as well?","Hikmet Ersek","First of all, thanks for the question, Tim. I think, first of all, we are growing our retail network and we will grow our presence, global presence, constantly. One million point-of-sale presence will continue to happen. Don't forget that we just, as just as I said in the call, just announced about 44,000 ATMs in Brazil. And we have about 5 -- more than 500,000 locations globally. We just opened -- we are the first in a new country, Myanmar, we just opened the country. So our global presence, will continue to expand and also, our PSD presence happening very well in Germany. We are opening to, in also in Europe. We are opening more and more retail locations for our consumers. The second thing is that, don't forget, our brand awareness is still very high. Our brand awareness is 90 plus in many receiving countries and also in sending countries. In Africa, 90 plus. In receiving countries, South Asia, 95%. So that fundamentals are here, and going to continue to grow above that. Though in some parts of the corridors, in some parts of the key markets, we did have a very high prices, and adjustment of that will continue to give the consumers their convenience. I can tell you, when an example from U.S. domestic money transfer. As we had our -- we have the locations in the U.S., we have the globe awareness, adapting our prices, whilst gaining market share and the revenue came up to 12 to 18 months in a very strong way. And we win, again, market share here. And the similar things we have done, I have personally done in 100 corridors. I know how to do it. I know it's about 12 to 18 months. It may -- in most of the time, within the 12 months, the revenues are coming back. And the first 2 months, you will immediately see the transaction increase market share's gain, and we have done that, and we will be active on the market to gain market share.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can I just ask one last one on that topic, and that'll be it. There's been a lot of, I guess, changes in reporting styles and organization of the company. I guess I'd be curious if you see areas to add to the bench, or maybe a different perspective would be helpful. And I guess I think about what you're trying to do or really trying to manage a brand and develop product here. Is there a role for somebody that comes from a large global consumer brand company to come in and give a perspective? Or do you feel like within Western Union, you've got the right capabilities to move forward on that front of the business?","Hikmet Ersek","I think we have a very strong team. We just hired also a very strong CIO, which comes from the -- a very strong capability, David Thompson. We have the -- a very strong General Counsel, our HR leader. We -- the new hires has been very strong to the company. And especially, our regional business heads. They know how to run the business. I think we have also a very strong CMO, Diane Scott, on the team. The business is unique. Has its uniqueness, has its challenges, but it's also a very different business. It's always, and by the way, we have also a very strong board, which advises and support us, a very diverse board, and we are constantly talking to them, and I believe that we have the right organization to grow this business. And we are a strong brand. You have this -- we have almost a $6 billion business. We have high margins. We generate high income. I think we have the right structures, the right organization in place.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Hikmet, I wonder if you could just, in very, sort of concise terms, articulate why you believe what you're doing is truly a strategic repositioning of the business? You, for example, referenced to the price changes in the U.S., which had some beneficial, would appear tactical, changes, as you look kind of at 2010 and in the beginning of '11. But I wonder just if you could make, in an elevator pitch style, the strategic defense of Western Union because we've kind of been sliding down a slippery slope here on pricing and on margins for the last few years, at least that's how it feels to me.","Hikmet Ersek","Well, first of all, on the pricing, if you look at our pricing structure the last years, we have been doing 4% investment in 2010, 1% on the, for I mean, in 2011 and 1% in 2012. But given the Western Union, if you lean back, Andrew, as you said, and look at Western Union, we have the global presence. We are in 200 countries. We operate in 16,000 corridors. We have different business in Latin America. We have bill payment business in North America. We have bill payment business. We have the B2B business. I think these assets are enormous. Now if you look at this business, we are a premium price. We are growing this business in many corridors, but we do have recent challenges in key corridors, which we have to fix it. You could call that a tactical, but I think it's strategic decisions here, which we are doing because these are fun, one-time corrections, which we will like to do it now, and move forward in 2014 with strong growth again. And that's in the correction, in the core business. But strategically, also, you look at our digital business, Andrew, growing very strong. And we did the right investment in San Francisco office, we opened, we built the right team. We have the right talent there to grow this business very strong. And no one else, but Western Union can connect the digital with physical location as we do it in 200 countries, in 16,000 corridors. That's one of the reason why it's growing so fast. And I am pleased on that.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then is there -- does there come a point, because I know you've articulated in the past, I believe the desire to have, perhaps as many as a million branches globally. Does there come a point at which there's a change in the balance between return of capital to shareholders or a thought about the capital structure versus the investment in branches? Because it does sound like there's a little bit of a hand off of the baton here from physical, location-based money transfer to electronic or account-to-account money transfer. Does that change strategic capital allocation considerations for Western Union here of -- might we hear about that next, I guess, is what I'm asking.","Hikmet Ersek","So well, our vision of 1 million touch points has not changed. I think we are expanding that, and I'm very pleased with the expansion plans on that and we are on target. But on the existing capital structure for existing retail locations, these are not lot of capital investments, except sometimes signing bonuses, right? But these are not capital expense because the retail locations already exist there. And what happens if you sign a post office or if you sign a bank in China, you do act on the -- on your service, on the existing banks or existing retails or existing shops, which doesn't impact our capital structure much here. Of course, we're going to further connect the electronic with retail, retail with electronic, account with electronic, account with retail, that's the beauty of the new strategy, that's the beauty of the Western Union growth.","Scott T. Scheirman","And I think and if you look at the external forecast, I mean as people are, other agencies are projecting that the cash to cash piece of the business is going to continue to grow, which we would agree with. But the digital side is growing faster. So we want to continue to invest there and connect more channels and choices for consumers.","Operator","The next question, or final question, rather, comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","I just wanted to go back to the statement you said, Western Union being a premium price brand. Do you think considering what you had to do domestically and now it appears what you're having to do in some of these other corridors for pricing, can Western Union, in this environment, still remain a premium priced brand, in your opinion?","Hikmet Ersek","Absolutely. I think, don't forget that we are in 16,000 corridors, price correction, we are doing currently in on certain corridors. It's -- we're not touching all market, we are doing the certain corridors. We did that several times. I mean, if you recall, Kartik, our investments in Middle East, pricing investment in Middle East, to adopt our prices. And our Middle East outbound has been bought out and has been a success story for many years and still a success story. And I think, and there, we have a premium pricing. And in many, our westernunion.com business is a premium prices in many parts of that. And our existing business is compared with the competition that premium prices because we can -- we have the brand, we have the regulation involved, we have set the best settlement system. We have 500,000 locations. I think these are very much valued by the consumers, and that's why, I believe, the premium price philosophy will exist.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","So based on your past experience, when you put in price corrections such as this, what does that usually mean for transaction growth, Hikmet? What would you anticipate this resulting in, as you go forward?","Hikmet Ersek","First of all, dependent, really. I mean, it sounds almost like a politician, but it depends on the corridor. It depends on the market environment. It depends on which bands you to the pricing investments. And as you recall, as we did the $5 for $50, that most increase came from lower bands. And the increase was significant, as you recall that, I think in the beginning, we had about 20% increase, right, on the transactions.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, I mean, near-term we expect more customers, more transactions. It'll take about a year to lap the revenue declines, but we almost immediately see transaction uplift and a lot more customers. And that's the goal of this program here, is to do that.","Hikmet Ersek","That's immediately transaction growth. And customer growth, actually, Kartik.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then there's just one last question, Scott. You talked about, obviously, 2013 margins. It probably won't grow, considering the environment we're in. As you look at this company, as we move forward, what kind of revenue growth do you think is necessary in the new cost structure for you to have a positive margin?","Scott T. Scheirman","Kartik, I don't want to get too far ahead of myself for '13 or '14. But clearly, and you hit the nail on the head, as we need revenue growth and, year in, year out, if you think about inflation runs, 1% or 2% or 3%, kind of pick your number, whatever you may. But clearly, the goal of the programs is to get back to more customers, more transaction and revenue growth. And we clearly do need revenue growth to be helpful to margin expansion on a long-term basis.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Overall, our business continues to provide a stable results as our customers remained resilient despite slowing global economic growth in parts of the worlds. Results remain strong with westernunion.com transaction accelerating to 25% growth in the quarter which translated into 22% constant currency revenue increase.","In addition to ongoing turn in our U.S. outbound digital business, we are also making great progress in increasing westernunion.com penetration and growth in key European markets including France, the UK and Germany. For our entire money transfer business, revenues increased 1% in constant currency. Transactions however increased 4% in the fourth quarter, and cross-border principal volume grew 8% in constant currency terms so underlying metrics are sound.","Business Solutions showed improvements with revenues increasing 5%, constant currency led by strong growth in Europe. We again delivered good performance in the payments area of B2B, including the education vertical. This quarter however we also had good growth in foreign exchange services aided by customers hedging related to increased foreign exchange volatility.","The bill payments businesses posted mixed results with Argentina results in U.S. dollar terms continued to be heavily impacted by negative currency translation. From a profit perspective, margins were solid at 19.2% for the quarter and 20.1% for the year as effective cost management and our WU Way lean programs contributed to stability.","Operating cash flow for the U.S. came in as projected, as we generated over $800 million dollars and we returned over $740 million to shareholders in 2018 through dividends and share repurchases. We are also very pleased to announce today a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.20 per share or $0.80 percent on an annualized basis.","As we begin, 2019 we remain focused on driving digital expansion and growth, offering our cross-border platform to new payments areas, and generating additional operating efficiencies. We made good progress on these initiatives in 2018.","I mentioned the strong results we experienced with westernunion.com which exceeded $0.5 billion in revenues last year. Our digital expansion efforts to drive future growth also continue to ramp up as we launch approximately 20 new westernunio.com or mobile app markets over the last year particularly in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.","Consumers can now access our online or mobile services to initiate transactions in more than 60 countries plus many territories and our digital penetration covers markets that represent approximately 75% of global remittance markets principal. We believe this will give us additional future revenue growth opportunities for our digital business.","In addition, we embedded digital money transfer services into more third party platforms such as Safaricom in Kenya and added large principal transfer products for our westernunion.com services in the UK. We also continue to expand our bank accounts payout services, as we now have the capabilities to send to nearly 100 countries and territories reaching billions of accounts and we are seeing strong growth in account payout transactions.","The combination of our extensive retail footprint and our growing digital presence and account payout network creates a very strong proposition for consumers, providing them the ability to send and receive in whichever method and currency they prefer around the world.","Looking at our progress with new cross-border payment opportunities. In October, we announced our collaboration with Amazon in which we utilize our global platform to process international e-commerce payments. Under this agreement, Amazon customers in various markets will have a new way to pay in person at our retail agent locations.","Over the last few months, we have launched pilot for this service in 10 markets mainly in Asia and South America. Coverage in these markets is not being increased and we are working with Amazon on the expansion roadmap for additional countries in the future.","Turning to our operational efficiency accomplishments, the WU Way continue to help us around the Company better. We implemented more than 40 lean deployments last year, trained more than 6,000 employees on lean processes and achieved approximately $70 million in run rate savings from WU Way driven efficiency programs. These savings helped fund investment in growth initiative technology and core sufficiently such as GDPR.","In 2019, we will continue to push forward these strategies. On a macro level, there is uncertainty on economic growth in many parts of the world as well as foreign exchange had been and geopolitical concerns, but we expect stable financial performance in 2019. Our business is very diverse with 20,000 corridors and no one country outside the U.S. representing more than 7% of our revenues.","Historically, our customers have been resilient even in challenging economic times. Our transaction and principal transfer helped exiting 2018 and we expect that to continue. We believe the pricing environment will remain stable and do not expect major pricing changes in 2019. Overall, our 2019 outlook calls for a low single digit constant current revenue growth and operating margin of approximately 20% and continue strong cash flow generation and return of funds to shareholders.","Raj will give you more information on the 2019 outlook in a few minutes. And right now, I would like to turn the call over to him to provide more details on the fourth quarter results.","Raj Agrawal","Thank you, Hikmet. As I review 2018 financial results, I will focus primarily on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules.","Fourth quarter revenues are $1.4 billion decline 3% or increased 2% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior period. Currency translation net of the impact from hedges reduced fourth quarter revenues by approximately $69 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to continued decline in the Argentine pesos. The decline in the peso are negatively impact the total revenue by 4 percentage points, while they expect some inflation on our Argentina businesses is estimated to have positively impacted both reported and constant currency revenues by approximately 2 percentage points.","In the consumer to consumer segments which represented 80% of company revenues in the quarter, revenues declined 1% or increased 1% constant currency while transactions grew 4%. Total C2C cross-border principal increased 5% or 8% on a constant basis while principal for transaction was flat or increase 3% constant currency. The spread between C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 5% with a negative 2% impact from currency.","Mix had a negative impact of 5.2 percentage points in the quarter while pricing had a negative impact of 1% compared to the prior year period. The 1% pricing impact primarily reflects action taken in the Middle East earlier in the year. Excluding the Middle East, the net pricing change for the rest of the world was positive both for the quarter and the full year.","Turning to the regional results, North America revenue was flat on both, reported and consequently basis while transactions grew 2%. The U.S. to Mexico quarter delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter, but this was offset by continued decline in the U.S. domestic money transfer business.","In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 1% or 2% on a constant currency basis, led by France and Spain, while transactions in the region increased 8%. Revenue in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region declined 7% on a reported basis or 6% constant currency, while transaction growth improved to 3% as the previously implemented price reductions are delivering good results and driving volumes.","Latin America and Caribbean region continued to deliver strong constant currency revenue growth driven by Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil. Revenue in the region was flat in the quarter or increased 16% constant currency, while transactions grew 11%. In the APAC region, revenue declined 9% or 8% constant currency and transactions were down 4% with Australia, China, and New Zealand contributing to the decline.","Westernunion.com continued to deliver strong growth as revenue grew 21% or 22% constant currency on transaction growth of 25%. Westernunion.com represented 12% of total C2C revenue in the quarter and for the full year. Business Solutions revenues increased 3% or 5% on a constant currency basis and represented 7% of company revenues in the quarters.","Other revenues which consists primarily of our bill payments businesses decreased 11% in the quarter or increased 10% on a constant currency basis and represented 13% of total company revenues. The Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina continued to grow transactions and local currency revenue aided by inflation had declined in U.S. dollar terms while our Speedpay U.S. electronic bill payments revenue also declined in the quarter.","The depreciation of the Argentine peso negatively impacted other reported revenue by 21 percentage points in the quarter while Argentina inflation is estimated to have positively impacted other reported and constant currency revenues by approximately 11 percentage points.","Turning to the margins and profitability. Our consolidated GAAP results reflect from significant special items, primarily in the prior year. So I am providing the adjusted metrics comparisons to better reflect the fundamentals of the business. The adjusted metrics in the current quarter excludes the impacts of tax expense related to changes for the accounting of the U.S Tax Act. I refer you to our press release tables for a detailed listing of the adjustment items amounts for the prior year quarter and full year.","The consolidated operating margin in the fourth quarter was 19.3% up from 18% in the prior year on an adjusted basis. The adjusted operating margin expansion was driven by lower bad debt marketing and incentive compensation expenses which were partially offset by higher other corporate expenses in technology spending.","Foreign exchange just provided a benefit of $4 million in the current quarter compared to a negative impact of $7 million in the prior year period. We achieved approximately $10 million of incremental savings from WU Way initiatives in the fourth quarter, which gave us approximately $45 million of incremental savings for the full year. On an absolute basis, we achieved approximately $70 million of savings from Wu Way for the year.","EBITDA margin was 24.2% in the quarter, which compared to 22.5% in the prior year period on an adjusted basis. The GAAP effective tax rate was 9.8% in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, the tax rate was 6.3% compared to 14.3% in the prior year period. The decrease in the adjusted tax rate was primarily due to discrete item in the current year period.","As we previously stated, certain of the impacts related to the Tax Act enacted in December of 2017 were provisionally estimated an additional affects we recorded during each quarter in 2018. In the fourth quarter, changes in our estimates related to the Tax Act resulted in an $8 million its tax experience. The accounting for the Tax Act was completed during the fourth quarter, so there will not be any additional adjustments going forward.","Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.49, which compared to $0.41 from the prior year period. The increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily due to the increase operating profit margin, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer shares outstanding partially offset by lower reported revenues.","The C3C margin was 23.3%, which compared to 21.5% in the prior year period. The margin increase was driven by lower bad debt marketing and incentive compensation expenses, which were partially offset by higher technology standard. Business Solutions operating margin was 5.4% of the quarter compared to negative 3.2% in the prior year period. The increase in operating margin was primarily due to high technology and other operating expense in the fourth quarter of last year.","Business, we should EBITDA margin was 16.2%, which compared to 8.1% in the prior year period. Operating margin for the businesses included in other was 1.8% in the quarter, which compared to 7.9% in the prior year period. A year-over-year margin decline was primarily due to lower revenue and higher corporate expenses as certain corporate expenses including spending for M&A and other strategic actions and activities are recorded within other.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $821 million for the full year, which includes the negative impacts of approximately $200 million related to payment on special items. Capital expenditures in the quarter were approximately $91 million.","At the end of the quarter, we had cash of $973 million in debt of $3.4 million. We returned $133 million to shareholders in the quarter including $84 million in dividends and $49 million of share repurchases, which represented approximately 3 million shares. The outstanding share account at quarter end was 441 million shares, and we had $544 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization which expires in December of this year.","Turning to our outlook. We expect stable financial performance in 2019 despite a slowing global economic environment. Similar to 2018, we expect a low single digit constant currency revenue increase excluding any benefit related to Argentina inflation. Due to the strength of the dollar against the Argentine pesos and major European currencies, we expect recorded revenue growth to be in a range of a low-single-digit decrease or low-single-digit increase.","Operating profit margin is expected to be approximately 20%. As we continue to focus on cost efficiencies and lean management communications to offset investments and some negative impact from foreign exchange. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% in 2019 including negatives incremental impact from the U.S. Tax Act's BEAT provision.","We have identified in our in the process of implementing structural actions to mitigate the adverse impact of deep for the future. The 2019 laid out looking through partial benefit from our mitigation efforts as they are rolled out during the year. We currently expect the effective tax rate in 2020 to be lower in the mid teens level, reflecting the full effect of mitigation. Due to the increase in tax rate with this year, our 2019 outlook anticipates full year earnings per share should be in a range of $1.83 to $1.95.","While cash flow from operating activities is expected to be possibly $1 billion, as we have mentioned previously, we are currently considering various strategic alternatives for certain of our business unit, but do not have anything to announce at this time. And there is no assurance any transaction will occur. If we were to complete a divestiture during the year, our outlook would need to be adjusted to reflect the related revenues and profits that would be removed as well as the impact of any use of proceeds.","So to summarize, we delivered our full year adjusted financial outlook in 2018 and made good progress on key strategic initiatives. We continue to generate solid cash flow and return significant capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. In 2019, we expect stable business, solid margins and continued strong allocation to shareholders.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang of JP Morgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Just on -- I\u2019ll start on the dotcom business, you've mentioned acceleration. You've mentioned new countries. I'm curious if you have an outlook for 2019 and what is it driven by? Is it again, more country expansion? Or are you just getting more penetration within your existing countries?","Hikmet Ersek","I think both will continue to do that because our U.S. outcome digital business is very strong and these are done by not the existing customers, but these have been here for a longer time. And as you know, we are also in the European Union countries longer time with our westernunion.com transaction. So that's going to continue.","But we\u2019re also very excited finding new customer segments in our new countries, and once you launch your country, takes the time with the marketing activities and you mean customers, but the growth rates are very promising. We came with Q4 also with a 25% transaction growth, which is also very encouraging. We are just starting in Middle East and Asia with our expansion.","I think, that's really encouraging numbers, so that gives us additional channels and still these customers are new to us. Additional customer doesn't cannibalize our existing business.","Tien-Tsin Huang","And just so my follow-up quickly, just I want to ask on Wu Way. I heard the $70 million in savings, but how -- where are you now in terms of potentially seeing better revenue production from Wu Way? Where are the investments going? May be just a quick update there?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think we\u2019re still very excited about Wu Way initiatives. I think there's still room from efficiency side also from growth opportunities how we implement that. Our focus is definitely on digital growth and we do -- when we launch in new country, we do launch with Wu Way initiatives. The Amazon Pay -- for our platform to Amazon, the collaboration with Amazon was done all via Wu Way and that has been launched 10 countries now, and we\u2019re just starting to promote that in different countries.","And from the efficiency side, I still believe there's some room and you know we gave our guidance about 20% margin for 2019. And while we do this efficiency program, we do invest also in the growth that we\u2019re going to continue to happen. And we are -- Wu Way is definitely the way we operate.","Raj Agrawal","And Tien-Tsin on those $70 million, that is our full run rate. We don't plan to call out any further savings there, but we will keep driving for lean and operating efficiencies and keep reinvesting in the business.","Operator","Next question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","I wanted to ask about the regions. In the North America region, I see transactions accelerated in the quarter at least year-over-year from 1% to 2%, but constant current you see revenues went down a couple points, and then EU and CIS similar. Transactions remain the same at about 8% but the constant currency revenues dropped to couple points. Just curious, what's causing that? And is that the mix that you called out there?","Raj Agrawal","This is Raj. In North America what you're seeing on the revenue side is, it's a growth over from higher foreign exchange spreads we had in the previous year fourth quarter, and some of those spreads were reversed during the course of the year. But transactions growth as you mentioned continue to accelerate, so that's good. Our U.S. outbound business actually did quite well. We had 7% transaction growth there which has been accelerating during the course of the year, but some of the pricing and mix impacts had the impact that we're referring to.","And then the Europe and CIS, the dotcom business overall grew very well during the course of last year and in the fourth quarter and also our DMT business in France. So, those have some mix impacts. The slowdown in the fourth quarter is again related to higher FX spread that we had earlier in the year in those markets that we reverse part of those. So, transaction trends have been quite healthy and just some of our mix in pricing impacts are having the revenue impact that you're seeing there.","Bryan Keane","And then, Hikmet just thinking about the new opportunities that you're talking about for cross-border, is there a way to quantify that in terms of revenue opportunities those could produce?","Hikmet Ersek","We don't give that revenue guidance there, but I believe there's a new opportunity for additional customers like we did it with the westernunion.com. These customers like the offering our platform to third party like Safaricom or Amazon Pay are really new customers that we didn't offer that. And that's the only way they can do transactions because if you're in Brazil, the local currency owner, is it in form of card or cash, you can't do international transactions because you can't use your credit card, international credit card. There is no international credit card, but the people want to buy online, want to buy global and pay local. And that's really our platform which we developed over years enables that. Technology wise, compliance wise and settlement wise do that. So we are very excited about that and Amazon is definitely a partner, but there are other also opportunity to extend our platform to new payments capabilities. Paying local, buying global is definitely something you are excited about.","Operator","And the next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","Just when you go into the mix impacts, hey, on this C2C segment that drove the two points of difference between transaction growth and revenue growth and I think you've mentioned one point pricing. Can you just explain a little more around the mix you are talking about? And then, when we think of '19 outlook, just if that's going to persist that kind of a mix impact is going to persist?","Raj Agrawal","Darrin, the mix is something that we don't really try to forecast. It's difficult to forecast. It's difficult to forecast. It really is related to where the growth is coming from. It's mostly geographic mix around the world. So what it means ultimately is that, we're getting faster growth and lower revenue per transaction corridors and that's what you're seeing coming through. It varies a little bit, this time it was minus two and it also have to do with product mix, but mostly it's a geographic mix issue that's showing up there. So it's not something that we try to forecast overall, but our revenue outlook envisions whatever might happen there.","Darrin Peller","Okay. I guess just a higher level question then. We're seeing very strong growth of the dotcom business continue and to your point accelerate, and I guess it just feels like at some point there should be an inflection where it's big enough to more than offset some of the headwinds that you've seen, whether it's on mix or it's on pricing, and potentially something that starts to align more with the volume growth across-border or even the transaction growth on cross-border you're seeing, which is higher than revenue. When did -- can you give us a little idea as to when you think that could really start to show and materialize, so that the digital side is big enough for you that it offsets other areas?","Raj Agrawal","Well, digital -- our wu.com business is, it's obviously a much larger than it was a few years ago. It was over 500 million last year, but it's still only 12% of consumer revenues. So, it's going to -- I don't know when that inflection point is -- clearly digital, we still see very strong growth opportunities. Retail, we think will be a flattish type grower, maybe low single digits. But you know, we've had negative growth in some of our other areas, which is really what's driving it down. WU is accelerated, which is good, but our bill payments businesses were negative. Generally speaking, so we need to get better overall performance there. If we could get those mid single digit type of growth and that gives us good flexibility in what we can do overall. So not just digital, digital certainly has to be there, but other components of our business also have to perform a little bit better than they have done.","Darrin Peller","Is there anything -- I am just going to leave it at this, but anything more you think that's possible to do from a restructuring standpoint? Beyond this, potentially, the B2B business we've talked about, maybe it's a sort of a domestic money transfer or anything else that can be done around a restructuring that could help the overall growth profile, the more near term manner?","Hikmet Ersek","I think yes, I mean, we\u2019re looking constantly about to structure opportunities growth areas and on the efficiency margin part. Obviously, in the retail money transfer business, as Raj described earlier, I think it's going to -- we have a good market there and it's going to get flattish, but the growth will come from digital environment. And it's only the 12% of our revenue, it's the largest by far in the digital money transfer environment and the countries we rolled out, they will come also, adding additional customers.","So I think if you're really keeps the customers on the retail side and add customers from the digital side, our C2C business is quite solid and will drive the growth. I think you have to really look at our payments parts, payments business. And on the payments parts, the volatility loss three months helped us and the B2B business, but that shouldn't pay the payments business, C2C business growing very well and we are building on that. We have to seek some the BMC and the domestic business and the SpeedPay domestic business has been a challenge, right. And that has an overall impact to our company's performance and the domestic businesses has been something we are focused enough to turn around.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","Jim Schneider","The Latin American region is one that continues to put up very good revenue growth for you. I think you talked about the U.S. outbound and the Mexico in particular. Can you maybe kind of a call out A, any other countries or geographies that really contributed to that? What initiatives you have been doing in other countries? And then B, to what extent that was held by the addition of wu.com in those quarters?","Raj Agrawal","Jim, this is Raj. The Latin America revenue growth is really the outbound growth some Latin America, it starts that you're referring to now that we've mentioned by Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, so we've had quite healthy growth in some of those other markets even though Argentina was impacted on a reporter basis by the currency devaluation there, other markets have been doing quite well in that region. So the conditions are quite good, it's a relatively small piece of our overall revenues a lot of times about 9% of total C2C revenues. So, we've seen continue good performance at least on a constant currency basis. But -- and then in terms of dotcom and certainly a focus that we have in terms of the expanding dotcom presence in Latin America, so that's really what we're focused on.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think, Jim, generally C2C business has been stable especially the cross-border. C2C business is really stable. Latin America, as Raj said, this s a smaller part of our business, but we had also a strong growth in despite besides U.S. up and also Europe. UK, Germany and France have been going very well. But we also see now good transaction growth in the Middle East. As you recall, Jim last year, we implemented some promotions there. Now, they are showing good returns. I think that's also a good sign and shows how stable our business is. So, digital growth is definitely driving the top line, but also there are very stable numbers in the retail manufacturing business.","Jim Schneider","And then maybe as a follow-up. Some of your payments peers have noted a notable slowdown in cross-border travel and while I understand most of your trends are driven by migration which are longer term things. Are you seeing anything in the business as you start Q1 that gives you a little bit of pause in terms of a potential macro slowdown and to what extent is that baked into guidance?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, macro environment is definitely challenging, but as you look at our business, we are in 200 countries, you have 20,000 corridors. So, we clearly are -- our portfolio play in our case, right. So, we though actually don't see big changes in our economical environment in the retail manufacture business. On our dotcom business even stronger as continue to happen, the strong growth and Q4 exit was very good, especially as I mentioned earlier in transaction and the principal amount which was constant currency. Principal was about 8% growth in Q4. And so, I think the environment stable. However, there are some concerns and global concerns on the economical environment.","Operator","And next we have a question from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.","James Faucette","I wanted to follow up on wu.com and as you're expanding into markets and corridors, what are you having to do from a pricing perspective to encourage and attract volumes? And how should we think about the pricing opportunity sets over time? I guess that\u2019s my first question.","Raj Agrawal","This is Raj Agrawal. When we expanded to new markets, we really look at the digital business as being new incremental revenues to us. So, we go into any new market, making sure that we priced competitively with whatever else might be available in terms of that similar service. We have a very unique service offering because the majority of our revenues payout at retail locations, even though they may be digitally initiated. So, we do try to price competitively and it doesn't really carry the legacy of the retail business. So, it's a new incremental business to us. We priced very competitively, we tried to get the business, and it's really about marketing and acquiring new customers more than anything else in terms of -- it's not really driven by the pricing. We're going to make that a competitive offering and then we just need to talk consumers about the offerings.","James Faucette","And then from a 2019 outlook, you've guided roughly 20% margins. 2018 in different parts of the year, you were a bit focused level. So could you talk to what would be the puts and takes that would allow you maybe to put back above 20% potentially in 2019?","Raj Agrawal","Yes, I mean we are comfortable with our 20% margins. It could be a little bit above, a little bit below or just depends on how things play out. If you look at the pieces, we are investing in the growth opportunities like digital life, the relationship we have with Amazon. We're also investing back in regulatory items like privacy and other areas. And then when we are in a low growth environment like we are and we have negative FX impacts, gets more challenging to get leverage on our cost structures. So, we do need to get revenue growth overall to be able to drive better margins, which is our objective. But for this year, we're comfortable with the 20% level.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Kupferberg","Just wanted to start on C2C, I know the constant currency rev growth there I think came in at 1%, a little bit below recent trend and the comp is kind of tough in Q1. And so, I just wanted to get a sense of how we should think about the near-term trajectory on C2C in constant currency terms?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I mean, we don't give outlook on a specific business units, Jason. But if you just think about the pieces, the retail business is likely to be a flattish type grower. And digital, we continue to soon as good growth opportunities there and it's going to become a bigger and bigger piece. So, I think the consumer business overall will be solid and stable. And really is about getting good growth in the other areas, but the consumer business should be relatively stable. The underlying transaction trends have been good, so we've had some variation due to pricing and mix factors, last year in the fourth quarter, but for while the underlying metrics have been solid.","Jason Kupferberg","And then just in terms of sensitivity in 2019 guidance, I mean, if we just think about some of the macro uncertainties out there. Hypothetically, if there was to be, let's say, a hard Brexit. Is that -- would that be a material issue for Western Union as there been any risk adjustment in the 2019 forecast for that scenario? I mean it just seems like to do some size remittance market overall, so wanted to get your perspective?","Raj Agrawal","Yes, from an operational standpoint, we're very well positioned, we were ready to operate under a number of different scenarios, and you can't predict exactly what the outcome will be. Economically, I don't know exactly what you expect, but I would say overall for Europe, we assumed slightly software environment. But from an operational standpoint, we're ready to go regardless of what scenario plays out.","Hikmet Ersek","Again, we believe that we are prepared. We've been working on that. I think operational replacement and customer wise, we don't see any issues in here. And just from the risk side, I mean, as I mentioned earlier, none of our countries are bigger than 7% of our revenue outside of the U.S. So, we operate in 20,000 corridors and I believe that we are very well positioned to despite the economic challenges. Globally, we are well positioned to respond and we believe we can have a stable 2019.","Operator","The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","I guess my question is on operating margin. Raj, you mentioned lower bad debt. Is this some action you've taken maybe big data analytics type of stuff? What's feeding to this -- can you comment?","Raj Agrawal","No, I would say, Ashwin, that's really a one-off item we have and that's a special item I would say that helps us from the bad debt side. But overall, from a bad debt standpoint, we do pretty good job of managing -- some of it is currently using data analytics. But generally, we manage the risk in our business quite well. And most of our business is on a good firm's model. So, there's not really too much that we have to deal with there, so I think we're in good shape.","Hikmet Ersek","The bad debt was primarily high bad debt expense in the prior year quarter, so the comparisons were just favorable.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","And then the other question with regards to the cross-border principal growth. I was just kind of wanted to delve a little bit deeper into that. What's driving that? Is it sustainable? Is it specific deals, channels? Is it any -- is it reflective of any integration related concerns people send back money to their home countries? Any anything detail on that?","Hikmet Ersek","I think on general, overall business, we had a good U.S. to Mexico business doing well. I would say that our principal amount in Middle East turning around, as I mentioned earlier, the transactions growth has been good. So it impacts the principal amount also. And European business has been stable also. As you know, we have some issues in the U.S. domestic manufacturers business, but that's not the cause for the principal. And generally, the cause for principal has been a good environment and the market growth has been healthy and I think the people are using cross-border transfer and thank God they're using Western Union and going to continue to use Western Union.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","That sounds like deal mix then?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes.","Operator","And our next question is from Jennifer Dugan with SunTrust.","Jennifer Dugan","I'm on for Andrew Jaffrey. Looking at the B2B and other revenue growth, both appeared very healthy but the margins in both were a bit weaker. Can you just go into some of the dynamics there?","Raj Agrawal","In the B2B business, you're looking at the third quarter comparison and margins, third quarter to fourth quarter, first. In the B2B business, we just benefited in the third quarter from timing and expenses. So, that was really just related to timing. I would say the overall margin for the full year were around 6% for the B2B business or EBITDA margins close to 17%, which is more representative of the overall margins there. And then, in the other revenues or other area of our business, we did have lower overall revenues in that business, but we also had other corporate expenses because certain corporate expenses that are for strategy or M&A costs fall into the other part of our business reduced. That's where we record them so that impacted the margins as well.","Jennifer Dugan","And then, one other thing I wanted to talk a little bit more, I know you've mentioned some of the tech investments, around digital, and some of these opportunities with Amazon in addition to some of the regulatory expenses. But looking more at the tech investments, what is the timeline for some of these investments, timeline to getting them done and then the return timeline?","Raj Agrawal","So, the digital investments will be ongoing. Our strategy there is really to drive growth and expansion all over the world. So we're going to it's a continual effort to improve the features and functionality in our platforms. We're launching new sites all the time. And so, you know, that investment will continue for the digital expansion. We're also leveraging our platform for new opportunities like the Amazon relationship. So there's some spending that goes with that. So, we continue to invest in the technology area and that's really to drive long term growth and expansion and so that's really our strategy.","Hikmet Ersek","I think from also -- if you are already in a country like, U.S. or Europe, it\u2019s a digital which we invested already, it's wining new customers, expanding in the marketing wise, really making commercial on the digital. And if you launch in new country, there were we do investments, and as Raj mentioned the earlier, we want to be in 200 countries like we are in our retail money transfer business. We want to be also with our digital business in 200 countries and we are expanding that. That's one of our biggest competitive advantage is connecting 200 countries with 200 countries and using our payout network and retails with 560,000 locations but also buildings of accounts. We can drop money really monetarily very fast in accounts directly on more than 100 countries. So that investment is going and you could see in the numbers, the growth numbers are coming from digital investments.","Operator","The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Ben on for Ramsey. I\u2019ve had a question on the U.S. outbound, you\u2019ve mentioned that it had grown quite nicely and then accelerated over the course of the year. And I guess, I'm just sort of wondering, what's going right? Is it more digital revenues is kind of taking more if you're going to piece of the whole or taking share or can you kind of parse that out a little bit for us?","Raj Agrawal","Yes, it\u2019s a number of things that are going well there. There's some pricing and mixed impacting the revenues overall, but the transactions growth has been accelerating. Dotcom, U.S. outbound and their digital business has been going very strong. And U.S. to Mexico was also very strong. And, that was be offset by some other things but those series have been very strong. And our price positioning for U.S. outbound is very competitive to your other offerings. And so, I would say it's a combination of those three things to cross-border wise, U.S. outbound to other countries has been doing quite well for us. And there is some impacts of revenue from mix in pricing, but otherwise, the transaction terms and principal terms have been healthy.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just on the tax rate, you had mentioned that you expected to come down a little bit in 2020. Can you give us any sense of like, the timing over the course of 2019 will there be some like a step down quarter-by-quarter? Or will it be a little more unpredictable and any color you can give there will be great?","Raj Agrawal","Yes, we're very pleased with the solution that we're putting in place for the BEAT issue that came about as part of U.S. tax reform. It was really causing unwarranted double or triple taxation on a portion of our U.S. outbound business. So, we are implementing a solution, it's going to be implemented during the course of this year. I don't have a quarterly tax rate to give you. But certainly, it's going to be implemented during the course of this year. And next year, we see our tax rate falling back down to the mid teens level for really to foreseeable future given the current tax environment that we're in. So, we're very pleased with that outcome.","Operator","And the next question comes from Vasundhara Govil of KBW.","Vasundhara Govil","I guess my first question was on the free cash flow guidance. I guess you guys are guiding to slightly better free cash flow even though revenues are expected to be flattish and margin stable. So what's driving that better conversion?","Raj Agrawal","Our operating cash flow versus for about $1 billion in 2019, and last year in 2018, we had $200 million of special type items that we paid for, and that's why the operating cash flow last year was just over $800 million. So, that's the primary difference overall in the operating cash flow.","Vasundhara Govil","And then in terms of the EPS outlook, what are you guys including in terms of contribution from share buybacks? And more broadly could you talk a little bit about your appetite for M&A and how it fits into your capital allocation authorities? Are you looking at deals actively and if so what types of targets are you'll be, would you be interested in?","Raj Agrawal","We don't give a specific amount for share buyback or the impact to EPS. But if you look at the last years, we've been buying between $400 million and $500 million of stock each year. Basically, we've been returning 100% of our freight free cash flow back to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends. And so, I expect that we're going to be active again in 2019, and then in terms of M&A strategy where we're always looking for the right kind of acquisition that fits within our cross-border payments strategy. We would love to do that kind of digital type of acquisition, but it has to be at the right price. And it has to really -- whatever we really do it has to advance the ball for us. We have a great platform. We have great capabilities. So whatever we do, it has to really give us some additional capabilities that strategically within our strategy.","Operator","Next, we have a question from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.","Tim Willi","I had a couple questions on digital and then one on Amazon. But in terms of thinking about digital and the impact around the margin discussion, if I do the math correctly right now it appears that the digital channel is effectively driving all of the revenue growth in C2C. Would that be correct, if we just think about this contribution and its revenue growth rate, the digital sort of this all growing channel for C2C while sort of the traditional business, if you could sort of call it flattish or slightly down. Is that correct first of all?","Raj Agrawal","Yes, digital is going to be the key growth driver not only for us when we lead in the market, long-term.","Tim Willi","So if you think about like in a 12%, I know that there's always lots of moving pieces around margins and scale and investing and expanding that franchise, but is there a way to think just conceptually that by the time digital is at a 20% or 25% of revenue for that C2C. Is that sort of way to think about the inflection point about letting the scale and the growth of digital and that what should be inherently pretty attractive margin start to show through? I know you\u2019ve always said it's profitable just not at the same sort of levels, the rest of the business. But I think you've always sort of said at some point it should be a higher margin business, if any updates on that thought process over the next several years?","Raj Agrawal","Yes, I mean -- it's a great question. We're in heavy investment mode in that business. If you separate the marketing and technology, which is a much heavier concentration than the rest of our business we're spending in marketing technology for the long-term growth of this business. And so, you know, today the margins are lower than the rest of the Company and that continues to be the goal until we get broad expansion all around the world with digital. But when you look at the contribution margin on a percentage basis, and I think we've mentioned this before, the incremental margins are actually similar in both the retail and the digital business, right?","It depends on how much money you're sending and the corridor that's involved. But the profitability of a transaction in from a percentage basis is actually quite similar to our retail business. So it can be a very profitable business you can drive the profitability up overnight if we wanted to, but that's not really the strategy we have is really continue to grow our business to 200 countries and territories. And then at some point it will be a better contributor to our overall profitability. And especially as we have more account channels, you know, accounts two accounts capabilities that we're building there that will also help the overall margin profile.","Tim Willi","Yes, it makes sense I totally understand. It sort of curious, if there's a way we could sort of think about a mile marker that, okay or that\u2019s a billion dollars of revenue, we should really start thinking about digital having a positive upward impact on margins. But I can understand, there's a lot of to go on between point A to point B, when you get there. My follow was just sort of on Amazon. I think over the years, you know, again you guys struck partnerships and tried to leverage this vast network your brand and your competencies around cross-border and risk management, some with mixed results, some have announced and I don't think necessarily there's been a ton of follow through I guess we point to over the year, but obviously Amazon is Amazon. So I guess I'm just sort of curious when you think about this partnership relative to other agreements that had been struck over the many years, how you feel or how this evolution maybe different than this potentially could be something where, hey, this actually has really or had an impact it really leverage the brand of the network of Western Union better than other kinds?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think, we are very excited about the opportunity with the largest global online marketplace, right. I mean, and I think Amazon wants to get to the customer segments and really offered their products to the new customer segments and they have the product and using our platform. Our platform is uniquely invested over the years and we are very proud of our platform. Not many companies have licenses, so operating 200 countries and we do have it not many companies can settle in 137 currencies, acting 130 currencies we have it. And that's technology that regulator environment puts us in a unique position to offer our platform to Amazon. Now it's a new product as you know, it's nobody did that earlier. We are the first doing this, and partnership with them. We are testing it. It's very promising. It a $600 billion market for online shopping. And I think that millions of customers don't have an excess on that. And we hope that our platform will help Amazon so for their products to new customer segments.","Operator","Okay, the final question will come from Bob Napoli of William Blair.","Bob Napoli","First question just on the domestic money transfer business. And I know that's been a challenge. How big is that business now? And how much is it declining? And do you expect that to continue to decline over the next few years?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think as you know, Bob, hello, how are you Bob? That's a quite challenging business because there's a domestic money transfer business, there's some pricing pressure. And but there are some loyal customers still using that because they want immediate cash at our senior locations payout and there are customers are loyal and saying, it is about 8% of our C2C business and it's a declining business. And but there are some loyal customers who use that sending money online for instance paying immediately in cash. It's quite attractive for many customers.","Raj Agrawal","Bob, we not disclose the groceries on that but it was about 9% of C2C revenues in 2017. So it's down from 9% to 8%.","Bob Napoli","Then Western Union is invested in the education vertical, I think in payments and you talked about payments, Hikmet, being the healthy business for you. Can you give an update on the education vertical and what the opportunities are in that business? And I think there's some good competitors out there as well.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, there are some competitors out there definitely, but it's a great business for us. We acquire globally universities and universities are attracting more and more foreign students. Foreign students, if I was going through that, in Spain for instance, there are about 200,000 Chinese students studying in Spain. Along that number puts things in prospect, there are millions of millions of students going abroad and studying, and they want to pay their tuition, local currency and study abroad in their universities. And we enable that.","Now, we are a few countries with our student pay, with mostly in Anglo-Saxon countries. But also we're expanding our university acquisition constantly to offer the product to the new segment. I'm particularly excited about future of Western Union. Once we build this C2B abilities, we could do that also besides the university also to other verticals. I think that gives us a unique position to do the cross-border payments for many needs of many customers because we can handle 137 currencies.","Bob Napoli","Can you give us any feel for the size and growth rate of that business?","Hikmet Ersek","We don\u2019t particularly break that business, but the main growth on the B2B, this quarter, we had good also trading business but main growth of the B2B comes from the payments part of the business. And it's something that we're very excited.","Raj Agrawal","Yes, just within B2B it's about half of the business comes from refer to those payments and half of it comes from the basic FX services. Education vertical is one of the businesses within payment. So, we don\u2019t disclose specific size.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael A. Salop","Thank you, Lauren. Good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's fourth quarter results and 2014 outlook, and then we will take your questions.","The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found on westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations tab, and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.","Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2012 Form 10-K, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We have reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section.","All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of the Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.","I would now like turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, our 2013 results were consistent with our expectations entering the year, and we made good progress executing the key strategic initiatives we began in late 2012.","As you recall, our plan included making pricing and other strategic investments and undertaking cost initiatives to better position our business for the future. We also continued increasing our compliance investments, including hiring a new Chief Compliance Officer and other senior compliance leaders last year to better navigate the evolving and complex global environment.","From a financial perspective, we were able to deliver earnings per share of $1.43, which was at the higher end of our outlook range entering the year. Our key strategies in 2013 were: Focus on strengthening our consumer money transfer business and our business-to-business foundation, while at the same time, continuing to generate and deploy strong cash flow for our shareholders.","We believe we made good progress in each of these areas. In Consumer Money transfer, our pricing investments delivered the transaction growth we expected, and we further advanced our capabilities in electronic channels. The pricing and other strategic actions were initiated in Consumer Money Transfer were intended to increase consumer usage, driven by better value propositions and more choice of channel options.","Our transaction growth trends at the end of 2013 represented strong improvements from the beginning of the year and this gives us good momentum heading into 2014.","In the fourth quarter, Consumer Money Transfer transactions grew 9%. Transactions increased 20% in the quarter in corridors where pricing had been implemented, or 15%, excluding westernunion.com.","The turnaround in Mexico continued. As we benefited from pricing investment, bigger growth and capturing more of the business previously moving through banks. Mexico delivered 20% transaction growth in the quarter, far outperforming the market data, as reported by Banco de Mexico.","Electronic channels revenue, which includes westernunion.com, account-based money transfer and mobile, increased 32% in the quarter. The westernunion.com C2C revenue growth rate accelerated to 34% on 64% transaction growth, while the revenue from account-based money transfer through banks increased 33% on transaction growth of 63%.","During the year, we introduced improved platforms on more direct-to-bank capabilities for westernunion.com. We now have Western Union branded transaction sites in 24 countries, from which consumers can send to 200 countries and territories around the world.","In Business Solutions, we achieved 8% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, or 12% constant currency. For the full year, revenue increased 7%, or 9% in constant exchange rates, with sequential improvement during the year. We feel we are exiting the year with good momentum in business solutions and a strong sales-oriented team on the grounds to drive growth going forward.","Our third key focus area in 2013 was to generate and deploy strong cash flow. Despite being an investment year, we generated over $1 billion of cash flow from operations and returned over $670 million to shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases.","Now turning to 2014. We plan to continue to focus on the same key strategic areas: Strengthening consumer money transfer with an emphasis on digital; driving accelerated growth in Business Solutions; and generating and deploying strong cash flow for our shareholders.","In Consumer Money Transfer, we want to drive profitable growth through expanding electronic based channels, optimizing the performance of our distribution network and strengthening customer relationships, while also continuing to enhance compliance capabilities.","We expect westernunion.com's C2C revenue growth to accelerate from last year's 24% rate, as we enhance our capabilities around products, pay in and pay out choices and risk management, to bring new customers and increased conversion rates.","We will also look to open new market, as well as add more online banking relationships for account-based money transfer. We continue to see primarily new customers online, with over 80% of new westernunion.com customer having not used our brand in the previous 12 months.","Our distribution network, digital offerings, global brand and compliance infrastructure, position us well to connect the cash and digital worlds of our consumers, and we will continue to leverage our capabilities in the fast-growing digital segment of the money transfer market.","We have an industry-leading network, with over 500,000 agent locations and over 100,000 ATMs that offer our money transfer services. We plan to add new retail locations and more account-based options in 2014, as they remain white space opportunities especially on the receive site and attractive parts of trade around the world. We are, however, also very focused on network productivity.","We want to ensure our network is well aligned with changes in consumer movements and preferences. Also, as increased compliance requirements raise the cost of maintaining and monitoring locations, we want to add locations more selectively and prune dormant and nonprofitable ones where appropriate.","In Business Solutions, we have worked through the challenges associated with the Travelex integration. And now we have the right foundation in place to accelerate growth moving forward. We are focused on sales effectiveness and new product development with an emphasis on increasing penetration in existing large markets. We will continue to differentiate ourselves by tailoring product solutions for specific customer markets and channels, including strong offerings for universities, financial institutions and non-profit organizations. We expect Business Solutions revenue to increase in the low double-digits in 2014. And we continue to believe this is a great long-term growth opportunity, driven by global trade and increased penetration.","We also plan to continue to generate and deploy strong cash flow for our shareholders, while also seeking to maintain our investment grade credit rating. I'm very pleased that we have a new $500 million share repurchase authorization, and we expect to have a strong returns of funds to shareholders once again in 2014, through both our dividends, which is currently at $0.50 per share annually, and stock buyback.","Our financial outlook for 2014 is in line with what we communicated in October. We expect low mid-single digit constant revenue growth. Profits will be impacted by increases in compliance spending and changes in procedures, as we discussed last year. Our compliance and project management teams have been working diligently over the last few months to prioritize requirements, analyze technology solutions, assess execution plans and redefine budgets.","After our assessments, we believe compliance costs will total approximately 3.5% to 4% of revenue in 2014. We are taking other steps to optimize our overall cost structure. Therefore, we had additional expenses related to these initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2013.","In 2013, our business trends improved throughout the year, as we continued our journey to restore growth momentum. As we look forward for the next few years, we believe we are in a strong position. Cross-border money transfer and business payments, fueled by global trade, are growing markets. And Western Union has great assets to help drive good, profitable growth over the long run.","With our omni-channel strategy, we are very well-positioned to respond to the different needs of our global customers in 200 countries and territories. In 2014, we will remain focused on consumer money transfer, with an emphasis on digital development and business-to-business cross-border payments, while still targeting strong annual cash flow generation and deployment.","Before turning the call over to Raj Agrawal, our Interim CFO, to give more detail on the fourth quarter results and 2014 outlook, I will like to take a moment and thank our outgoing CFO, Scott Scheirman. Scott has been a tremendous asset for me and the company for many years, and has left a strong financial foundation in place for us to build from. I know many of you, like me, appreciate Scott's leadership and integrity, and we want to wish him all the best.","Raj Agrawal stepped into the Interim CFO role on January 1, after serving most recently as President of Western Union Business Solutions based in London. Raj has a strong financial and business background. He originally joined Western Union in 2006 as a treasurer and has held a variety of other financial roles with the company, including being my financial partner when I ran the Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia regions. So Raj, welcome, and I give the call to you now.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Thank you, Hikmet, and I'm pleased to join you today. As I review the 2013 financial results, I will primarily focus on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules.","Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $1.4 billion was flat compared to the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 1% in the quarter. Electronic channels and Business Solutions each delivered strong growth, but these increases were largely offset by the impact of the previously implemented pricing investments in C2C.","In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue declined 1% and was flat on a constant currency basis. Our pricing actions are yielding strong results, as total transactions grew 9% in the quarter. Transactions increased 20% in the quarters where we implemented pricing actions, or 15%, excluding westernunion.com. In the non-priced corridors, total transactions increased 5%. C2C cross-border principal increased 8% in the quarter, with no impact in currency, while principal per transaction declined 2%.","The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was 10 percentage points, including a negative 1% impact from currency. For C2C, the impact of net price decreases was approximately 6% in the quarter, while mix had a negative impact of approximately 3%.","Turning to the regions. All of the regions delivered good transaction growth rates in the fourth quarter. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue decreased 2% year-over-year, including a positive 1% impact from currency. Transactions in the region increased 7%, driven by continued growth in key markets, such as Germany, Italy, France and the U.K.","North America revenue declined 2% in the quarter, while transactions increased 6%. As Hikmet mentioned, we delivered strong growth in Mexico, where we continue to grow faster than the market. Our Mexico transactions increased 20%, compared to 15% in the third quarter, while Mexico revenue was flat in the quarter. In the U.S., domestic money transfer revenue was flat on transaction growth of 5%, as growth in lower principal bands was offset by declines in higher principal transactions.","Revenue in the Middle East Africa region was flat compared with the year ago quarter with no impact from currency, while transactions grew 8%. Asia Pacific region revenue declined 2%, including a negative 2% impact from currency translation. Transaction growth in the region improved to 11%, driven by strong growth in the Philippines and India.","The Latin America and Caribbean region revenue was down 4% from the prior year period, including a negative 8% impact from currency, while transactions increased 6%.","In our Digital business, westernunion.com continued to report strong results in the quarter, with money transfer transaction growth of 64% and a revenue increase of 34% in the quarter. U.S. originated online transactions increased 61%. Total electronic channels revenue, which includes westernunion.com, account-based money transfer through banks and mobile increased 32% in the quarter, and represented 5% of total company revenue. Revenues from account-based money transfer banks through banks increased 33%, and we now have over 75 banks active with account-based service.","In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 2% in the quarter, but increased 5% in constant currency terms. The U.S. electronic and the South America business continue to grow, partially offset by decline in the U.S. cash walk-in business.","Business Solutions revenue accelerated 12% on a constant currency basis, or 8% reported. Strong performance in Canada and the U.K. and increased revenue from customer hedging activities contributed to the growth.","Turning to consolidated margins. The fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 16.8%, compared to 20.1% in the prior year period. The margin decline was primarily the result of the impact of pricing and other strategic investments, higher compliance expense and lower compensation expense in the prior year period, partially offset by lower marketing expense.","In the fourth quarter, we incurred some additional cost savings expenses to drive future efficiencies. These initiatives included streamlining of our regional structures and integration of many of our new product initiatives into existing business units, as well as further optimization of our shared services support groups.","Overall, for 2013, we incurred $57 million of expense on cost savings initiatives, including $33 million in the fourth quarter. We expect these initiatives to drive an incremental $45 million of cost savings in 2014. EBITDA margin was 21.3% in the quarter, compared to 24.4% a year ago.","Our fourth quarter tax rate of 10.1% benefited from non-recurring items, and we would expect that 15% level from the first 9 months of the year to be more indicative of our ongoing rate. Reported earnings per share in the quarter was $0.31, compared to $0.40 in the prior year period. The C2C operating segment margin was 20.5%, compared to 25% in the prior year period, with the decline primarily driven by the same factors as overall company margins.","The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 15.6%, compared to 17% in the prior year period. The margin decline was primarily due to higher IT expense, bank fees driven by mix, and the pass-through to billers of Durbin-related debit card savings, which were partially offset by costs in the prior year quarter related to the renegotiation of a third-party distribution agreement.","Business Solutions reported an operating loss of $11 million for the quarter, compared with a loss of $18 million for the same period last year. The reduction in operating loss was driven by lower Travelex integration expenses and strong revenue growth, with partial offsets from expenses related to cost savings initiatives.","The fourth quarter's $11 million loss included $13 million of depreciation and amortization and $5 million of Travelex integration expense. In the fourth quarter of last year, depreciation and amortization was $18 million, while integration expense was $12 million.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. We generated cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion for the full year. Capital expenditures were $75 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, capital spending was approximately 4% of revenues, which was in line with our outlook.","At the end of the year, the company had debt of $4.2 billion and cash of $2.1 billion. Approximately 50% of the cash was held by United States entities. As a reminder, we have $500 million of maturing debt that we plan to pay out when due later this month.","During the fourth quarter, we issued $250 million of 5.5 year notes at a coupon of 3.4%. In the quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock at an average price of $16.79, totaling $59 million. In addition, we paid $69 million in dividends. At year-end, we have 549 million shares outstanding.","Now before discussing the 2014 outlook, I want to give you a brief update on our Southwest Border agreement with the state of Arizona, regarding our anti-money laundering compliance programs. Last week, we filed an 8-K announcing an extension of the agreements through the end of 2017.","We've been negotiating with the state for this extension, which gives us additional time to implement the many recommendations from the monitor and defines remedies for noncompliance. We believe we will be able to complete these requirements prior to the end of the extended term, and are pleased to have a defined process and final timeline now agreed.","The extension is not a driver of the increase in compliance cost in 2014, as we have already been spending on the Southwest Border projects the last several years. And we accrued many of the expenses related to the extension in 2013.","Turning to our outlook for 2014, our expectations are largely consistent with what we disclosed last October. Overall, we expect low to mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth, driven by Digital, Business Solutions and Consumer Bill Payments, with some offset in C2C from the effective compliance procedure changes in various markets.","Gas revenue is expected to be in the range of flat to low single-digit growth, as we anticipate negative currency impacts from the emerging market devaluations. Most of the emerging market economies are receive markets for Western Union, so there's not a significant currency exposure. However, markets like Argentina and Venezuela are primarily outbound send markets, so we are anticipating impact from devaluations. We have both Consumer Money Transfer and Bill Payments businesses in Argentina, which together represent around 4% of our company revenues. The currency has already devalued and economists are projecting further declines throughout the year, which is factored into our outlook. We expect the company's operating margins to be between 19% and 20%, which comprises -- which compares to 20% from 2013.","Profit margin should benefit in 2014 from lower integration and cost initiative expenses and higher related savings. However, we anticipate these benefits will largely be offset by higher compliance costs, higher commission rates in retail C2C and further investments in digital and business solutions. We expect compliance-related expense to total approximately 3.5% to 4% of revenue in 2014. The compliance expense forecast is projected to be composed of approximately 50% people cost, with the remainder primarily split between technology and outside services.","We anticipate our compliance-related personnel to increase to approximately 2,000 people by early 2015. Although it is still very early to project precise longer-term compliance costs and the environment can always change, our objective is for compliance, as a percentage of revenue, in 2015 to be a similar range in 2014.","The expected increase in retail C2C commission rates in 2014 is being driven primarily by the renewals of some key strategic agents, as well as some new signings. We are still targeting lower distribution costs longer-term. We're both being on new agents and increasing the westernunion.com and account receipts portions of our business. We expect our tax rate in 2014 to be around 15%. Putting all this together, we project earnings per share for 2014 to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50.","The outlook for 2014 cash flow from operating activities is approximately $900 million, or $1 billion, excluding anticipated final tax payments related to our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service from 2011. The final $100 million of payments related to this agreement was previously projected to be paid last year, but we now expect this to occur during late 2014 or in 2015.","The new $500 million repurchase authorization is in effect through mid-2015. We have identified working capital programs, which we believe will give us access to additional available cash this year, and we look to execute a majority of the authorization in 2014, depending on market conditions and other factors. So to summarize, although growth rates and profits are projected to be tempered by compliance changes and some negative currency movements, we do expect to return to solid constant currency revenue growth in 2014. Cash flow should remain healthy and we plan to continue with strong returns of funds to shareholders through dividends and buyback.","So that is our current outlook for 2014. And operator, we are now ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the new compliance procedures. I guess, what's been the impact so far in the fourth quarter? Did you see an impact on transaction growth? And then, secondly, in the guidance. It sounds like you're expecting some type of impact on transaction growth. Just trying to figure out if that's 2 points, 4 points or how much of transaction growth are you expecting to be impacted by the increase in compliance costs?","Hikmet Ersek","We do see some impact on the compliance pressure, especially in the higher bands, Bryan. It does do impact our revenues. And we did a forecast also for 2014, some impact here. And in that impact, we believe it's mainly the higher bands and also, the transactions will be not -- the transaction number will be okay, I believe, but the revenue number will have some impact on the higher bands. And in our outlook, we did put that in and calculate in our procedures.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, Bryan, let me just add to what Hikmet said. We do expect to see some negative impact on our revenue in 2014 from compliance procedures. And those are primarily impacts to our high principal transactions, high frequency senders and receivers, and sometimes, high-risk corridors. But we've factored in, into our outlook a negative, a 1 to 2 point negative impact in revenue for the year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, now that's helpful. And then I might have missed it, but what are you guys expecting for pricing in 2014?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, it's again, it's also in our outlook. Generally, we don't assume that we're going to have a pricing, but we did it in last -- end of 2012 and beginning of 2013. So we believe that we're going to have the -- we don't see a big competitive reaction on our pricing. Our price corridors are working very well. And I believe that we have good momentum and gaining in main corridors, some main market share gain.","Michael A. Salop","Yes, so Bryan, we're trying to get away from giving pricing guidance so we can react however we need to, as we go through the year and just really try to drive revenue growth. But the pricing assumption is certainly a lot lower than what we did last year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So that's -- the pricing impact will be less, I guess, and probably more to the typical range, I guess, of where we went previously?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes.","Michael A. Salop","Yes, we still have to anniversary, the first half of the year, the pricings that we did last year, still see that in the numbers. But the pricing actions will be much lower than last year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then just last question for me. We've been hearing some banks have been getting out of the remittance business due to some of these higher compliance costs. Just curious if you've seen any impact from that, or if you've heard of that so far?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, Bryan, we do see it. Some of the banks even are calling us and given the compliance environment, want to partner with us. I mean, one of the things we definitely see is that a part of our growth in Mexico corridor is that some banks are getting out of this business. And obviously, enhancing our compliance activities does help getting this revenue for us, because we do invest in the compliance, and that helps. But generally, don't forget that 75% of our network is international banks and financial institutions, and we do have a good relationship with them.","Operator","And the next question will come from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A lot of good detail here. Just, I guess, on the margin side. Just wanted to clarify. So it sounds like the compliance expenses, you're trimming the investment by 50 bps on the high end. Is that right? And then also, the $45 million in savings that you're talking about from some of the restructuring, how much of that is incremental savings versus 2013? Just trying to clear those 2 things up on margin first.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Tien-tsin, this is Raj. You're right, the compliance spend is 3.5% to 4%. So that is our expectation for the year. And then the -- the $45 million of savings is incremental to what we achieved in 2013. So that's an incremental savings in 2014.","Michael A. Salop","So Tien-tsin, you'll recall, last year, we were expecting an incremental $15 million of savings in 2014. We took some additional actions in the fourth quarter, and that impacted our fourth quarter margin. But we're driving additional savings on top of that 15. So the $45 million is incremental.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, great. So $45 million is purely incremental, so that is new. So that's great. And then just, I guess, glad to hear the step-up in the buybacks through the working capital. I mean, is it -- should we assume that you could also take on some additional debt to hit that $500 million bogey? Are there some other options that you might want to consider as well? Or is it all coming from the working capital?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Tien-tsin, it'll primarily be coming from the working capital initiative. That's really just managing our intercompany payment flows more effectively, more efficiently. And I expect that we'll have more opportunities, longer-term in that area as well. Certainly, as the business grows, it will create more debt capacity as well. And we have, obviously, a lot of different funding needs in the business, not just share repurchase, but -- and so we're looking at all different options, and use the best vehicle available to us.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, great. Glad to hear it. Last one, I promise. Just the growth in C2C transactions, where you did not adjust price, did I hear correctly, 5%? I think it was 6% the prior quarter, just trying to gauge how that came in versus your internal plan?","Hikmet Ersek","It was 5%. Yes, Tien-tsin.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, 5%. How does that compare versus plan, Hikmet?","Hikmet Ersek","I think we are very -- we have a good momentum. And that's why we -- I feel comfortable with the transactions growth. And especially, also -- even the non-priced corridors, we are very well-positioned. As you know, this business, Tien-tsin, it's corridor by corridor. And we do see a good growth corridor by corridor and in the major markets. So I am -- that's why it fit the growth rates.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, Tien-tsin, the growth was also 5% last quarter, and it accelerated throughout the course of the year. So we're happy with where that's at.","Operator","The next question is from George Mihalos of Credit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just looking at the compliance costs for 2014, the 3.5% to 4.5%. Is any portion of that onetime in nature? And then, I just want to confirm that I heard correctly that you're expecting a similar percentage of revenue expense going into 2015. Is that correct?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, you heard it, except one part. We said 3.5% to 4%. As you recall, we were giving an assumption in the last quarter, it was 3.5% to 4.5%. But the team did a great job and looked at the procedures, looked at the technology, looked at the processes. We have a dedicated team, worked with our Chief Compliance Officer. And I think it's about -- we project from today points of view, about 3.5% to 4% on compliance expenses of the revenue, '14 revenue. And the second part of the question was?","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just -- is there a portion of that, that is onetime in nature, versus it being in the run rate going forward permanently?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","George, this is Raj. Certainly, we expect that we'll finish some activities this year. But we also expect that there'll be new things that we need to do as we move forward into 2015 and into more geographies. So we believe that 3.5% to 4% is a good range for this year, and it's also good range from where we stand today, for next year.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on the transaction and revenue growth trends. Overall, nice acceleration across most of the business. Just the Middle East and Africa seemed to slow a bit from the prior quarter. Anything to call out there or...","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Not really, George. We're starting to anniversary some of the price decreases that we had, so we're starting to see the impact of that, but nothing in particular there.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just, last question. I don't think I saw the agent count, as of the end of the year.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, it's more than 500,000. We just -- we gave, as I said, before we have more have more than 500,000 agent locations and 100,000 ATMs. I don't think we gave the agent count.","Michael A. Salop","Not in the quarter, I think, as Hikmet said during the call, we are going through a process now where we're pruning some of the dormant locations and as compliant, there's more compliance costs around having dormant locations now. So we're looking at that. So there's going to be some ups and downs. But -- so we're reporting more rounded figures. But were over 500,000 at the end of the year.","Operator","And the next question will come from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","So it looks like, if I have it right, the incremental cost actions cost about $0.04, $0.05 in Q4. Is that the right way to think about it?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, it's...","Michael A. Salop","Yes, we had about $33 million of kind of non-recurring expenses related to the cost savings initiatives in Q4.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Great. And then just so I'm clear, that -- is it $45 million incremental, on top of the $15 million? Or the $15 million becomes $45 million for the cost savings in 2014?","Michael A. Salop","Yes, the $15 million becomes $45 million.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Great, great. And then just real quick. As you think about kind of the business impact, the compliance costs, the 3.5% to 4%, longer term, Hikmet, as you think about kind of more incremental capacity coming to market just as more competitors kind of exit, you're starting to see Mexico, is that something you kind of expect to accelerate, as we work our way through the year?","Hikmet Ersek","It's hard to say. But I can generally say that some parts in Mexico, we saw some impact to our, positive impact our transactions. But generally, I would not, from today points of view, I would not -- build a model on that and saying that our revenue was increased. My expectation is that competition will also invest here on the compliance environment and the people who can't do that, maybe they exit. We, will see some, in some markets, they can't afford it, maybe we can get the revenue here. But generally, I would say that we are very much focused on our compliance activities. We are the industry leader. We are focused on that. We are driving it, and we will like to set up. And I believe it's long term. Long term, I believe, yes, it's a competitive advantage, Kevin.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Great. And then, I apologize, last question. Is the buyback factored into the guidance? Or will that be incremental upside, as we think about the buyback we announced today?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, Kevin, the buyback is factored into the $1.40 to $1.50 range that we gave.","Operator","And the next question is from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Hikmet, have you seen some of the regional and smaller companies having to deal with some of the compliance issues that you and -- that you're dealing with, or do you anticipate that this will become a little bit more prevalent throughout the industry?","Hikmet Ersek","I think that -- I can't speak, as I said, for the name of the competition that -- But, believe me, the regulatory environment is very -- changing very fast, evolving. And we are on, I believe, as the industry leader, we are setting here best practices. We are driving it. We have a great compliance officer. We had -- he hired very great people. We do invest our CIO. David Thompson is very focused on the, also on the technology, how we can activate the technology to be more effective on the compliance, making -- the most focus is on the know your agent and know your customer. And so there's some diligence activities. And I believe, we gave -- we were anticipating that in Q3, we told you and we looked at that. And now we are investing, we are -- we signed an agreement with Southwest Border. I am very pleased that has been -- we were -- we had a budget that cost for longer time because we were working with them longer time. So I would say, generally, it's a tough environment. But we, as the industry leader, I believe that we are on top of the things.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then, Raj, I think you said anticipate higher commission rates. Is that just a result of more competition trying to sign agents? Or is that a result of, maybe some of your other agents becoming more mature, so they're moving to different tiers? I guess, what's causing that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Kartik, we do expect some increase in retail commissions this year. That's from recent signings and renewals that we did. We have a long history of being very successful in signing agents. And I think we've been quite successful there. The competitive environment is more difficult in some markets. But in other markets, we've been quite successful. So I don't see that being a long-term trend. I do believe that we have opportunities to take our commissions down, as we add more agents of the mix, and as we actually change our business mix over time with the Digital business, so.","Hikmet Ersek","So, Raj, just as a reminder, Kartik, maybe -- sorry, I interrupted you. The top 40 agents, sent agents, top 40 sent agents has been 18 years exclusive with us and --","Rajesh K. Agrawal","18 years, yes.","Hikmet Ersek","I don't see, Kartik, big changes, it happens year-over-year. But long term, as you recall, Kartik, the commission rates has been going down. I believe that, as we said in '13 already, '14, will have some impact on the commission rates. But also, the other thing will help us is the strong growing electronic channels, dot-com. You don't have the send side agent commission here. I believe also that electronics, westernunion.com, electronic channels long-term will have similar margins, like the company margins. We are investing there now to grow that. We are very pleased with the growth. So I believe that will help our commission rates also, long term.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last one. Raj, so there any opportunity is take additional cost out in 2014 to help offset some of the compliance costs that you'll incur in 2015?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Kartik, we're going to keep looking at our cost structure and look for opportunities to take more costs out. It's not something specific that we're going to call out, because it'll be part of our normal operations. But rest assured that we're continuing to evaluate our cost structure.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, we have a team that is looking hard on our cost structure. So Kartik, we are very focused on that.","Operator","And the next question will come from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Look, I just wanted to add one question in on the compliance cost. As we look forward into further out years, how do we think about how you're really analyzing the growth of that number, in the sense that you're saying it should be relatively similar on a percentage of a revenue basis. And yet, revenue's growing now, and we should expect it to grow again, I think in 2015. And so the dollar number keeps getting bigger. Maybe just give us a little more concrete examples of what's causing that dollar amount to increase? Is it -- that you have to move from U.S. compliance to international, or expecting other areas? Maybe just a little more specific samples, I think would be great.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, you're absolutely right, Darrin. It will be assumed that it will be about 3.5% to 4%. But the more, the expansion, international expansion, the global environment is changing. It's mainly also know your agent and know your customer activities. We have to do more questions on your customers, ask the customer, register the customers, doing diligence on the customers. But also on the agent side, with the front line associates, we are doing more diligence, understanding who is serving our customers. They trust us, and they want to trust also to the -- from loan associates. We do some diligences is there. And I think that's the main investment we're going to continue to happen in the future. Now it is, today points of view, I am pretty much confident that it will be about 3.5% to 4%, from today points of view, and that's what we see.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Darrin, we'll also, keep looking for automation opportunities and look for efficiencies as we move through the next few years, but that's our current estimate. And clearly, we want to automate as much as the activity as we can, over time.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's great. I appreciate that. And then, just one follow-up. With regard to the opportunities for growth in the non-C2C businesses, I mean, it seems like those are still trending pretty well relative to where they were, a couple of years back. Give us a little more color on any other strategies of change there? Is that just going to keep going, and should we expect this kind of growth, going forward?","Hikmet Ersek","I just want to congratulate Raj, that he did a good job on B2B. On the B2B, I am very much -- we have a new leadership here. Kerry comes from the business. He knows the business. And this team is very focused on the sales activities. The existing customers are using us more, we see that the volume of the existing customers is using more. It's also -- you could see that improvement, transaction improvement quarter-by-quarter, revenue improvement quarter-by-quarter. And we also start to expand to the new countries. The other thing we expanded is the new categories, like universities and the NGOs and financial institutions. They started to use us. That has been a strong growth on the B2B. On the C2B business, especially in the U.S., we see a strong growth on the electronic channels. Our electronic channel is growing strong, a little bit slowdown on the walk-in, where the people walk in on our location, want to pay their bills. They do use more on money transfer than using the bills. So generally, I am satisfied. The integration issues then are almost gone. We do -- had some in the beginning, had normal acquisition. And the team worked very hard. I think, it's -- do you want to add something on the B2B here?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, no, the B2B business is well-positioned. Had accelerated growth, as Hikmet said, every quarter of last year. And we expect low double-digit growth this year, throughout the year. So it's well-positioned, whether it's taking more products to the existing markets or new vertical opportunities, or even expanding its distribution, it has an online business that is relatively small right now, but what we want to be in a position there in that business to serve customers however they want. So low touch or high touch, and that business is a good position to be able to do that. So I think it's well positioned.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If I could just squeeze one last quick one in. There's a lot of -- a lot of times we get questions about your Domestic business. And I think that's now, what, about 7% or 8% of total revenues. And I think the question's coming from the fact there's a lot more P2P models coming to market, whether it's Square Cash or others, that you're seeing offering very low price for that. Is that something we need to watch for you guys? Or are you -- do you think the customer base is really just different enough that it's really not a concern?","Hikmet Ersek","I think -- as you do, I am watching also every competition. But I am satisfied with the domestic money transfer, especially in the lower bands. Transaction growth rates we see, the customers who want this in minutes. But the higher bands has have an impact. And that's why also, you saw a little bit slowdown on the domestic money transfer. But where I'm very satisfied on the Domestic Money Transfer and team is doing a good job is the electronic parts. People are using, sending fast money from their PCs or from their mobile phones. And one of the strongest growth rate on the westernunion.com is using of the mobile phones. I don't know, I think it's growing very fast there. It's faster than the normal parts, right?","Michael A. Salop","Yes, And I would just add Darrin, that in the U.S., all of our domestic money transfer is paid out in cash, and about half of it is for emergency purposes. So there are some different use cases there. But you're right, this kind of the new entry is where they most would effect is Domestic Money Transfer. That's something we keep an eye on.","Operator","And the next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I guess, what I have is more of sort of a qualitative, high level question, and it sort of pertains to the long-term profile of the business, because '13 had its unique charges. '14 is a little bit of a transition year, vis-\u00e0-vis, the compliance spending and so forth. It looks like there are a lots of moving parts. On one hand, pricing to drive transaction growth. And that -- the impact of that on revenue. The higher compliance costs, perhaps, somewhat offset by the cost takeouts. And as well as rising short term commissions, would you think can fall long term? Now I mean it feels to me like, if all of the tailwinds break your way, and some of the headwinds dissipate, we could see accelerating growth in '15? And if it doesn't quite break that way, maybe '14 is more of the template? I'm just wondering, as you long-range plan, how do you handicap all the moving parts? Because if you don't sort of get them all lined up, you can have a year like the '13, '14 kind of transition. So I'm just thinking more of strategically internally. How are you balancing the puts and takes in the business?","Hikmet Ersek","It's a very good question, actually. I think -- so what we do is that, we do look at the long-term opportunities on the business. First of all, the good news is that, it's -- the remittance market's a growing market. The global trade market is a growing market. And on the remittance market, we are definitely leading, but we have a 16%, 17% market share. So it's huge -- there's still room to grow, especially on the Digital where our emphasis is that we can grow. There's no company, from a strategic point of view, can -- in the hybrid economy, can connect cash with digital, ATM with the account, account with the business, business with the consumer, in 200 countries. I believe we are very well-positioned on the respond to the global economic changes with our omni channel, multi-channel strategy. That's #1, it's a growing economy, and that's doing that. The regulatory environment has been an evolving environment the last 2 years, and especially fast-changing. And I believe also, that the investments we do today will respond for the future environments, and it will be putting us long-term, in a competitive advantage. You've been following us, Andrew, for so long. You know of our brands, how our brand awareness, we are -- it's high, it's very, very high, and the people like us. And they use us. I don't have to talk about that. So I do see, really quite good growth opportunities. Lastly, our business model is a fantastic business model. On the 35% of our costs, fixed costs, 65% are variable costs. And once you grow the revenue, I think also it will help our profit growth and margin expansion over time.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. You make me feel old, Hikmet. One more, just to follow on, if I may. You mentioned the macro. Can you quantify how much in improving global remittance volume growth environment informs your '14 revenue growth outlook? And I assume that from all indications, it's -- '14's going to be a better year than '13, and '13 was better than '12.","Hikmet Ersek","I -- we believe that the '14, from global economy, I believe that things has not changed. I mean, they are always ups and downs in the different part of the world. But a World Bank saves about 6% to 7% of principal, and the revenue will be a little bit lower, about 3% to 4% in revenue growth over the next few, over 2014 and next few years, I guess, is that right, Mike? Mike is looking at me...","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Price declines and those kind of things, you would expect revenue to be lower than that in the industry.","Michael A. Salop","Yes, a little bit lower than the principal growth because of pricing. In terms of our outlook for '14, basically, it's assumed a similar economic situation in '14 and '13, a couple of exceptions. Southern Europe has been doing better for us in the back half of last year. And then, as Raj mentioned, we have accounted for some of the turbulence we're seeing in the currency changes in some of the emerging markets, particularly in South America.","Operator","And the next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My first question is on CapEx. So '13 was, what, 4.4% of revenues. You guys are talking about down the road, 2% to 3%. How do you get there, in terms of bringing it down to that lower level?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Ashwin, our -- we would not expect to be at the 2% to 3% level. I expect the CapEx will be more in the 5% range for 2014. And the increase is primarily driven by higher compliance-related activities that we're putting in place, as well as discontinued investment in our -- in the faster growing areas of our business. So I think in any given year, we might expect it to be between 4% and 5%, but that would be the expected range.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Oh, got it, okay. And to what extent -- it wasn't clear to me, to what extent is the buyback of $500 million dependent on making those working capital changes? What specifically are you doing that, there?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Ashwin we, yes, we have -- as you can imagine, we have payment flows all over the world, billions and billions of dollars of payment flows. So what we're doing is taking advantage of those payment flows and just utilizing intercompany working capital in a more effective and efficient manner. And that will continue to give us opportunities down the road, I believe. So that's primarily what we're doing.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So that will be a one-time benefit to get that, and then it becomes part of doing business?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, it becomes part of doing business. It's well within what we can do in terms of our payment flows. So it's a strategy that we've been utilizing, we plan to continue to utilize. But it's just looking for pockets of opportunity. As you know, we added Travelex and Custom House and other entities as part of the business. So they have a lot of payment flows between them. And so it just allows us to look for more opportunities in that regard.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That makes sense. And then you will use all of that to do the $500 million buyback? It wasn't clear, all of that in the second half?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes, that will be the primary way of doing the buyback. And it depends on overall cash flows of the business during the course of the year, and how the company performs. So it'll be a combination of things. But primarily, it's the working capital strategy.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Last question, if I may. From a pricing strategy perspective, as I look at your website over time, and try to figure out what you're charging for people. It seems like over time, you've been shifting, perhaps to a lower fee-base, it's always 0 fee, that $1 fee kind of thing, with a greater focus on making money out of FX. Is that -- I mean, could you say that, that's sort of the direction you're going in more clearly than before? Is that a -- I mean, what kind of difference does that make to your business, Raj?","Hikmet Ersek","I'll take that one. Absolutely not, it's not the strategy. I think the fees continue to be a main driver of our revenue, and will stay as a main driver of our revenue. It really depends, as you know our business very well, Ashwin. It really depends on the corridor, right? In a competitive corridor, where the price -- revenues are -- sorry, fees are lower, you could definitely also respond to the market environment than to -- also have on the foreign exchange. It really depends on the -- market by market, corridor pricing actions. And I would say that it's -- our strategy on the pricing has not changed. We feel comfortable and we will continue to evolve our pricing corridor by corridor as business as usual.","Operator","And next, we have a question from David Togut of Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Hikmet, when the 2014 proxy is published in the next few weeks, what will be the primary drivers of management compensation for 2014? And then, if you could look out longer term, as well.","Hikmet Ersek","Well, let's wait until the proxy has been published. Obviously, I have to talk up with the board and everything. But generally, overall, I would say that our compensation has been, always performance-based. My CEO compensation was very much in the past, always, as you know, very much variable, long-term focus, on the shareholder focus. That -- I don't think that's going to change. And -- but let's wait until the proxy's -- comes out in a few weeks.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","But I guess, broadly speaking, what are the primary financial metrics that the board wants management to be compensated based upon?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, revenue and profit.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And are there broad, long-term targets for that?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, there are. Of our long-term targets, we do have some targets. Yes, we are very much on revenue growth and profit growth focused.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And what are the targets?","Hikmet Ersek","We don't give long-term guidance.","Michael A. Salop","Yes David, there are annual targets and then there are long-term targets as well. The long-term ones are -- we don't make public.","Operator","And next, we have Tom McCrohan of Janney.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Are there any insights you can give us on adding new customers and the recent pricing actions, or maybe usage patterns, repeat customers, from the investments you made on the pricing side?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think, most of the pricing actions we did in was the main corridors, I could see that we did gain some market share. In some quarters, we were losing market share like in Mexico, the customers came back to us. And also, in some corridors, where we, there are compliance issues as the customer joined us. I would say also, in some corridors, where we are entering new, is -- where we had very good response to the new pricing, like in digital area. But in the digital, especially 80% of the customers did not use our service the last 12 months. We know that they are registered customers. We check that every time, and they did not use it. And so it's a good response to the pricing actions.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And on the importance of mobile seems critical long-term. Is there any chronic developments, soon-to-be launched in 2014, even mobile and the online side, that is worthwhile calling out?","Hikmet Ersek","Absolutely, absolutely. We are very focused on the mobile. Mobile, more are using as a -- on our digital send site. We do have apps. I mean, I can only recommended that you download our apps and use our app. It's a really good moving, fast-moving. You have to register and then customers are very satisfied. We get also reviews about our apps. And the apps will be expanded to the different countries. And mobile is -- the people are to -- use mobile phones more often. They do use their send money in a spontaneous environment at different use cases.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And if you disclose, like what percentage of the total C2C transactions are initiated on mobile and online?","Hikmet Ersek","We did not disclose that. But I can only say that 5% of our revenue is electronic.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. Last question. Just what share count assumption as baked into your 2014 EPS guidance?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","We have -- we just assume that the buyback, that the majority of the stock will be bought back this year. So I think I gave you the ending share count. So you just help to make so much assumptions around that, in terms of overall share count.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So 549, end of the year and then assume that 500 million is exhausted?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","The majority of the program would be exhausted this year.","Michael A. Salop","Yes, the basic share count, so it is a little bit higher. [Operator Instructions]","Operator","And that question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just want to make sure I have the math right on the electronic channels. And I know you indicated it was 5% of revenue in 2013. So I think that comes out to about $275 million or so. Are you still reinforcing the $500 million target for 2015? And if so, just talk about your confidence level in seeing the kind of growth acceleration that you would need to see in 2014 and 2015 to get there? Because I think you grew it probably about 25% in 2013.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I'm getting day by day more confident on the -- to reach our goal, approximately $500 million. The reason for that is our revenue growth is accelerating quarter-by-quarter. The reason -- the main reason of that, as you recall, as we disclose our strategy, the first strategy was acquiring customers. And we are acquiring customers. And we know once you acquire customers, they do use more often the digital westernunion.com. So -- and that's -- plan really started to work out. The people are using it. The other factor why I am -- where we have this target and we did not change to approximately $500 million target, is we are expanding to more countries. Now we are in 24 countries, sending money to 200 countries. So that's going to continue the expansion of our westernunion.com site, send sites, to the countries that you can connect online with our 500,000 locations or 100,000 ATMs.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And any update on Walgreens, as far as whether or not the roll out there has started across their 8,000 locations. Anything you can tell us when that roll out might be done?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think the teams, our technical teams and operational teams, are working together to combine their host with our host. We did not launch it yet. And so -- but the teams are working hard on that to launch it.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. But you still expect it to be launched, I guess, relatively soon, is that fair?","Hikmet Ersek","I don't have an update. Maybe I'll take -- you can, Mike, would take the call afterwards. I don't have an update in front of me. But I assume that's the case. It's one of our major agents. We are very focused on that.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question. Obviously, it seems like Raj is doing a great job so far in the CFO seat, but I know the interim tag is still there. When do you think we'll get an update on the CFO search?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","You want me to answer that?","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Absolutely.","Hikmet Ersek","The good thing is that Raj really knows the business. He is the Interim CFO, but he's an internal candidate. He is one of our highest talents in the company. He has been a great -- he has been sitting in different functions. So he knows the business very well, especially given the complex business, evolving business. He is doing a great job. But I also launched the CFO search. I'm looking at all the options. And we believe that we will announce that soon, the fixed CFO role.","Michael A. Salop","Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We hope to talk to you soon. And have a good evening.

We delivered solid business performance in the first quarter, and we also continue to make important progress on our key strategic initiatives. Overall, the quarter's business results were consistent with our full year expectations. Revenue increased 3% in constant currency terms led by strong digital growth in consumer money transfer and the double-digit increase in our consumer bill payment business.","Westernunion.com money transfer continued its trend of excellent results with revenue increasing 28% constant currency. Geographically, in C2C, our Latin America and Caribbean outbound business was very strong. North America and Europe posted good constant currency growth, while the oil producing countries in the Middle East and Africa continue to be challenged as expected.","From a profit standpoint, operating margins were solid and we also returned over $300 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends in the quarter. Our earnings per share in the quarter was negatively impacted by a higher than usual tax rate due to timing of some items, but we don't expect this to impact our full year earnings, and we are confirming our full year EPS outlook.","Operationally, we continued implementation of the WU Way business transformation program. While we are operating from a position of strength, we are also redesigning our organization structures to drive enhanced focus on end-to-end full service delivery for our customers.","We are progressing the cost efficiency initiative and technology organization optimization, and we are continuing to implement lean management into our operations. With these lean management techniques, we will improve the customer experience. We have initiated pilot programs of cross-functional teams analyzing our customer experience value streams, identifying issues, assessing root causes, and developing solutions.","Currently identified solutions include providing more digital self-service options, piloting of customer care centers of excellence and enhancing capabilities in our agent point-of-sale technology. In addition to the potential cost efficiency opportunities, these changes are intended to lead to better customer experience and stronger retention over time.","The WU Way programs are also supporting long-term growth initiatives, and we are making good progress in key areas. As we drive toward our vision of being a recognized leader in cross-border, cross-currency money movement, our strategic focus continues to be on expanding mobile and online, building our account payout network, and improving and enhancing customer experience across our portfolio.","We have already had several advances in our digital business in 2017. We expanded our online distribution, as we now have 40 countries with Western Union transaction sites, including all the European Union countries, and 18 mobile apps with the ability to send money to more than 200 countries and territories.","In the first quarter, over 60% of our westernunion.com transactions were initiated on mobile. We also added Apple Pay as a payment option on westernunion.com in the U.S., and we launched a bot, which allows our money transfer service to be accessed through Facebook Messenger in the U.S.","Our account payout network continues to expand with access to billions of accounts. Although revenues are still currently small, account payouts represented over 30% of westernunion.com U.S. outbound principal in the quarter, and we have dedicated teams working on expanding this business.","We have various initiatives underway to improve the customer experience not only through WU Way but also through implementing services such as app-initiated retail, which allows consumers to initiate transaction on their mobile devices and complete them at agent locations. All these actions give us confidence in the opportunities for our business.","Obviously, there has been a lot of news in the money transfer space in recent months with the potential acquisition of one of our competitors. We believe this demonstrates the value of our global network, especially the retail and digital combination in cross-border money movement as well as the importance of global presence both in terms of capabilities and regulatory licenses and infrastructure.","Now, regardless of how the external situation play out, our resilient global business model has shown solid results over the last several quarters. We will continue to focus on business execution and implementation of long-term strategic actions, including expanding our digital assets and optimizing our operating model. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we delivered solid business performance. We will continue to give you updates on our strategic progress throughout the year.","But now, I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the first quarter results in more detail.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Hikmet. First quarter reported revenues of $1.3 billion were flat or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior-year period. The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits, reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $30 million compared to the prior year.","In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenues were flat in the quarter or increased 2% constant currency, while transactions grew 2%. C2C constant currency revenue benefited from strong growth in westernunion.com, while geographically growth was driven by Latin America, North America and Europe and CIS regions. Total C2C cross-border principal increased 1% or 2% on a constant currency basis, while principal per transaction declined 2% or 1% in constant currency terms.","The 1% cross-border principal increase was an improvement from the 1.5% decline we reported for the 2016 full year. Last month, the World Bank updated its cross-border remittance principal estimates, and its data indicates the overall market declined 1.2% in 2016, following a 2.7% decline in 2015.","Factors cited by the World Bank for the decline last year included low oil prices, weak economies in the Gulf states and Russia, reduced flows from Europe to Africa and the translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The World Bank is projecting an improvement in 2017, driven by stronger global economic outlook.","Returning to the first quarter results, the spread between C2C transaction growth and revenue growth in the quarter was 2 percentage points, including a negative 2% impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 2% in the quarter, while pricing had a positive impact of approximately 2%, primarily driven by price increases implemented last year, and that remained in place. We continue to view the current pricing environment as stable.","Turning to the regions, we implemented a new regional structure this quarter in our C2C segment due to some leadership and organizational changes. Changes include a few modifications in the country composition of the segments by geographic regions, which we detailed in an 8-K we published last week and are also available in our 10-Q.","In addition, we have changed the methodology of our regional reporting to allocate 100% of revenues to the send region rather than our previous practice of splitting the revenues 50-50 based on the region in which the money was originated and the region in which it was received. We believe this new methodology provides you with a better understanding of where our business is originated around the world, and how economic trends and other macro events may affect our results. We have provided the 2016 historical quarterly regional results using this method in the filings I just mentioned.","So, turning to the regions, regional results for the first quarter, I'll be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regions' results. North America again generated good growth in the quarter with revenue increasing 3% or 4% on a constant currency basis, while transactions grew 5%. U.S. outbound, particularly to Latin American countries, continue to be a strong grower. U.S. to Mexico business increased, although growth trends were not as good as the very strong results we delivered in the fourth quarter.","The strengthening of the Mexican peso likely contributed to a slowdown in the market growth for the quarter. However, our Mexico business did continue to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de M\u00e9xico principal and transaction data for the first quarter. Our U.S. domestic money transfer revenue was somewhat softer, primarily due to the impact of some price decreases we implemented in parts of the market in the second half of last year.","In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 1% or increased 4% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 8%. Revenue growth in the region is consistent with the fourth quarter, while transactions benefited from growth of lower-priced transactions in Russia. In the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region, revenue declined 13% or 10% constant currency, and transactions were down 15% as low oil prices continued to negatively affect key send markets.","The regions' results were also impacted by reduced sends from these countries into India. Total inbound business to India was down just over 20% in the quarter. That compared to the 30% revenue decrease we saw in November and December following the government demonetization actions, and we did see month-by-month improvement in the trends during the quarter.","In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue was down 2% or 1% constant currency, while transactions decreased 2%. Business originating in the Latin America and Caribbean region was very strong. Revenue grew 26% or 25% constant currency, while transactions grew 17%, led by Argentina and several other markets.","A combination of strong economic performance and currencies, market reforms, previous pricing actions and marketing programs helped drive the regions growth. Westernunion.com's C2C revenue continued its strong performance trend with revenue increasing 26% or 28% constant currency on 27% transaction growth. Westernunion.com represented 9% of total C2C revenue in the quarter, up from 7% in the first quarter of last year.","In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue increased 8% or 10% on a constant currency basis. Constant currency revenue growth continued to be driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which were partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. Business Solutions revenues declined 6% or 3% constant currency, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from the loss of XE.com business.","Revenues were also impacted by a decline in sales of hedging products, partially due to lower FX volatility in some markets. Geographically, good growth in Europe was offset by declines in North America and Asia-Pacific.","Turning to margins and profitability, the consolidated operating margin in the quarter was 18.4%. Excluding the impact of costs related to the WU Way transformation program, adjusted operating margin was 19.5% in the quarter, which compares to 19.9% in the prior year period.","The adjusted margin decline was driven by the impact of foreign exchange and customer and funding mix in C2B, partially offset by benefits from timing of marketing spend. Foreign exchange hedges in the quarter had a positive impact of $7 million, down from a benefit of $15 million in the first quarter of 2016.","We continue to expect approximately $25 million in hedge benefits for the full year compared to $48 million of benefit in 2016. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $15 million in the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year.","Compliance expense was 3.7% of revenue for this first quarter, and we still expect to be in the higher end of the 3.5% to 4% of revenues range for the full year. We recorded $14 million of WU Way expenses in the quarter, while expected savings are weighted more towards the second half of the year.","EBITDA margin was 23.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding WU Way expenses, was 24.6% compared to 25% in the prior year period. The decline was due to the same factors that affected our operating margin.","The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.1%. Excluding the impact of WU Way-related expenses, the adjusted tax rate was 24.8%, which compares to 14.6% in the prior-year period. The higher tax rate in the quarter was due to the impact of changes in the internal ownership structure of certain of the company's international subsidiaries, which were implemented to help address upcoming regulatory changes in Europe. The first quarter negative impact is expected to be largely offset by lower taxes of a comparable amount over the remainder of the year, resulting from the structural changes.","The GAAP earnings per share of $0.33 in the first quarter includes a negative $0.02 impact from the WU Way-related expenses. Excluding these expenses, adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 compares to $0.37 in the first quarter of last year with the decline primarily driven by the higher tax rate.","The C2C margin was 22.4%, which compares to 22.7% in the prior year period, has a negative impact of foreign exchange and offset by benefits from timing of marketing spend.","The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 12.2% in the quarter compared to 14.6% in the prior year. The year-over-year margin decline was primarily due to customer and funding mix in the U.S. electronic business, including increased credit card usage, although the margin improved substantially relative to the fourth quarter.","Business Solutions operating profit margin was 2.5% in the quarter compared to 2.4% in the prior year period. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $11 million in the current quarter compared to $13 million in the prior year period. The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 13.7%, which compare to 15.1% in the first quarter of 2016 with the decline primarily caused by higher technology expense.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet in the first quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $86 million, which includes $151 million of payments related to the settlement with the Federal and state governments announced in January, and approximately $19 million of WU Way-related payments. Excluding these items, cash flow from operating activities was $256 million in the quarter. The remaining $440 million of legal settlement payments will be made in the second quarter.","Capital expenditures were $26 million in the first quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.5 billion and cash of $1.3 billion with approximately half of the cash held by United States entities.","During the quarter, we issued $400 million of five-year notes with a coupon of 3.6%. We also returned $308 million to shareholders, including $83 million in dividend and $225 million of share repurchases, which equated to approximately 11 million shares. The outstanding share count at quarter end was 472 million shares, and we had $1.2 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.","Based on the first quarter results and our recent business trends, we are affirming our full year outlook. We expect GAAP revenue to be flat to down low-single digits with constant currency revenue increasing in the low-single digits. GAAP operating margins are expected to be approximately 18% and adjusted operating margin approximately 20%, excluding approximately $100 million of WU Way-related expenses. Our outlook include savings of approximately $20 million from deficiency actions included in the WU Way initiatives in 2017, and we expect approximately $25 million of additional savings in 2018.","In addition to the impact from the subsidiary ownership structure, we also expect other discrete tax benefits in the fourth quarter, which we're anticipated in our original outlook. For the full year, the GAAP effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 11%, while the adjusted rate is expected to be approximately 13%.","Quarterly, we anticipate rates closer to our full year outlook in the second and third quarters, and then a very low tax rate in Q4. We continue to expect full year GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.48 to $1.60 and adjusted earnings per share, excluding the WU Way-related expenses, in the range of $1.63 to $1.75.","Both earnings per share ranges reflect an approximately $0.09 negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP cash flow from operating activities is expected to be approximately $200 million in 2017 due to the impact of the $591 million payments related to the settlement agreement with the U.S. and State governments announced in January to be approximately $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to the previously-announced IRS agreement in December 2011 and the WU Way-related payment. Excluding these items, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion.","So, to summarize, the first quarter business performance was solid, strategic progress continued and we are on track with our full-year outlook.","Operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Tien-Tsin.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for the detail. So, it looks like just trend-wise volume in C2C pretty stable, pricing actually a little bit better. So, Hikmet, I want to ask you, I know you travel a lot and you meet with a lot of different regulators, government entities, et cetera. Have you sensed a change in tone in sort of the regulation and regulatory environment on the business side, whether it's in the U.S. or outside the U.S, I'm curious if you change your thinking around the risk or opportunity there?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Not really, Tien-Tsin. I mean, there's a lot of noise obviously. But at this point, it's hard to measure the impact. In fact, our U.S. outbound business to Latin America business has been extremely strong, and our Mexico business a little bit slower than Q4, but still strong in Q1. Recent data just came actually, yesterday or something like that, the data from Banco de M\u00e9xico. We are still beating the other competitors, and we are better than the market data.","Overall, a lot of noise on the protective environment, on the immigrant environment all over, but I think the governments also regulated (22:05). When I talk to them, they do realize that it's important to use the formal channels to transfer money. They do realize that they understand that the regulated environment is the best to send money and support actually also the people that come from. I think that sentiment is there to support us. I don't see any big noise yet, noise more on the media, more on the published words, but less on the impact on our remittance market.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's good to hear. And maybe just for you, Raj, just on the margin side, gross margin, I guess, overall margin. I mean, I know there's a lot of puts and takes. I heard a little bit about funding mix, and I guess we'll have some WU Way benefits coming in the \u2013 later on towards end of the year. So, can you help us think about 2Q versus exit rate margin? What are some of the things that we should focus on there? Obviously, the full year margin, I understand, but just thinking about the walk through that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, yeah. I mean, as we go through the course of the year, Tien-Tsin, we should get benefits from the cost savings initiatives. Most of that benefit will hit us in the second half of the year. And then, based on our current forecast for foreign exchange rates, we think that FX impact will be a little bit less in the second half of the year, so you get a pickup on those items. We had somewhat of a marketing benefit in the first quarter, and I expect that we'll get back to our normal averages for marketing spend, there's some timing in the first quarter. So that will also pick up. So, net-net, that's how we get back to roughly our 20% adjusted margin for the full year, and some of the things that will happen from a quarterly standpoint.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And to clarify the funding mix piece of it, I know it's probably pretty small, but is that reversible?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is that...?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. It's the way \u2013 in our consumer bill payments business, we're seeing \u2013 we had couple of things happening over the course of the last year. We had a large customer that we brought on at lower margins, and then we also saw consumers using credit cards to make payments, and that's a more expensive transaction for us. So, it ends up being more expensive for us. And although margins were down from the first quarter of last year, we actually did improve quite a bit from the fourth quarter where we were in the C2B business. So, the goal there has been to get really good top-line growth, and we're getting a lot of success there, we're adding to the portfolio. And then that gives us an opportunity to stabilize margins and maybe improve them over time.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Got it. Thank you so much.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Darrin.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Darrin.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, thanks. Look, it's good to see pricing was stable on the quarter again. Obviously, it does seem, we're seeing incremental competition from innovators across the ecosystem. So, I just want to make sure, I mean, should we expect pricing in your view to remain stable, let's call, in the next 12 months to 24 months. It's just a bit of a shift obviously than what we saw two years, three years ago. And then, just any further thoughts on the industry implications of one of your largest competitors potentially being acquired, whether it's depending regardless of who buys them?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. Let me \u2013 you are right, Darrin. Pricing is stable, it has been stable for the last three years. And I think we don't see any big movements. I think, the pricing is stable in the market, and for short-term, I see that it's going to stay stable. There are always corridor adjustments. There are always some markets up and down, but generally I would say that it's stable and on average, our premium like 15% to 20% pricing are being higher than the competitors. It's staying there, given our network, given our brand, given our competitive advantage, global advantage. I think we're going to \u2013 we feel comfortable with our pricing action. We will continue to do in certain corridors pricing, and we will continue to adjust that and sometime it's FX, sometimes it's fee, sometimes it's putting the price higher, sometime it's lowering, and managing 16,000 corridor in 200 countries has been our strength, and we're going to continue to do that.","Now, I can't tell you about the competition \u2013 the new owner of the competitors are, when that will go through or not, I can't do that, that has to be approved by the different regulatory environment in the U.S. and how long it will take. But I can only tell you that we are extremely focused in the market. And I can say that our team, our regional heads, our corridor heads, our marketing heads, our people have been very focused and delivering pretty good.","I do \u2013 from an agent side, they are also asking us what that means, the new environment, I can't tell you what's the new environment is, but I believe that the competitors want to make also money and want to be successful in the market and serve the customer in a right way, and we're going to compete on the market.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. So it sounds like you do expect continued stability around pricing at least over the near-term?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. Near-term of \u2013 yes, I mean, it's always hard to predict the future \u2013 long, long future about near-time, yes.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","And I feel like they're quite good. Our fundamentals are good to respond to specific corridors. We can immediately respond to that if there is any pressure in certain corridors in certain countries.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That's good to hear. And then, just a quick follow-up on \u2013 I know you mentioned some comments around the India demonetization and some progress being seen on a monthly basis even. Could you just provide a little more thought around the long-term stability in the region for you guys there? When would you expect that to be back to normal again?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I think, we see improvements. I think, there is more cash in the market, so people are getting more cash and will be paying us in our 100,000 locations. But one thing you should not forget is, one of the major corridors is the Middle East to India. And oil prices has been low, and you see the impact of that mix to India. But one of the very strong corridors for us is the U.S. to India on our digital part. And we're dropping money not only there on the cash, we're dropping money also on account. In fact, most of the transactions are going to an account there from online. So, it is really the portfolio management.","I would say that it will stabilize. We do have a competitive advantage. We do have a coverage there. Our brand has been very prominent in India. The brand awareness is bringing probably the highest amount of money transfer companies there. So, I think it will come back depending on how fast, I can't say that, but it's coming. I can see day-by-day improvement.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","And the great thing about India is that we have fantastic retail coverage. And we also have fantastic account coverage. We pay out into most accounts in India. So...","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","...the infrastructure is right to improve there.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful, guys. Thanks very much.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hello, Bryan.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. How are you doing?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Good. How are you, Bryan?","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm all right, I'm all right. Just wanted to ask about the U.S.-originated transactions. It was up 4%, and then I think that was down from 8% last year in fiscal year 2016, and it was pretty consistent around that 8% last year. So, just trying to figure out, was that directly a result of the strengthening Mexico peso and anything else in there that caused a little bit of a deceleration from the rate that we saw all through the fiscal year 2016?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I mean, it's \u2013 U.S. to Mexico, our DMT business is also a part of that number, so DMT was softer in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter. And so, those two things combined did that, but we still \u2013 as you said, we still had good growth in North America as well as the U.S., and so overall still tracking well but softer than what we saw in the fourth quarter and prior quarters.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, just on the tax rate, for the quarter, that came in higher. Was that something that you guys knew that was going to happen or is that something that popped-up during the quarter? And then you talked a little bit about cadence throughout the year. It sounds like the fourth quarter, will it basically be like a zero tax rate or...","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...what do you think about the fourth quarter?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I mean, we had planned on \u2013 obviously our outlook for the full year has not changed, so 11% and then 13% adjusted. So, we had planned on these activities for the year. The timing in the first quarter was less under our control, I would say. And so, we're going to get those same benefits the rest of this year, because we had planned on it. We've basically accelerated into Q1.","And then, the second and third quarters should be closer to our full year average tax rate. And the fourth quarter, I would expect to be substantially lower because we have a number of different discrete benefits that we had already planned on, plus this timing benefit. So, it should be substantially lower than you'll see for even the second and third quarter as we go into the fourth quarter.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Just last question for me on the Western Union Business Solutions. It sounds like there was a termination of a partner contract. Is there a bigger impact in that going forward or is the decrease in 3% constant currency about the right number we should expect for fiscal year 2017? Thanks so much.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, the XE.com customer is something we spoke about last year. We knew that we were going to lose it at the end of last year, which is what happened. And so we're going to see that grow over impact at least through the first three quarters of this year, a little bit in the fourth quarter. So you'll see a three-point impact from that as we move through, but our goal is to grow the business faster than what we achieved in the first quarter. That's not an acceptable growth level for us. And we're doing a number of good things in that business where we want to drive better growth. So I would not model minus 3% in that business, that's not our objective. Our objective is to grow better than that.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I mean, it's also different performance. Europe has been growing good, but Latin America \u2013 sorry, North America and Asia-Pacific has been slower there. It's something that we're focused on that, should be better growth. And I think we have also some focus areas with some management changes, and really how we can drive the sales there better. And I think we will try to get that better, but we are not pleased with the current (33:07) performance...","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","...and I think it should be better.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Operator","And next we have a question from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking...","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Jim.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit about the C2B revenue. I think you talked about an impact in Argentina, and maybe a couple other factors. But I think that growth in that segment was as high as I see it going back several years. So, is that a one-time impact? Is that a sustainable benefit? And maybe just talk about what you're seeing in that business maybe for the remainder of the year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. The C2B business has been growing in the low double-digit range for quite a long time now, the last several years. And what we saw in the quarter, we also had good reported growth in that business of 8%, and that's because Argentina didn't devalue as much as we had expected. But we continue to see really good growth opportunities for that business. It's being driven by a couple of different things, the Argentina cash walk-in business where consumers are paying bills at retail locations, and then our electronic payments business here in the U.S. And then that's being offset a little bit by U.S. cash walk-in. So, the growth profile of that business continues to be very strong, and we continue to add to the portfolio. And we're very excited about the opportunities in that business.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think, in some area, we are focused also about the future. One of our strategic initiative is that how we can move better not only C2C transaction or the C2B transaction cross-border, cross-currency. And we see some signs in the U.S., that business is performing very well, our Speedpay business, electronic business and our Argentina business. Can we take that also to other countries? Can we do cross-border payments? That's something with our new organization, WU Way, that's something that we're long-term concentrated on that that we can have a long-term growth there. So we are excited.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good to hear. And then, maybe as a follow-up really on related topic, related to the kind of changing international owners to be talked about to adopt to PSP2. Can you maybe talk about broad strokes of what changes in ownership were actually or have been made and will be made?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And whether that has any kind of longer-term impact on the tax structure?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. No, it's a longer-term impact on the tax structure. The activity relates specially to our Business Solutions business and the licensing requirements that are coming next year in Europe related to some of the products that we sell \u2013 the derivatives products that we sell. So, we had to make some changes. As you know \u2013 as you may know, we own a bank in Austria. And so, we've combined or we're going to be combining those organizations to provide the right type of licensing structure ultimately. So that's the underlying activity that we're driving at.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Operator","The next question will come from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good evening.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Kartik Mehta.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hi. You've talked in the past and even on this call about mobile and the utilization, and it seems to be increasing. And I'm wondering, obviously there is a consumer convenience component to it, but what other benefits does Western Union get, if any, from greater mobile utilization?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think that's one of our biggest \u2013 strong growth where it's coming from. It's one of our biggest strategic initiatives and the team is doing a great job. So, let me start with saying that we have the fundamentals. We can send money to 200 countries, the others can't like we can do it. We can drop money in an account and in a location. We have almost billions of accounts, almost 3 billion accounts or like over 2 billion accounts, I don't know. Currently it's over 2.5 billion accounts, I believe, yeah.","And then, we have about over half-a-million locations. So, this combination, sending money from a mobile anytime, anywhere, 24\/7, has been seen by the customers extremely well. Now, the customer has to register. Once the customer use it once, they really want to use it more often. The other thing what we say is to get different customer segment. They're probably younger generation, they do have accounts, they do use their credit cards or their accounts to fund the transaction, and we see good growth here.","So, we saw very good growth in the U.S. but we also expanded, we have now 14 countries on our online westernunion.com and 18 on mobile app. If you can use your mobile app in the U.S. with your English language, or with \u2013 you're sending that. But in Germany, we have a German; in France, we have a France app. We have really adapted all this to local environment our apps and the customers are using that, and it's going to continue.","The other thing is also, I'm excited, we started not only send money to an account, not only to a location, but also through a mobile wallet. And so, combining mobile wallet to mobile with mobile to mobile is also something that we're excited about that.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And Raj, I know you talked about compliance cost this year maybe being at the higher end of guidance. But as you look at those costs, do you think there is an opportunity to automate or consolidate so that they reduce as \u2013 maybe in 2018 and beyond?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Go ahead.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I mean, we're always looking for opportunities to optimize how we spend there. And over time, the composition of how we spent that money has changed, right? And as we've completed many of the Southwest Border requirements, that spending has gotten less over the last couple of years, but it's migrated to other programs. So, we're always putting technology in place and we want to automate those things. Our first priority this year really is to address the requirements that we have under the settlement agreements, and that's the reason for the higher spend this year. And we'll look to stabilize as much as we can over time.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","One thing, Kartik, I just want to mention that also. I see that as an investment as a competitive advantage. And it really gives us the capability and operate in 200 countries, work with regulators, flows, adapting to changes very fast. We have a team there, about 2,000-plus people working on the compliance, but not only them also our agents work with \u2013 close with our compliance teams. So I see that as a competitive advantage. It's a barrier of entry for many, but we have it here. And we're going to continue to advance that compliance activities. That doesn't mean that we are not looking being more efficient, but it's an competitive advantage I believe.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from our Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, Hikmet. Hi, Raj.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. How are you?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Good.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Good, good.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, my first question is on Western Union Business Solutions. And I've always had the view, I think you guys have mentioned this in the past too that as the economy improves that the performance of this business unit should improve, and even absent the XE contract loss, it just seems to be a little bit sluggish in terms of \u2013 if there is a lack of growth. Does it need more investment? I mean, do you need a better product? I'm trying to understand what is it that gets this going. And then, sort of a sub-question is, any views on \u2013 you've seen some acquisitions in the B2B space just in the last week, one by Vantiv and one by FLEETCOR, any thoughts on that space?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, Ashwin, I believe that the Western Union Business Solutions should have a better performance than we reported in Q1, I agree on that with you. I think, the global economic environment, when that improves, when more export-import connection happens, especially on the small and mid-sized business entities, that will improve given how linked that sending money and receiving money is with importer and exporter.","Besides that, I don't believe that we need a significant investment there to improve our performance. It's more really a focus on the sales getting new customers, where its liking is that I understand more is on the foreign trade part \u2013 foreign exchange trade part on the hedges and on the forwards. We have some performance issue. However, the payments part, like the invested (42:11) payments, like NGO payments is doing very well.","How you pay your builds or cross-border builds during (42:18) performance very well. However, on the trading part, foreign exchange trading part, we do need some more focus here. And I know the team is doing a little \u2013 putting also Wu Way activities around that's looking really how we can improve the part generally, this part has to improve, and I believe that over time it will improve.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then, I want to go back to sort of the commentary around pricing being stable. I just want to confirm that when you top-up stable pricing, it is still that you can offset the unit fees or the transaction fees with increasing FX spread. And I know you're not going to provide this information in the future. But to what extent can you actually increase FX spread before sort of clients start pushing back on that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","It's all about mix. You know our business very well, Ashwin, depending on the corridor. We do have corridors, which is zero FX. We do have corridors, which are higher FX, zero fees. We do have corridors where there's both are that. It's really like an airline management where you fly from one destination to another destination, which seats you for use, and that's exactly what we are doing with our teams. I think, in the portfolio management, the team is impressive. It's really looking at every corridor, understanding the customer needs on FX side.","I believe there is room. We can be even better there, having the right balance between foreign exchange and fees, but our business model is built mostly on fee and less on FX. But there is, I believe, opportunity to see the customer need and go after that. That keeps the \u2013 the mix also keeps the flexibility as to keeping the pricing stable. And as I mentioned earlier, our prices are higher than the competition, but the market and the customer feel comfortable with the prices. And the 2% constant currency growth is definitely something that are also transaction growth reflects that.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","And Ashwin, in some markets, customers are hyper-sensitive to fees or FX, and so it really just depends on that overall mix in what the competitor set has. So it's not one formula for any particular market.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. They're just managing country-by-country or corridor-by-corridor?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Corridor-by-corridor more, Ashwin.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from John Davis of Stifel.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Raj, I wonder maybe you could give us an update on the amount of cash in the U.S. versus abroad currently. And then, maybe on a more normalized run rate of $1 billion, excluding all the one-time items, how much of that cash flow is generated in the U.S. versus abroad? Just trying to get a handle, if we do get tax reform, what kind of impact it could have on your tax rate?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, our cash balance was higher at the end of the first quarter than we've had for some time. It was higher than the end of the year, because we did raise some debt in the first quarter. We also issued some term debt as well as some commercial paper. And that's in anticipation of making these final payments for the legal settlements. So that's why you see a higher level of cash. By the end of the year, we should be at a lower level of cash.","We currently have about half of the cash at the end of the first quarter U.S.-based, and the rest of it's abroad. On an ongoing basis, we generate about 75% or so of our cash flow outside the U.S. And that includes any repatriation that we may do back to the U.S., normal repatriation. So, if we were to get comprehensive tax reform, that could potentially alleviate any future issues of repatriation of foreign profit, which should be a good thing for us.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up on WU Connect, obviously the Facebook announcement, but any kind of update there? I know it's still early days, but I just haven't heard about it in a while. I'm just kind of curious, kind of thoughts or any updates?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I mean, we're excited about the Facebook announcement and the potential there. It's a great product. Our customers really don't have to leave the messenger environment to do a transaction, but for us it's just another channel to allow customers to do a transaction with us, right. Whether it's Viber or WeChat or Facebook, we just want to provide as many avenues as possible for customers to be able to do a transaction with us. On Facebook specifically, whether they come through Facebook or whether they come to us directly on wu.com, we're really indifferent because the economics of that transaction are about the same for us. So, we'll see \u2013 it's early stages, but we'll see how that kind of transpires.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Is the customer convenient? I did some transactions, unbelievable. You would not be \u2013 leaving the messenger and you do transaction, you continue to use the messenger, so it's really combining here and dropping money in minutes worldwide to 200 countries, 500,000 locations and billions of accounts. It's quite convenient for both who are Messenger users, Facebook users, then us.","John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good evening. Will you need to raise more debt to fund the settlement payments or is the debt activity that you did here in the first quarter pretty much all that you're paying for the full year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. We've raised the debt in the first quarter to make the payments in the second quarter \u2013 first and second quarter. So, that's why you see an elevated level of debt. The only other piece that we have there is, we have a refinancing to do of another $500 million maturity at the end of this year. So, we will likely pre-finance that before the December maturity. So you'll see potentially some higher levels of debt. But by the end of the year, we should be at about where we were for the first quarter, assuming nothing else changes.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then, could you give us the year-over-year margin impacts from higher compliance costs in the first quarter?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, last year, we spent \u2013 we are at 3.6% of revenues in the first quarter. And in the first quarter this year, we're at 3.7%. So it's not a dramatic difference. And for the full year, I would expect this to be at the higher end of our 3.5% to 4% range. And in the last couple of years, we've been closer to 3.5%.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. And then, last one from me. When you \u2013 as you look forward into the timing of the WU Way cost savings, I understood though increase as you go through the year, but would you be close to full run rate by the fourth quarter?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","I would expect to be at a more full run rate, but we're going to keep looking for more opportunities there. So, right now, we plan for about $20 million this year, and then incrementally $25 million next year, but we're going to keep looking for more opportunities for savings.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you very much.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Bob.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Just on the stock buybacks, how much capital do you expect to use this year? And then, any change to your policies and share buybacks should capital return over the next couple of years?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I mean, Bob, we have $1.2 billion left on our share repurchase authorization, and that's good through 2019. We bought $225 million in the first quarter. We haven't given an exact number for this year. But as we gave our original outlook earlier this year, we were just planning on buying irritably through the course of the next three years. And if you look at our capital return, our policies really haven't changed a lot. We've continued to give a lot of cash back through dividends. And that's \u2013 our dividend payout now is over 40%, our yield is 3.5%. And so that's the key important part. We returned more than $300 million a year in just dividends. And then, we use our excess cash flow to really buyback the stock to the extent that we're not investing in other places.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, on wu.com, the growth rate has been relatively steady over the last year, in the high-20%s. What are your thoughts on being able to maintain that growth rate over the next few years?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I think, it has been obviously a great growth rate, and we believe that we are absolutely growing faster than the competition, and the team is executing very well. Don't forget, I mean, I said we are \u2013 just launched 40 countries, it's only 40 countries to send money to 200 countries. And the new countries will generate until they come really on a revenue generating mode, it will even be better, and then we want to be in 200 countries to send 200 countries, like our agent network.","And so that's something the team is focused. That's something that we are extremely optimistic that our digital expansion will continue. And combining digital with retail, it's the secret sauce, different customer use cases. So, I'm quite optimistic, and the teams are also optimistic on that.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","And those customers, what is it still over 80% that are new to Western Union?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. Still 80% of the customers didn't use the recent \u2013 retail money transferred for the last...","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","For the last couple of years.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","...couple of years. They're still new.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Last question, Business Solutions, last night, FLEETCOR announced the acquisition of Cambridge. I believe they're a direct competitor. That business obviously has not performed the way you wanted it to perform since you've acquired the two businesses. The Cambridge they put out was growing over 20% has 40% margins. What does it take to get your business to \u2013 I mean, why are you underperforming to a competitor like that so much? And is it strategically important to own that business should you consider selling it?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","So, first of all, Western Union Business Solutions is nothing else but moving money cross-border cross-currency. It's not like total different business like a prepaid card business or something like...","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","...loan business. So it is obviously very much linked to our core, which we move cross-currency. So, it makes sense to be within the Western Union. The second thing is that, on that business, the foreign exchange part \u2013 the trading part has not been performing that well. In Europe, we had good results but some in North America and Australia has been a little bit, over the few quarters, not the performance we want to have it.","I think it's important also to keep that business. It does has some \u2013 provides benefit for our internal working capital, and we've been extremely good on that one. But on this business, there are two big benefits which the competitor don't have. The payments part of the business, like we have the most universities. It's growing very \u2013 the student payment is one of the product, which is growing very fast, and we have other things like that.","Utility payments is also cross-border. And the other thing is also, we do \u2013 if you recall about three quarters ago or something like that, we announced our EDGE platform, where we combine the importers and exporters in one platform and provide service for both of them. This is also something that has a future about that, so it has asset (54:48).","Now, from the business performance, I agree from that \u2013 it could be better, and we'll focus on that. And so, it is definitely something that we are very much focused on it.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","We're almost at the bottom now. We'll take one more question.","Operator","Okay. The final question will come from Alex Veytsman of Monness Crespi.","Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.","Yeah, greetings. A quick question on the EU and CIS regions. So, the transaction growth rate was 8% year-on-year for the quarter. Could you help us break it down, if the traction is coming mostly from Western Europe or CIS? And also given that transaction growth rate has accelerated over the last several quarters, should we be expecting the same levels more or less for this region throughout 2017?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, the Europe CIS region, first of all, was quite stable till the last quarter. We had the same level of constant currency growth, 4% in both quarters. And the transaction growth lift that you saw was largely coming from the Russian market, which is at a relatively lower revenue per transaction. And so, the Russian and the Ukraine business performed quite well, but that's not necessarily going to continue for the full year. There are some other restrictions coming in those markets. So, that's really you saw the transaction lift, but the overall revenue growth was pretty consistent with last quarter.","Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.","Great.

We are pleased with how we started the year. Our core money transfer business continued to rebound and key growth areas such as westernunion.com online money transfer and Western Union Business Solutions delivered strong performance. We also continue to generate and deploy strong cash flow for our shareholders. Overall, first quarter revenues increased 2% or 4% constant currency. This improvement trend reflects benefits from the previously implemented consumer money transfer pricing actions, the investments in Digital and the investments in Business Solutions that we put in place over the last couple of years. Consumer money transfer transactions increased a healthy 9% in the quarter. Both international and U.S.-generated transactions, including domestic money transfer, delivered strong transaction growth.","As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the rebound in our retail-initiated consumer money transfer business, which represents approximately 95% of our C2C money transfer revenue. Total C2C revenue increased 3% in the quarter or 4% constant currency, as the pricing actions and other promotions we undertook beginning in late 2012 are now translating into revenue growth. Mexico, for example, delivered an 8% increase in revenues, which was the country's first positive quarterly revenue growth in 2 years. In addition to the pricing actions, Mexico has also benefited from the competitive market changes and strong growth from our Vigo brands.","Westernunion.com money transfer revenue growth accelerated to 45% in the quarter, driven by more consumer acquisition, stronger retention and increased revenue per customer. Enhancements to our platforms, mobile services, pay-in and payout options and risk management in various markets all contributed to the strong results. Mobile access continues to grow fast. In the first quarter, over 30% of our U.S. westernunion.com transactions were initiated through mobile devices. Our total electronic channels revenue increased 36% in the quarter.","As I have mentioned in the past, we believe digitally initiated money transfer is the fastest-growing segment of the market, and it is bringing new customer segments to Western Union. We have westernunion.com online money transfer sites in 24 countries and payout capabilities in over 200 countries and territories. As we combine this foundation with ongoing service additions and enhancements, we have a great opportunity to continue to expand our online business globally. In addition, providing consumers more choice by offering our services through other online and mobile relationships remains a key part of our strategy.","We are pleased with Business Solutions, which delivered a third consecutive quarter of low double-digit constant currency revenue growth. Our focus on sales execution, customer retention and more products and services is leading to good results in the growing B2B market. I would also like to highlight our strong cash flow generation, which allowed us to again return significant funds to shareholders. In the quarter, we returned nearly $250 million through dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with our past practices, we seek to balance appropriate investment in the business with returning available funds to shareholders. Our dividend yield is around 3%. And as we mentioned last quarter, we have a $500 million share repurchase authorization in place, which we currently expect to utilize most of this year.","So based on this good start of the year, we have affirmed our 2014 financial outlook. As we look to the future, our organization is focused on serving our customers. Globally, many people have unmet financial needs for cause for the money movement. They may be migrants, small business owners, travelers, NGOs. There are many use cases, and we strive to provide solution to those needs. Our vision is to be the recognized global leader in providing innovative solutions, high-service levels and omni-channel integration for cross-border and cross-currency money transfer. Over the past few years, we invested in the business and in our foundation. We plan to continue to leverage our global network, compliance and operational capabilities, and we believe we are well positioned to connect the digital and physical worlds for consumers and businesses alike.","In 2014, we continued to focus on 3 key areas: strengthening consumer money transfer with an emphasis on digital expansion, growing Western Union Business Solutions and generating and deploying strong cash flow for our shareholders. We believe our first quarter results are tracking with our plans in these areas, and we look forward to continue to drive the business and report our progress throughout the year.","Now to give you a more detail on the first quarter financial results, I would like to turn the call over to Raj.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Thank you, Hikmet. As mentioned, the first quarter results were in line with our expectations and consistent with our full year outlook. Total revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of 2% or 4% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Consumer money transfer, Business Solutions and consumer bill payments each delivered positive constant currency revenue growth in the quarter. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue increased 3% or 4% on a constant currency basis. The 3% growth compares to a 1% decline in reported revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. Revenue trends continued to improve from prior quarters as transaction growth remains strong, and we passed the anniversary of some of the key price actions. Total transactions increased 9% in the quarter, driven by our previously implemented pricing actions in key corridors and strong growth in westernunion.com and other electronic channels. The World Bank and Aite each recently issued updated market estimates for cross-border remittances. Both estimated 2013 cross-border principal growth at 4%, which was consistent with our results last year. And their 2014 projections for the market range from 5% to 7%. Western Union's C2C cross-border principal increased 8% in the first quarter or 9% on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction declined 1% and was flat constant currency. The spread between the C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 6 percentage points, including a negative 1% impact from currency. For C2C, the impact of net price decreases was approximately 3% in the quarter, while mix had a negative impact of approximately 2%. The price impact primarily relates to actions taken in 2013, and we still anticipate 2014 pricing actions to be modest and back in line with historical standards.","Turning to the regions. In addition to strong transaction trends, each of the regions delivered improved constant currency revenue growth rates relative to last year's fourth quarter. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 1% year-over-year, including a positive 1% impact from currency with Germany continuing to deliver strong growth. Transactions in the region increased 10%, aided by the pricing actions implemented in 2013. North America revenue grew 1% in the quarter, including a negative 1% impact from currency, and transactions increased 4%. The revenue increase was an improvement from the declines in the region each quarter in 2013. U.S. to Mexico and U.S. outbound both delivered good revenue growth in the quarter. Mexico revenue grew 8%, and transactions increased 12%. Domestic money transfer revenue increased 1% on transaction growth of 5% in the quarter, and we continue to see most of the growth coming from the lower principal bands. U.S. domestic money transfer represents approximately 8% of total company revenues.","In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue increased 4% compared with the year-ago quarter with a positive 1% impact from currency, and transactions increased 8%. Saudi Arabia and the UAE were key drivers of the region's revenue growth. Asia Pacific revenue grew 1%, including a negative 3% impact from currency translation and benefited from growth in the Philippines and Japan. Transactions in Asia Pacific increased 8%. The Latin America and Caribbean region was -- revenue was down 4% from the prior year period, including a negative 9% impact from currency. The currency impact was primarily due to the weakening of the Argentine peso. Transactions increased 6% in the region.","Finally, westernunion.com delivered strong C2C revenue growth of 45% in the quarter, while transactions increased 55%. U.S.-originated online transactions grew 56%. wu.com had strong revenue growth in many key corridors, including U.S. and U.K. to India, U.S. to the Philippines, U.S. to Mexico and U.S. domestic money transfer. In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 4% in the quarter, but increased 7% on a constant currency basis. The differential between the reported and constant currency rates was primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso. In the U.S., growth in the electronic bill pay business was partially offset by a decline from cash walk-in, which is consistent with prior trends. Business Solutions revenue grew 7% or 10% on a constant currency basis. Strong performance from Australia and Canada and good growth in customers use of hedging products helped drive the constant currency revenue increase.","Turning to consolidated margins. The first quarter GAAP operating margin was 20.1% compared to 22.4% in the prior-year period. The margin decline was primarily a result of higher average C2C retail commission rates, increased compliance expenses and higher funding costs in consumer bill payments. These impacts were partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives and lower integration costs. Average retail commission rates increased as expected, primarily due to the renewal of some large agents. Compliance expense in the quarter was approximately 3% of revenue. We continue to expect compliance expense to be in the 3.5% to 4% range for the year as we hire people and implement more programs in the complex, evolving global environment. Funding costs in consumer bill payments increased due to higher interchange costs, which were driven by more credit card usage from our customers and larger principal transactions. The benefits from cost savings initiatives relate primarily to comparisons with costs in the first quarter of last year when we incurred $8 million of expenses related to cost savings initiatives and Travelex Global Business Payments integration. We also began to realize some of the related cost savings in this year's first quarter, although we expect most of the incremental $45 million in anticipated savings for the year to be in the remaining 3 quarters. EBITDA margin was 25.1% in the quarter compared to 27.1% a year ago. Our tax rate of 10.7% in the first quarter benefited from some discrete items, including the impact of some foreign currency fluctuations. We expect a rate of around 15% for the full year.","Reported earnings per share in the quarter was $0.37, which was the same as the prior year period. The C2C operating segment margin was 22.9% compared to 25.4% in the prior year period, with the decline driven primarily by higher average retail commission rates and increased compliance costs, partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives.","The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 20.2% compared to 24.7% in the prior year period. The margin decline was primarily due to the higher funding costs related to increased interchange expense. Business Solutions reported an operating loss of $4 million for the quarter compared with a loss of $6 million for the same period last year. Both quarters included depreciation and amortization of approximately $15 million. The reduction in operating loss was driven mainly by strong revenue growth and lower integration costs, partially offset by timing of certain expenses.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $197 million for the quarter, while capital expenditures were $46 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.8 billion and cash of $1.7 billion. Approximately 40% of the cash was held by United States entities. In February, we paid off $500 million of maturing debt, which had already been prefunded with issuances last year. We spent $180 million on share repurchases in the quarter, retiring 11 million shares and paid $68 million in dividends. At quarter end, we had 539 million shares outstanding and $320 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, which expires in June 2015. So we believe the year has started off on track. Our consumer money transfer business revenue trends have improved. wu.com and other electronic channels are strong, and Business Solutions is delivering good growth. We continue to both invest in the business and return funds to shareholders. Based on the first quarter results and current business trends, we are affirming the full year financial outlook that we provided in February, including our outlook for earnings per share in a range of $1.40 to $1.50.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So good execution on the transaction growth, continuing to see momentum for the pricing changes. I guess, first of all, can you give us some color on -- you may have said this on the call, or maybe I missed it. But the actual growth in transactions where you didn't change pricing in the corridor, what was that this quarter? And maybe a little more context as to the growth trends you're seeing online. I know the numbers look very good, continuing to be in the 50% plus range. But what would we expect to see once some of the pricing changes there anniversary?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Hey, Darrin. This is Raj. Thanks for the question. We didn't break out the price corridors in terms of transaction growth this time, so you didn't miss that. As we've said before, the price actions typically will allow transactions to peak within a 12-month period. So we've more than anniversaried most of the price actions. And so that's really part of our normal business. So we're not going to break that out anymore. But clearly, those price actions are having a positive impact on our transaction growth. And with respect to Dot.com, we're very pleased with the results there. 55% transaction growth, that's very much in line with expectations and 45% revenue growth, which is a significant step-up from last quarter. We would expect the transaction growth to moderate somewhat, but the revenue growth continues to accelerate there.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. That's helpful. With respect to the -- go ahead. We're you going to...","Michael A. Salop","Yes. Just going to add. Online, we're always doing a lot of things in terms of promotion and looking at the right price points. But the major pricing actions we did there were in the fourth quarter of '12, so we've anniversaried those already.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up. On the online business, I mean, with respect to margins on the domestic business or the business overall, I mean, you've said in the past, those margins are in line with corporate averages. Does that still hold true? And any other opportunities you see improve margins in the U.S, whether it's East to East [ph] development, or any other technological innovations that might help that along? And then lastly, are you still on track for the $500 million target for the electronic business that you'd laid out awhile back?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. Let me try. And maybe Hikmet, you can jump in afterwards. But in terms of margins, again, we're really pleased with the growth in the business. Clearly, we're in investment mode right. And right now, we're below company average margins. But we do believe that as the business scales and grows that top line like it is that we will be able to get closer to the company margins on an average basis. As we rollout more funding options, paying in by bank or paying out to a bank account, clearly, that will help the margin picture. But that business continues to deliver on our expectations, and we're very pleased with the results there overall.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. I -- Darrin, just to add on that. Don't forget that we are in 24 countries with our online money transfer and send countries, and we are connecting to 200 countries. That gives us a huge portfolio. We are very pleased with our U.S. money transfer. We are very pleased with our transaction growth on the main corridors. Besides that, that really attracts also new customers to our network. We know that. From our data, 80% of our customers are new to westernunion.com online, are money transfer customers. And we are pleased with that. By the way, it doesn't cannibalize our existing business. That question comes up every time. We know that our business like U.S. to Philippines, U.S. to India, it's not going on, on the online very strong. It's also retail money transfer. We had saw a solid growth, good growth there. So I'm generally pleased with the business performance.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. Just the last one. I'll turn it back to the queue. The pricing changes you put into effect over the -- from 2012 onward, I mean, those really should start to see more and more inflection, I think, as I mentioned, earlier also, which means from a revenue-per-transaction standpoint, that should start to get better. I mean, with regard to respective pricing changes going forward, I mean, what should we expect? I mean, are we really back to the 1% to 2% or 3% change now per year? Is that something we can use to model?","Hikmet Ersek","I feel comfortable with our historical pricing models, Darrin. I mean, we always do pricing actions in corridor by corridor. We look at that, we always did that. And as you know, our business is quite complex. We are in 16,000 corridors. We look band by band. We look corridor by corridor. But I'm pleased with our current pricing structure, also with our historical direction. I don't see any big changes coming in near term.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to get your general reaction to Walmart's initiative that was announced a couple of weeks ago. I mean, you guys expecting any kind of share loss around that, or any sort of competitive response? And do you guys expect that Walmart will ultimately extend that service to include cross-border remittances to its stores in places like Mexico or elsewhere? And if so, is that a potential concern for you? Or is that something that you have a plan of attack against?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I can't talk about Walmart's plans, obviously. It's not our agent, and it doesn't impact us so much because we have a very strong U.S. domestic money transfer business. Just putting under perspective, it's only 8% of our total company revenues. And putting things on perspective, we have many, many agents globally, which gives us 500,000 locations. It gives us -- we have thousands of contracts. And none of our countries are bigger than 5% of our total revenue and none of our biggest -- even the largest agent is not bigger than 4% of our total company revenue. So the diversification of portfolio, that's the beauty of Western Union business. Being everywhere, having so many agents distributing our revenue, it gives in a very good position. Basic, on the U.S. domestic money transfer business, I mean, our business have been growing very good in Q1, right? We grew by 1% by revenue and 5% by transaction. And these are the actions -- don't forget, these are the actions we've put in place in 2009, still growing, and we are gaining with 5 for 50 promotions a lot of transactions, lower band. We are pleased with our transactions. We have 46,000 locations. I don't know how many Walmart has, about 4,000 locations or something like that. So our 46,000 locations do serve customers. The customers value the speed. The customers value our brand. The customers value our locations. But we do also pricing actions if you need it quarter-by-quarter, band by band. But it's -- I just want to put things in perspective here.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Right. Right. But it sounds like, for now, you guys aren't planning on having to take any material new pricing actions for the balance of this year?","Hikmet Ersek","I don't think -- if you look at our portfolio, as I said earlier to Darrin, we do always look at pricing quarter-by-quarter, band by band, product by product, but I don't think that we are going to have big material pricing actions this year.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. Any impact on your business in Russia or the surrounding reasons just from all the geopolitical tension? I mean, anything that's been detectable?","Hikmet Ersek","Good that you asked that question. Being in 200 countries, we always have this [indiscernible].","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Right. With Arab Spring a couple of years ago.","Hikmet Ersek","I know. You asked that question. I remember. But no, we don't see -- just to put again here the perspective, Russia is a very important market for is, but it's only 2% of our total company revenue, Ukraine is about 1% of our total company revenue. But we do have about 20,000 locations in Russia, and we do have about 15,000 locations in Ukraine, which gives us a good presence here. And we don't see any customer changes, behavior changes from our current business. We don't see any impact from the environment there yet.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's great to know. And just one housekeeping for Raj on the tax side. Can you just review what the tax benefit in Q1 was? I know you said you're still going to be 15% for the full year. Is that kind of a similar tax rate each of the last 3 quarters? Or are there any ins and outs that we should be thinking about from a modeling perspective to get us to the full year 15%?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Jason, there were just some discrete benefits every some in Q1. Some of it's related to currency benefits. We still expect the tax rate for the year to be around 15%. And we'll -- as we move through the year, we'll see what that means for us overall. But there were just some discrete benefits in Q1.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just some onetime stuff? Okay.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes.","Operator","And next we have a question from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a follow-on to Jason's question with Walmart, just the private label or store-to-store concept, in general. Do you see the potential for some of your larger against to consider doing something similar? I know it's a big change in the model. But from a foot traffic standpoint, I can see why certain agents might want to try it. Thoughts there?","Hikmet Ersek","I don't see -- I don't know any plans that -- any white label plans from our constant -- retail agents that it's going to do something like that. I can't talk for their plan. But don't forget, our 46,000 locations is easy to go to next corner and pick up the money from next corner in the U.S. We have, alone in the U.S., 46,000 locations. And it's -- I believe we are very competitive here. We'd really -- the U.S. domestic money transfer, Raj, was growing quarter-by-quarter over the past years, right?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes.","Hikmet Ersek","And we've been executing principal here. I don't -- I can't speak what the -- I don't hear any rumors on the market, and I can't speak to rumors.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Good. Just wanted to make sure. I appreciate that. Just on the -- I heard the commission comment -- I'm curious about just the renewal rate of large agents and, specifically just, exclusivity opening up, is that changing the pace? Is that changing at all as you go into the renewal process?","Hikmet Ersek","No. I think we do see sometimes competitive environment, sometimes not. But having personally negotiated hundreds of agent negotiations, and we have thousands of agents. There will be always some competitor. Sometimes, a higher agent commission. Sometimes, a lower. We do see some higher agent commissions in the current environment -- competitive environment that also impacts a little bit our bottom line. But generally, I would say that I do not see big changes from agent commissions. But we do, in some corridors, you know how it works, Tien-tsin, negotiation by negotiation, agent by agent, country by country, regulatory environment, all that affects the agent negotiations so...","Rajesh K. Agrawal","And Tien-tsin, just to add, our goal, longer term, is to bring overall distribution costs down, and we believe that we can achieve that with the mix of the business as it changes to be a little bit more electronic. And then as we bring new agents into the mix, we also believe that we can bring them in at a generally lower overall commission rate. So there are a lot of different dynamics in that business, and we're working through all of those to get the right results.","Hikmet Ersek","It's a good point, Raj, but yes.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's great. And then Raj, just housekeeping, no restructuring cost this quarter, did I hear that correctly? That's all I have.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. We have some minor costs. But unless there is something more material, we probably won't break that out. It's just part of our normal business. We're continuously looking for opportunities to take cost out of the business. And so nothing material.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanting to see if we can get an update on the impact of the higher compliance costs. What kind of impact that had on transaction volumes do you guys figure?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Bryan, let me start with that. We did see some impact in the first quarter. As you know, we mentioned that for the full year, we expect about a 1- to 2-point negative impact on our top line. That's still in our outlook. That's still what we expect, especially as we ramp up in the compliance spending. We spent about 3% in the first quarter, and we expect that to ramp up the rest of the year in the 3.5% to 4% range. So we do still expect some impact to the top line.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just seeing this through. I mean, the common question we get is, does that continue into 2015? Will you still have an additional 1 to 2 head point -- or 1 to 2 points of headwind from compliance, or does it start to level out?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Well, my -- our goal is to not have much impact, but that's something that we can't predict. What we do is when we put these compliance actions in place, initially, we see a negative customer reaction, and we'd like to learn from those customer experiences and improve upon those over time. And that's really our goal. So I can't really predict about next year. But the goal is to improve upon the interactions with customers and put the right systems and processes in place so that the customer experience can be a better one.","Hikmet Ersek","Saying that, though, the 2014 investment, Bryan, 3.5% to 4%, was a significant step-up from the last year investment. So we believe that we will have good programs in place. I can't say -- speak, as Raj said, for the future of how the relative environment looks like. But from today point of view, I think that team is doing a great job, putting the things right in place that we have with the compliance programs that it's a competitive -- even a competitive advantage. And I can see that part of that competitive advantage already in some countries like Mexico. Part of our growth in the Mexico is driven through the compliance environment, and we do have programs. We are increasing our programs, and we are investing here. And we are trying to build a competitive advantage like in Mexico and in other countries.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. I was going to ask that. On the higher compliance costs, where -- which corridors are being impacted by that?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, it's a global program, by the way, right? So I mean, we have to -- it's a really -- it has a -- if you are in 200 countries, it's beautiful. But it has also a price to be in 200 countries, and that's the main corridor. It's you know that in the past, we invested in Southwest Border. That's -- additional to that, we have this investment like in the European union. We do have investments in some receiving countries and in Africa. And we do have in Middle East. It's all over actually, Bryan. And I think we have a good program that we cover the world with that investment.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","And we have various KYC programs that we're implementing. We're implementing know-your-agent programs. It's pretty broad based, and it's in various parts of the world, as Hikmet said.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Last question for me. Europe and the CIS region, the transaction growth accelerated. I guess I'm curious on the economic front. Any signs of stability, finally, in that region that's causing that, or just would be curious to know if we're getting any kind of economic -- potential economic rebound?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, my view didn't change from last quarter. Unfortunately, it didn't change, I would love to report that the economic environment is better, but it's also not worse, that's the fortunate part. So I would say that it's the same. We do see some strong transaction growth in Germany. We do see some improvement in Southern European part like Spain and Italy. Our business is quite stable there, but I wouldn't say that it's now sunshine yet there.","Michael A. Salop","Yes. We did a lot of the pricing actions in Europe in the first half of last year as well, so we're getting some benefit from that now.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","This is Rayna Kumar for David. Do you expect to increase your dividend? And when will the board be making a decision on the dividend?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Sure. Hey, Rayna. This is Raj. The dividend is something that we evaluate on an ongoing basis with the board. We're very happy with where the dividend is right now. It's at about a 35% payout, which is very much in line with S&P 500 paying companies. So I expect that as the business performs and improves, the board will want to look at that again to see what the right level is. But our policy has been to return capital to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends, and I expect that we'll continue that as well.","Operator","And the next question is from Sara Gubins of Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to go back to Mexico for a minute. You signed an additional, I think it was 10,000 agents in Mexico last year. Are those now all up and running? And are you comfortable with the current footprint in Mexico? Or do you think you'll continue to make a bigger push to expand in the region?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, Sara, first of all, we are very pleased with our quarter on Mexico. I have to say that the 8% revenue growth is quite good. We did put programs, compliance programs, agent programs into place that -- they are working. We did sign agents to expand our footprint in Mexico. We are -- did not enroll all of them yet. They are in the pipeline and we believe that we're going to significantly increase our presence in Mexico with new host-to-host connections, new IT systems and new programs there. And I'm quite excited. Actually, I was in Mexico about 2 weeks ago and just came back from a meeting there and -- with a new potential agent there. And I was quite excited to increase my footprint there.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like some more to come. And then as we think about the balance of the year, your comparisons get significantly more difficult throughout the year in terms of transactions. Is it reasonable to think that the trend should flow in the back half of the year on a more difficult comp?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","As we -- Sara, we did see some pricing as well to Mexico, and we -- typically, we expect the pricing actions to cause transactions to peak within a 12-month period. So I expect that transaction growth is likely to level off. But we can't really predict what's going to happen each quarter. But generally, that would be the trend that we would see. We also expect to see good revenue growth for the year. So that's about where we are. Revenue growth would typically pick up in the 12 to 18 months period after pricing. And so that's what we're seeing.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Sorry, was that comment about transactions overall or Mexico-specific?","Hikmet Ersek","Overall.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Overall.","Hikmet Ersek","I think that the -- what we did -- Sara, we did thousands of pricing actions, and we do it constantly quarter-by-quarter. And if you do that, the cost -- revenue picks up about 12 to 18 months. And that generally has been not only Mexico, worldwide.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just another question on compliance. Can you give us an update on the subpoena that you disclosed in your 10-K from the middle district of Pennsylvania? And has there been any update since the 10-K on that issue?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. Smitti, I would just refer you to our 10-Q that we are filing today. We don't really have more comments beyond that. It's early in the process, and it's something that we're working through. We have good monitoring systems in place. We have a multifaceted program to prevent consumer fraud and an outreach [ph] program with consumers. So that's about all we can say right now, and we're working through that.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then maybe just on the Digital channel where you continue to see very good growth. Can you talk about how you're investing in westernunion.com and some of the other new solutions?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Sure.","Hikmet Ersek","Well, generally, why don't you just give a shout to me. I don't know.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. That team is doing a great job, and I've spent a fair amount of time with them, and they're hitting on all cylinders. The 3 key areas that they're spending on: First is around the consumer experience. They have a new platform in place, and we're rolling that out to more markets. We're also adding more funding capabilities in different markets. Secondly, we're also adding more customers to the mix. And as Hikmet mentioned earlier, 80% of the customers that are visiting wu.com are new to the Western Union franchise. So we're adding significant new customers. And lastly, we're expanding distribution, either through ourselves or through other partners. So those are where the primary investments are, and they're paying off, as you can see. And we're very pleased with the results.","Operator","And the next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess my first question was, I'm trying to understand the spread between wu.com transactions and revenues. And it seems to fluctuate a lot between just 20% this quarter because it's been as high as 40%. Why does it bounce around so much? And why is it so different from the spread in your traditional business, which is more like mid-single digits?","Michael A. Salop","Yes, Ashwin. This is Mike. We did some major pricing actions primarily in the fourth quarter of last year. There were some things we did prior to that as well. But we had some major actions in the fourth quarter. So we just anniversaried those as we went through the fourth quarter of 2013. It's just that we did those in the fourth quarter of '12. So now we have passed that anniversary, and it's more just mix issues and other promotions in the business. And that's why the spread has narrowed.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, okay. Now my second question is with regards to segment margins, and I'm kind of looking at C2B margins and also B2B x integration costs, and they were both down. Is that currency in the C2B? Well, I'm trying to understand why in each of those areas why margins were down. And what's the trend we should expect going through the year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Sure. Ashwin, this is Raj. On the C2B business, as I mentioned in some of my comments, there were a couple of things that impacted us there were, higher credit card usage by our customers. We opened up some new funding options in certain parts of our business, so consumers started to use more carded-type transactions. Secondly, we had higher principal transactions as well, and some of that higher PPT was related to the severe weather we had in the U.S., which caused utility payments to be higher. So that business achieved about a 20% margin last year, and that's about where it is in the first quarter, and I would expect it to be in that range for the year as well. With respect to B2B, that business -- last year, we achieved low-teens EBITDA x integration. And in the first quarter, we had some timing of expenses that drove the margins down. But I would expect to see that improve as we move through the course of the year. Longer term, we still expect that business to expand margins as it gains scale and leverages the infrastructure that it's put in the last couple of years. So those are some of the reasons behind the margins that you saw in the first quarter.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And also, I'm trying to understand with regards to C2C transaction growth. Obviously, through the course of last year, transaction growth rebounded pretty nicely. But it seems to have plateaued the last 3 quarters right around 9%. And is it fair to expect further acceleration? Or is it kind of upper-single digit is about what you can do without price concessions and more marketing dollars? Or how should we think of that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Ashwin, we haven't really provided a transaction growth outlook. And so I won't give you a specific number. But generally, as we have said, the pricing actions are driving a lot of the transaction growth that you've seen in the last 3 quarters, and that continues to have a good effect. But we would normally see transaction growth leveling off after -- within a 12-month period. But then the thing that we are seeing is that as expected, the revenue growth is picking up. In the 12 to 18 months after a pricing, we typically expect to see revenue growth pick up, which is what's happening. So those are some of the parameters. I would expect transaction growth, to your question though, to level off.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Understood. One last housekeeping question. You did mention in the Q, you have about $700 million in the U.S. I just wanted to clarify, is all of that really available for any actions you might want to take, buybacks, whatever?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","If it was all available, I would probably use it. But most of the cash on the balance sheet is not available. We had $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter and, as you said, about $700 million in the U.S. A lot of it is cash in-transit. Another chunk, we hold for regulatory purposes. And then we just need money for liquidity purposes. We move hundreds of billions of dollars around every year, and we need to keep some cash on hand for liquidity purposes. But clearly, we do things as efficiently as we can. And to the extent that there's any excess cash, we will use it. But I would say most of it's not readily available.","Operator","And our next question will come from George Mihalos of Credit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to start off on the compliance side. Nice to see you reiterate the compliance amounting to about 3.5% to 4% of revenue this year. But will that be uniform throughout the course of the year? Or should we see 1 quarter versus another maybe have a little bit more or a little bit less of that expense?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Hey, George. It's Raj. The -- I can't give you a quarterly number on that. We expect about 3.5% to 4%, and it really depends on the pace at which we hire and the pace at which we put programs in place. Clearly we're going to try to do things as efficiently as we can. And if we don't need to spend the money, we won't. But that's our current expectation for the full year.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just for the first quarter, were you within that range, 3.5% or 4%? Or can you share that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Okay. That's our full year expectation. For the first quarter, we were at 3%.","Hikmet Ersek","We were at 3%, yes.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. 3%, 3%. Okay. And then just going back to your commentary around trying to add some leverage in the margin in terms of long term bringing commissions down. Obviously, it's a competitive landscape, but some of the steps that we saw recently or some of the announcements. As it relates to Walmart, do you think that could potentially impede a competitor from maybe approaching some of your agent partners on the receive side? Just curious what your thoughts are there.","Hikmet Ersek","Well, competition was always here, right? We all -- George, we were always competing. And I've been in the market 14 years, and I've been always competing with the competition here. But I don't see any big changes. Don't forget that our top 40 agents have been 17 years exclusive with us. They like us. They like our brand. They like that we bring customers to them. They like that it's a win-win situation. And they like to serve our customers. And I did not see any big changes here. We do have definitely agent by agent some negotiations. And sometimes, the negotiations are tough. Sometimes, you have to fly around the world and do these negotiations. But it's a win-win situation. And I'm very pleased with our current agent structure, and that gives us 500,000 locations, 100,000 ATMs, and that's a huge, huge, huge number.","Operator","And the next question will come from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Hikmet, I know you said you haven't heard any rumors about agents wanting to do private label. But I'm wondering in your top 30 agents, do any of them have the option to do a private label if they wanted to?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, don't forget, we do have agents for years. They do. They have their own money transfer business in some countries internationally, right? They do have -- banks, for instance. We work with banks. They have been doing money transfer for years, and they switch to us, or they do both. I don't see -- it's not like we don't do that, and they have their -- or if you send the money from one bank to other bank, it's kind of a private label. But they choose us. Customers choose us because they prefer to send money from U.S. to Vietnam or from Finland to Argentina in minutes, and that's what we provide, and that's our beauty in crossing the borders. I don't see -- within the environment, we do have a pretty good business model, I guess.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then I'm just wondering, have you seen the impact of the compliance on other regional companies? It seems as though you've spent a lot of money on compliance because you're the largest. Are you starting to see that trickle down to some of your other competitors that might be a little bit smaller?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I can't speak name of them, but I know that we are investing a lot, and I believe it's going to be a competitive advantage. I only can tell some -- in some countries, as I mentioned earlier, that we do see some people saying that we are -- or we can't invest in this business. There's obviously companies like Western Union, who has the right compliance program or investing in the current compliance, upgrade their compliance programs. And that brings us definitely customers. My example was Mexico. We see there. But generally, I would say that my hope is that it's good for the industry that everybody invests here and invests significantly here and do a good business here. And that's what we do. We believe that we are investing in the right way. And to comply with the regulations and being -- having a good compliance program.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And I know, Raj, this might be a little early. But when you had indicated the increase in compliance, one of the things that I think you said is you're hoping to automate some of the processes so that maybe you can control the compliance costs a little bit more. Is -- have you looked at that? Is that an opportunity? Or is it just still too early to tell what you might be able to do in terms of automating and connect-controlling that compliance pause [ph] as we go forward?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Hey, Kartik. It is early, but we're always looking for opportunities to automate our processes. That's an ongoing initiative for us. Our goal in the short term is to get the programs and processes in place. But longer term, it is to automate, and that's where some of the technology spending comes into play, that our CapEx is expected to be about 5% of revenues this year, which is a little bit higher than the last couple of years, and that's part of the reason. So we are trying to automate those things as much as we can, and we learn as well over time.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. I think compliance and compliance optimization is one of the highest programs we have in the company. We have an executive who is only focused on that to upgrade that, to do it in a best way. That's why we invest here, and we believe it's going to be long-term a competitive advantages. It will be automated everything, and we believe that we will have the -- we -- aim to have the best-in-class one.","Operator","And our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","My question's around wu.com and the strategy there a little bit just with regard to, I guess, a few different initiatives, at least rumors of which have been bandied about. One would be instant ACH and your outlook for offering instant ACH, and which markets do you think that's the most attractive. And then second, I think, Hikmet, did I hear you say that about 30% of wu.com transactions are mobile? I guess I'd like to hear a little bit about the mobile strategy, too? And how important you think that is and thoughts around new mobile apps and so forth? So just kind of focusing on -- in on how you view that business and those offerings evolving here over the next several years.","Hikmet Ersek","Raj, do you want to take the first part? And I'll take the mobile part.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Hey, yes. Andrew, let me just talk about instant ACH. We were very happy with the results in wu.com, and that business is doing some great things. We operate in 24 markets around the world, where we send money from into 200 countries and territories into cash or to retail locations, and then we can also send money into a bank account in 50 markets around the world. And you've already seen the success that, that business is having with the customer experience, adding more customers to the mix, as well as the distribution expansion. So we're doing a lot of great things already in that business. And from our perspective, instant ACH is going to be another feature that our customers will want, and we'll add that later this year. We have an ACH product in the U.S. today. It's on a 4-day basis. And we have similar bank funding mechanisms in a few other countries, and we're expanding that on an ongoing basis. So throughout instant ACH, it is important to add later this year, but it's not the only thing that's going to drive this business. Clearly, we're already having a lot success around that. And then, Hikmet, I'll give it to you for the [indiscernible].","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. Just to complete on the ACH program. As you said, there are different ACH program around the world, right? In Germany, an ACH sounds different like a direct debit from your account than in France and then in the U.S. So -- and being into -- that's the beauty of being in 24 countries, right, and expanding our portfolio. I mean, long term, I want to be with Digital in 200 countries. A big part of that, that's the second part of your question, is the mobile. I believe on the mobile. I think it's the future is that people sending money instantly from their mobile phone and receiving on their mobile phone, and we've been with our Western Union apps in the U.S., very successful, 30% of the transactions are already on mobile. And the people do use fast money sending from their mobile, and I think it's going to be a growing area. I'm going to continue to look at that. And we're going to have -- continue to evolve -- involve to invest more on the mobile to sending money. But don't forget, in the end of today, you need the Western Union fundamentals. You need the operation. We have 100 -- we payout in 121 currencies. Not many companies can do that in minutes. Not many companies do that. We have operational excellence. In the middle, we have the compliance programs. Not many companies can combine worldwide hybrid economies, sending money from your iPad in minutes to rural areas of Bihar in India. We can do that, drop money in rupees in minutes. I think -- and that's -- adding on that mobile function is, I think, a very important part of my strategy.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is it -- for how long, I guess, do you see not specifically, but conceptually, would you see or be willing to do things like subsidize interchange and so forth to drive volume? Is there a -- as that business grows faster and gets bigger, is there a sensitivity to sort of the incremental costs in that versus the lower cost, but still somewhat slower and maybe riskier, hence more expensive ACH network?","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Andrew, we're evaluating all different options. It's a balance of continuing the success that we've had and then looking at new funding options. We're doing that in many markets, and we'll do that in the U.S. as well. But we want to manage the risk around the instant ACH product, which you really have to manage well. But if you can get the formula right, it can be a nice growth driver. So we're managing all that. We'll look at all the options there.","Michael A. Salop","And Andrew, we typically have different prices in different corridors, as you can imagine. But where we can, we often have higher fees for credit card funding as opposed to bank funding, so more of the promotional is driving to the lower cost bank funding.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it sort of depends on which area you were talking about?","Michael A. Salop","Yes.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last, Hikmet, it sounded like last quarter, you were kind of getting away from highlighting the agent count, perhaps trying to rationalize the agent base. Could you give us an update there? And kind of -- are were thinking -- should we be thinking about directionally more agent concentration rather than less over time?","Hikmet Ersek","No. You should think more that, we're going to get more agent locations and more distribution and more ATMs. I'm still driving to my teams to do more touch points. And it could be agent locations. It could be ATMs. It could be a sales kiosk. And I think that's going to expand. What we have done is also -- we also leaned back a little bit, looked at the agent productivity over a few quarters. And found they're saying that, \"Okay. We want to have more revenue, more transaction on the send side from the agent transactions and we focus on that.\" And the secret of that business is also that you have to be in every corner, and I would like to see a Western Union brand in every corner of the world. Is it on an ATM? Is it on a location? Because it's then easy to combine a mobile phone from Denver here to worldwide, any location, rural areas of Vietnam or rural areas of Ukraine or in Turkey to a location. And if you don't have the locations or if you don't have the sales kiosk or if you don't have the ATMs, you can't do that. So my strategy will continue to push my team to expand our distribution channels.","Michael A. Salop","Laura, we'll take one more call.","Operator","The last question will come from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","It looks like your transactions actually increased for the first time in awhile. Any thoughts on that? Principal per transaction was up modestly just as we think about that over the course of '14.","Hikmet Ersek","I think we had already the strong transaction growth, but [indiscernible].","Rajesh K. Agrawal","Yes. Principal per transaction was flat on a constant currency basis. Is that what you were referring to Kevin or...","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Yes, yes. As opposed to -- do you think we're at an inflection point, I think that's actually a pretty big positive as opposed to kind of the declines you've been seeing the last couple of years.","Rajesh K. Agrawal","I think it's really just related to mix and what might change in the businesses. It's hard to predict exactly where that's going to be, but we're pleased with that result. But I think it's mostly just related to mix.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then if you said this, I apologize. But are we still on target for the $500 million by 2015?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. We still have the approximately $500 million as a target. The team and everybody is focused at reaching the approximately $500 million, and I think we are -- have a very strong growth, 45% revenue growth, convince me that we are on that direction.","Michael A. Salop","That was a $500 million target for our Digital business just to clarify. So everybody, thanks for joining us for the call and have a good afternoon.","Rajesh K.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Mike Salop","Thank you Emily. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the Company's 2015 fourth quarter and full-year results and the 2016 outlook and then we will take your questions. The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at WesternUnion.com under the investor relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.","Today's call is being recorded and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2014 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call. I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. We delivered solid earnings, despite global economic and geopolitical challenges which demonstrates the resiliency of our consumers and business model.","Full-year earnings per share increased 5% in 2015, adjusting for our second quarter payment settlement charge and all three of our business segments produced relatively good constant currency revenue growth during the year. Consumer-to-consumer revenues increased 3% in constant currency, with slight growth in retail-initiated money transfer, boosted by very strong results from digital, as WesternUnion.com constant currency revenues increased 26% for the year.","Western Union business solutions constant currency revenue increased 7% and the segment's EBITDA margins improved from 11% to 15%. And consumer bill payments also contributed a strong year, with constant currency revenue growing 11%.","From a macro perspective, while the U.S. market was solid, many other parts of the world experienced slowing economic growth, depreciating currencies or geopolitical instability in 2015 and low oil prices affected several send markets. As a result of many of these factors we saw significant outbound declines in markets such as Russia, Angola, Greece and Libya.","Despite this, transactions and constant currency revenue in our retail money transfer business increased slightly, showing the ongoing importance of cash to consumers around the world, while they continued to drive strong growth from our digital business. Operating margins increased from 20.3% to 20.9%, excluding the charge. And cash flow was strong again, with approximately $1.1 billion generated from operating activities and over $800 million returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Today, we also announced a 3% increase in our first quarter dividend which equates to $0.64 per share annually and we remain committed to consistently returning funds to shareholders.","In addition to the financial results, we made important progress in key strategic areas in 2015. Our strategies are designed to leverage our platform and other capabilities to allow us to access more use cases and customer segments for cross-border money movements. In 2015, we continued our digital expansion, adding 10 new WesternUnion.com online transaction sites which raised our total to 34 countries. We introduced WU Connect which allows us to offer cross-border money transfer services on third-party platforms, such as social media and messaging companies, among others.","We signed our first WU Connect partnership in 2015 with WeChat, a leading Chinese social communications platform and we just announced our second with Viber, a leading mobile messaging app which will make our money transfer service available to their consumers here in the U.S. We're in the process of putting promotional programs in place with both partners and we believe these offerings will generate incremental revenues over the long term. We also made additional investments in our technology in 2015 to position us for the future and rolled out further compliance and anti-money laundering enhancements.","And we expanded our account payout network which will allow us to target account-driven receivers in the future. This is an important new potential revenue source for Western Union, as funds into accounts make up the largest portion of the cross-border principal pool and we now have the capability to send to over 1 billion accounts into 50-plus countries.","We will talk more about our strategic initiatives at our investors day in March, but let me turn now to our 2016 outlook. We expect global economic growth to be challenging and currencies to be volatile again in 2016 and we believe we will continue to deal with external challenges and disruptions in various countries. The stronger dollar is also going to affect our reported results.","We remain confident, however, that our multi-channel business mode delivers solid transactions and constant currency revenue growth this year, with strong cash flow and continued returns of funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We anticipate good constant currency growth from WesternUnion.com and business solutions again in 2016 and steady performance from retail money transfer. Over the long term, we believe the unique combination of our strong global brand, our base network and our cross-border expertise and capabilities, give us great opportunities to expand our reach in cross-border money movements, including adding new use cases with our WU Connect and account payout platforms. I will now like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the fourth quarter results and 2016 outlook in more detail.","Raj Agrawal","Thank you, Hikmet. As I review 2015 financial results, I will focus primarily on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules.","Fourth quarter revenues of $1.4 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior-year period, while reported revenues declined 2% due of the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced fourth quarter revenue by approximately $74 million, compared to the prior-year period. In the consumer-to-consumer segment revenues increased 2% constant currency and recorded revenues declined 3%, while transactions grew 3% in the quarter.","C2C constant currency revenue growth was driven by WesternUnion.com and solid growth from U.S. outbound. In the quarter total C2C cross-border principal declined 4% or increased 1% constant currency. Principal per transaction was down 6% compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to foreign exchange translation as it decreased 1% in constant currency terms.","The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 6 percentage points, including a negative 5% impact from currency. The impact of net price decreases was 1%, while mix had minimal impact in the quarter overall. The pricing environment remains stable and our net C2C pricing change for the full year was essentially flat.","Turning to the regions, due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 8%, but was flat on a constant currency basis. Transactions increased 1%. In the region, strong revenue growth in Germany was largely offset by continued weakness in Russia. The Greece business improved compared to the third quarter, as the market-imposed restrictions were largely lifted, although revenue was still below prior-year levels.","North America revenue was flat or increased 2% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 5%. U.S. outbound continued to deliver strong growth in the quarter, driven primarily by spend to Mexico and Latin America. Our Mexico business again grew faster than the market, based on the latest Banco de Mexico data for both the fourth quarter and full year. The domestic money transfer business produced improved trends in the quarter, as transactions increased 8%, while revenue growth turned positive, with a 2% increase.","In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 5% or 1% constant currency and transactions were down 1%. Similar to the third quarter, declines in Angola and other African countries were offset growth in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 6% or up 1% constant currency, while transactions in the region decreased 5% and continued weakness in the Philippines was partially offset by good growth in Japan and China.","Revenue in the Latin American and Caribbean region was down 2% or increased 5% constant currency, while transactions increased 7% in the quarter. The region's constant currency growth was primarily driven by strong inbound business, from the U.S. WesternUnion.com C2C revenue grew 21% in the quarter or 25% constant currency. WesternUnion.com transactions increased 28%, with U.S. originated online transactions at 35%.","Electronic channels revenue which includes WU.com, account-based money transfer through banks and mobile money transfer represented 7% of total Company revenue in the quarter. I do want to mention that we will be making a slight change to our regional reporting for C2C in the first quarter. Rather than separating the WesternUnion.com business from the regions, we will begin reporting it within the regional numbers, splitting the revenue 50-50 between the send and receive regions. With online transaction sites now in 34 countries, we believe this will give a better perspective on total regional performance, while we will still continue to provide the WesternUnion.com standalone metrics as additional information.","Turning back to the fourth quarter, in the consumer-to-business segment, revenue increased 4% or 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses which was partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-ins. Business solutions reported revenues increased 1% or 8% on a constant currency basis. This revenue growth was driven by Europe and led by strong sales of hedging products.","The consolidated operating profit margin was 20.4% in the fourth quarter, compared to 19.6% in the prior-year period. The operating margin benefited from lower expenses and incremental savings related to cost savings initiatives and from foreign exchange hedge gains. These benefits were partially offset by higher technology expense in the quarter.","We recorded approximately $21 million of hedge gains on our revenue and profit lines in the current period, up from $9 million of gains in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our cost savings initiatives, we had approximately $11 million in expenses in the quarter on actions to drive future cost efficiencies which compares to approximately $30 million of such expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, prior cost savings initiatives contributed approximately $6 million of incremental savings in the fourth quarter and full-year total savings were approximately $32 million.","Technology spending and investment increased compared to the prior year, as we invested in enhancements to our platforms, digital capabilities, settlement systems and data center transformation, all of which will continue in 2016. Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue in the quarter, compared to 3.6% in the prior-year period. For the full year, compliance expense was 3.6% of revenue.","EBITDA margin of 25.4% in the quarter increased from 24.5% in the prior-year period. Our tax rate was 10.4% and increased from 6.1% in last year's fourth quarter which benefited from various non-recurring items. For the full year, our reported tax rate was 11%. Excluding the impact of the Paymap settlement charges in the second quarter, the full-year effective tax rate was 11.8%. Earnings per share in the quarter was flat with last year at $0.42 net increased operating profit and fewer diluted shares outstanding were offset by the increased tax rate.","The C2C segment operating margin was 24% compared to 23.1% in the prior-year period. C2C operating margin also benefited from lower expenses and incremental savings related to cost savings initiatives and foreign exchange hedge gains which were partially offset by higher technology expense. The consumer-to-business operating margin was 11.9% in the quarter, compared to 14.2% in the prior-year period.","The margin decrease was due to the higher local currency expenses in Argentina, including various inflation adjustments and increased technology expense which were partially offset by lower expenses and incremental savings from cost initiatives. Business solutions reported operating profit of $4 million for the quarter, compared to a loss of $5 million for the same period last year.","The operating profit improvement was driven by lower expenses and incremental savings from cost initiatives, depreciation and amortization for business solutions with approximately $13 million in both the current and prior year quarters. EBITDA margins for business solutions improved to 16.2% compared to 7.6% in the fourth quarter of last year.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $1.1 billion for the year. Capital expenditures were $60 million for the fourth quarter and $267 million for the year which equates to just under 5% of revenues. At the end of the quarter, the Company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.3 billion.","The Company utilized U.S. cash to pay off the $250 million debt maturity during the fourth quarter. As a result, approximately 30% of the cash was held by the United States entities as of quarter end. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $69 million.","Our remaining authorization which expires in December of 2017, was $712 million at year end. The outstanding share count at the end of the year was 502 million shares. We also paid $78 million in dividends in the quarter and we're pleased to announce today a further 3% increase in our quarterly dividend.","Turning to the 2016 outlook, as Hikmet mentioned, we expect continued steady constant currency results from retail money transfer and good performance from our growth areas such as WesternUnion.com. We expect the C2C pricing environment to remain stable with strategic pricing adjustments similar to last year. Our money transfer consumers have been resilient which has a given us a reliable business model and solid earnings and cash flow generation, even in some difficult economic periods.","Our outlook does reflect a challenging macroeconomic environment in many parts of the world and negative impact from a stronger dollar relative to 2015 average rates. Specifically, we anticipate foreign currency changes and reduced hedge benefits will negatively impact revenues by approximately $250 million and operating profit by approximately $100 million compared to 2015 rates, including the impact of hedges. The outlook is primarily based on recent exchange rates, with the euro assumed at $1.08.","The estimated $100 million profit impact results from just over $25 million of reduced hedge benefits compared to 2015, approximately $25 million related to Argentina and the remainder from translation of profits in various currencies around the world. We expect a benefit of approximately $50 million from foreign exchange currency hedge gains in 2016, but this is down from the $78 million of benefit achieved in 2015. So the year-on-year impact on profit and margins from hedges is negative.","In Argentina, the peso devalued in late December, as new economic policies were implemented and its value is now more than 30% lower than the average rates for 2015. We have both money transfer and bill payments businesses in Argentina which represent about 4% of Company revenues last year. So the devaluation translates to approximately $100 million of revenue impact and approximately $25 million of operating profit impact.","We expect compliance expense in a range of 3.5% to 4% which is similar to last year. The margin outlook also reflects over $50 million of incremental technology expense, as we make further investments in our capabilities. Otherwise, given the challenges from currency, we're managing expenses very tightly.","Excluding all impacts from foreign exchange rate movements, the outlook for operating margins in 2016 would be similar to 2015. Achieving our outlook operating margin in 2016 would mark the fourth consecutive year of margins around 20%, with currency contributing to the step up to 21% in 2015 and driving the anticipated step back to approximately 20% this year.","We have worked hard to stabilize margins over the last few years, in what has been a relatively low-growth reported revenue environment paired with rising compliance costs and we're pleased with our progress. We expect the tax rate to increase from 11.8% in 2015, excluding the Paymap charge, to a mid-teens level in 2016. And we expect the rate to be somewhat higher in the first half of the year than the second.","Putting this all together, our initial 2016 outlook calls for low to mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth, with GAAP revenue approximately 400 basis points lower than the constant currency growth; operating margin of approximately 20%; earnings-per-share in a range of $1.58 to $1.70 which includes at approximately $0.15 negative impact from foreign exchange and also reflects the impact of a higher tax rate; and cash flow from operating activities of approximately $1 billion.","Similar to last year, the cash flow outlook excludes approximately $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to our IRS agreement, some or all of which may occur in late 2016. We anticipate completing the remaining $712 million of our buyback authorization over the course of 2016 and 2017 and we also plan to issue additional debt to at least partially replace the $1 billion note maturity in 2016.","So to summarize we were pleased to deliver our results in 2015, despite a tough environment. We expect to drive stable performance and continued strong cash flow generation and allocation in 2016, while we execute our strategies to drive long-term growth. So with that, operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang","Can you hear me okay? I'm at the airport. Just on the margins flat margins excluding the foreign exchange effects in 2016, it sounds like you're including a $50 million tech expense there?","Raj Agrawal","Yes.","Tien-tsin Huang","So I mean I guess is that what's holding back margin expansion that we would normally see, maybe with higher positive revenue growth and the other puts and takes there that I may have missed?","Raj Agrawal","Yes, Tien-tsin. The margins would have been about the same as last year, without the currency impact. And that includes about a $50 million increase in spend in technology. We're saving other costs during the course of this year and that's why we're able to keep relatively flat margins. But certainly, if we had not had that kind of an increase in technology, then margins could have been better. But we're investing in our platforms and upgrading our core processing technology which is a little bit dated and we think that's the right thing to be doing.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay. Understood and then maybe if I could just as a follow-up, just M&A appetite or update there? I know there's a lot of news flow in the quarter related to that. What's the latest thinking on M&A?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, generally we always, like in the past, we look at M&A opportunities as it fits up with our strategy, definitely interested in digital environment or mobile environment and that environment we continue to look. It has to be -- fit with our strategy and we're very disciplined also on return on M&As and so we're going to continue to look at that. I mean, I don't plan big M&As, but definitely strategic fit will be within our focus area.","Operator","Our next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Just want to follow up on that, Raj. Just thinking about the $50 million in incremental technology investment spend. Is there something that's a complete opposite to that, like the cost saving initiatives? I don't know if you gave a number for that to expect in FY '16? Just trying to figure what if there's anything in detail to offset that incremental, to keep margins flat?","Raj Agrawal","We haven't really given any detail on that, but these are general cost reductions and other savings that we're doing and that's really what's allowing us to offset some of that expense for the most part, Bryan.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then, pricing was down, I think, 1% in the fourth quarter, but flat for the year. Was there some pricing initiatives taken in the fourth quarter? And then going forward, will pricing be more flat again? Just want to make sure I understand it. Thanks.","Raj Agrawal","Yes. The pricing that you saw in the fourth quarter is nothing out of the ordinary. We still expect a low single-digit pricing environment during the course of this year. Earlier in the year, we had some price increases that were offsetting some of the price declines that we had, so it's really just normal course price changes in the market.","Hikmet Ersek","Market looks also quite stable, Bryan so we don't anticipate big pricing investment. The usual ones, but not big ones.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then just last one for me, Raj, is there a way to think about the three segments in terms of constant currency, how to model them going forward in 2016?","Raj Agrawal","We haven't really given a segment breakout, but for the B2B business, we still believe long-term that opportunities for low double-digit constant currency revenue growth and that's really a long-term objective. We, overall, the business we expect to be in the low to mid single-digit constant currency growth range for the Company.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes.","Raj Agrawal","But from a business unit standpoint we haven't really--","Hikmet Ersek","I think generally, we will see very strong growth coming from the digital send transaction, combined with our network worldwide, that drives really the growth, especially being in 34 countries it's very strong and our U.S. business, as you saw, U.S. outbound online business has been very strong and now we're in 34 countries. We expect long-term also similar growth rates like we have in the U.S. globally and we're going to continue to expand that one.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ryan Cary","This is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. With all the global macro volatility we've seen lately, I was hoping you could provide just some additional color about embedded expectations in 2016 by region. Just if there's any particular regions that you think could grow accelerate or any that are probably going to be particularly hard hit by some of the headwinds that we've seen?","Hikmet Ersek","I think generally our business is quite resilient. Our customers are quite resilient, even through 2015 economic challenges, the currency volatility, the geopolitical issues, our business and customers has been very resilient. We did see some impact of our global and geopolitical issues, like in Russia, we saw it in Angola, we saw it in Greece. In Libya. These outbound countries had some effect to our revenues, but given, being in 200 countries, I feel quite comfortable to manage that risk.","However, there is a huge geopolitical oil prices maybe also have impact in the Middle East outbound business long term. And generally, year to date and last year we saw a quite solid business and our customers are growing -- our growth was also coming from new incremental revenue, new customer segment, adding on that, with our online business, with our mobile business growing really strong. And these are new customers and it's not cannibalizing our strong retail money transfer business which is resilient.","Ryan Cary","Okay and then looking at the WU Connect platform, I know you've announced a couple partners since launching. I was hoping you could speak broadly to the feedback you have received from potential partners and maybe on top of that how long do you estimate it will take to start getting some more significant traction within this new channel?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, it's definitely something that we built over the years, WU Connect which has API connection to our platform which the platform is basically our multi-settlement currency platform, our compliance platform, our IT platform. We now give the platform, make it capable for social media and for operators, messaging operators, that they have an access and use that. To build that takes years to have license 200 countries. It's not easy.","And in the past we're opening that platform, there is a kind of a closed platform, for our agents. Now we're opening this platform also, for new social media. One is WeChat obviously and another one as just announced a week ago was Viber and it will take some time, as you know, it takes some time. We have to promote that within the users, within the people who use Viber and WeChat and other social medias. We would like to expand that also to the other social medias, but we have just put programs. One of the recent programs is the Chinese New Year, as you know, yesterday was Chinese New Year and we started promotion with WeChat which is a Chinese communication platform and we'll see the results long-term, definitely incremental results.","Operator","Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller","I mean overall I think the constant currency trades look fairly stable on most of the businesses. The exceptions I guess look like they are the markets you called out, just in the last question, around the outbound markets, being somewhat oil sensitive markets, Middle East and Asia to some extent. I guess Asia maybe a little bit less. But just give us some color on what your embedded expectations are for those markets?","I mean I guess a lot of the copies we see reporting are having a pretty big concerns over those economies, obviously. And when we take it a step further in the U.S., there's parts of the U.S. outbound market, I know, that have historically been somewhat tied to oil-producing areas in the U.S. as well, whether or not that's embedded in your thoughts? So a little color on the expectation for transaction growth in Asia be down 5%, Mideast down 1% and whether that's potentially going to get better or worse in the U.S., also?","Hikmet Ersek","I mean if you look at our business, U.S. has been really very solid and even in Saudi Arabia and UAE, we saw good transactions in Germany, we saw good transactions -- I have to be fair Germany is not oil-producing country, but the numbers have been very solid. Saudi Arabia and Middle East, Gulf countries which has a huge outbound business has been stable.","Definitely there is some risk looking forward on these areas maybe have some -- oil prices are down, maybe some economic challenges, but I feel quite confident with our resiliency of our business, of our customers. And also, we're start, you'll see some announcements, additional announcements to our 34 countries adding new online capabilities, especially also Middle East, for customers to be able to send not only retail money transfer, but also online money transfer. I believe that will keep that stable.","There is some concerns on the economic challenges. There is, global environment is not stable. I'm cautious about that. But customers, don't forget also not of our countries out of the U.S. are bigger than 7%, Raj? I believe revenue, so our portfolio is quite diverse. With that, we manage with marketing actions, with promotions, we really drive our constant currency revenue at least, as you said, biggest impact on the GAAP is the currency impact for next year.","Darrin Peller","Okay. I mean, so it sounds like your expectation is for something similar to what we're seeing now, more or less? Or you're not expecting much worse? Okay.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes.","Darrin Peller","And then just on the other non-C2C segment C2B and the business solutions segment, again, I guess it's nice to see those constant currency revenue growth rates still at the high single digits. Any thought we could have on the macro factors? I mean I know generally FX volatility has been an impactful driver on the business solutions side of the business. Anything that's impacting that there or anything else we should think about, given all the volatility in macro we're hearing across the board?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. I mean, it's not like 2014 or before the global trade is growing very strong. There is some growth, but trade is not as we would like to see. And as you know, our B2B business is dependent on global trade activities. But I have to say that in Europe, especially the B2B business, we're doing pretty well. At our markets where we're active like UK or other markets like France and Continental Europe, the team has been doing a good job here and growing pretty well. There is, as you know, there is something global trade could be impacting our business but currently, I don't see big changes.","Raj Agrawal","I would also add, Darrin, hedging has also helped some of the results there and that activity continues to expand into more markets around the world.","Darrin Peller","And just last question for me I'll turn it back to the queue is on the tax rate. I know it comes up this year to a more normalized mid-teens level. I guess just big picture on that, I mean, I imagine that should slowly but surely move to a high double -- more closer to 20%? Is that the right way to think about it for modeling purposes over the next couple of years?","Raj Agrawal","I can't speak to your model, but for us, we believe that the mid-teens tax rate is something that we would still have for the next couple of years. Obviously it's dependent upon tax law changes in other things that may happen, but based on what we know today, that's roughly where we see the tax rate. And this year is coming out to be right where we said. During the course of last year, we thought we would be back in the mid-teens and we're and that's what we see for the next couple of years.","Darrin Peller","Okay so mid-teens is pretty stable now.","Raj Agrawal","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Sara Gubins","Some questions on commission expense. Is this a year that we should expect an outsized amount of agent renewals and how should we think about commission expense for the year?","Hikmet Ersek","Sara, well, if you look at our business, if not that we have one year that commission goes up, the other year commission goes down. Normally our agent agreements are four, five, multi-year agreements. Right? And so it comes -- every year comes agent renewals.","I don't expect that big changes in 2016, on the commissions. I believe not that the commissions rates will go up or down. I mean sometimes there are some years go up, some years go down, but major changes won't happen, Sarah.","Raj Agrawal","I mean, last year, Sara, we actually had a decline in commission rates, retail commission rates. And this year we expect that commission rates will be relatively stable, as Hikmet said, to last year. And really longer-term the opportunities are around reducing distribution costs as the mix of our business changes, as we have more of rank funding, more bank payout, that's going to naturally shift the overall distribution costs of the Company.","Hikmet Ersek","Absolutely.","Sara Gubins","Following up on that, I know it's really early, but any chance you could help us think about to the economics of WU Connect over time?","Raj Agrawal","I mean, it's really early as you said, Sara. We haven't really gotten into those details. The model itself, there's likely to be some profit-sharing mechanism with a partner and the pricing for transactions could be similar to WU.com for similar channels. And then we do believe that these relationships could have a captive audience that we're marketing to versus the rest of our business, because these are customers that are using these messaging apps and if we're embedded in the messaging app, it makes it a little bit easier to find us, if you will, to use our services. So there's some opportunities here, but too early to talk about specific economics.","Hikmet Ersek","And our assumption, Sara, here is also like investing in dot-com. These are additional incremental consumers, additional revenue. We don't expect huge cannibalization, but time will tell us, our first search and first understanding is that these are incremental customers and revenues.","Operator","Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","So the tech spending on your network and processing infrastructure, I guess, the question is, why now? Is it a competitive response to newer choices in the market like transfer wise or what's the benefit you get from the investment? And while you are discussing technology I guess a question we do get from investors is impact of block chain. If you could spend a couple of minutes talking about the technology, that would help.","Raj Agrawal","Sure, the tech spending is not a this-year item only. We have been ramping up our tech spending. We have some older platforms that are in place, so we're upgrading our data center, data centers, around the world and in the United States. We're also upgrading our settlement system and we're upgrading our core processing capabilities, so it is definitely in an effort to upgrade our older technology, but it also is going to allow us to be more flexible in the market as we move forward and as we have newer kind of partners. So it is really setting us up for growth the next several years. And then from a block chain standpoint, Hikmet, do you want to add something?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes I think we're always looking at technologies like block chain and we also look at can we look -- adapt the block chain in our system and everything. But as you know, Ashwin, our system is unique. The success of our system is that it works in 200 countries, it can pay out in 121 currencies. It can adapt to regulatory systems of 200 countries and make anti-money laundering and process 22 transactions, does how many transactions a second we said? Raj?","Raj Agrawal","More than that.","Hikmet Ersek","More than that. I don't know. Every second transaction, so the flexibility of our system is there. It's hard to beat that and we're adapting that, exactly what Raj said, that we're adapting our systems to the given environment.","If the block chain is the better one, we will definitely look at it, but our team is very innovative here and Denver and in San Francisco and really looking at our capabilities. I'm quite confident that we're -- we made big steps last two, three years in our technology and going to continue to invest. Otherwise companies like WeChat or Viber or banks, big banks like La Banque Postale or like big retailers won't work with us. They want to have the customer experience good and they want to connect to our systems, so that's what we're doing.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","On a separate point, you've been stable at these transaction growth rates for a couple of quarters here. At what point do you decide that the growth rate just isn't good enough? And that maybe a price cut makes more strategic sense? It would seem like the current environment, you are not growing, but it may be your smaller competitors might be suffering a little more, so maybe it might be time to take advantage of that. How do you feel about that?","Hikmet Ersek","With all respect, I would like to push back on your growth comment. Maybe in retail money transfer, the transactions are slow growth, but as you know, our WesternUnion.com and digital business is growing very fast. I believe in many markets we're beating the competition and we're very competitive here and I'm very proud of the team. Even in the U.S. which we have been so long in WesternUnion.com, growing I think the transaction last quarter grow 33% or 34%?","Raj Agrawal","28% overall transaction growth, 35% U.S. origination.","Hikmet Ersek","U.S. originated transaction 35%. These are quite impressive numbers, so I believe that we're doing the right thing on our online business. And if you compare our business in electronic channels, of about 7% of our revenue, it's a quite big business and if you compare that with other competitors, their absolute numbers are definitely not there and they are only active on a few corridors.","Their expansion capabilities is, they don't have the WU Connect platform, their expansion capabilities is I believe not there yet and we're very proud of our platform and I think we're going to continue to expand there. You will hear more announcements, Ashwin, on expansion on digital. Especially on digital you hear more partners and at the same time, you will also hear more WesternUnion.com countries coming on our platform.","Raj Agrawal","Ashwin, I wanted to add to what Hikmet said. The lower growth that we're seeing in the transactions right now is really reflective of the continued global environments around us. I mean, we last year, we had a softer environment globally. We continue to see that this year, so things haven't really changed. It's really reflective of that more than the pricing need.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jordan Fox","This is Jordan on for Jim. I apologize that I missed this, but I just wanted to ask you about the current pricing environment both in the U.S. and Mexico corridor, following MoneyGram's contract expansion with Walmart. Any incremental there that you could point out? And then also in WU.com, have you seen any increment the pricing pressure, as it relates to Xoom following PayPal's acquisition? Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Sure. As a Raj mentioned earlier, first of all on the Mexico, Latin America U.S. to Mexico corridor, obviously Banco de Mexico data shows that we're definitely doing better than the market and that's not the first time and that's been very consistent over the last quarters and I'm very proud of the team that they are doing a good job. We will -- we're going to continue to do corridor by corridor pricing, sweet corridor quarter pricing, really very intelligent pricing, to attract new customers to compete on that, but I don't see big pricing changes. I really see the pricing environment quite stable.","On online, when we enter to a new market, in our online business, we may do some promotions to enter in the market to promote our channel there, but overall, I would say that the market environment has been stable. Look, no one can send money from one corner to 200 corners, like if you're from Denver to 200 countries, in our 500,000, in 100,000 ATMs, now also 1 billion accounts, dropping money really in a fast, very efficient way in 131 currencies. So that's what we're doing.","It's not all about price, the customers like our product and they're really working on that. So the last question was on WU.com pricing. As I mentioned on the WU.com pricing, I believe that we will continue to do promotions, like we have been very successful on India promotions. And that our aim is always profitable, being profitable and in all lines, we're making money, just I want to make this point that we do make money and we're increasing our margins also in online and getting profitable.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie Research. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","In terms of the uptick in that tax rate, what's the actual EPS impact to that, in terms of just how much of that impact is 2016 guidance?","Raj Agrawal","We haven't given that, Kevin. We're going from a roughly a 12% tax rate last year to mid-teens, so I'll let you just do the math behind that. But you can easily calculate that impact, if you will.","Kevin McVeigh","Okay. I didn't know if there was any kind of nuances in there. And then just in terms of the continued spending on the compliance side, the 3.5% to 4%, is it the same type of spend and is that independent of the technology spend or is that all wrapped in one?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. It's similar type of spend. The well over half of the spending is for people costs and we have over 2,000 people in the compliance organization here at Western Union. We obviously have them in various centers around the world so that's where a lot of the spending is. But we're continuing to invest in technology and outside services to optimize our spending there as much as we can, so -- but it is largely the same kind of spending, but just it -- this is a global effort if you will, so we're going to continue to expand these programs around the world.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom McCrohan of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Tom McCrohan","What's your expectations this year for total growth in cross-border principal? Which I think end of the year constant currency about 1%.","Raj Agrawal","Yes. Well, the World Bank has estimated principal growth to be 1% this year, but as we know, that information is more directional than anything else and as the data continues to come in and get updated, so we'll see where that ultimately ends up. Last year, our principal grew by 2% on a constant currency basis and then was down 5% on a reported basis.","Tom McCrohan","Okay. And can you give us a sense for the proportion of your total cross-border principal that is oil sensitive or emanating from oil-producing countries?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. I mean, if you look at the oil-producing countries in which we operate, the revenue generated from those countries is in the 10% to 15% range and it's really a mixed story. In those oil-producing nations, as Hikmet mentioned earlier, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have continued to thus far show decent growth, but we have other markets like Angola, Libya and others that are having, Russia as well, that are just having a challenging time.","So it's really a mixed bag and then the broader impacts from lower oil prices in other outbound markets is also a mixed story. We have had good growth in some key outbound markets as a result, I think, of just those kinds of situations. So -- but generally a 10% to 15% of revenues is from oil-producing nations.","Tom McCrohan","And the trends post the end of the quarter in Saudi Arabia and UAE -- are they still similar to what you experienced during the quarter?","Raj Agrawal","Well, we don't give any intra quarter information, but from the fourth quarter, that's where we saw the growth, so nothing to update really at this stage.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead. ","Bob Napoli","With your competitors signing a new contract with Walmart, I think that contract -- the old contract excluded Walmart from talking to Western Union, I believe. And this contract, I think, was less exclusive the prior one. So I just wondered if you had -- if there were any thoughts if Western Union was increasingly interested in Walmart, if you think -- maybe leave it there and get an answer to that question. And follow-up.","Hikmet Ersek","Good question, but as you know, we don't make any comments on any negotiations or any other specific partnership capabilities, as you could imagine, from competitive reasons and generally I don't do that. But I just can tell you that I'm interested in on any partner to grow out my business.","I believe that we will look always to grow our business and to -- but it has to be profitable. It has to pay back not for any price and we want to get new customers. We want to get additional customers and we will definitely look at any potential partnership worldwide, anywhere.","Bob Napoli","You are not excluded from any of your other partners from working with Walmart and do think of non-exclusive sends are the way of the future in the U.S.?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, generally I would say that from -- I can only speak for my business, the exclusivity, generally when the exclusivity has been very stable and our top 40 agents or 35 agents have been exclusive more than 18 years. And most of the agents are choosing this, because they know they have quite stable partners, financially stable, good anti-money-laundering system, good settlement system, long-range capability, great brands and they can drop money in 200 countries immediately, so the activities comes in both sides obviously and they would like to protect good partnership for longer-term. We have also host-to-host connections, we have IT implementation with our partners and so I feel from my part of business quite comfortable on this.","Bob Napoli","And you're not excluded from working with Walmart, from like Kroger or any of your other partners?","Hikmet Ersek","I can't answer that question but I guess not. I don't know. You have to ask that question to the others, not to me.","Bob Napoli","Okay and Raj, you have -- you mentioned $1 billion of debt coming due in 2016. With credit spread having widened so much, is there any -- what would be the impact if you were to refinance that debt today on your interest expense?","Raj Agrawal","Taking everything into account, Bob, we see interest expense being similar to last year. So potentially higher interest rates for that refinancing, but we have a lower overall average debt balances this year, as we paid off some maturities from last year. So those two things would largely offset, I would expect to see interest expense similar to last year.","Bob Napoli","Okay. And then last question, with your Investor Day coming up and why now for the Investor Day? And are you planning on giving any medium to longer term financial targets as part of your Investor Day?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, as you know, our Investor Day is coming beginning of March. And we're very proud about our strategies, what we want to tell to our shareholders or really how we transformed the company, how we get to the new use cases, how we get the new our WU Connect platform, how our strength -- strong about retail money transfer business. And we would also like to talk to the uniqueness of the Western Union cross-border engine, cross-border platform and I think within that environment, we would like to talk to our long-term and loyal shareholders, how comfortable we feel about the future of the Company.","Operator","Our next question is from Daniel Hussain of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Daniel Hussain","Just another one on that $50 million tax spend. I know it's early to talk about 2017, but I just wanted to get a sense for whether the $50 million is elevated in any way or whether this is maybe a go-forward investment rate for now?","Raj Agrawal","Well, the $50 million certainly has some one-time costs in there, but again, we're trying to upgrade our platforms, so there's also some ongoing costs in that spend. As we add more partners to the mix, especially on the digital side, partners like Viber and WeChat, as we have more of those, we will continue to invest in the technology areas. So too early to say whether it's only one-time in nature or how much of it is one-time in nature.","I expect some elevated tech spending to continue, but again, that allows us to be faster to market. It allows us to be more flexible in how we provide services and it also allows us to add new kinds of partners to our business which is really why we're doing it.","Daniel Hussain","And then not to beat a dead horse on oil, but I'll try to ask the question a different way. Saudi Arabia I think they are the second largest send market and they did cut their budget in December. So at this point, are you taking a wait-and-see approach for your expectations for 2016, even if you haven't seen any impact yet? Or are you baking in some sort of headwind now?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think generally I'm cautious. Right? About the global economic, it's not Saudi Arabia specific. But generally there is -- the environment didn't get better. It's very volatile. But once again, I just want to make the point, one of our countries from a revenue side is bigger, outside the U.S., bigger than 7%, so we have a really quite balanced environment.","I mean, as Raj mentioned earlier, Germany for instance produced pretty good outbound numbers again which is obviously engine of Europe and continued to produce that. So I feel comfortable that being that global, having that portfolio, we could respond better than the other companies to the economic challenges.","Daniel Hussain","Okay. And then if I could just follow up on Darrin's earlier question on tax, this issue does come up a lot for us. So just wondering if it's possible to provide maybe an example of one of these working capital strategies that you use to repatriate cash, without paying the U.S. Marshal impact.","Raj Agrawal","Yes. I would say is that we move a lot of money around the world annually, we move hundreds of billions of dollars around the world globally on an annual basis and we have a lot of payment flows between our various companies around the world, so we try to optimize those as best as we can. And I'm happy to talk more about that off-line if you would like to, but it's really just optimizing the cash flows that we have within the Company.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Tim Willi","Two questions, one Raj, I missed the full comment but could you just go back over the $25 million of headwind from Argentina? I didn't catch that, I just want to make sure that I understand it. I have a follow-up.","Raj Agrawal","Sure. I think you are referring to -- this year we have an overall impact from currency on profit of about $100 million. $25 million of that is from the Argentine peso devaluation that took place in December of last year. Another $25 million plus is from year-over-year changes in hedge gains, so we have hedge gains this year that are less than last year. So last year we had $78 million in hedge gains. This year we have around $50 million based on our current rate assumptions and that's a negative to the margins.","And then the remaining piece of it is just overall translation, so we have a revenue impact of $250 million in our top line this year and $100 million impact to profits and that combination is a negative to our operating margins this year of around 100 basis points. And Argentina is just a translation of our profits is going to translate into $25 million less just based on the devaluation of the currency.","Tim Willi","My follow-up, going sort of WesternUnion.com and the global expansion that you seem to be moving on here more aggressively. Is there anything around reallocating marketing budgets or elevated levels of marketing or anything like that, as you really open up this platform, that we should think about in terms of operating leverage, whether pros or cons, as you roll this out more globally and really try to accelerate it?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. I think, absolutely. I think, we're focused on the send countries, major send countries, obviously. The 34 countries which I mentioned earlier are the major send countries. Now we're -- we have almost all European countries, obviously now we're starting to have -- by the way in Europe, we're using our bank license there and to expand WesternUnion.com and now the next step is, in Europe are putting promotions and marketing programs there, to drive the revenue even stronger which is a good strong -- the base is still small, but growing stronger.","And now we recently opened an office in Asia to expand our activities, also WesternUnion.com activities to send Asian countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, but also in Middle East, like typical countries in the Middle East, outbound countries. And you'll hear coming up new announcements on that using our capabilities and I believe it's really attracting new customer segments. For instance, people who want to send in a different way, don't want to carry cash in a location and we saw the similar pattern also in Europe, these are additional customers, not ones that use retail, but still you want to use Western Union and add additional growth and that's going to happen, I believe, also in Asia.","Tim Willi","So are you comfortable in terms of the P&L impact, that there is not any pressure on margins? This'll just be reallocated your existing marketing budget to different channels and countries? Not anything necessarily incremental -- at a material level?","Raj Agrawal","Tim from a marketing standpoint, we've been spending just under 4% of revenues as a Company for the last few years, but we have been reallocating more to the digital areas and that will probably continue, but not affecting the overall budget.","Operator","Our last question today is from Oscar Turner of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Oscar Turner","So you mentioned that overall, you expect C2C pricing trends to remain stable in 2016. I was just wondering if you could provide some general color on the proportion of markets where you are typically able to raise prices versus perhaps those that are more competitive?","Raj Agrawal","We have 60,000 corridors that we operate in, so we have a number of different combinations that you could envision, but it's very hard for us to tell you specifically by country. We typically, in many countries, we're priced above the overall average. In other countries, we're priced below and we also have different channels that we're also utilizing.","So in our WU.com business we're actually priced quite competitively with similar kinds of products, so it really just depends on which corridors you're talking about which channels and there's a multitude of different combinations that we could be looking at. But in markets where we believe the value proposition is not aligned, then we will take the opportunity to look at that. It could be pricing changes in foreign exchange. It could be in fees, so it's hard for me to tell you a specific area where we do that.","Hikmet Ersek","Sometimes we increase prices in different bands, current corridors, lower bands, decrease pricing and increase on the higher bands. So it's really a very intelligent price product we have and this is based on the markets environment. We adapt the prices to the customer needs and that's what we do.","Oscar Turner","And then second question, you've talked a lot about expanding WU.com geographically and then also growing WU Connect. I'm just wondering how you think about possible cannibalization there or at this point, are they so small that it's not even a concern?","Raj Agrawal","First of all, our WU.com business is growing very, very well and it's in 34 markets, we're paying out everywhere -- almost everywhere in the world in cash and then we're delivering money into accounts into more than 50 markets. So that business continues to have a lot of good growth potential, but we also believe that much of the WU Connect opportunity is incremental in nature. It's too early to really tell you exactly how that's going to play out, but we believe that's going to be a good incremental revenue and profit opportunity for Western Union, because it's a new kind of customer. They may use us in a different way, different use cases that we have in our core business, so there's -- we just need more.","Hikmet Ersek","Isn't that today Raj, current customer, 80% of our customers are new to our -- they didn't use --","Raj Agrawal","To WesternUnion.com, yes. I mean, WesternUnion.com, we're getting more than 80% of our customers are still new to Western Union overall, so we think it's largely an incremental opportunity, but we'll see. We'll have more expense over the next several months and years.","Jean Claude Farah","Sure. It's the bottom of the hour so thanks everyone for joining our call and we hope you have a good day. Thanks.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Revenue trends were softer in the first quarter and industry growth appeared to slow but we remain on track with our full year expectations. We expect growth and margins to grow throughout the year as we gain traction with new opportunities such as Albertsons and Dollar General and face less challenging comparisons from currency and pricing actions in the prior year.","The digital business continues to drive our results with 19% transaction and constant currency revenue growth in the quarter for westernunion.com money transfer. Cross-border digital growth was much higher, but declines in U.S. domestic money transfer business continue to affect both westernunion.com and overall C2C growth rates.","Geographically, our U.S. outbound and U.S. to Mexico money transfer business has delivered good results and Latin America outbound remained strong. Trends in Europe in certain countries were mixed. And Middle East revenues continue to be affected by the price reductions implemented in the first half of last year.","In business solutions, we achieved constant currency revenue growth for the third straight quarter driven by strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Europe. Overall, our core business expectations for the year have not changed from our original projections and we are not standing still. We are taking additional actions to improve our results going forward.","In the next few days, we expect to complete the sale of our Speedpay U.S. domestic bill payments business for approximately $750 million. This represents the first step in our efforts to streamline our model and focus on our core cross-border businesses. Our overarching strategies remain, focus on driving digital expansion and growth, offering our cross-border platform to new business areas and generating operating efficiencies.","With digital, in addition to westernunion.com and mobile geographic expansion, we continue to build our account payout network, including recent collaborations with mobile wallets in emerging markets around the world. Although this business is relatively small, it is generating strong growth.","We also continue to extend our payments platform and agent location network to allow customers to make payments for use cases such as e-commerce purchases. We are expanding into new pilot countries with Amazon and are also looking at other additional payments opportunities.","Finally, we remain focused on generating operating efficiencies, including the implementation of lean management and other WU Way driven processes which we are continuing to rollout across the company. With this streamlining of our business, we have identified additional opportunities to optimize our operating model and cost structure, which we are currently evaluating.","Our business has proven resilient regardless of the economic conditions, but these initiatives can give us more ways to drive stronger profitability in the future. We are working on specific plans and expect to have an Investors Day later this year where we will share our strategies, growth plans and efficiency opportunities in more detail.","Now turning back to this year. We remain committed to generating and returning cash flow to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned over $260 million through dividends and share repurchases. For the full year, we currently expect to spend $500 million to $600 million to buy back shares which would put total return to shareholders, including dividends at $850 million to $950 million for the year.","To summarize. We continue to generate strong cash flow. The Speedpay divestiture is near competition. We expected revenue growth to start up slowly in the first quarter and improve throughout the year and we remain on track with our full year business performance expectations. And we are in the process of evaluating long-term efficiency initiatives that will enhance profitability in coming years.","Now to give you more detail on the first quarter as well as the outlook and capital allocation plans, I would like to turn the call over to Raj.","Raj Agrawal","Thank you Hikmet. First quarter revenues of $1.3 billion declined 4% compared to the prior year period, while adjusted constant currency revenues, which exclude Speedpay revenues from both the current and prior year, increased 2%. Currency translation, net of the impact of hedges, reduced first quarter revenues by approximately $77 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to continued declines in the Argentine Peso. The decline in peso negatively impacted total revenue by four percentage points, while the effects of inflation on our Argentina businesses is estimated to have positively impacted both reported and constant currency revenue by approximately two percentage points.","In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, which represented 79% of company revenues in the quarter, revenues declined 3% or were flat on a constant currency basis, while transactions grew 2%. Total C2C cross-border principal increased 1% or 5% on a constant currency basis, while principal per transaction was down 2% or increased 2% constant currency. The spread between C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 5% with a negative 3% impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 2% in the quarter while pricing was flat compared to the prior year period.","Turning to the regional results. North America revenue grew 1% on a reported and constant currency basis, while transactions were flat. The U.S. to Mexico quarter delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter, driven by westernunion.com and we made significant share gains based on the latest Banco de Mexico data through March. Our other U.S. outbound business also generated good revenue growth driven by sends to Latin America and Asia. However, continued declines in the U.S. domestic money transfer business largely offset the U.S. outbound strength.","In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3% or increased 1% on a constant currency basis, with growth led by France and Spain, while transactions in the region increased 5%. Revenue in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region declined 7% on a reported basis or 6% constant currency on transaction growth of 1% as last year's price reductions in the Middle East are still impacting revenue. Latin America and Caribbean region continued to deliver strong constant currency revenue growth with very good growth from Ecuador, Mexico outbound and Peru. Revenue in the region declined 2% or increased 12% constant currency, while transactions grew 9%.","In the APAC region, revenue declined 13%, or 11% constant currency and transactions were down 6% with Australia, Korea and New Zealand contributing to the revenue declines. Westernunion.com again delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by cross-border sends, which were partially offset by declines in the U.S. domestic business. Overall westernunion.com revenue grew 17% or 19% constant currency on transaction growth of 19% and represented 13% of total C2C revenue in the quarter.","Business solutions revenues decreased 1% on a reported basis or increased 4% constant currency and represented 7% of company revenues in the quarter. Constant currency revenue growth was led by strength from hedging products and the education and financial institution verticals. Regionally, business solutions growth was driven by Asia-Pacific and Europe.","Other revenues, which consist primarily of our bill payments businesses, decreased 9% in the quarter. Other revenues represented 14% of total company revenues in the quarter, with approximately half of the revenues related to the Speedpay business. The Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina continued to grow transactions and local currency revenue but declined in U.S. dollar terms and Speedpay revenue also decreased in the quarter. The depreciation of the Argentine Peso negatively impacted other revenue, reported revenue by 20 percentage points in the quarter while Argentina inflation is estimated to have positively impacted other revenues by approximately 11 percentage points.","Turning to margins and profitability. We will focus on consolidated margins as segment margins have not been adjusted for the expected reallocation of corporate overhead expenses anticipated after the divestiture of the Speedpay business in the second quarter. The consolidated operating margin was 18.8% in the quarter compared to 19.1% in the prior year period, with the decline due to higher acquisition and divestiture related expenses. Foreign exchange hedges provided a benefit of $5 million in the current quarter compared to a negative impact of $9 million in the prior year period.","EBITDA margin was 23.6% in the first quarter which compared to 23.9% in the prior year. The GAAP effective tax rate was 19.9% in the quarter compared to 8.9% in the prior year period or 11.4% in the prior year period adjusted for changes in tax act provisional accounting. Last year's first quarter rates benefited from certain discrete items, while this quarter's rate reflects the impact of new full year expectations related to the Speedpay transaction which I will detail when I discuss the 2019 outlook.","GAAP earnings per share in the quarter was $0.39, compared to $0.46 in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues and increase in acquisition and divestiture related expenses and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was $240 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the quarter were approximately $38 million. At the end of the quarter, we had cash of $833 million and debt of $3.4 billion. We returned $262 million to shareholders in the first quarter including $87 million in dividends and $175 million of share repurchases, which represented approximately 10 million shares. The outstanding share count at quarter-end was 433 million shares and we had $1.369 billion remaining under our existing and new share repurchase authorizations, the majority of which expires in December 2021.","Before I turn to the updated financial outlook, I want to provide some details on the Speedpay transaction. We expect to complete this transaction in the coming days for approximately $750 million in cash. As a reminder, Speedpay generated $350 million in revenue in 2018 and approximately $100 million of carve-out operating income, which exclude corporate allocations to the business.","Separately, we have completed the sale of our Paymap mortgage payments services business, which was also in other in the second quarter. This business had approximately $15 million in revenue last year. From an income statement standpoint, the sale of Speedpay business is expected to generate a pretax gain of approximately $530 million in the second quarter. We expect taxes on the transactions of approximately $150 million, reflecting the fact that the Speedpay tax gain is considerably higher than the book gain and also reflecting a $15 million tax benefit from the Paymap sale.","In addition, the Speedpay gain produces a favorable effect on our overall U.S. tax position with respect to the BEAT provision in 2019, resulting in a separate tax benefit of approximately $40 million compared to our previous outlook. We currently expect to use the approximately $600 million in after-tax cash proceeds available from the Speedpay and Paymap transactions for a combination of share repurchase and net debt reduction over the next 12 months with slightly more than half currently planned for share repurchase.","From an earnings per share perspective, we expect the dilution from the lost income related to Speedpay, net of additional share repurchases and lower net interest expense, to be approximately $0.10 per share for both 2019 and 2020. This reflects about four-and-a-half months of Speedpay and Paymap income in 2019 and no income come from these businesses in 2020, which is being offset compared to 2019 by the impact of additional share repurchases and lower interest expense.","The after-tax gain on the sales and the BEAT tax benefit generate an approximately $0.94 benefit to the 2019 earnings per share, which is net of approximately $0.02 for acquisition and divestiture related costs. So the total impact of all divestiture related items is approximately $0.84 accretion this year.","Turning to our full financial outlook. We now expect GAAP revenues for the full year to decrease mid-single digits due to the removal of a partial year of the Speedpay business. On an adjusted constant currency basis, excluding Speedpay from both years, our outlook is unchanged as we continue to expect a low single digit constant currency revenue increase. Operating margins are expected to be approximately 20%, in line with our original outlook.","Although the removal of Speedpay carve-out profits does have a negative impact on margins, our outlook still projects to approximately 20%. We expect an expected tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% in 2019, which increased from the previous range of 17% to 18%. The increase in the GAAP outlook reflects the impact of tax on the gain on Speedpay sale partially offset by favorable changes in the company's U.S. tax position with regards to the BEAT provision. We currently expect the effective tax rate in 2020 to be in the mid-teens range.","GAAP EPS in 2019 is now expected to be in a range of $2.66 to $2 76, which includes the approximately $0.94 of nonrecurring net benefits and approximately $0.10 of ongoing dilution from the divestitures. GAAP cash flow from operating activities for 2019 is expected to be approximately $850 million, which is net of the taxes paid on the Speedpay and Paymap sales.","From an accounting perspective, the proceeds from sales are classified as investing activities on our cash flow statement while the taxes on the net gains are classified as operating activities. Excluding these taxes and the BEAT benefit, operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $950 million, which is adjusted from our previous outlook of approximately $1 billion to reflect the removal of a partial year of Speedpay cash flow. As mentioned earlier, we currently expect to spend between $500 million and $600 million on share repurchases in 2019 and a similar amount in 2020.","So to summarize the quarter. Our business results were stable, although we face currency headwinds and a difficult year-over-year growth comparisons. We continue to generate strong solid cash flow and returned significant capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. Our full year outlooks have been updated primarily to reflect the Speedpay divestiture, but basic business trends are still expected to be in line with our original outlook.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane","Yes. Hi guys.","Hikmet Ersek","Hi Bryan.","Bryan Keane","I want to just ask about pricing. I know you guys did some pricing actions in North America and the Middle East. It looks like transaction growth dropped a little bit. Usually you see the opposite effect. You see with pricing, you see an increase in transactions. Overall transactions was, I think, 2% for the quarter, was down from 4% last quarter. So just trying to figure out what was the impact from pricing? Did you guys get the impact you expected? And how much of this is just a little bit of the difficulty going on into the economies worldwide?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. Bryan, this is Raj. Let me start off. In the Middle East, most of what you are seeing on the revenue side is related to price reductions we made in the second quarter of last year. Transactions did fall off a little bit, but there are number of different things happening in that region. Middle East and Africa, the revenue was a little bit better in some of the key markets like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, but we also had a little bit of softness, both in transaction and revenue trends in our Africa outbound business.","Just some of the markets there are being impacted by hard currency shortages. And so we are just trying to manage through that. So there is some opposite impacts that are impacting the business. But we do believe that the trends will improve as we go past the second quarter just as we anniversary some of the price reductions there. And then in North America, there was a little or price optimization or increases, I would say, in the quarter, but nothing material there to really talk about.","The domestic money transfer trends, the transactions there are a little bit worse even though revenue trends were probably similar to the fourth quarter. So that could be some of it where the DMT business is really driving down the results in North America.","Bryan Keane","Okay. I got it. And then I think, Hikmet, you talked about an Analyst Day towards the end of this year and talking about some long-term initiatives. Maybe could you just maybe a preview of some of the things that you are thinking about for that Analyst Day and how you guys might talk about some of these long-term initiatives for the business model?","Hikmet Ersek","Sure. Yes, we are excited about the coming up Investors Day because we believe that we have an exciting story to tell. We are currently working on it. We are really looking at our business model which we can use more technology and more artificial intelligence, which we have already. It's not additional investment. We can optimize our current organization and running this business more efficiently. Starting from variable cost to fixed cost, we are looking at that. But at the same time, we are driving the expansion possibilities like digital expansion and really offering our platform which is unique, offering cross-border solutions to new payments providers. That's the story basically. We are currently revaluating what the outcome will be. We have the first internal plans but we are really going on the details and we would like to share that with our investors on the Investors Day coming up, probably September, end of September or October, end of Q3 or beginning of October.","Bryan Keane","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Raj Agrawal","Thanks Bryan.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks guys. I just wanted to ask actually a follow-up there just in terms of some of these newer initiatives that you are going to talk more about later in the year. I just wanted to get your viewpoint on why now, why is this the right time. It doesn't seem like WU Way was that long ago. It seems like that was a successful effort. So is this about taking WU Way to the next level? Or just wanted to get a sense of why this is the right point in time to take another cut at efficiency initiatives?","Hikmet Ersek","I think again, Jason, that's an excellent question. Why now? As you look at our business, so 2016, we really were investing a lot on the compliance programs on the anti-money laundering efficiencies, on the technology. Since end of 2016, 2017, we have a much more stable results, we are really the resilience of our business give us confidence that we can run this business in a much more efficient way. We do have licenses in 200 countries.","We have invested in the technology part. Now it's really the reorganization. And in the past, we were all about expanding globally. We are in 200 countries, whereas the other competitors are still struggling expanding globally. We have been already there for many years now. We are really looking at how we can offer our global platform to new partners. And we can do that in a much more efficient way with artificial intelligence.","We have been working with our teams the last few weeks. Actually not few weeks, I will say the last six weeks, in a very detailed strategic plan. And then we will like to take that through a more detail plan and present that to the shareholders. We believe that this could go to a margin expansion that could be in a much more better margins here, because it's changing the business model from a distribution model to more of a customer oriented business model.","Gaining more consumers and having consumes more in our digital way will give us efficiencies. For instance, dropping money on an account, it's much more efficient than dropping money on a location because of the commissions and be could gain there are also more traction and there is a plan behind that. We will like to share that.","Does it make sense?","Jason Kupferberg","Yes. That does make sense. Maybe just shifting gears, maybe one for Raj, just on the guidance side. So I think on an adjusted constant currency basis, excluding the Argentinian inflation benefits, we need to get from 0% in Q1 to the unchanged full year guide of 2%. Can you kind give us that walk of the pieces of how we get there? I know the comps do get easier. You talk about Albertsons and Dollar General. Can you maybe quantify how much they may benefit the topline during the rest of the year?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. It's all the pieces that you mentioned, Jason. We had a tougher comparison to Q1 of last year. We also had a slightly negative calendar impact in Q1, which will alleviate itself as we move through the course of the year. And then Albertsons is now fully ramped up. That gives us an incremental 1,000 locations. Dollar General's now also fully ramped up and will contribute more. We are adding about 14,000 locations with them.","We don't quantify the exact impact of each one but they are certainly going to be contributors. And then we are also going to be expanding some digital partnerships later this year that will also add to the overall picture. So we feel confident about the full year outlook, even though Q1 is a little bit softer.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. I am sorry, just one last quick one. On WU.com, I know you grew to 19% but you did call out DMT as a headwind. How could we think about maybe the Wu.com number, ex-DMT? I am just trying to see if there is any underlying change in the trend? Thanks.","Raj Agrawal","We grew 19% all-in but we haven't given that number specifically, but we would be in the mid-20% range if we took DMT out of the dotcom number.","Hikmet Ersek","And overall, I think Raj, in 2018, our DMT business was about 8% of our revenue.","Raj Agrawal","It was our consumer revenue.","Hikmet Ersek","Consumer revenue. It was consumer revenue, Jason, as you recall. We don't give that. We said that we are not disclosing in the future but it's declining and has an impact to our total number. But cross-border is still healthy, very healthy growth rates.","Raj Agrawal","Yes. The international cross-border is really growing at the strongest level in dotcom and then we are getting pretty good growth in our U.S. outbound business. And then the DMT part of digital is declining.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Terrific. Thank you for the color.","Hikmet Ersek","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon all. I will ask similar to Jason on margins for the year, though. Starting out 2018, you mentioned Speedpay removal, I think is dilutive, but still guiding 20%. So I guess with revenue improving you see will some margin lift, but what other levers do you have to get the margins higher than the balance of year?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. Hi Tien-tsin, this is Raj. We also had some acquisition and divestiture related expenses in Q1 that we called out and that's not necessarily representative of every quarter. So that will help a bit. The revenue lift that we get the rest of the year will absolutely help on the margin expansion. And with the Speedpay divestiture, coming into the year, we had about 20% margin outlook and we still have 20%, because even though Speedpay is a bit negative, it could be a little bit above or a little bit below the 20% number. So still confident that we are going to make the full year. And the revenue growth will help a lot and our expense base should be relatively stable as we move through the course of the year. So that's why we have confidence around that 20% number.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay. Thanks for that. Just a quick follow-up, advertising. I have noticed a lot of the pay to account advertising even on TV. So was that reflected mostly in Q1? Could we see more of an advertising impact for the balance of the year? I am curious what kind of payback you might expect from something like this if it's a change from before?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. On the marketing and advertising front, we are likely to have little bit higher spending in the first half of the year than the second half. Second quarter is typically a higher spending quarter, just given Mother's Day and other things. So that's roughly --","Hikmet Ersek","Tien-tsin, on the account payout, I think it's one of our strongest growing. It's still small of course, but strongest growing channel. People are using more and more for account payout. If you use your mobile app, you tend to choose between cash payout or mobile payout. There also price differences to automate the customers. It's going very well. Transactions and revenue growth doing very well. So we are advertising, especially in some certain corridors like India, it's definitely something that is growing fast. But also from Europe, people are using more and more account payout. And that's long term also helps in our agent commission structure because of the mix. So I think that I am excited about that. Currently, we have about four billion accounts worldwide which can drop money directly. And we are very much pushing that also to optimize our revenue growth and our commission structure.","Tien-tsin Huang","Yes. That makes sense to advertising. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Raj Agrawal","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller","Nice, guys. Just to start off. When I think about strategically, the DMT, the domestic business, again just revisiting, is there anything you guys could do to, first of all, how profitable is that for you right now? Could you disclose how much that contributes to earnings? And then is there anything you can do similar to what have done with Speedpay? Would it make sense in someone else's hand? I know it's declining but still potentially cash generative for someone. And then I guess, taking a step further, is there any other ways to enhance the business model in terms of specifically C2C digital beyond just the organic trends you are seeing with capital brought in by Speedpay and others? Should you buy someone else's, does it become a greater priority? Thanks.","Raj Agrawal","Yes. On the profitability of DMT, we haven't really disclosed it, but it's a very profitable business for us. It probably generates more profitability than its size. But we haven't really gone into the actual specifics of that. Selling DMT would be challenging because it's so integral to everything that we have. I think that's what your question was, Darrin. We have DMT customers that are also international money transfer customers and vice versa.","Hikmet Ersek","And also, as you know, DMT is one of the big advantage of the MT as a cash payout. We have certain customers. They use DMT, our U.S. DMT to send money via mobile but payout and cash in minutes. And that's unique. That customers existing. However the competitors like Zelle and Venmo having zero fees on a direct-to-direct, that's where we feel the competition and it's hard to compete against zero fees. And so I think that we are really looking at these customers we currently have. It's high profitable business and we are serving this customer in the best way like we do so with U.S. outbound customers.","Raj Agrawal","And Darrin, can you just repeat your last question. There was a third question around C2C digital?","Darrin Peller","I guess I was just wondering if there was any other use of capital around some of the proceeds from Speedpay. You talked about debt paydown and buybacks. But have you raised in priority any type of tuck-ins that could help expand some of the growth profile of your businesses?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. Our going in plan is to buy back stock as we articulated. But we also are always looking for acquisition opportunities, whether it's digital or something else.","Hikmet Ersek","Let me just give a shot on that. We do look at many opportunities, given the business. We are not standing still, given the operating performance a little bit flat. And we are really looking for M&A opportunities also which will continue to get additional revenue to our cross-border engine. So of course, it has to be at right price, right strategic fit and that's what we are doing. And we are really evaluating. Now we can do these things since we feel much better with our platform. And as I mentioned earlier at the call, as we have now the operating efficiencies and we are for operating efficiencies, I think we can also when we go to the market, we can include new revenues terms to our engine much better than we did it in the past. I think having an efficient cross-border engine will allow us to be more active on the M&A front.","Darrin Peller","Okay. So just one last follow-up is just around, the Amazon news that we have seen from you guys a couple of quarters ago, we thought was pretty promising. Have there been any other marketplaces like that where know you can use your network for bigger and better things even with what you are doing today?","Hikmet Ersek","On Amazon, first of all, we are expanding with Amazon together the countries we are in, right. I think there will be hopefully some recent announcement our shareholders will like it like I it and our shareholders in Amazon will like to be partners like to serve new customers. Collecting funds in the local currency, turning that to dollar immediately, which is so that you can buy locally, you can buy globally, pay locally, it's enormous and we are looking also for other partners and more announcements to come on that. We have our division called cross-border solutions division which is a sales organization which offers our platform to big partners and it's all about closing that and expanding Amazon but also signing new partners.","Darrin Peller","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Hikmet Ersek","Thank you.","Raj Agrawal","Thanks Darrin.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Hikmet Ersek","Hi Jim.","Jim Schneider","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my -- Hi. How are you? Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just maybe at a 50,000 foot level, can you maybe kind of give us a sense regarding the divestitures and the M&A contemplating, where do you want to take the company, in say, two years from a business mix perspective? Is the thought that you want to be just a much more larger scale C2C business with a lot more digital exposure and maybe less B2B exposure? How are you thinking about the direction the company is going to go in given what you done with Speedpay and what you might be contemplating elsewhere?","Hikmet Ersek","Excellent question, Jim. That's why we want to have the Investors Day to go more deep on that. But let me try to give you a high level thinking behind that. Over the years, we created that cross-border engine, we call it cross-border platform which allows us to settle 137 currencies in minutes and turn that really, offer that really now, not only to Western Union customers which are the C2C customers, really offering also that to C2B and B2C customers.","And that's where our platform is unique. Not everybody has that. We have 200 countries license. We have compliance programs which is driven by artificial intelligence. We have a technology, which is really unique. And putting that all in one platform, putting that in the cloud, that's something we are doing currently. With that, Amazon is only one example to go out of our C2C customer, really using that Turk brand, which is the Amazon app called and offering our platform to Amazon so that customers worldwide are able to shop Amazon online.","And these are kind of things which I am trying to take the company to the next level. C2B, B2C and C2C is definitely something in our hearts. And other examples is, Jim you know, we talked a little bit, is the University pay. The student pay product is basically acquiring universities. And so people can globally pay their are fees locally and study in another country.","An example, there are about 200,000 Chinese students only in Spain. And so we can offer that. People pay in local currency and can study in Madrid or Barcelona immediately and get their visas to go abroad. So these kind of things are definitely something we are looking at. It's not only Western Union branded products, C2C product but also other verticals to offer our platform.","Jim Schneider","That's helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe just as a follow-up. Aside from the macro pressures you are seeing in a, the corridors, can you maybe talk about whether you think the bigger impact on some of the transaction deceleration you are seeing is more due to things like the hard currency shortages, et cetera? Or is there any kind of change in migratory trends that's really driving that weakness as well? Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek","Well, generally, Jim, our cross-border business is healthy, as I mentioned and as Raj mentioned earlier, right, which we really believe on our country-to-country peers, we are healthy. We do have some softness in the Middle East. We have some softness in some part of Europe. But generally, I would say that our U.S. outbound business, which is a major business and European Union outbound like France and Germany has been doing very good, good results. Even in Saudi Arabia and UAE, we see some, if you put the pricing to that, some improvements in the recent quarters.","I would say that the impact is really the U.S. domestic money transfer business has impact to our business from transaction wise. And we always say that our competency is in cross-border, cross currency and that's where we are focused and I feel resilient also. Even we don't see the pricing pressures. The prices are stable in cross-border, cross currency. I think that operating in 200 countries, serving more than 20,000 corridors, it's really a competitive advantage.","Raj Agrawal","I mean the remittance principal growth based on the World Bank data, Jim, is a little bit slower this year than it was the last couple of years. So that may be some of it overall in terms of overall market. But it is expected to keep growing in that low to mid single digit range in terms of principal growth, cross-border principal. So the market dynamics should continue to be okay. A little bit softer this year.","Hikmet Ersek","I think it's softer, I think also competitors gave some numbers there where their numbers were also softer. But generally, I would say, still healthy business.","Jim Schneider","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Hi Hikmet. Hi Raj.","Hikmet Ersek","Hi. How are you?","Raj Agrawal","Hi. How are you?","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Good. Thanks. I hope the same for you. So my first question is with regards to the U.S. domestic money transfer trends is kind of worse. The reason I am asking is, given the backdrop of a higher number of agent locations because you have been adding agent locations, what's going on at that level? Is it just it takes time for agent locations to get more productive? Because then that's a broader question too because over the last couple of years you guys have added a number of locations. WU.com is in more countries, but your growth rate has not necessarily accelerated. So how should we think of that?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, first of all, let me start with agent locations. The recent agent locations, the Albertsons and Dollar General just has been added, Ashwin, a few months ago and activation of them takes time. We know that especially on the strategic areas that you add locations, it does bring more transactions. That's from the send side. On the receive side, having 550,000 locations globally is a big advantage, Ashwin. So you can use your phone and send money directly to 550,000 locations in dollar and we turn that in Vietnam or in Chile or in Finland immediately to their local currency, that not many companies can do that. That being present been on that countries in last mile is the biggest advantage. That's why we are paying out in 137 currencies. Not many companies can do that, that will be.","On the new expansion of westerunion.com, yes, it takes time. Our growth basically comes from U.S. and some European Union outbound. As you recall, we were first to U.S. few years ago, then expanded to European Union. Now we are all over the European Union. We recently, I was just last week in the Gulf states in Middle East. We opened seven new countries there to outbound business, especially I am excited about that sending money to South Asia. Since the promotion we know that we signed many, many new customers on our mobile apps, on the westernunion.com mobile apps. So it will take some time but the 19% growth on dotcom, it's a very healthy growth. If you compare it with few years ago and where we are, we end this year more than $500 million of revenue in the dotcom business and it's still growing by 20%. The base is much larger and we are still growing with 20%. It's a good success, I guess.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Great. I was thinking within the context of your overall business. But the second question is quite different from the first is, in terms of how much was the acquisition and divestiture expense in 1Q? In other words, what's the normalized EPS for 1Q? And if you could also provide what compliance expense came in at for the quarter and for the expectation for the year?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. Ashwin, we didn't break out but I think, just think about the annual outlook. We said that we expected about $0.02 worth of impact from acquisitions and divestiture related expenses. Obviously that could change depending on the level of activity. But that's what we have currently assumed. So that should give you a sense of how much that could be for the year.","And then from a compliance standpoint, I would say the cost were relatively consistent. We haven't broken that out but we have been able to stabilize our compliance costs over the last couple of years. So nothing specific to call out there.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. Understood. Thank you guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ben Budish","Hi guys. This is Ben Budish, on for Ramsey. I wanted to ask about another question on your operating margin. Maybe this is something best left for the Investor Day, but talking about some of your longer term efficiency initiatives and with the growth in the WU.com business, is there a path there to getting the operating margin back in the like mid-20s? Or is that more dependent on reacceleration in your revenue growth?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. I mean I think it's something we should probably say for later next few months. And certainly Investor Day will give you more color on some of our initiatives. We are going through the process right now, I would say, in identifying how much opportunity there is and what we can take to the bottomline, right. And in past exercises, we have sort of reinvested the money to drive that growth but we also are looking for ways to drive more efficiencies, ultimately better margins. But we still are going through that process to evaluate how much that could be.","Ben Budish","Okay. Fair enough. If I could ask one more just on your APAC business. Could you maybe give a little more color on what you are doing tactically this time to turn that business around?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. Asia-Pacific is certainly a focus area for us. The good thing is that it's only 6% of our consumer revenues. And so it is relatively well contained but the negative trends in the quarter were driven by Australia, Korea and New Zealand and each market has different issues associated with it. Some are more competitive in nature, some are more just economy related. And then digital continues to be a heavy portion in the Asia-Pacific market.","Right now, digital for us is only about 11% of the total Asia-Pacific market and we want to drive that to be a much bigger number over the next few years because that is the way the market is heading. And so having more mobile capabilities, more account funding, more account payout and having more of those kinds of capabilities. So these are some longer term things that we are trying to do, Ben. And we are also trying to tactically fix things on a short-term basis as well.","Hikmet Ersek","And in Asia-Pacific, most of the market is a receiving market. Few markets like Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia are outbound some markets. But if you look at total Asia, most of the Southeast Asia, China and India are receiving markets. So it is much depended on how we send money to these countries. And the other thing is also, we do have some challenges, as you said, in Australia and in New Zealand with our retail, but the dotcom business and the digital business is doing pretty well there.","Ben Budish","Okay. That's great color. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James Faucette","Thanks very much. Most of my near term questions have been answered. But I did want to ask a modeling question and a more strategic operational question. The first is, with the sale the Speedpay business, is there any seasonality that we should be aware of that we should incorporate in your forecast or models?","Raj Agrawal","I wouldn't expect seasonality. Do we have anything, Mike?","Mike Salop","No. Actually the tables that accompany our press release, we actually have the Speedpay by quarter pro forma for last year. So you can look at that.","James Faucette","Okay. Great. Yes, I missed that. Okay. Thank you. And then my second question is, your comments on using, implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning, et cetera to improve, among other things, AML and KYC requirements. How do you think about like that ability to not only help you maintain compliance but then ultimately bring down costs potentially as far as maintaining AML and KYC compliance? Is that a possibility? Or do you feel like you are probably going to, it's just a new avenue of investment to be able to maintain your capabilities there?","Hikmet Ersek","No. It's the first part, actually. It's definitely. We have it and we use it and we want to expand it. Currently we use a lot of artificial intelligence, especially in our compliance programs, know your customer environment, the transactions, monitoring and that helps are a lot on our compliance programs which we advanced since we starting to heavily here. And we have also a good team who really knows that field well. So it's the existing artificial intelligence.","But we could use this also in other parts of the company is at dynamic pricing, for instance, like an airliner, all these things that we really think that we could do, we do have, we think that we could have some revenue opportunities there. And also you know, using the technology of artificial intelligence will give us have a better access to front line associates, communicate them in a better way.","As you recall that we have about 550,000 locations. Let's say two times of them is through front line associate for a location or about million people promoting Western Union daily, right. And how do we communicate with them in a very efficient way. All those things are something that we will like to share during our Investors Day. And that's exactly what Raj mentioned earlier, that's exactly what we are planning and putting together all those things to give you more better outline for our future growth and future efficiencies.","James Faucette","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from David Scharf of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","David Scharf","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Two of them. First off, Hikmet, I believe in your prepared remarks you specifically called out your belief that you experienced market share gains in U.S. to Mexico that may have been triangulated from Banco de Mexico?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes.","David Scharf","Can you expand on that?","Hikmet Ersek","David, they don't want, but I will take it. It's a good news, yes. Banco de Mexico data shows that we are gaining market share, yes.","David Scharf","Got it. And is there any magnitude you are able to articulate or any internal sense of where that share may have come from or if it was broad-based in terms of competitors?","Hikmet Ersek","As you recall that we invested on our network there. The last two years, we did a lot. We had OXXO. We had other kind of locations. But one of the big changes also, we started through our APN network which means account payout network. That shows really good growth rates in account payout. And also dotcom business to Mexico has good results, the digital growth. So these are the things that helps us to gain market share. By the way, as you recall also, we have three brands there. We have Orlandi Valuta and Vigo additional to our Western Union brand. We adapt our products to the customer needs. That helps definitely also to gain market share on this specific corridor.","David Scharf","Got it. Understood. And then as a follow-up. I believe in response to one of the questions about the expected ramp up of revenue throughout the year more backend weighted, among other things you highlighted some of the additions like Albertsons and Dollar General. I am wondering, when we think about a big grocery chain like Albertsons kind of a regional\/national chain, when we look at things like a Safeway or a Kroger, other examples, what is typically the transaction profile out of big grocers? Is the bulk of it domestic money transfers? Is most of it outbound? Just trying to get a sense for in addition to how that helps the topline, what it means in terms of profitability per transaction?","Hikmet Ersek","So if you look at our business, the U.S. outbound business is huge, right. We like U.S. outbound business, sending money from U.S. to 200 countries in minutes, I think nobody can beat that our way and we have a lot of competitors that we are competing daily on the markets, right. But I think during that environment, we are doing pretty well good job. So agents like our product. Most of our agents have been, on send side have been with us more that 17 years, Mike?","Mike Salop","20 years.","Hikmet Ersek","20 years already. So 20 years and they like that product because they bring customers in their locations. And the customers are from migrant population from different countries but at the same time also people you want to send money support their loved ones globally.","David Scharf","Yes, I might have misspoke. I guess what I was trying to understand is the grocery vertical in particular and Albertsons as we compare it to like a Kroger.","Raj Agrawal","Yes. There is probably, you have customers that are, it's probably a representative customer set from the rest of it. But it not unique in nature from a grocery store chain standpoint. Because U.S. outbound is such a large business, you are going to have more customers doing that than the domestic business part of the business. But it's going to be a mix. And it's going to probably depend on where some stores are located and which neighborhoods and those kinds of things will have an impact on the kind of customer base you have within a chain, within a store.","David Scharf","Got it. Okay. Thank you Raj.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Jeff Cantwell","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. [indiscernible]. Your launch of digital in the Middle East, I believe you launched digital in seven countries last week. Can you just tell us a little more about that and maybe just give us a general feel, not to ask you to preempt your Investor Day, but it just seems like your Asia digital strategy, certainly over the 12 months, now your Middle East, digital launch, it just sounds like a possible shift towards more topline growth, given how large those TAMs are. So is there anything you can tell us about the magnitude of the opportunities there? And any color around timing and size of the impact to the extent you are able to today, would be great. Thanks.","Hikmet Ersek","So generally, as you recall, just from strategic point of view, the digital customers are new to our network, 80% of our dotcom users are new to our network that didn't use the last 12 months Western Union. So we are really gaining additional customer segmentation not the retail customer, they want to use the digital one. Putting that aside for a minute, we have been now in 70 countries. Our Middle East strategy, Asia strategy is the same like we did it in Europe for years to open in countries we have been now in 70 countries, sending capabilities to 200 countries. We can drop money in 200 countries on a location, in a location or you can send money to one of the four billion accounts we serve globally. So, this is a huge advantage.","In the Middle East, well, I was recently there with the seven countries, they are Gulf countries. They have our outbound countries. They have a big migrant population and these people are also started to have credit cards and accounts which you can allow them to send money from their account, from their credit card directly to 200 countries, not giving cash to a location. We believe it's a huge opportunity. Going forward, it will take some time.","We know that the dotcom customers take some time until we acquire them but when once they start to use them, they use it more often than retail. So it's the basic. And you know, if you look at our growth rates, as I mentioned to Ashwin earlier, we have been growing around 20% constant over the years right now. And our base was much smaller on dotcom. Now our base over $0.5 billion revenue and we are still growing by 20%. That's a part of the global expansion and part of it is that returned customers on the existing countries.","Jeff Cantwell","Thanks very much.","Mike Salop","Okay. Andrew, we will take the final question.","Operator","And that question will come from Vasu Govil of KBW. Please go ahead.","Vasu Govil","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one I had was for Raj. I just wanted a clarification on the EPS guide for the year. I think if you exclude the $0.84 impact that you called out from the divestiture, it seems like the underlying guide is going down $0.0.2. I just wanted to understand what was driving that and if that's the right way to look at it?","Raj Agrawal","Yes. I wouldn't give that too much weight. The only real change is the divestiture impact that's what try to isolate. Otherwise, our outlook for the year really has not changed. When you look at the topline outlook has low single digit constant currency, just same as it was before and margins are still approximately 20%. So the range itself is a little bit tighter and it all depends on the level of revenue, the level of expenses, the t tax rates that we actually will have, timing of repurchases. All those things can have an impact. And so we have just tightened the range a little bit. But we still feel good about the overall outlook and no material changes other than the divestiture related impact that we tried to call out.","Vasu Govil","Got it. That's very helpful. And then I guess the second question, not to beat a dead horse, but just on the slowdown in the westernunion.com channel. I know you guys called out the slowdown in the domestic money transfer business. But could you just sort of help us with how much it got worse during this quarter? Because just the magnitude of, I guess, decline in transaction would imply that the domestic corridor got materially worse, this quarter versus last.","Raj Agrawal","No, I wouldn't look at it that way. The DMT business transactions did get a little bit worse. However the other parts of the business, the international parts continue to go very strongly and that's where a lot of our expansion focus is. Our U.S. outbound business slowed a little bit but it still had very strong growth. And on the domestic side, I would say the revenues were still relatively stable to the last quarter but transaction were a little bit worse. So we still really feel good about the dotcom business and the growth opportunities and we ultimately want to be in 200 countries and territories over the next few years and with multiple different channels. So nothing has really changed from our strategic outlook on the dotcom business.","Mike Salop","Yes. Vasu, I would just add, as Hikmet mentioned, DMT is 8% of our C2C revenues, but within dotcom DMT is actually a higher percentage of those revenues.","Vasu Govil","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Mike Salop","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining our call today. You have a good afternoon.","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"22564":["Western Union (NYSE:WU) Q4 2011 Earnings Call February  7, 2012  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Michael A.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","Michael A. Salop","Thank you. And good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss 2011 fourth quarter and full year performance, and our 2012 outlook. Following the remarks, we will open the call for questions.","The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in a supplemental table with our press release.","As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language and the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including that 2010 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles.

And welcome, everyone. Overall, 2011 was a good year and we realized many accomplishments. We exceeded our earnings per share outlook from the beginning of the year and delivered our highest full-year revenue rate since 2008. This was accomplished in a challenging environment that included the Arab Spring, economic troubles in Europe and high global unemployment. ","We believe that we gained cross-border market share, each of our consumer-to-consumer regions grew and the repositioning of our U.S. domestic money transfer business, which began in late 2009, continue to pay off. ","We advanced our European strategy of being closer to the consumers and optimizing our operating model by completing the Angelo Costa and Finint super-agent acquisitions. In Asia, we've further expanded our network and now have approximately 200,000 locations across China, India and the rest of APAC. With our bank license, we also laid the groundwork for expansion in Brazil and continued the turnaround in consumer bill payments.","In business-to-business payments, we completed the Travelex Global Business Payments acquisition in November, which gives us a strong foundation for a second leg of growth well into the future. Within C2C, our electronic channels business continue to advance in 2011 with 35% revenue growth, indicating that our combination of physical network with digital send and receive options is matching consumer needs in the marketplace. ","We also signed a global prepaid and money transfer agreements with MasterCard, which will help us globalize prepaid services and allow us to leverage MasterCard's world-class global electronic network. Late in the year, we began our launch of prepaid cards in Europe. ","Other accomplishments in 2011 include completion of the restructuring activities we announced in mid- 2010, which delivered approximately $55 million in cost savings. And also, we resolved our international tax position with the IRS.","We also maintained strong cash deployment in 2011. In addition to the acquisition, we repurchased $800 million of shares and paid almost $200 million in dividends. So 2011 was a great year. ","As we enter 2012, we are expecting near-term challenges, driven largely by economic conditions. I've just returned from the world economic Davos where I had the chance to talk to many business leaders, and the general expectation is Europe will be challenging in 2012.","Our business has held up well in countries such as the U.K., France and Germany. However, Italy and other parts of the Southern Europe have softened. We also will face some challenges in Mexico and Russia in 2012 as we adjust our strategies in these countries.","But our focuses on execution and positioning the company for future growth, we have defined our long-term opportunities and growth strategies, and now we must execute successfully against them. Our long term vision is to become the premier financial service provider for the underserved. This includes our current customer base, but also new consumer and business customer segments that are underserved.","There are 2 billion people worldwide who are considered under-banked or completely un-banked. Western Union's core remittance business charges to the 200 million who migrate to other countries as well as their families back home. However, all consumers have financial needs. And we plan to utilize our brands, global network and infrastructure to provide more financial services to the underserved over time. This could mean in the form of prepaid or stored value or distributing third-party financial and related services throughout our global network.","I met with many potential global business partners in Davos, and there are great opportunities to leverage our global network and brand. There are many other types of underserved customers that could benefit from the services we offer. Examples include students who need to make some tuition payments in foreign currency; travelers who need cash; and small businesses that make cross-border payments.","Last year, we organized our business around 3 key growth areas: first, global consumer financial services, which include core money transfer; second, new ventures and services, which includes expansion of our electronic channels; and third, business-to-business payments.","We now have a strategic roadmap in place that will allow us to accelerate our businesses over the next several years. In 2012, we will focus on executing against those plans.","We have 3 main areas of focus this year: expanding our network and focusing on adding and retaining consumer and consumer money transfer; creating a digital infrastructure to drive our electronic channels business; and growing the B2B business and successfully integrating the Travelex acquisition position. I would like to spend a few minutes talking about each of these areas. ","In core money transfer, over the next 2 years, we want to transition from being a transaction-based to becoming a truly customer-centric organization with added convenience and more choice. We have a long-term vision for the core business of 1 million agent locations, further market share increases and margin improvement from growth and efficiencies. ","Over time, we want to further increase loyalty by continuing to improve the retail experience with simple, high-quality transactions at the right value. We want to increase share of wallet by leveraging our consumer database and providing access to new services. And we want to add new consumers through expanding our network with strategic agents and offering adjacent services, such as account-based money transfer, direct-to-bank or card, ATM money transfer and intra-services in key markets. To reach these goals, we will need to invest over time in salespeople, focused marketing and technology.","In 2012, our focus is on accelerating network expansion to reach more consumers through increased global sales resources and more aggressive pursuit of new agents. We are adding to our sales forces around the world and anticipate that we will increase agent locations at a faster rate this year. ","We plan to further build our network in Asia, add to our retail agents in Europe and banks in the U.S., and fill in white space around the globe with strategic locations and accounts. We also plan to increase our account-based money transfer relationships with banks and further expand ATM capabilities.","Our market research has shown us that providing more locations and options brings us new customers, not only due to added geographic convenience, but also because we can connect with account-driven consumers and customers of an agent's main business. By strategically expanding our network, improving the consumer experience over time and building and leveraging our customer database, we will -- we can increase retention, add new consumers and provide new services in global consumer financial services over the next several years.","Another area where we can provide more choice to existing customers and attract new consumers is through electronic channels. Last year, we created an internal team that took a deep dive study of our digital efforts and the market opportunity. In 2011, our digital base revenues from westernunion.com and mobile were over $100 million. I asked the team to build a long-term roadmap on how to achieve true leadership and scale in electronic channels.","At the core of this roadmap is creating a separate digital business that will give us the dedicated focus and expertise. We have placed this business in San Francisco and are building a team, combining strong internal expertise and external digital talent. We are also investing in technology to redesign the consumer experience, offer multiple funding and receive options and optimize risk mitigation.","Importantly, having a strong digital offering will allow us to add new customers, consumer who want to make account-to-account payments or transfers will be able to use our services. There's also significant portion of the remittance market that is run to account-based solutions and historically, this type of consumers has utilized bank transfer options. We're seeing it in a strong position to assert leadership in digital, as we have the advantage of global retail network in over 200 countries and territories, as well as strong global compliance capabilities.","The digital portion of the remittance market is projected to grow faster than the cash portion over the next few years. We already have a westernunion.com business that is over $100 million in revenues and growing with even today's limited capabilities. We plan to become a leading edge digital money transfer provider. Building the infrastructure now will allow us to turn into a much larger profitable business over the next several years with a goal of exceeding $500 million in revenue by 2015.","Our third area of focus for 2012 is to grow the B2B business and to integrate Travelex Global Business Payments. As you are aware, we completed this acquisition in November of last year. We believe there is a tremendous market opportunity to serve small-businesses' cross-border payment needs. And the combination of Travelex and Western Union Business Solutions gives us a strong foundation for growth.","The SME cross-border payments revenue market is estimated to be approximately $24 billion and it's fueled by growth in international trade. With Western Union Business Solutions and Travelex, we expect to have an approximately $400 million revenue business in B2B in 2012. We are now the largest non-bank provider in the space, but our market share is still estimated to be under 2% only. Small business customers are often underserved by their current cross-border provider. They want speed, accuracy and transparency in their payment, and we believe we provide a superior value proposition with differentiated service, feature-rich platforms and competitive pricing.","Our customers include small and medium size businesses, but also specialized verticals, such as universities, law firms and smaller financial institutions. We have approximately 100,000 customers in 23 countries, including more than 500 financial institutions.","To grow this business, we are adding sales resources in new geographies and deepening our reach in existing markets. We are expanding with vertical and online partners and utilizing our money transfer agents in certain countries to sell the services.","We already have 16 Western Union Money Transfer agents signed in different countries with 6 active. With talented employees and strong platform services and back-end payment connections, we believe, we have a tremendous opportunity to achieve low double-digit revenue growth in this large and fragmented market for the next several years.","So we are focused on execution of strategic roadmaps this year. We want to expand our network at new consumers and increase loyalty in core money transfers, build a world-class digital business and integrate and expand business-to-business payments in 2012.","We have a strong foundation with our brands, our global network, our consumer relationships, our regulatory and compliance capabilities and our range of send and deliver options. We are building a strong foundation in business-to-business payments and can leverage our strength to establish leadership in electronic channels. We expect overall growth to be somehow challenging in 2012, due to economic conditions and the impact of currency translation. However, we believe in the future opportunities of our businesses and are investing in the key areas now to position us for accelerated growth as conditions improve.","Now to give you a more detailed review of the quarter and our 2012 outlook, I would like to turn the call over to Scott.","Scott T. Scheirman","Thank you, Hikmet. As I review 2011 financial results, I will primarily focus on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules.","Overall for the quarter, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 5% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis. Excluding $35 million of revenue from the Travelex Global Business Payments acquisition, which closed on November 7, reported revenue increased to 3% or 4% on a constant currency basis for the quarter.","Consolidated organic revenue growth was driven by increases in all regions of our consumer-to-consumer segment, both as consumer bill payments and double-digit growth in Western Union Business Solutions. Transaction fee revenue increased 2%, while foreign exchange revenue grew 20%, primarily due to the acquisition of Travelex.","In the Consumer-to-consumer segment, reported revenue increased 3%, with transaction fee revenue up 2% and foreign exchange revenue up 6%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was 3% as compared to 4% in the third quarter, while transaction growth was 5%, the same as the third quarter.","While we have revenue growth in each region, revenue trends were affected by the slowdown in Southern Europe as well as business challenges in Mexico, Russia and China. C2C cross-border principal grew 2% in the quarter or 3% on a constant currency basis. C2C principal per transaction declined 2% year-over-year or 1% on a constant currency basis. In the international C2C business, revenue grew 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis. International transaction growth was 5%.","International principal per transaction declined 1% compared to the prior year on both a reported and constant currency basis. We ended the year with approximately 485,000 agent locations. This was the same number at the end of the third quarter because we closed approximately 15,000 inactive or lower activity Vigo agent locations in Russia and CIS countries. ","Turning to the regions. Our C2C business in the Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region increased revenue at 2% and transactions at 3%. The revenue growth rate was down slightly from the third quarter due to currency and further challenges in Russia and Southern Europe, primarily Italy.","As we mentioned in the third quarter, in Russia, we are losing business to retail-based competitors. We have action plans in place to counter this, but they will take time to implement, and we expect Russia to be a challenge throughout 2012.","In addition to the economic situation in Southern Europe, new regulation in Italy are also impacting the business. Despite the headlines, other large markets in Europe, such as the U.K., France and Germany, held up well, and the Gulf States delivered good growth.","In India, revenue growth remained strong at 12% and transaction growth increased to 15%. For the full year, the EMEASA operating margin was 28.7%, a 30 basis point increase from 2010.","Turning to the Americas region. Revenue increased 3% on steady transaction growth of 6%. Although not as strong as third quarter, domestic money transfer continues to have solid momentum with revenue growth of 7% on transaction growth of 11% in the quarter.","Mexico revenue declined 1%, while transactions increased 1% in the quarter. Our Mexico business continues to be affected by ongoing compliance procedures related to our southwest border agreement.","In 2012, we will be evolving our business model and practices related to Mexico. We're in the process of renewing agent agreements and changing how we operate in Mexico, including further compliance-related changes. As a result of these factors, we expect our Mexico business to decline in 2012, as we modify the business. ","U.S. outbound continues to grow with growth rates increasingly slightly relative to the third quarter. For the year, the Americas' operating margin was 28.5%, an increase of 30 basis points from the prior year.","Asia-Pacific revenue increased 6% in the quarter, a decline from the third quarter rate, while transactions improved to an increase of 8%. Australia delivered good growth, but not as strong as the third quarter, while the Philippines delivered similar growth to the third quarter.","In China, revenue declined 5% in the quarter, while transactions increased 1%. China was affected by currency controls or other restrictions implemented in certain countries in Africa and Latin America, which impacted high principal outbound activity from these countries to China.","The Asia-Pacific operating margin for 2011 was 28% compared to 28.7% in 2010. For the C2C business overall, the spread between transaction revenue growth in the quarter was 2 percentage points. The impact of net price decreases was 1% again in the fourth quarter and mix was 1%. For the 2011 full year, the impact of net price decreases was 1%, and we expect 2012 to be in the 1% to 2% range.","Within C2C, electronic channels revenue increased 36% in the quarter and represented 3% of total company revenue. Account-based money transfer transactions through banks increased over 40% for the quarter and increased 40% for the year. We now have over 80 banks signed for account-based money transfer with 44 active. One of our most recent ABMT signings is a major European bank, UniCredit in Italy, which will also offer ATM and kiosk services.  Westernunion.com had transaction growth of over 30% for the quarter and just below 30% for the year, with transaction growth in international markets over 40% for both the quarter and the year. ","Although mobile is still a small business, we're seeing strong adoptions in some corridors, such as the U.K. to Kenya, and U.S. to Kenya. In fact, over 30% of our U.K. to Kenya transactions are now sent to a mobile phone. Also, our mobile apps for the iPhone and Android are gaining traction as access to points to westernunion.com.","In prepaid, we ended the year with nearly 1.5 million cards in force, and retail distribution at over 15,000 U.S. locations. In the quarter, approximately $115 million of principal was loaded onto Western Union prepaid cards through 500,000 loads. ","Starting in the first quarter of 2012, our GPR cards are now available in more than 3,000 7-Eleven locations with more being added. We also launched our first prepaid expansion in Europe, in the U.K., and began testing in Austria and Germany in the fourth quarter. In total, prepaid, including third-party top up, represented just under 1% of company revenue for the year.","Moving to Global Business Payments. Overall segment revenue increased 24% in the quarter, including $35 million in revenue from Travelex. Western Union Business Solutions reported revenue growth of 13%, excluding the acquisition. The consumer bill payment business continued its steady improvement, with revenue increasing 2%, led by strong international growth. U.S. revenue trends were similar to the third quarter.","Turning to margins. The fourth quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 25.0%, which compares to 23.7% or 24.5%, excluding restructuring expenses in the prior year.","The improvement is primarily due to revenue leverage, restructuring savings, Durbin and lower marketing expense, partially offset by Travelex deal costs and intangibles amortization. Travelex results negatively impacted operating margins by approximately 100 basis points. This includes about $5 million of integration expense as we began integration in the quarter.","In addition, there were $9 million in cost related to completion of the acquisition. Marketing expenses were 4.4% of revenue in the quarter compared to 5% in the prior year. Marketing for the year was consistent with 2010 at approximately 4% of revenue.","There were no restructuring expenses in the quarter, as we completed all activities in the third quarter, and we realized approximately $19 million in restructuring savings in the quarter. As a reminder, restructuring charges are not included in our segment operating results.","For the full year of 2011, GAAP operating margin of 25.2% is consistent with 2010 GAAP operating margin of 25.0%. Excluding restructuring charges, 2011 operating margin of 26.1% is also consistent with 2010 operating margin at 26.2% on the same basis.","Excluding restructuring charges, the relatively consistent year-over-year margins of approximately 26% were a result benefits from restructuring savings and revenue leverage, offset by foreign exchange, spending on initiatives and acquisition-related costs.","The company recorded a total of $47 million of restructuring charges in 2011. We realized approximately $55 million of related savings. We continue to expect approximately $70 million of savings in 2012.","In 2010, we reported $60 million of restructuring expense with $8 million of savings. Our 2011 earnings per share include some nonrecurring gains in other income. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a gain of $20 million related to the revaluation of the company's previous ownership position in Finint, as we indicated earlier in the year. We also recorded a gain of $21 million on foreign currency forward contracts related primarily to the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments. We entered into forward contracts to lock in the dollar volume of a portion of the anticipated purchase price, which generated a gain when the British pound appreciated. As a result of the forward contract gain, the overall impact of that Travelex acquisition on EPS was neutral in 2011, including the deal cost.","For the full year, we reported $50 million of gains relating to the revaluation of ownership position in Angelo Costa and Finint, which were included in our last outlook, and we recorded the $21 million gain on foreign currency forward contracts related to the acquisition.","The tax provision in the quarter reflects the benefit of approximately $205 million related to the agreement with the IRS, which was announced mid-December. We have previously established tax contingencies reserves over the last 8 years related to the restructuring of our international tax operations in 2003. As we resolve the appropriate tax treatment of the IRS, we agreed to make tax payments of approximately $200 million, which we anticipate as we made in 2012, in addition to the $250 million deposit we made in 2010. Since we have reserved at a higher level, we recorded a onetime noncash benefit of $205 million to our tax provision in the fourth quarter.","Excluding the benefit, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 29.8%. This compares to an effective tax rate of approximately 23% on a year-to-date basis for September 30, as we had some international reserve increases and other items in the fourth quarter. For the full year, the company's effective tax rate would have been approximately 25%, excluding the tax benefit related to the IRS agreement and the impact of restructuring expenses.","Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.73 or $0.40 excluding the tax benefit. GAAP EPS was $0.37 in the fourth quarter of last year or $0.38 excluding restructuring charges. Earnings per share in the full year were $1.84 or $1.57 excluding the tax benefit and restructuring expenses. This compares to GAAP EPS of $1.36 or $1.42 excluding restructuring charges in 2010. Common shares outstanding as of 2011 year-end were 619 million.","Our C2C segment operating margin in the quarter was 28.0% compared to 27.0% in the same period last year. The improvement was due to restructuring savings, revenue leverage and lower marketing spending. For the full year, C2C operating margin increased to 28.6% in 2011 from 28.4% in 2010, driven by the restructuring savings and revenue leverage, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and spending on initiatives.","Global Business Payments' operating margin was 17.5% compared to 13.3% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The margin improved compared to last year primarily due to revenue increases, restructuring savings, the impact of lower debit processing expenses related to Durbin and lower integration and investment spending in Western Union Business Solutions. The reduction of debit fees due to Durbin is having a positive impact on our consumer bill payments margins, although it will negatively impact revenue in some cases as we pass through the savings.","Full year Global Business Payments' operating margin increased from 17.0% in 2010 to 17.9% in 2011, driven by many of the same factors in the fourth quarter. Consumer bill payment margins improved slightly in 2011 compared to 2010.","Moving to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our financial position remained strong. Cash flow from operations for the year was $1.2 billion and capital expenditures were $163 million. Capital expenditures were 3% of revenue for the year. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $193 million. At year-end, the company had debt of $3.6 billion and cash of $1.4 billion, of which approximately $500 million was outside the United States.","As a result of the IRS agreement, we have been able to move additional cash back to the U.S. During the fourth quarter, we retired $700 million in maturing notes, which had already been replaced by issuances since earlier in the year.","In the fourth quarter, we declared $50 million in quarterly dividend, which were paid on December 30. Consistent with our comments on our third quarter call, we did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter, but plan to resume buyback activity in the first quarter. We had approximately $650 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization as of year-end.","Now I'd like to review our outlook for 2012. In general, we're anticipating a more challenging economic situation this year. We saw some slowdowns in our C2C business in the fourth quarter of 2011 and expect similar growth rates in 2012. Our outlook assumes softness in Europe. In the Americas, we expect our U.S. outbound and domestic money transfer businesses to remain solid, but we're anticipating decline in Mexico, as we evolve our business model and compliance practices. ","The C2C revenue outlook includes solid double-digit growth in electronic channels. In Business Solutions, we anticipate constant currency revenue to grow in the low double-digits on a pro-forma basis. Revenue from current business-to-business customers are impacted by movements in global trade, but we still anticipate strong new customer acquisition. Our bill payments business is expected to be steady, although reported revenues will be somewhat negatively impacted by Durbin pass-throughs.","Overall, we expect constant currency revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% in 2012. This includes a 4 percentage point benefit from having a full year Travelex Global Business Payments revenues compared to approximately 2 months in 2011. We expect GAAP revenues to be approximately 2 percentage points lower than constant currency. As you are aware, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly compared to the 2011 average euro rate of approximately $1.40.","As a reminder, we hedged the majority of our European profits, so currency movements have a larger impact on revenue than operating profit. Moving forward, we would expect any additional 5% move in the European currencies to have a full year impact to our 2012 outlook for approximately $55 million on revenue and approximately $6 million on operating profit.","Our operating margins are expected to be similar to 2011 levels, including the negative impact of intangibles amortization from the Travelex acquisition. However, we do expect EBITDA margins to increase in 2012. We anticipate GAAP margins of approximately 25%, which compares to 25.2% in 2011.  Current year GAAP margins include approximately $50 million of integration expense from Travelex Global Business Payments, while prior year included $52 million of restructuring expenses and Travelex integration costs.","Excluding Travelex integration costs, we expect 2012 operating margins of approximately 26%, which compares to 26.2% excluding restructuring expenses and Travelex integration costs in 2011. Items that are favorably impacting the margins include: revenue growth, currency hedges on European profits, Durbin, lower deal costs and approximately $15 million of additional restructuring savings. These benefits to margin are being offset primarily by increased amortization and incremental investments in the business.","The acquisition-related intangibles amortization for Business Solutions will increase for approximately $20 million in 2011 to around $60 million in 2012 due to the Travelex acquisition. We also plan to build out our digital business, which is already well underway. From a P&L standpoint, we are investing about $35 million of incremental expense into this initiative in 2012, hiring talented digital employees, enhancing technology solutions and increasing consumer marketing. This will become new infrastructure and our goal is to create $0.5 billion-plus digital revenue business by 2015.","We're also investing in network expansion, allocating additional funds to increase sales forces and to drive new accounts acquisition. As a result of all these factors, we expect essentially flat operating margins compared to 2011. Due to the increasing magnitude of acquisition-related intangibles amortization, we will also provide EBITDA metrics going forward. The EBITDA metric will reflect operating income with depreciation and amortization added back. All other income and expense is excluded from the metric. We expect 2012 EBITDA margin of approximately 30%, excluding the Travelex integration expenses. This compares to 29.6% in 2011, excluding Travelex integration costs and restructuring expenses.","Our 2012 net other expense is expected to increase from 2011 due to the $71 million in non-reoccurring acquisition-related gains recorded last year. We expect an effective tax rate in the range of 16% to 17% in 2012, following our agreement with the IRS late last year on treatment of our international operations. This compares to an effective tax rate of 25% in 2011, excluding the tax benefit related to the IRS agreement and the impact of restructuring expenses.","Bringing this all together, we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.65 to $1.70 in 2012. GAAP EPS was $1.84 in 2011, aided by the onetime $205 million tax benefit. Our outlook calls for EPS, excluding Travelex integration costs, to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.75 compared to $1.57 in 2011, excluding restructuring expenses and the non-reoccurring tax benefit. The increase in 2012 is driven by revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by the acquisition-related non-reocurring gains in 2011 and other income and expense.","As mentioned, operating margins in 2012 are expected to be similar to 2011, as benefits are offsetting increased amortization and investments. We expect cash flow from operations in a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, excluding the anticipated tax payment of approximately $200 million to the IRS and state tax authorities related to the agreement announced in December. Our future cash flow is now expected to be roughly 65% international and 35% domestic, which reflects some standard repatriation each year. However, based on the IRS agreement and other factors, we also anticipate being able to bring back additional international cash to the U.S.","Capital expenditures are anticipated to be 4% to 5% of revenue in 2012. This year, we anticipate a significant increase in signing bonuses on Asian contracts, as we have several major renewals, and we are aggressively pursuing new agents. We're also adding to investments in westernunion.com and new technology.","Longer term, we expect capital spending to come back down to approximately 3% of revenue. We plan to continue to manage our capital structure to balance returns with strong credit ratings, while maintaining appropriate debt and cash level. At this time, we do not anticipate pursuing any sizable acquisition. However, we may continue to evaluate smaller acquisitions that support our growth strategies.","Before opening the call to questions, I would also like to mention that in 2012, we would be evolving our segment reporting. We will maintain our consumer-to-consumer segment, but we'll now have separate segments for business-to-business and consumer bill payments, rather than the Global Business Payments segment.","Within the C2C segment, we will provide metrics on 5 regions that align with our regional leadership team. The 5 regions are Europe and CIS, Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific, North America and Latin America. India and South Asia will be included in the Asia-Pacific region.","Our prepaid and retail money order businesses will continue to be reported in the Other category. We'll provide restated comparisons for these changes, prior to our first quarter earnings release.","To summarize, we believe 2011 was a good year, given the environment. We exceeded our initial EPS outlook for the year and recorded our highest annual revenue growth since 2008. We advanced our strategies, and we added a strong foundation for growth in business-to-business payments with the Travelex acquisition. We also successfully executed our restructuring and reached resolution with the IRS on our international tax position. Finally, we returned to $1 billion to shareholders, and today announced the 25% increase in our dividend. ","We expect some challenges in 2012, but are focused on execution in investing in the areas we believe will position us well for long-term growth, including core consumer money transfer, business-to-business and digital channel.","Operator, we are now ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Tien-Tsin here. I just wanted to clarify, on the margins, I heard the flat comment, but just wanted to confirm. Excluding the Travelex intangible amortization, margins will be up 40 bps including the investments. Did I hear that correct? And secondly, the digital investments you're making, what kind of growth do you expect that to drive in fiscal '12? I heard it's 3% of revenue now, but what could that look like this year?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, Tien-Tsin, this is Scott. Let me address the EBITDA margins, then I'll turn it over to Hikmet for the .com for 2012 and forward, which we think can really grow very well. But on the EBITDA margins, 2011, we had an EBITDA margin of 29.6%, excluding restructuring charges and Travelex integration expenses, which were only about $5 million in 2011. In 2012, we expect EBITDA margins of 30%, which excludes the Travelex integration costs. So the EBITDA margins, we anticipate to increase in 2012.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, on the westernunion.com investment, Tien-Tsin, I believe that, that which the company does, and I think that's great, because we're already growing with our limited capabilities about 35% internationally, even 40%. What we do, what the other companies can't do, is that we are connecting the electronic channels with our retail, 485,000 locations, 200 countries. Not many companies have the capabilities to use the iPhone or use a computer to send in minute and payout in 485,000 locations. We believe with special focus within the branches, the team is working very hard in San Francisco, and we hire also digital talent there. We believe that we can grow this business to $500 million. Now it's to about $100 million, right, Scott?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes.","Hikmet Ersek","$100 million. We can grow to $500 million by 2015. And the roadmap there is very clear, capturing the customers, building on that and growing this business very strong.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And just, I guess thinking about the core including the digital piece, I guess you're targeting 2% to 4% growth, excluding the Travelex piece. And you did, I think, 4% growth in the fourth quarter and most of '11. So is that deceleration all just the Mexico and the Russia adjustments that you're making? What's your underlying assumptions, I suppose, here on the macro, to get to the 2% to 4%?","Hikmet Ersek","From the macro environment, I stay cautious in Europe. Parts of Europe is doing pretty well. I mean the north part of Europe, like Germany, U.K. and France, we are doing -- growing there very well. And but in the parts of Europe like Southern Europe, we do have some challenges. Here, we see some slowdown. Partly also, which -- in Russia, we do have a lower price competition there and the retail markets. And Mexico, we do have some southwest border compliance issue. We are upgrading there our compliance environment and also changing our business model. But from general environment, economic environment, I would say that I'm a little bit cautious on Europe, generally, but that showed also into Q4, the numbers has been a little bit slower than Q3.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Last one, I promise. Could the digital component add 100 bps to growth again in 2012 versus '11?","Scott T. Scheirman","Well, we think it's got a lot of opportunity in digital. I won't get specific about '12, but we do expect strong double-digit revenue growth in digital. And we do think that could be a $0.5 billion business by 2015. So it's going to, for sure, add to the growth rates in 2012.","Hikmet Ersek","It will be, Tien-Tsin, and we have a roadmap to get to $0.5 billion, and we all feel confident about that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sorry if I missed it, but the -- what's the goal for fiscal '12 marketing spend as a percent of revs? And you talked about these expansion efforts having more customer-centric view. That's a fine strategy. But I just want to know, what type of impact could this have on marketing spend over the long term. I mean, imagine it should increase, but the offsets possible from the electronic and mobile channels, how do you look at the moving parts there?","Hikmet Ersek","I'll take the second part question of Glenn. If you like then, then Scott, you jump in, okay? I think from the digital strategy from the -- being customer focus is really putting the customer in the middle. And see digital as the fixed region besides our 5 region and sending from digital consumers to new -- to our -- sending money globally. I think what we are doing here is really connecting the digital with our network, 500,000 network. One site you have good funds from cards or from accounts, and sending cash globally, but also account -- the account is growing very fast in certain markets. We believe that's a huge opportunity also. Putting the customer in the middle, we don't believe that we need additional huge marketing investment. We already captured the customer. We're communicating to customers in a different way, but still, with our ethnic marketing we'll continue to do, we still believe that we will have -- we have strong brands sending and receiving connection will drive digital, as we do it in the retail money transfer. One thing I just want to make sure also is that our retail money transfers, our core business, is the core and we still believe that there is a huge opportunity to grow that. Otherwise, I wouldn't have this strong ambitions with the team to grow our retail network to 1 million locations.","Scott T. Scheirman","And then, Glenn, on the marketing for 2012. We'll be right around the same levels we were in 2011, about 4% of the top line we'll spend on marketing.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, second to last question. Just a little more granular color on expectations for C2C versus B2B, well, Business Solutions margins. I know one's going to be under pressure because of the amortization, but just the magnitudes of the trajectories. I mean, you're expecting 25 bps expansion in C2C or 50 bps?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. I'd say, if we look at the overall, company-wide, to give you a sense, Glenn, operating margins, company-wide, we expect them to be flat, if you will, to 26% in '12 and '11. The EBITDA margins, we do expect those to be at 29.6% in '11 versus 30% in 2012. Again, as we've looked at the C2C business, I continue to expect to have strong margins there. Clearly, in the C2B business, because we are through some investment cycle with Custom House integration there, the C2B margins I do expect to strengthen there. But we are going to invest $50 million to integrate Travelex Global Business Payments. And we think that's really important to help move that top line to the low double-digit revenue growth. We have a 2% share. We think we have an opportunity to have much greater than 2% share, so we'll invest behind that. But overall, we expect EBITDA margins to be slightly up next year and operating profit margin to be flattish with 2011.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Ashwin from Citi. So I guess my question is, you run basically a portfolio of corridors. And when I look at the year-over-year comparison of what was not working last year versus what's sort of not working this year, can you provide where we stand? And Europe was weak both years, last year and this year, so where do we stand with Ivory Coast with the -- with countries in the Middle East? And then, is there a timeframe for Russia or China or Mexico to get better here into -- of your own actions?","Hikmet Ersek","So Ashwin basically, we have 16,000 corridors, right? So I mean, that detail our business, and it's hard to come up, but generally, I would say that I wouldn't see Europe as weak. Certain corridors in Europe, especially from southern Europe to certain corridors, that had some impact. That our business from Gulf is doing good. Its growth business is back again. I think specially to South Asia, and Philippines, Asia, parts of Asia is doing very well. Our U.S. outbound business is doing well. We did do -- saw some challenges, obviously, to Mexico, do -- as I mentioned before in the call, but I think that's going to. The Russia business is mainly driven to Central Asia business. And that has been impacted by strong pricing competitors, which we think that we can -- we have a plan to compete against it in the long term. But it will take some time. I would say, overall, from corridor point of view, I except Southern Europe, I would say that the business is holding pretty well and the Gulf is back.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I guess, my next question then would be on growth then, looking at margins and the digital business as you grow that. What should we expect for the margin profile in that business? I mean, given the potential to eliminate the agent on one or both ends. Do you expect margins to be correspondingly higher?","Hikmet Ersek","First of all, I don't believe that eliminated agents, Ashwin, as you know, what I said before is that Michael is having 1 million agent locations and I get challenging questions about few years ago, \"Would you ever have 500,000 agent locations?\" And we are almost there now. First of all, I would say that you need the agent locations to connect the digital with the agent. Otherwise, this business has -- many people tried to build this business and the issue is that building the retail with the digital, and we have it. I would say that, on the send side, we do believe that that's a high-margin business and we're going to increase the margin, definitely, because we had agents on the send side and we do have operating model to drive this business. But we have to invest in the beginning and to grow -- to come to a revenue expansion and margin expansion business.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Real quick bookkeeping question. How much of the buyback is included in your guidance?","Scott T. Scheirman","Ashwin, this is Scott. For a variety of reasons, I don't give you a specific number. But maybe let me give you some color of our thinking. And clearly, we want to be returning capital to our shareholders, both in a balanced way through dividends and buyback. In fact, we increased the dividend by 25% today. But what we're trying to do with buyback is get cash for our shareholders, but also balance it out with keeping a strong balance sheet, if you will. So as we think about 2012, you probably won't see buyback to the level we did in 2011 at the $800 million. But I'd probably have you think about the years of 2009, 2010, as we see things today, probably at that type of level as we move forward through 2012.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Hikmet, I wanted to get your thoughts on the new regulatory environment because of the CFPB, and if you think that'll have any impact on business conditions or your ability to grow market share.","Hikmet Ersek","Well, on the consumer protection side, I believe that, first of all, we are looking at it from the U.S. side very carefully on that, how the new regulations are. But our -- Kartik, our business, well, as you know, is quite simple and quite transparent. The sender, we call this fixed offset. The sender exactly knows what the receiver will get, what -- how much we're going to payout. That puts our business model in a very advantaged part that we are quite transparent. Saying that, though, if you look at that -- the new rules, we believe that we cannot adopt our business model also where it's needed to the requirements, and but we don't see a huge change in our business model. We believe that we are -- can apply the regulations very easy.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then, what are your expectations for the C2C market growing in 2012, considering some of these headwinds that are being posed by the economies of the world?","Hikmet Ersek","I would generally say that our C2C business is very well-positioned, right? If you exclude the electronic channels, the digital part, I think we are very well-positioned. The -- I'm still saying cautiously, as I mentioned before, on Europe. Parts of Europe, especially south parts of Europe. Today, I think Spain announced again the unemployment rate of about 22%. And Italy have some issues also. But Germany, U.K., France, our business is doing well. I think the employment rates are -- or they are stable. So it impacts all that. But Europe, I would like to stay on 2012 cautious on Europe. You want to add something on that?","Scott T. Scheirman","No, I think that, that frames it well, Hikmet.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last question. The margin decline in Asia-Pacific, was that just pricing pressure or was that Western Union investing more money to grow market share or something else?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, it's still very strong at that 28%-type level. And it's really the latter as you described. We invested more in marketing. We had a little bit more in compliance, which I think is an investment in the brand, too, but really things to help drive the top line on a long-term basis. But overall, strong margins in APAC, it almost -- not quite 30%, but nearly 30%.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I think, Kartik, I would like to be really invested on that stuff. I mean we have now in Asia-Pacific, including India, China, in APAC about 200,000 locations, Kartik. I mean, that's a huge coverage there. And I think there's still room to grow, though.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just quick question. Could you just provide some color on thoughts around the new restrictions we're seeing in Italy, maybe how impactful that is to you, and is that in your guidance assumptions? And then maybe on the other side of that, are there any macro assumptions built-in for potential pickup in housing starts? Maybe if you can give us a little more color on what you think might come out of any type of housing recovery and how impactful that could be to your fundamentals?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, jump in, Scott, I'll try to answer the first part and the second of the question. First part is on Italy. I think that has been some impact at some of the higher brands of the revenue on PPT, principal per transaction, has been impacted for putting some regulation from non-European Union Citizen showing ID. But I believe long term, look at Italy, we have the retails and we have the banks there, right? And bank customers don't -- who have the Know Your Customer registered already, don't have to go through the process, only the retail customers have to go through the process. So our portfolio is pretty well settled. And we -- it's not the first time we have it in some countries. In the beginning you'll see some changes on the process that impact on the transaction numbers. But long term, we always come back to customers and they said, well, then -- still use our service. On the housing then, I would say that it will help, right? Everything, building new houses, building in the construction, it helps. They are our first sign in the U.S. that employment rates are picking up. That will definitely help that our customers, many of our customers do work in the construction area, they do make money and send back to their loved ones. In Gulf states, you saw some investments, as you recall, in the last 3 quarters or some -- I talk about the investment in Saudi Arabia. And that started to payback and the customers are sending -- working there and sending back to the south Asian corridors.","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, and Darrin, in regard to the outlook. In the fourth quarter, we did see some impact from the Italy regulations, so we've built that into our 2012 outlook. And likewise, for the U.S., we haven't built in an assumption that things are going to improve due to housing.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's great and helpful. And then one quick question on the margin again. I know there's been a couple of points discussing it, but correct me if I'm wrong, I was under the impression that depreciation and amortization, or incremental DNA from Travelex was around -- it was, I think, over $50 million in the year. That's somewhere around 90 basis points of pressure on a year-over-year basis. But your guidance on EBITDA margins is really only for mildly higher, right? About 30, 40 basis points. So is there maybe just some conservatism built into that, or is it just an approximation?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. We just called out the intangible amortization, which is going -- combined for business solution and Travelex going from about $20 million to $60 million, so there's a $40 million impact there, which is roughly 70 basis points or so. There is additional depreciation as well. There's additional, I think, about $50 million or so of depreciation coming from Travelex.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. And then just last question on Mexico. Can you just give a little more color on what exactly you're doing there? I just, maybe, I think you mentioned before how you're expecting a little bit of slower trend, but maybe give us some -- a little more explanation, and then I'll just go back to the queue after that.","Hikmet Ersek","Hey, Darrin, if you look at our Mexico business, it's really -- it's a little bit affected by ongoing compliance pressures which we are changing, especially from southwest border. As you recall, we had agreed on 2009 to work with an independent monitor on our compliance activities. And that we see that some of the activities has been impacted our business. And we're also looking at 2012, all our model of practices in Mexico. We are in process of reviewing some agent agreements and changing our operating model in Mexico. We're going to upgrade our compliance-related changes. We're going to be more -- we really want to be the industry standard and the highest standard of industry. I think we want to really be the highest there. So I believe that we have the right approach there. And just to put the things in perspective, as you know, none of our business -- Mexico is not larger than 6% in 2011 of our business, right? So ...","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just had another question on the margin. Just trying to conceptualize longer-term. I know you guys have always talked to the management team as being committed to long-term margin expansion of the business. And obviously in '12, you've got kind of this one-off situation with the intangibles due to the Travelex deal but at the same time, you're telling us that you don't see any other large acquisitions on your near-term horizon. So if you kind of take that factor out longer-term, can you just talk us through where you guys stand from a strategic perspective in terms of the priority of margin to expand longer-term, both on an EBIT and on EBITDA basis?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I think -- first of all, management is committed for the margin expansion. To do that, we need to grow. And I think we are investing in the right way to do -- to get the growth, right? We have been -- as you saw in 2012, a little bit impacted -- we believe we're going to be impacted from the economic slowdown, especially in Europe. And that will impact our growth rates, which were being similar to 2011 Q4. That's the projection we have it from 2012. So on the growth rate, I have to say that besides the card business will grow on the C2C, but we believe also the B2B growing low double-digit and also electronic channels growing on the 40% approximately. I think we are really set for the growth. And with that investment, they will be definitely a help on the margin expansion. So my team and I am very committed for the margin expansion, but for that, we need definitely growth. You want to jump on that?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. The only thing I would add, Jason, is that these business models are set up to drive margin expansion with roughly 65% of our cost variable, 35% of our costs are fixed. As a management team, on a long-term basis, we're committed to drive margin expansion, whether that's operating margin or EBITDA margin. And just review the 2 things that are impacting the operating margins in '12, the additional amortization, and then, if you will, the investments we're making in the business, the $35 million for digital, we believe that will be a $0.5 billion business in 2015. So we think it's very much well worth the investment today for the future.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That all makes sense. Just to shift gears for a second over to Travelex because I think the execution that, that part, that people are really focused on. And if I recall, when you guys announced the acquisition, you suggest that it would be accretive to cash EPS in 2012. So I wanted to confirm, is that still the case? And any sense you can give us on order of magnitude there?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. It is, for sure, still cash accretive to EPS in 2012. Looking forward to 2013, we expect it to be both GAAP accretive and cash accretive in 2013. As far as magnitude, I'd probably have you think about roughly the intangibles going from $20 million to $60 million as a noncash charge, if you will, Jason. And then, we do have $50 million of integration charges, although those are cash, we expect those to go away in the future, as we get it integrated.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up on Travelex, and I guess more broadly on Business Solutions. Can you give us an update on the size of the sales force there and growth plans for the sales force in 2012, as you continue to pursue the double-digit top line growth opportunities on that side of the business?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, I mean, if you think about our business, we are very active on the set, now we are in 23 countries. We have about 500 people selling our products there, getting to SMEs. We have about 100,000 SME customers in our portfolio. Our approach is really using our existing agent network, which do consumer-to-consumer money transfer, also selling B2B. And it works already, we have about 16 agents signed on that, 6 of them are already active selling this, our business. So we are very much active on selling that, and our sales force is about 500 people selling our products there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Just to back up real quickly and to make sure I have the growth rates for 2012 correct. Can you just give us that target growth rates for C2C? And then maybe if you can decouple electronic channels in '12? And then lastly, the Business Solutions piece, please?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, well, I'll work backwards with Business Solutions. What we expect there is low double-digit constant currency revenue growth, not only for 2012, but really over the next several years. For electronics, we expect double-digit, strong double-digit revenue growth in the electronic business. And then, Julio, the color on the C2C business is that the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter, those type of growth rates, we're cautious about Europe, but we expect C2C to see those type of growth rates throughout 2012.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe, Hikmet, this one more directly for you. If we go back and compare the strategy that you laid out back in 2010 at the end of the year. You had identified a lot of the -- quite frankly, a lot of the same things that you're talking about today in terms of areas of investments. And yet, as we go into 2012, it feels like you have to do more in the way of incremental investments to sort of to keep pace. Is it the economy that's driving some of the requirements for incremental investments? Is there more competition? So if you could just kind of help us bridge the gap between what you guys sort of laid out as your investment strategy in 2010 versus where you are now to 2012. Where is the change on the margin in the sense that you guys actually have to go out and invest more to stay more competitive?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I mean, if we -- as we talked in 2010, and as you recall, our investors meeting there, we outlined our strategy. I think we are really executing against our strategy now. What we did is also -- we won't forget that we expect the margin in 2011, and think we are doing the right thing. We grow the revenue since 2008. The highest growth was in 2011, the best year on the top line. So I think we have the right strategy. Plus last year, we built a second leg on the B2B. We have, on customers and Travelex put together to rescue Business Solutions, and we want to grow that by double-digit, low double-digit growth. So on the electronic channels, Julio, really, we are -- one, that was growing 35% to 40% already with limited capabilities. So what we are doing here is that taking this business channel, a new region called, or whatever it is they call it, the new channels to $500 million, $0.5 billion business. And that needs some capability investments. That needs some investments to around the consumers and that's what we are really doing on that part. I wouldn't say that big pricing -- big pricing challenge globally. As you recall, our pricing investment was around 1% 2011, and we assume that it will be 1% to 2% in 2012.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just lastly on the competitive front, with all of the different P2P options that have popped up over the last couple of months now with, obviously, PayPal and Fiserv, and in MCR, yesterday, all kind of jump in to B2B. How do you think about that from a competitive dynamic going forward?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, from the competition side, I think we are very well-positioned. What differentiates us from the competition, as I said, is our global brand, our regulator relationship present in 200 countries, and our connecting the electronic with the retail. Plus, I just wanted to say also, on the prepaid side and also on the top up side, we have a partnership with MasterCard. And I'm very excited, actually, with our partnership with Ajay Banga and I sit together, we talked about how that could be. These 2 companies, Western Union serving the underserved customers having the brand awareness in emerging markets combining with MasterCard's capability with electronic capability makes big sense to take that, our stored value, to the next stage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Kissane with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just following up on Darrin's question. The compliance issues in Mexico, are those industry-wide or company-specific? And maybe, if you can be a little more specific in terms of how you're going to change the model and maybe some of the agent, how you deal with the agents, and will there be any impact on pricing in Mexico?","Hikmet Ersek","Thanks, Jim. On Mexico, I would say that it's more company-specific because we came on the 2009 in an agreement, as you recall, and we are implementing really with the independent monitor, the agreement requirements. And it does impact our business. I would say that also it sets industry standard, at which we are very proud. I think we are building on that, but it does impact our business, especially in some southwest border. I think that's where we are really focused on that. And that's really -- it's a high priority within the company, and we believe that long-term, we're in a very well-positioned environment with that.","Scott T. Scheirman","And Jim, on the agent model, we're currently in negotiations for agent renewals in Mexico. So it's premature for us to talk about what's going to happen there. But once things are finalized, we'll be able on the discuss that.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. But that's on the receive side, not so much on the send side?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, you're right.","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. On the southwest border is on the send side, the compliance issues, Jim.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then in Russia, you talked about the retail competition being more intense. Looking out, how are you -- plan on countering the retail competition in Russia?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, we're going to do that same things which we do with the European Union with the PSD. I think we will have the right sales force there also. The big thing is also it's a pricing issue there. I think we have to balance between pricing and gaining market share and gaining transactions. I think that that's all in our business plan, and we have the right plan to expand that.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just last question on China. Can you give us an outlook on the revenue growth there, and did the time or the new year have any impact on the fourth quarter growth?","Hikmet Ersek","As you know, we don't give -- we didn't -- we never give specific numbers on China. But generally, I think we are very well-positioned in China. It had some currency impact, Scott, believe me, right? That's currency. It had impact, some on the higher RPG. Also, some corridors had some regulations from Africa to China and to South America...","Scott T. Scheirman","To South America.","Hikmet Ersek","To South America, was not China. But China have some impact on our business on the regulation side. But generally, I would say that with our locations there, we had top banks, now we have also the regional banks there, I would say that we've -- good position. And don't forget, China is currently an inbound country only.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Follow-up on the Travelex or the B2B business. I think when you bought Travelex, you were looking for about $400 million in revenue in 2012, and I know currencies moved, then the dollar strengthened a little bit since then. But what is your outlook for revenue for that B2B piece in 2012?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, it's very similar to use a round number as we combine Travelex-Western Union Business Solutions, we expect it's about that $400 million number.","Robert P. Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just on your digital business. $100 million to $500 million. I mean, that's a 50% annualized growth rate. Are you on track for that in 2012, that kind of growth organically? And this is all without acquisitions?","Hikmet Ersek","I think, yes, that's without acquisitions. And I believe that we are on track on to reach our $500 million business. We are very confident about that.","Scott T. Scheirman","And Bob, you can imagine, we're investing in a lot of these things that's going to help the business. So until the investments are in place, the growth will come a little bit later. But we have strong growth last year in the existing business, we expect strong growth, but the growth will probably ramp up as we go out towards 2015.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just on your growth rate, I mean, do you think you're losing some market share now? I mean, the World Bank is looking for, I think, upper mid-single digit transaction growth. I mean, you saw MoneyGram report mid-double digit near, I think, 13% transaction growth. I mean are some of these issues in Mexico, in Italy, in Russia, are you currently losing market share, do you think?","Hikmet Ersek","We believe in the cross-border money transfer, we gain market share. We compare, as you know, Rob, usually with Aite, our numbers. We believe we gain share. We do have, as I mentioned before, seen some countries like Russia or Southern Europe, some challenges. But I would say that our belief is gaining market share, and we believe we've gained market share in 2011.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And if you look -- yes, last question. Your Bill Pay business. If you go back several years, I mean, that Bill Pay business, the U.S. piece, I think, was -- a lot of that was rapid pay. Your margins, you were generating operating margins in the 30% range. And granted the mortgage piece isn't coming back to rapid pay, but the auto finance is screaming back in the U.S. as far as the growth and -- or I mean, is that business changed such that you don't have the operating leverage, you're not going to get -- I mean, I would have expected to see a little bit more acceleration in growth in the U.S. business, given the growth of -- I think, auto was -- is a big piece of that business. You've added a lot of billers. But what is going on with that business? Can -- I mean, are the margins that we saw in the past just not achievable in the future? Is there more competition?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. Definitely, that business has evolved over time, especially as we move through the financial crisis of 2009 and 2010 with subprime and so forth. We do now have 10,000 billers, so we're further diversifying our biller base. The one thing I'd probably point out, Bob, that might be helpful in the fourth quarter, out of the Global Business Payments segment, if you take out Travelex now in that -- if you take Travelex out of that, that segment would have had margins over 20%. So the margins are getting better there. When you kind of look more on of an apples-to-apples basis. And we do believe that business, in 2012, the C2B business would be steady. Although the revenue could be somewhat impacted by some of the Durbin pass-through, but we do see a steady C -- C2B business in 2012. In the last 3 quarters, we have grown that business 2%, where it was declining before that. So we feel like we are on the right path to improving that business.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Didn't Travelex have margins in the 30% range, excluding amortization expense?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes. Travelex had EBITDA margins right about 30% range. Travelex Global Business Payments. But you have to remember, in the fourth quarter, we had $5 million of integration expense, we had depreciation and amortization, so all those things impacted that segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a few very quick questions. First, Hikmet, at the time of the September 2010 Analyst Day, you highlighted agent commission as a significant source of possible cost savings as you go through the 5-year contract renewal cycle. Where do you stand with respect to that renewal cycle? And do you still believe that you could bring commission rates down over time?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes. I think, yes. The answer is yes. We are bringing down and it's -- especially the agent contract renegotiation, there's always the seasonality. In some years, it's higher because of the agent contracts are coming to renewals with CapEx investments, everything, the effective rates impacts there. But generally, our current cost of services going south, which is going down, which is great, and helps us. And it's also win-win situation, long-term agreements, I think we have the right formula here, bringing the agent commissions long-term down, and keeping the agents for a longer time with -- in our network.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And second, Scott, do you still expect to have ballpark $70 million of restructuring cost savings in 2012?","Scott T. Scheirman","We do. It was $55 million in '11. We think there'll be an incremental $15 million. So $70 million in 2012.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. And just a quick final question, nice to see the 25% dividend increase. Can you be a little more granular on your acquisition appetite? Are you done with the big deals for now and it's, basically, all share repurchase and dividends? Or are you still on a lookout for large transactions?","Hikmet Ersek","Oh, I think obviously, constant -- as a business leader, you are constantly look on acquisition opportunities, right? That's my -- is that an opportunity, we have a healthy capital structure, so we do look at it. But I think our focus for 2012 is mainly on the integration of Travelex. We did a big move in 2011. We built a second leg of business and we are focused on our -- now I don't see from today's point of view, on a bigger acquisition like the Travelex one, but we do see opportunities on the smaller one, which will expand our capabilities in electronic channels or in other parts of the business. So I will say that we are constantly looking for an acquisition but not on a larger scale. Current, I don't see another opportunity.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Quick final question. Where are the TGBP integration costs located in the P&L? Are they cost of services or SG&A?","Scott T. Scheirman","The $5 billion, it's split, a little bit in cost of services and SG&A. And what we may do, David, on a go-forward basis in 2012, is give you color on how those break between the 2 lines.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had 2 questions. First one, just going back to the capital a bit. Can you at all talk about ultimately what you think the capital returns, sort of what the profile might look like between buyback and dividend? You currently sit, I guess, roughly around a 20%, 25% payout ratio, which is obviously much better than it was, and you've done a good job there. Do you see that as a ratio, as we look out 3, 4, 5 years, that it could be notably higher than the current payout ratio, with more emphasis on the dividend versus the buyback?","Scott T. Scheirman","Tim, it's Scott. As we think about our business, we clearly want to invest in our business, but also get cash back to our shareholders, and we want to do that in a balanced way. Probably, one way to look at that historically is the last 4 years, we've raised the dividend, at least once per year, if you will, from that standpoint. So we'll continue to work closely with our board and our management team to have dialogue around that. But as the business performs, as things work, we would like to do things to move the dividend up. But also be balanced with the stock buyback. The good news with our business, we generate so much cash flow, it allows us to do a number of things, whether it's investing in the business, moving the dividend up like we did today, about 25%, and returning cash to our shareholders through stock buyback.","Hikmet Ersek","Also, keeping the -- in the right balance cash availability, because it's important also for us in parts of the world to have the ratings in place. And if you go to the several parts of the world, you want to keep a good rating company, which other big companies want to work with you. That's the financial strength is also important to keep the business and have a good relationship with many partners.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up I have was just going back to the electronic channels. I apologize if you hit on this in prior answers in your comments. But do you at all have any kind of feel for, if there's any, even if it's minor, cannibalization of sort of the legacy customer base or legacy transaction that is occurring with your growth of account-to-cash or through mobile? And then as you think about this $500 million target, do you all expect people that are typically going in and sending money as an agent are going to be part of that equation, and now they're going to do it from their mobile phone or off the computer instead going to an agent and sending money to a relative or somebody overseas?","Hikmet Ersek","Yes, well, most of the customers are new customers, we are getting to New Customer segment. There may be some of the cannibalization. But depending also on the geography where you are. In some countries, it's really new. In some countries, the existing ones are using. That I would say that generally, I would say, it's the new customers. We believe we are really coming to a New Customer segment. And on the receive side, we are being -- I mean, I give also me as an example, right? I used to go to a location, Safeway location, since we have westernunion.com in the U.S. and me, I'm a new migrant, I send money to my father in Istanbul with electronic because I don't have time to go through that. But I still on Saturdays and Sundays, I go to Safeway and still use it. So it's a balance between that, absolutely.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just want to go back to segments and these investments for the year. You called out the $35 million incremental for the digital channel. But could you either put a round number around the consolidated investment that you're looking at this year, or at least can you help us with your costs to the build out the sales force? And then these other incremental expenses as it relates to Mexico, Italy and Russia?","Scott T. Scheirman","Yes, to kind of give you a sense, and you hit on the $35 million to the digital investment, and I would say that's, of all the investments, that's the larger piece of it for sure. We are investing in the sales force. We think, we believe, we have opportunities to increase even more market shares and march towards that 1 million locations down the road, if you will. Also to make some investments behind the technology and customer acquisitions. But I don't want to parse it too fine, Dan. But think about digital, $35 million is the bigger -- biggest part of that investment.","Michael A. Salop","Yes, as you think of -- yes, so when you think about these investments in WU-dot-com, and sales force, I  mean, these are infrastructure investments, so we're hiring people and creating technology that will be there as ongoing as well.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And as you think about doubling your agent network from here, how do we think about the incremental margins associated with those? I suspect they're smaller in size, will there be any super agents that you have to rely on? Is there a new infrastructure that you think you have to have in order to get you to doubling of that size? It's a pretty significant call-out for you guys.","Hikmet Ersek","Well, it is significant expansion of our retail thing. Don't forget that we really started to get -- first of all, we do have direct agent relationship. I think the super agent model, what we had in the past, opening account to be done, entrepreneur, and expanding, it's all where you are really having the direct agent model, which is also more cost efficient with us. So we believe that certain geography, certain class of trade is still untapped. Certain banks in U.S. are still untapped, and some retailers in Europe. But most importantly, emerging markets, there are still a huge numbers, as we -- nobody -- as I was over the seas, a few years ago, we wouldn't come up, coming up with 200,000 locations in Asia-Pacific. I think we significantly changed the environment. And knowing the market a little bit, there are still opportunities to grow that, and I believe we can do that.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And on the types of the transactions that you would expect from this kind of the next bucket of agents. are you expecting as much cross-border transaction or more kind of intra-country transactions, where you might not get the spread?","Hikmet Ersek","Several financial services, which I outlined from my strategy could be cross-border, intra-transactions also, but cross-border also. And some of the countries which are inbound-only will be turned to outbound also, because the migration patterns are changing. And in the rural areas, still, we have a need to expand that. Also, could be with our MasterCard agreement, some of them using as a top up location as we expand the -- our prepaid and stored value activities, globally, with partners. That will be also part of it.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, can you just from the appetite that the super agents are having to sell this business-to-business or Business Solutions -- I know you said there are 16 that signed up, 6 are active. Are you expecting that to be at all significant as you look at maybe just Business Solutions as a standalone segment in 2012 and '13? Or is that in the still kind of early days as a cross-selling opportunity?","Hikmet Ersek","First, we just started with that, right? So I think it's the early days to tell how that will be. But I believe really on that model, the reason for that, it reminds me how we expanded our consumer-to-consumer money transfer business. It's a similar part. And the more and more request is coming actually from the agents saying that, \"Yes, eventually, you have a new business segment, we can also send this -- sell before -- besides the C2C also B2B with our existing.\" Is it in Latin America or is it in Philippines? They say that, \"Hey, you have already existing Western Union brand there. We have the regulatory environment there, why shouldn't we sell also to money transfer part also to the small business entities?\"","Operator","And our last question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'll be quick, just 2 questions. I guess it sounds like compliance and regulatory challenges are hampering the growth rate in several countries, Italy, Mexico, China. I guess, Hikmet, do you worry that, that could spread to other nations and just becomes a global phenomenon?","Hikmet Ersek","Well, I think, first of all, with our compliance one, we are really on it. I think Western Union is, I believe, has the focus, and it's a higher priority in our environment. I think they're really setting the industry standard. And my aim is, with our general counsel and with around the money laundering activities, to set up in our very high priority. That's the thing. I would say that regulatory environment and this business has been always challenging in 200 countries. I wouldn't say that as a spread out because we have the right environment, in many countries, don't forget that we have already 0 thresholds, which we did implemented. We work very closely to regulators. And some of the competitive that has been always a challenge to enter some markets because of the regulatory environment. I feel quite confident that we have the right structure to meet the regulatory environment needs.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one for Scott. I think operating margins ended up at 26.1% for the year. And that's excluding restructuring. I think the guidance was 26% to 26.5%. So that was a little bit on the low end. Just was wondering, Scott, if there were any takes that put us there on that side of the fence towards the low end?","Scott T. Scheirman","Not particularly. We had a wide range -- or I shouldn't say a wide range, but 26% to 26.5%. FX did have some impact on that. And then we did pick up $9 million of deal cost in the fourth quarter. So there's a variety of things, but they came in, basically, exactly where we expected. And then, 2012, we are expecting to improve the EBITDA margins. So we're on path to do that.","Michael A. Salop","For the full year, we had $20 million of deal cost related to the Travelex acquisitions which at the -- I mean, FX was a big impact on margin last year as well.","Well, thanks, everyone, for the call. We hope you have a good evening, and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's 2017 third quarter results and then we will take your questions.","The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in the supplemental tables with our press release.","Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements.

We are pleased with the third quarter results, including the continued success of our digital growth initiatives. Overall, we delivered 3% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter with solid profit margins and strong cash flow generation.","Looking at the business segments, consumer money transport growth was led by digital as westernunion.com money transfer revenues increased 23% in the quarter. We continue to be a leader in digital with more than 40 Western Union markets that can deliver funds to over 200 countries and territories across the world.","The third quarter results also demonstrate the geographic diversity of our business. C2C growth in the quarter was led by strong performance from Latin America outbound markets, such as Argentina, Brazil and Chile, which helped offset continued weakness in the oil-producing countries of the Middle East and Africa.","In our payments business, Business Solutions revenue improved to a slight increase in the quarter and our Argentina, Pago Facil and U.S. Speedpay bill payments businesses each delivered double-digit growth. Overall, we are on track with our constant-currency revenue growth expectations for the year, with reported growth slightly more favorable than expected due to strengthening of key foreign exchange rates.","Turning to profitability, our adjusted operating margin was healthy 20.6% in the quarter. We also continued to use our strong cash flow generation to return significant funds to shareholders with over $700 million returned year-to-date through dividends and share repurchases.","Now, due to favorable results and trends, we are pleased to raise both our adjusted and GAAP earnings per share outlook ranges for 2017, which Raj will discuss in more details in a few minutes. Strategically, we are focused on accelerating top-line growth over the coming years. Growth initiatives in consumer money transfer include further digital expansion and optimization of our retail business, primarily by improving the customer experience and increasing retention.","Some recent progress points of these initiatives include the rollout of westernunion.com in Kuwait and agreement to preinstall Western Union's app on Wiko smartphones in France and further expansion of our account payout network.","Initiatives in the payments-based businesses also include digitization efforts such as the EDGE platform in Business Solutions and the next generation platform for Speedpay. And we are putting more resources behind expanding our verticals business which focuses on specialized areas such as education payments and has consistently been our best performer within Business Solutions. We are also continuing to explore opportunities to leverage our unique global cross-border capabilities to drive more and new types of money movement through our platform.","To fund and drive implementation of these growth initiatives, we have been focused on producing additional operating efficiencies. Our WU Way business transformation is an important part of these efforts. Although many benefits of the WU Way will take some time to realize, we are seeing good results from the initial implementations, especially we expect to achieve approximately $25 million of cost savings in 2017, increasing to a run rate of $50 million next year.","The technology footprint consolidation and in-sourcing efforts are well underway as we consolidate 50 IT locations to a handful of key sites, and the implementation of lean management techniques in our regional operations centers, in Lithuania and Costa Rica, are delivering significant productivity improvements.","Rolling out the WU Way across our organization and processes is a multi-year effort, but it's an important part of creating efficiencies to help drive long-term growth. And we are very encouraged by the first-year progress.","So to summarize, our third quarter results were solid and we have increased our full-year earnings per share outlook. Our cash flows have allowed us to continue to execute significant dividend and share repurchase programs and we are advancing long-term efficiency and growth initiatives.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the third quarter results and our full-year outlook in more detail.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you, Hikmet. Third quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion increased 2% compared to the prior-year period or 3% on a constant-currency basis. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced third quarter revenue by approximately $8 million (07:38) compared to the prior year. In the consumer-to-consumer segment revenues increased 1% on both the reported and constant-currency basis from the quarter. Transactions grew 2% led by strong growth in westernunion.com.","Total C2C cross-border principal increased 4%, or 2% on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction increased 1%, or was flat constant currency. The spread between C2C transaction growth and revenue growth in the quarter was 1% with no impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1% in the quarter, while pricing was flat compared to the prior-year period.","Turning to the regional results for the quarter, I will be referring to constant-currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the region's results. North America revenue increased 1% on a reported and constant-currency basis, while transactions grew 2%. Strong U.S. outbound growth driven by sends to Latin American and Caribbean countries was partially offset by a weaker trend in the U.S. domestic and U.S. to Mexico businesses.","The U.S. domestic money transfer business originated at retail locations declined due to price reductions and softer transaction trends. Although, we continued to see good domestic growth from westernunion.com.","In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 2%, or 1% on a constant-currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. Revenue growth was again led by France with mixed results from other countries across the region.","In the Middle East, and Africa, South Asia region, revenue declined 8% in both reported and constant-currency terms while transactions were down 11%. The revenue decline improved relative to second quarter's rate, but we still experienced the impact of soft conditions in the oil-producing markets.","Total inbound business to India was down approximately 10% in the quarter which improved sequentially from a revenue decline of about 15% last quarter. Weakness in the Middle East send markets continued to contribute to the decline. In the APAC region, revenue declined 1% or increased 1% constant currency while transactions were flat.","In the Latin America and Caribbean region, Argentina and several other South American markets continued to drive very strong growth. Revenue increased 19% in the region or 22% constant currency on transaction growth of 17%.","westernunion.com C2C revenue delivered strong results again in the quarter with revenue growing 23% on both a reported and constant currency basis driven by 24% transaction growth. westernunion.com represented 10% of total C2C revenue in the quarter.","Business Solutions revenues grew 2% or 1% constant currency, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from the loss of the XE.com business.","Revenues benefited from good growth in key verticals such as universities and NGOs, but this was partially offset by continued declines in sales of hedging products, partially due to lower FX volatility in key markets. Other revenues increased 9% in the third quarter, or 13% on a constant currency basis.","Other revenue growth was driven by Speedpay in the U.S. and the Pago Facil walk-in bill payments business in Argentina. The bill payments businesses represented over 85% of other revenues in the quarter and our Speedpay U.S. electronic bill payments business is the largest component.","Turning to margins and profitability, the consolidated GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 19.3%, which compared to 20.2% in the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin of 20.6% in the quarter compared to 21.7% in the prior year. The margin decline in the quarter was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and increased marketing spend.","Adjusted metrics in the current quarter exclude $10 million of WU Way expenses and $8 million related to an accrual for estimated cost of an independent auditor which was required by our January joint settlement agreements with federal and state government.","The prior-year quarter excludes $5 million of WU Way expenses and $15 million of accruals related to the joint settlement agreement. We achieved approximately $11 million of savings from the WU Way initiatives in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date savings totaled to $12 million. We now expect approximately $25 million of savings for the full year, up from our previous estimate of $20 million. Full year WU Way spending is expected to be closer to $95 million, down from the previous estimate of $100 million.","Currency negatively impacted operating profit in the quarter by approximately $9 million compared to the prior-year period. Foreign exchange hedges in the third quarter had a negative impact of $2 million due to the strengthening of the euro and other key currencies, which compared to a benefit of $12 million in the third quarter of 2016. For the full year, we now expect approximately $5 million in hedge benefits.","Compliance expense was 3.5% of revenue in the third quarter. We now expect compliance expense for the full year to be closer to the low end of the 3.5% to 4% range in our outlook. EBITDA margin of 24% in the quarter compared to 25% in the prior-year period, while adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.3% compared to 26.5% in the prior-year period with the decline attributable to the same factors as operating profit margins.","The effective tax rate in the quarter was 1.5% compared to 9.6% in the third quarter of last year. The adjusted tax rate was 3.6%, which compared to 11.7% in the prior-year period. The tax rate in the quarter reflects discrete benefits related to statute of limitations expirations on certain reserved items. Our full year tax rate outlook has not changed, as we continue to expect full-year tax rate outlook has not changed, as we continue to expect the gap effective tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11% and the adjusted rate to be approximately 12% to 13%.","GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 in the third quarter increased from $0.44 in the prior year period, while adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 increased from $0.47 in the third quarter of last year.","The C2C margin was 23.5% compared to 25.1% in the prior-year period. The margin decrease was primarily due to higher incentive compensation-related expense and increased marketing spend.","Business Solutions operating profit margin was 9.1% in the quarter compared to 4% in the prior-year period driven by operating expense efficiencies and lower depreciation and amortization which were partially offset by higher technology expense.","Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $11 million in the current quarter compared to $13 million in the prior-year period. The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 19.7% which compared to 17.5% in the third quarter of 2016. Operating margins for the businesses included in other revenues was 10.5% in the quarter which compared to 10.1% in the prior year. The year-over-year margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and technology efficiencies, which were partially offset by higher compensation-related spends and higher bank fees in U.S. electronic bill pay.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $423 million year-to-date. This includes outflows of approximately $600 million from payments related to the settlement with federal and state governments and WU Way spending, net of associated tax benefit. Capital expenditures were $47 million in the third quarter. And at the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.5 billion in cash of $1 billion with approximately half of the cash held by United States entities.","During the quarter, we issued $100 million of five-year notes with a coupon of 3.6% and $250 million of floating rate notes due in 2019. We returned $180 million to shareholders in the quarter, consisting of $80 million in dividends and $100 million of share repurchases, which represented 5 million shares. The outstanding share count at quarter-end was 459 million shares and we had $956 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Based on our results and recent business trends, we are affirming the outlooks for operating margin and increasing our earnings per share and cash flow outlooks compared to our previous outlook reported on August 3.","We are increasing our outlook for GAAP revenue slightly to reflect a more favorable exchange rate while the constant currency revenue outlook has not changed. We now expect GAAP revenue growth to be a low-single-digit increase, a slight improvement from the previous outlook of flat to low-single-digit increase. Given favorable profitability trends, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $1.75 to $1.85, up from $1.70 to $1.80 previously.","GAAP earnings per share, which has also been increased to a range of $1.50 to $1.60 compared to $1.46 to $1.56 in our previous outlook. Both earnings per share ranges reflect an approximately $0.07 negative impact from foreign exchange compared to the prior year, down slightly from our previous projection of an $0.08 negative impact. We are increasing expected GAAP cash flow from operating activities to approximately $600 million primarily due to tax-related items, better-than-expected working capital changes and increased profitability. On the tax items, the approximately $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to the 2011 IRS agreement are no longer expected to be paid in 2017.","In addition, this year's cash flow is benefiting from a tax refund related to prior-year overpayment and other lower than expected tax payments. Excluding the impacts of the settlement agreement payments and WU Way spending, expected operating cash flow for the full year would be approximately $1.2 billion.","So to summarize, we are pleased with the solid business performance in the third quarter. We generated strong profitability and cash flow, continued to return significant funds to shareholders and increased our earnings per share outlook for the year.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Good afternoon to all of you guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hello. How are you?","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm well, I'm well. The margins were nicely ahead of our expectations and you're running, I guess, what 20.6% year-to-date, you're guiding to approximately 20%. So, I'm curious, why not raise the margin outlook for the year, should we expect a step-down in the fourth quarter?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Tien-Tsin, this is Raj. We are guiding to approximately 20%. So it could be a little bit above or around that range, it really depends on how the spending goes in the fourth quarter. We have planned for additional spend in marketing in other areas in the fourth quarter, so the margins are likely to be lower in the fourth quarter, but the overall margin for the year should be still quite solid.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","As you've seen.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah. Got the approximate is the keyword.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yes.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, I'll ask on the WU Way savings there. I guess, you guys upped your savings a little bit and then actually reduced the expense of it by about the same amount. So is that \u2013 given how far along you are in that, is there more sort of upside here given what you've seen, what's driving the exact savings? Just trying to get better understanding what's structural versus maybe something just better than what you expected?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, Tien-Tsin, let me take that one. As you know, the WU Way initiative is a real lean management initiative which we implemented all over the company. The first results are very encouraging, it's better than we expected. I think the company started to operate in a different way, more much in a efficient way. And that is the one that's a reflection. Now, we are taking that, it's a multi-year shipment taking all over the company. And we expect $50 million of savings next year and this is encouraging and also operating in a different way.","And what we are going to do, also taking the lean management tools really focusing on our growth initiatives also. We want to take that, it's not only cost savings, it's really to drive the growth stronger especially in the new initiatives and doing in a better way, that's something that we are very excited about.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Operator","The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Darrin.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, Hikmet. Let's just start off, I mean, it looks like pricing and transaction trends are fairly stable again. If you could just touch on that in terms of sustainability along with what implications we have on the model around mix on the RPT, the per transaction revenue? And then just as part of that, the World Bank I know took up remittance flow estimates to, I think, the mid-single-digit range. So is that, do you find that the trends you're seeing now on the transaction trends now should even be more so \u2013 does it look more sustainable now in the context of what we're seeing from some of the outside estimates? Thanks.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I can take maybe that overview, big view, and Raj can go on the mix maybe, more mix side. Well, generally, I would say that we are satisfied with our transaction growth and with our business. And as you said, it's stable, we'd \u2013 also don't see a lot of price pressure there. There have always been as I mentioned, some corridors, we're going to adjust that, but generally the prices are very stable and we are comfortable with where we are with that and also with the transaction growth.","The big help for Western Union is always being in 200 countries, and we are having a strong portfolio. We have strong geographic diversity, we have a very strong outbound Latin America outbound business, which recently really came out, U.S. outbound is still strong growth. We did see some softness in U.S. to U.S., but U.S. to Mexico maybe but it's not that big, so it's only of one quarter. I would say that the business generally is very stable and the diversity is very good. France is doing good, Europe is doing good. So these are good numbers, transaction-wise good.","There are some mix, definitely \u2013 maybe, Raj, you want to add some comments?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. On the mix impact of about 1 point in the quarter that's something that we have been seeing for this year. It's really hard to predict exactly where that will be. And it really just depends on where we're getting the growth and obviously the growth is coming from lower RPT corridors and lower growth in higher RPT corridors and if you look at last year it was about the same and then, in 2015 it was flattish in terms of overall mix impact.","And the World Bank data, they adjusted their principal growth for last year and our principal growth was in line with what the World Bank showed and then for this year, they expect something just under 4% principal growth. Our third quarter, we grew about 4% in principal, so we'll see where we end up for the year, but we're tracking in terms of at least the third quarter.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. So just also as you said, Darrin, in the last quarters, actually not only this quarter, has been quite stable the business. Our core business is extremely resilient and the growth is definitely coming from our new initiatives like the digitalization, like in also...","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right, that makes sense.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","... about 10% of our revenue.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, I know. That helps. I mean one of the things that you guys used to consistently call out pricing pressure as almost part of your annual guide of a couple of points and we \u2013 it just seems like we're in a different environment now and I wonder if there is something that's structurally changed in your view that's causing that. I mean just the stability has been pretty consistent?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I think remember the big pricing investment was 2012. So it was...","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","...many, many years ago and we did adjust our business, sort of reset our business there. I think we've been very stable and the other thing is also, it's a complex business, there is a complexity on that. I believe also the competitors and everybody understands that moving money cross-border, cross-currency is a complex business and we've been quite active in the early years investing in the compliance, investing in the technology and really adjusting, resetting our business; that helped a lot to have that consistency.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. In various countries.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Darrin, we have, as you know, we have thousands and thousands of corridors, so we're always moving pricing in many of those corridors, sometimes up, sometimes down, but on a macro basis, it doesn't translate too much in terms of net change.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","But individually, individual corridors we're moving pricing for sure.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That's helpful. Just one quick follow-up and I'll turn it back, is just on the, I think you guys mentioned you saw lower agent commissions \u2013 just if you can give us a little more color on that? I know that's gone back and forth through the years. But was that around negotiating at lower rates or is that a mix or can you just comment on that? And I guess, sustainability around that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I would say both of those things are benefiting us. We didn't call it out specifically this quarter, but we're continuing to see good performance from both the absolute commission rates that we're seeing in the business as well as the mix benefits from just faster growth of our digital business that's continued to drive overall commission rates down, if you will so, that trend is continuing. So it's a positive.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Darrin, I think it's a part of overall as I mentioned to Tien-Tsin before, it's a part of WU Way initiative overall, right, not only the commissions, but really how we operate more efficient in the market that lean the management helps also.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. All right. Very helpful guys, thanks.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Darrin.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. How you doing?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hello, Bryan.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just wanted to ask on the third quarter results, did \u2013 was it ahead of your guys' internal expectations and maybe if it was, what exactly was a little bit better and surprised you guys?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I would say that certainly the tax rate was lower. We had originally expected a lower tax rate in Q4. So that's certainly in terms of timing that's shifted. And, we've continued to see favorable profit trends with the currency helping us a little bit and we're also getting some benefits from lower compliance spend. So those things are positive and that's really why we've taken up our overall outlook for the year.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And the $0.05 raise in the guidance, was that predominantly currency?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","No. I would say there was some profit impact. Some of it was currency, $0.01 of it was roughly currency. Overall currency impact is about $0.01 better this time in our outlook versus last time and the rest of it was just favorable trends overall. And you know as I said, I think those are the two components.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then just on that lower compliance spend. Can you maybe talk, is that a trend in the marketplace, maybe you can talk about what you're seeing there and going forward, is it possible that number continues to track lower?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","No. I would say that, you know we're in the 3.5% to 4% range. Some of it is just timing more than anything else. But we're also trying to do things as efficiently as we can you know with technology and other solutions. So \u2013 you know we've been stable in that 3.5% to 4% range now for the last few years and you know so it's not \u2013 it's a relatively small range as you know, so that's we are still in that range.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","In general I would not see the compliance going away, in fact we do \u2013 we are invested constant in compliance programs.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yes.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Right, I mean that's going to be one of them, we see that as a competitive advantage and we did it in early years, Bryan don't forget that. I mean, that has been investment and I think we are continue to do. The thing is that we also put lean management tools there, and the efficient \u2013 we are running in a much more efficient way compliance and the team is doing a great job there.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, no, that's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hello, Jason.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe just to start on. Hello, there. I wanted to start the question on westernunion.com. Obviously, the trends have been pretty healthy there, and I just wanted to get your general thoughts on how long can we sustain these kind of low or mid-20s kind of revenue growth rates in that channel. I mean, you're now up to 10% of C2C. The base is getting a little bigger, but obviously the opportunity set is still big globally. So, I mean, is this \u2013 do you see kind of multi-year runway for these rough kind of growth rates or...?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Well, obviously, I have not given long-term guidance on the growth rates, but I think we are very pleased with the beginning of a big journey here. I believe that the growth will continue to happen from digital. We are just in around 40-plus countries around the world with our online send apps, with our westernunion.com applications and sending money to 200 countries. And the competition have a hard time to go to the more countries because we have the regulatory environment, we have the compliance, we pay out in 131 currencies, we pay out in 500,000 locations or 3.5 billion accounts that can go forever.","So, the growth rate is there and the team is expanding. We will like to be in 200 countries, sending money to 200 countries, that's our goal. Obviously, if we can send money via retail why not sending money only digital on 200 countries. So that's something we are focused on that. The growth is, as I said, it's just the beginning of a bigger picture.","But the growth happening here from send site and we also started to do our account payout which is a big advantage. We are \u2013 in India, for instance, we have about 100,000 locations. We are not paying only on the location, but a big chunk of the transaction is going now on accounts. And we opened that, that's also a new customer segment. It's 80% of our customers still as new to westernunion.com so I am excited about that.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just on the domestic money transfer business, I think you mentioned that there was some pricing pressure there. I mean was that in line with what you had anticipated or did something new happen in the quarter and when do we lap those pressures?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I didn't say the pricing pressure there. Our prices I believe in the U.S. domestic, we adjusted for a longer time and are quite competitive. And there are some price \u2013 some U.S. to U.S. softness, we see it currently, but I'm not sure it's the pricing pressure and we don't see significant price differences on the market there. Our transactions are below $200 and most of them are paid out in cash. But I think...","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","...the average is about $150 or something like that on the U.S. to U.S. only and paid out in cash and that's a big competitive advantage because we have 50,000 locations. You can send online, the sends are done mostly by online or by mobile app, but the payout is in cash. This combination between online and cash is a huge competitive advantage.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","And the dotcom business domestically continues to do very well and accelerated slightly actually in the quarter.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. Raj, just one more quick one for you. If I look at the LACA region, the constant-currency revenue growth has been well ahead of transaction growth for at least the last couple of quarters. Any callouts there in terms of what's driving that, is that spread expected to continue?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","I don't have a forecast for the spread, but some of it is continuing from the larger price reductions we had made in Argentina more than a year ago. So some of that is continuing, but overall I would just say the Latin America business is getting healthy growth across the board. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the conditions are quite strong there. We've seen stronger growth throughout that region more than we've seen in some time. So it's good.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Maybe, Jason, just maybe use the opportunity, we are also now focused on the traditional inbound countries, which for years were inbound countries, also doing outbound from there. You can see like Argentina or Brazil or Turkey or Russia they've been now outbound countries and we are using also our digital way to force out funds (33:34) there. So you could see that we have different customers not only on the inbound now, growth comes also from new kind of outbound countries.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Well, I appreciate all that. Thank you, guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hey, good evening, gentlemen.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi. Hi, Kartik.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Kartik.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Oh, hi. Raj, you talked about increased marketing spend and I'm wondering is this more than you anticipated or is this more just a timing issue?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I'd say I think it's mostly timing, we had been messaging earlier in the year that we were under-spending in marketing. And so now that's catching up with us, so it's as expected from a couple of quarters ago. We're launching a number of different programs on the digital side to acquire customers. We're also trying to create awareness at some of our other digital capabilities of paying out into accounts. So it really is more timing than anything else.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And Hikmet, I know you talked about pricing, and as you look at your westernunion.com business, it seems like pricing is really stabilized there. Is there a reason for this, is that just less competition or are you in markets where you're not seeing as much competition. What's the primary driver there?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think first of all, in the market, we feel comfortable that's for sure. We feel that's very competitive. I mean, don't forget our prices are still 15% to 20% higher in average from the competition overall in every trade. I mean, we do have a competitive advantage, trust, global network, speed, anti-money laundering activities, all these things add on to allow us to be a premium price.","The other thing is also, Kartik, as you know the business, that's the beauty of being in so many corridors. We do portfolio management. In some corridors, we increase prices, some corridors we decrease prices. And we really are like a last-minute airliner, right, you fly on last minute, you want to pull up your feet. We really look at, we do street corner pricing, we do weekend pricing. So we are quite flexible there. And that gives us an overall almost flat pricing that has not changed over some, few quarters now.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And then just one last question, Hikmet. Just your thoughts on what you're seeing in terms of competition as small and mid-sized money transfer companies they're having to deal with all these compliance costs? Are you seeing more consolidation? Are you seeing them, fewer of them or is it business as usual?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","I think there has been always competitors on some certain corridors. I think if you're a mid- and small-size company, you have difficulties to be a global company. That's where our big network effect comes. That's where our global trust comes. And on the small \u2013 there will be always competitors on certain corridors and we've been dealing in early years with our retail business and now it's on to more on the digital, but that don't forget 10% of our revenue is already westernunion.com. That's by far the largest digital business in the market.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good afternoon. This is Jenny Dugan in for Andrew.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Jenny.","Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. You mentioned in North America, there was some softness in pricing, just domestically within U.S. to U.S.; is that being impacted by the lower pricing in Walmart?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","We don't believe that's really impacting us much. Obviously, we have 50,000 locations here in the U.S.; Walmart has 4,000. Walmart, what they did most recently was they reduced an already low price. And so it really remains to be seen on whether an even lower price is going to bring in more traffic into those stores. So we feel very good about our positioning.","If you look at our nation-wide pricing, it's pretty competitive to the other offerings and distribution is very strong as well. So that's not really the key driver and DMT in total for us is about 7% of our total revenues, just to put that in perspective. And again dotcom continues to grow really well from a DMT standpoint and we saw some accelerated growth there. So we're well-positioned competitively.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","On the 50,000 locations, Jenny, I would like to say that that's such a competitive advantage. You can send from mobile where you are now to 50,000 locations and we can pay out in minutes cash out. So that's a huge advantage that I think the competition doesn't have it.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And just quick follow-up, you mentioned that the tax rate in Q3 came in more similar to what you've been expecting for Q4. So is that just timing or are we going to see a lower rate in Q4 as well?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. It's just timing. We have not changed our full-year outlook on the tax rate. So still 10% to 11% or 12% to 13% adjusted tax rate for the full year, which is the same as we gave last time.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Jim.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Jim.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. I guess maybe on just a follow-up on the earlier questions on U.S. to U.S., it looks like transaction growth slowed down pretty notably in the quarter after having been pretty strong for quite some time. Can you help us unpack whether that's the entire market or potentially share issue and then maybe whether the hurricanes helped or hurt that in the quarter?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. Well, there are three pieces to the North American business that you're looking at. One is, U.S. outbound and U.S. outbound continued to grow really well. We saw strong trends similar to what we saw in the prior quarter and that's the largest piece. The U.S. domestic money transfer business, the retail part of the business did see some softness both in revenue which was driven by some of the price reductions we've made, but also some transaction softness.","Some of it may be related to the hurricanes, but we'll see what that impact was as we get into the fourth quarter. It's hard to know exactly how much that was, but some of it may have been from the Hurricanes. And then the U.S. to Mexico is also part of that number and the transaction trends there were a little bit softer as well. The overall market seems to be a bit softer in Mexico, that seems to be more of the impact.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thanks. And then good to see the margin performance in the quarter, maybe just looking forward to the $50 million in savings, you talked about as part of WU Way, it's good to hear. But I think Hikmet, I also heard about some discussion around new product and technology investments. So, I'm just trying to understand, as we head into 2018, would you expect to drop the full $50 million to the bottom line or would that be partially offset by new investments and maybe give us a sense of what those might be on the margin for next year?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. I mean, we'll give a view of the margins and the other components of our outlook when we go into next year, Jim. But obviously we like the fact that we're getting more savings that's positive for us. Revenue growth is still going to be the number one driver for us in terms of where overall margins are because our cost structure is about 40% fixed.","But we also want to look at some of the investment opportunities. Our goal is to try to accelerate revenue longer term, so we do want to put some of the money back into growth opportunities. Hikmet talked about digital expansion globally. We want to be 200 countries to 200 countries digital to digital in our wu.com business. So that requires investment. So, we'll see where we ultimately end up, but we like the strong margins we're getting this year and we want to continue to drive a good balance between investing and also driving good profitability.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks Jim.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Hey, Ashwin.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hello, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good evening, hey. How are you both?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Good. How are you?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I'm good. Thanks. I hope that didn't count as a question.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","No, I feel good.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, I wanted to ask about compliance. The compliance range, the difference between sort of the lower end of compliance and higher 3.5% to 4% about $30 million from my calculation is about $0.06 of EPS. It's pretty material, what drives differences in estimates as you go through the year with regards to whether you end up at the lower end of the range or upper end of the range.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Ashwin, first of all, we are pleased that we are targeting the lower end, right?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Definitely.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","That helped. That has been definitely great teamwork of the compliance department, IT department, and WU Way efficiencies, that has been the thing. But don't forget that this business is complex, it's in worldwide everywhere and one of the competitive advantages that we can manage that complexity and where others a little bit struggle I believe. And we always want to be proactive and invest in the compliance and that's something that I'm very focused on that the compliance and anti-money laundering programs have enough resources and really in efficient ways and I call it now also as investment. We invest for our future and that's why we are \u2013 keep it a little bit \u2013 still give it 3.5% to 4% because it's complex.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Ashwin, we came into this year expecting at the higher end because of some of the joint settlement agreements and the incremental activities, so the timing of some of those things have allowed us to be at the lower end. But we're continuing to invest as Hikmet said.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. But the joint settlement stuff happened like in 1Q, right, so I guess the question becomes you already have the settlements now.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So going back to the previous question...","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","I mean, part of the reduction \u2013 sorry, Ashwin, part of the reason why we are at the lower end as you heard last time, we talked about the Southwest Border activities being completed early. And so that's something that we had not anticipated at the beginning of the year. So that's one of the reasons and then other efficiencies.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Got it. And then no one ever asks you about your Business Solutions type of \u2013 but that profitability improved from 5% to 9%.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","It's just kind of like $0.01 of EPS, so what's driving that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","It helps. Just operating efficiencies, obviously we'd rather get stronger revenue growth, that's our number one priority. But we've also been managing the bottom line in that business, just in the environment that we're in. So it certainly helps. But our number one focus there is still to drive better top-line growth.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","Yeah. The next question comes from Tom McCrohan of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Thomas McCrohan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I'm looking at the Middle East region and just trying to understand the sustainability of the trends there. You had a slight deterioration sequentially in transactions. But constant-currency revenue improved. So is there some pricing actions that you took in that market this quarter and just kind of how sustainable and the outlook for that region in general?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. There is probably some pricing that's helping us there. We expected that in the second half of this year, we would start to get some grow-over benefit. Key parts of the Middle East started to decline in the second half of last year and then as we go into the fourth quarter, India, the demonetization that began in India in November of last year should start to grow over.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Because India's strong corridors are from Saudi Arabia.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah. And the Middle East is a key sending region to India and so that should start to help some of the actual metrics in the Middle East and India. So you should start to see a little bit better grow-over impact from that as we go into the fourth quarter.","Thomas McCrohan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Is Saudi Arabia to India still your third largest corridor?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","I don't know where it ranks, but it's still very important to \u2013 that's a very important corridor for us, Saudi to India. I don't know of its exact ranking, but clearly the top corridor for Saudi is to India.","Thomas McCrohan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And just last question on mobile, what percentage of your overall C2C transactions are originating through your mobile app today?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","About two-thirds of our transactions are initiating in our mobile app on wu.com. So if that was your question on wu.com, about two-thirds of our business is originating on a mobile app and it's even higher in the U.S. And so we're getting very strong growth and we don't have mobile everywhere yet. So that's really the goal is to be mobile....","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","And the reason why it's U.S. higher, Raj, is because we've been longer in the market with the U.S.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Takes some time and we are opening the new countries \u2013 and in some countries we go only by mobile in the country, which brings us huge competitive advantage. And it's really working very well with their own language, with their own apps, so that works pretty well.","Thomas McCrohan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies & Company. Please go ahead.","Damian Wille - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. This is Damian Wille on for Ramsey. Thanks for taking my questions.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","All right, good. How are you?","Damian Wille - Jefferies LLC","I am good. Thanks. How are you?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Good.","Damian Wille - Jefferies LLC","Good. So, I mean, at this point, a lot of my questions have kind of been picked over, but I guess, can I can ask on, is the guidance here in Q4, the full-year guide on the top-line implies acceleration in Q4. Can you kind of speak a little bit about your confidence in that. I know you called out FX as a driver at least of the GAAP revenue acceleration, but is there anything else in there?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","I mean, it depends on the trends that we see in other parts of our business. We'll start to see some grow-over benefit as I just mentioned in certain parts of our consumer business. We've continued to see good strong trends in our digital business. And our bill payments businesses have been doing quite well, both Speedpay as well as Pago Facil. So those are really the key drivers of growth, both from a constant currency and a reported standpoint and then of course currency is helping us from a reported standpoint.","Damian Wille - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And kind of related on the currencies here and maybe going out on a limb here, but do you ever \u2013 I'm talking the slowdown in North America and Europe sequentially. Do you ever see that the strength or weakness in any major currencies like the dollar or the euro plays a role in the fundamentals of your business?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","It can, it can. Over the long term, probably not, but in the short term, if there are extreme moves in currencies, then customers may change their behavior at times. When we saw the Indian rupee weaken some time ago or when we've seen the peso, we've seen a large influx of business into those markets. So currency moves in the short term can certainly have an impact on consumer behavior.","Damian Wille - Jefferies LLC","That's interesting. All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Rayna Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Good evening.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Hi, Rayna.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","For 2018 and 2019, can you quantify the potential revenue and earnings impact from your recently expanded partnership with Mastercard to integrate Mastercard Send into your money transfer business. And secondly, is there any other partnerships or business you can do with Mastercard?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, the way we look at the Mastercard partnership and paying out here domestically, it's really just another channel to deliver our services. We have dotcom today originating transactions which largely pay out on retail, this gives us the opportunity to pay out to all debit cards in the United States, and including Mastercard debit card. So, we'll have to see, we don't really have any projections to give you on that, because we just, we expect it to launch early next year","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","But it's a exciting partnership, I have to say it's a exciting partnership, because it gives \u2013 really opens a new way of sending money and we are excited about the partnership as we mentioned in the press release.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","Hey, Drew, I u nI understand we have one more question in the queue, so this will be the final question.","Operator","Okay. The last question will be from John Davis of Stiefel. Please go ahead.","John Kimbrough Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just wanted to touch on WU Way expenses for a minute. I appreciate they're running ahead this year and that's good news. So $25 million run rate this year, $50 million by the end of next year. So I just want to make sure we're implying somewhere between $35 million and $40 million of realized savings next year. Is that the right way to think about it?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","No, the realized savings this year will be $25 million and we'll have an incremental $25 million next year realized. So total realized savings next year of $50 million.","John Kimbrough Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And I think you said WU Way expenses will come down next year from the $95 million this year. I'm just trying to figure out, is the WU Way expense program margin-accretive next year meaning you're going to spend less than $50 million on WU Way expenses, or how should we think about that?","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Well, the $95 million of WU Way expenses that we're incurring this year will go away at the end of this year. So the programs themselves we may continue, but we're not going to have the spending next year, so it's zero.","John Kimbrough Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So all else equal there should be some margin accretion from the WU Way program next year.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Yeah, we've tried to call it out separately for GAAP margins and adjusted margins, just so you can see the difference that that's making.","John Kimbrough Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Then maybe just briefly on capital allocation, I don't think anyone's talked about M&A in a while, I mean I appreciate the commitment to dividends and buybacks. But how do you guys think about M&A, is it something you consider on a tuck-in basis or larger scale just as the industry changes, maybe some updated thoughts there on M&A?","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","First of all, yes, John, we do have a balanced capital generation. Thank God, we have a good cash flow. So, we have the luxury to look around and what is there. But we're going to be smart on our M&A activities. And obviously, we are looking on the technology site, is that something digital for the right return? And is there something other on the industry which will bring us an advance? But I think we're going to continue to be very smart on our capital allocation. And we have been very diligent when we look on our M&A activities.","John Kimbrough Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.","Thank you.","Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.","Thanks, bye. Okay.","Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us today. Hope you have a good afternoon.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."]}}
