At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through August 8, 2013, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at (800) 585-8367 for domestic calls and (404) 537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 15535210. [Operator Instructions] Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are: Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Administration; Suky Upadhyay, Senior Vice President, Finance; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, President of Diagnostics Systems; and Gary Cohen, Executive Vice President.","As we stated in our press release, we experienced a charge relating to a pending litigation settlement of $22 million or $0.07 per share related to the indirect purchaser antitrust class action cases. We also experienced a charge relating to the medical device tax of $13 million or $0.04 per share. For the purposes of our conference call today, we will refer to adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding the pending litigation settlement and the medical device tax.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. Our solid results against the backdrop of a challenging environment demonstrate that we are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments. Revenue and EPS growth in the third quarter were in line with our expectations. Revenue growth in the third quarter was driven by our Medical and Diagnostics segments. We experienced a decrease in our Biosciences segment, which we will provide more details on later.","Strong international growth overcame slower U.S. sales growth in the quarter. Growth in the U.S. was impacted by ongoing softness in our Women's Health and Cancer business and the timing of orders in Advanced Bioprocessing. We also saw a continued strong growth in international Safety sales and emerging markets, and we continue to deliver on our strategy of improving patient and health care worker safety. Based on our third quarter and year-to-date results, we feel confident in our previously communicated guidance ranges. We will review our guidance for the full year in more detail shortly.","On Slide 5, we've outlined our third quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency neutral basis. Total company revenues were solid, increasing by 5.1%. Fully diluted adjusted EPS, excluding the device tax, came in at $1.58, which grew 7.2% in the quarter.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris Reidy to make a few opening comments. As you may already know, Chris was previously at ADP Corporation, where he served as Corporate Vice President and CFO for 6 years. He is well positioned to help drive BD's strategy of accelerating growth through innovation, geographic expansion and operating effectiveness. We're extremely pleased to have Chris onboard, and we will leverage his diverse experience as we lead the company to its next phase of growth.","Christopher R. Reidy","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here. I'm equally pleased to have joined the team at BD. The company's long history, core values and ethical standards are attributes that really resonated with me. It's a particularly exciting time to join the company as we focus on product innovation, strategic acquisitions and geographic expansion, and I'm delighted to be a part of it.","While I have been only here a few weeks, it's evident that BD leaders and associates are committed to delivering health care products that are more effective, efficient and safe. I'm also very much aligned with the financial model here at BD, which is similar to the model used at ADP. I'm looking forward to working with the board and the management team to continue to execute against the company's strategy. We're committed to accelerating top line growth, driving margin expansion and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank Suky for his contributions and the work he has done serving as interim CFO. As you all know, Suky, along with the rest of the strong finance team, ensured a seamless transition over the past 9 months. Suky's productive working relationship with the management team and the board, as well as his commitment to shareholders, is invaluable to the company.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Suky to review our third quarter of fiscal results and our guidance for the total year.","Suketu Upadhyay","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's been my pleasure to have had this opportunity. Today, I'd like to begin by discussing the key financial highlights for the third quarter. The diversity of our portfolio, in tandem with strong execution, helped deliver solid performance in a challenging environment. From a macro perspective, we continue to view developed markets as stable but constrained and emerging markets as a continued source of growth. Revenue growth in the third quarter was in line with our expectations, driven by new product sales, acquisitions, Safety products and geographic expansion.","In addition, the quarter benefited as a result of the reversal of some negative timing matters from the second quarter. We also experienced a better-than-expected price and mix profile. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the device tax, were better than expected due to the timing of certain legal expenses, which we now expect to incur in the fourth quarter. We also completed an additional $50 million of our share repurchase plan, bringing our year-to-date total repurchases to $406 million.","Overall, we are pleased with our results, and we are on track to deliver our commitments of solid revenue growth and underlying margin expansion, which will ultimately translate into an improved quality of earnings profile. As Vince mentioned, our third quarter and year-to-date results give us the confidence to reaffirm our guidance for the total year. We expect revenue growth to approach about 5%, which is the upper end of our previously communicated guidance range. We also expect adjusted earnings per share growth, excluding the medical device tax, to be at the upper end of our previous range of 11% to 11.5%.","On Slide 9, I will review our revenue growth by segment on a currency neutral basis. Third quarter revenue growth was 5.1% for the company with acquisitions contributing about 80 basis points. We also experienced the impact of positive pricing and mix of about 20 basis points in the quarter. This reflects the benefit of new product launches and more effective pricing management in a challenging environment.","BD Medical third quarter revenues increased 7.9%. Growth in this segment was driven by strong international sales, Safety and the normalizing of unfavorable ordering patterns from the second quarter, as discussed earlier. Medical Surgical Systems growth was 6.6%, led by emerging markets and international Safety-related sales. Growth in Diabetes Care was 9.4%. This reflected continued strong sales of pen needles, which include our Nano and PentaPoint products, along with our AutoShield Duo Safety product. Growth in Diabetes Care also reflects a timing favorable -- timing benefit from the normalization of second quarter impacts. Pharmaceutical Systems growth was 9.2%, also driven by favorable timing of orders from the second quarter and our SSI acquisition.","BD Diagnostics third quarter revenue increased 3.6%. The segment's growth was driven by solid sales in Preanalytical Systems. Growth in Diagnostic Systems was softer than expected due to the timing of lab automation systems installations on a global basis and due to continued softness in Women's Health Care and Cancer in the U.S. BD Biosciences revenue declined 2.5% versus the prior year. Slight growth in instrument placements in the U.S. were more than offset by a few geographic factors, which I will speak to on the next slide.","Moving to Slide 10. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the third quarter. As we expected, softer growth in the U.S. was offset by continued strong international growth. BD's reported U.S. revenues increased 1.3% versus the prior year. Revenue in our U.S. Medical segment increased by 4.4%. As expected, this was partially driven by the reversal of unfavorable timing in both our Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care businesses, in addition to the positive contribution from our acquisition of SSI. U.S. growth in the Diagnostics segment declined by 1.5%. This reflects growth in Preanalytical Systems, which was more than offset by continued softness in Women's Health and Cancer due to extended cervical cancer screening intervals.","U.S. Biosciences revenues declined by 3.3%. As I just mentioned, slight growth in the U.S. instrument placements were more than offset by an unfavorable timing of orders in Advanced Bioprocessing. While we have seen low single-digit growth in instrumentation this year, we remain cautious on the macroeconomic outlook related to research funding. This has been contemplated in our full year guidance.","Moving on to international. We continue to see strong growth. Revenues grew 7.9% currency neutral, driven by Medical and Diagnostics segments. The Medical segment grew 10.3% and Diagnostics grew 8.6%. This reflects strong growth in emerging markets and international Safety sales. Biosciences declined 2.1%. This reflects continued softness in Western Europe due to austerity measures and continued delays of government research funding in Japan.","On Slide 11, we continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, which accounted for approximately 25% of our total revenues. Emerging markets revenues grew 12.8% currency neutral over the prior year. This was driven by good performance across all segments and regions. China revenues and Safety sales in emerging markets both grew by about 18%. We continue to see solid growth across all key geographies driven by an attractive return on investment profile.","Moving on to global Safety on Slide 12. Currency neutral sales increased 8.7% and grew to $538 million in the quarter. Revenues in the U.S. grew 5.6%, which benefited in part from our acquisition of SSI. International sales grew 12.7%. We are encouraged by the positive results in Europe as the market continues to convert to safety-engineered products. Medical Safety sales grew 12.8% driven by a range of safety-engineered products and Diagnostics growth was 4.8% in the quarter with particularly strong growth in emerging markets.","Moving on. Since we have already discussed revenues in detail, I will not cover Slide 13. Turning to Slide 14. As we expected and outlined for you on the last call, sequentially, gross margins improved by about 100 basis points. However, on a year-over-year basis, reported gross margins declined by 60 basis points due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. On a performance basis, positive contributions from ReLoCo and pricing were offset by acquisition and startup-related costs. For the full year, we continue to expect underlying gross profit improvement of about 40 basis points.","Slide 15 recaps the third quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. As we discussed, revenue and GP were in line with our expectations. SSG&A increased about 11% due to investments in new products, acquisition-related expenses, legal fees and the medical device tax. The medical device tax unfavorably impacted SSG&A by about $13 million or about 300 basis points. As mentioned, the third quarter included a year-over-year increase in legal fees. We expect a further increase in the fourth quarter as we prepare for the RTI trial in September.","R&D increased 5.6%. This remains in line with our expectations at 5.9% of revenues as we continue to invest in new products. Operating income, excluding the aforementioned settlement, declined by 0.9% in the quarter. However, when you exclude the medical device tax, together with the increase in legal and acquisition costs, operating income growth was broadly in line with underlying sales growth. Our tax rate declined by 180 basis points, reflecting the benefit of the reinstated R&D tax credit in the U.S. and favorable geographic mix. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share, excluding the medical device tax, were $1.58, which represents a 7.2% increase over the prior year.","Slide 16 recaps the adjusted year-to-date income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. I will not review this slide in detail but would like to highlight our year-to-date operating income growth of about 4%. Excluding the medical device tax, underlying operating income growth was a little over 6% and ahead of overall revenue growth. As we've communicated previously, we are still on track to deliver about 40 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion this year.","Slide 17 illustrates our revenue guidance by segment. We expect revenue growth for the total company to approach 5% or the upper end of our previous guidance range. This assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of about 1.31 and a dollar-to-yen exchange rate of about 99 for the balance of the year. Within the Medical segment, we expect growth to be between 5% to 6%. This is primarily driven by better-than-expected results across international, Safety-related sales and acquisitions. The Diagnostics and Biosciences segments remain unchanged. We expect growth of about 5% and 1% to 2%, respectively. Adjusted EPS guidance is expected to be at the upper end of 11% to 11.5%, excluding the impact of the medical device tax.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thanks, Suky. Moving on to Slide 19. I would like to review the program and product launches in our Medical segment.","In June, we closed the licensing agreement with CRISI, that's C-R-I-S-I, which is a privately held company in California. CRISI is currently developing a drug delivery device for verifying, monitoring and documenting manual IV injections. CRISI nicely aligns with our strategy in Medical Surgical Systems around the elimination of medication delivery errors. Additionally, this links with our latest acquisition of Cato Software Solutions to create a preparation and delivery solution for certain safety gaps.","For BD Simplist, we are continuing to make progress. We recently received FDA approval of ondansetron, and we expect to launch this by the end of our fiscal year. Ondansetron is an antiemetic used to treat nausea and vomiting often following chemotherapy treatments.","We have 3 additional drugs in various stages of the FDA regulatory approval process. As you can see by Cato, Simplist and now CRISI, we're continuing to focus on medication error management and enabling safer and more effective parenteral drug delivery in both hospital and pharmacy settings.","In our Pharmaceutical Systems business, we launched the BD Neopak this quarter. This is a new glass prefillable syringe system specifically engineered for the administration of biopharmaceutical injectable drugs. This new product is designed to address industry challenges in developing, manufacturing and marketing biological drugs to patients. As you can see, we've continued to make good progress with our product portfolio in the Medical segment.","Turning to Slide 20. You will see the various product launches in Diagnostics. We're extremely pleased with our BD Veritor System since its launch in early fiscal year 2012. More than 5,300 units of this system have been placed to date. We continue to broaden our customer base, as well as capture share gains with this innovative point-of-care platform. We have now expanded beyond doctors' offices and have gained the interest of large pharmacy retail chains across the U.S.","Moving on to molecular. On the BD MAX platform, we're pleased with the progress we're making as shipments continue to accelerate in the third quarter. We expect shipments to continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter as well. Our StaphSR, enteric bacteria and GC\/CT Trichomonas assays are also progressing well through clinical trials. Our BD Viper molecular platform remains well positioned for the high-volume screening market. And the launch of the BD Viper Trichomonas assay remains on track for launch in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. The launch of the new Viper LT platform, which includes our Onclarity HPV genotyping assay and GC\/CT assays has been delayed by 1 quarter. However, we've completed the European clinical trial and are very pleased with the data. On front-end automation system for Women's Health, the BD Totalys is now shipping in Europe after being delayed by 1 quarter. The launch remains on track for the U.S. next year.","On Slide 21, I'd like to review the program and product launches in our Biosciences segment. In the third quarter, we announced the launch of our new BD LSRFortessa. This is the latest cell analyzer in this line of high-performance research flow cytometers. The LSRFortessa will enable researchers to conduct complex experiments with the additional parameters and increased sensitivity they need. It's been designed by BD's special order program that enables customers to configure BD flow cytometers and cell sorters to fit precise research and assay needs. This program is tailored to meet the needs of researchers at the leading edge of biomedical discovery. And we'll continue to invest in this business in order to continue our expansion in this market and drive future growth.","On Slide 22, before we open the call to questions, I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, we're pleased with our continued improved revenue and underlying operating income performance in the third quarter and year-to-date. Second, we continued to demonstrate that we're making progress delivering against our strategy of accelerating revenue growth, delivering underlying margin expansion and driving effective capital deployment. Third, we're seeing continued success with our key growth drivers of geographic expansion, new products and acquisitions, which are performing in line or better than our expectations. Finally, we're positive about our outlook for fiscal year 2013. Despite the challenging environment, we believe we are positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to our customers and shareholders.","Thank you. And we'll now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just want to focus in on earnings growth for this quarter and for the balance of the year. So you talked about the legal settlement for the third quarter. And Suky, I wonder if you could break out for us what was sort of the magnitude of the legal shift in the third versus the fourth quarter. And is the fourth quarter number -- you initially had talked about earnings growth building throughout the balance of the year. The fourth quarter implied guidance has a sequential downturn to a certain extent. Is that entirely due to the legal expense? Or does it reflect some type of conservatism? So just helping us net out that math would be helpful.","Suketu Upadhyay","Sure, David. Yes, the back half, as we talked about the last quarter, remains intact. It really is around the calendarization and the phasing of those legal expenses. So what we're seeing is about a $0.06 beat versus overall consensus on EPS. That's primarily driven by those legal expenses, which will now occur in the fourth quarter. So the second half still remains intact. It's just a shift from third quarter into the fourth.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just maybe just a quick one for Vince. In terms of the European Safety, obviously it continues to be a driver for the business. Post the regulatory action in May, have you begun to see any change in the relative growth rate here on this particular quarter? And would you expect to see that as early as the fourth quarter?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, we did see a bit of a step-up in the quarter in European Safety. In fact, it grew just under 10%. So it was strong in the quarter. And we expect it to continue to be strong. As we've said all along, more so in Northern Europe than Southern Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was wondering if we could just dive in a little bit more into the Medical business. Since you are raising guidance there, I just want to get a better understanding of the components that give you a higher expectation for the balance of the year and just generally whether you think it's sustainable going forward into 2014.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in the Medical segment. And Bill will comment on that.","William A. Kozy","This is Bill. Just the real basis for our slight change there is driven by the success of the recent acquisitions and the new product. If you could literally break the performance of those 2 categories out of the segment, they're contributing in the quarter we just concluded, a little over $95 million on the top line or a growth that would have been a little north of 8%. So anyhow, as we had planned quite a while ago, the impact of new products and recent acquisitions would offset some of the known kind of nongrowth contributors that we have in the more mature pieces of the Medical segment, particularly in Med\/Surg. So right now, that's the basis for us moving up. For the quarter, for the Medical segment, new products as a percent of sales were a little north of 15%, which is the highest number we've achieved there for quite some time. And so that's the basis for the uptick.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then you had also commented just generally on improved pricing and mix. Can you also expand there? I don't know if it was specific to Medical or if it's...","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes, that was company-wide. And Bill can comment on that as well.","William A. Kozy","Kristen, the comment I just made, we tend to think about our pricing always in the same kind of phrase with mix. So what's happening, there's a number of examples in the Medical business. For example, in our Diabetes Care business, every time we make a conversion to Nano, we gain some slight improvement, but some slight benefit in terms of price\/mix. We like converting customers to the Nano or the PentaPoint because of the slight advantage we're creating. That's what's giving us a little bit of favorability. And you have to look back to that very assertive price management and contractual management systems that we talked to you about on the last call. Those 2 factors have just allowed us to get a little better performance in that price\/mix category.","Vincent A. Forlenza","And Kristen, across the company -- and maybe Suky might want to make a comment or 2. But think about this, from what Bill said, we had good mix in Medical with the new products with Diabetes Care. PAS did well. The one business where we generally would have a positive mix effect from a corporate level that was lower was Biosciences. But net-net, it was a positive, right, Suky?","Suketu Upadhyay","No, I think you're right on point, both Bill and Vince. I think the one comment I would make is that we still do continue to see the environment as challenging, both from a pricing and reimbursement perspective. And year-to-date, we are still seeing erosion overall in year-over-year pricing, but we're very optimistic with these results. But we're taking it 1 quarter at a time.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. I'll sneak one last in. Suky, are you still expecting within the guidance range for this year about 60 to 70 basis points from acquisition contribution?","Suketu Upadhyay","Actually, we're expecting a little bit closer to 70 to 80 basis points. So as Bill talked about, we're doing a little bit better on SSI, as well as KIESTRA, which we've been talking about. So we see that contribution going up slightly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could actually dive into a little bit more detail on the U.S. Diagnostic Systems business and particularly in the context of your comment that BD MAX placement [indiscernible] accelerated in the quarter.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Tom can handle that, no problem.","Tom Polen","David, this is Tom. So let me just walk through some of the key elements. So overall in the U.S., we certainly do see overall lower testing volumes, I think, as you see reported by others in the industry and from labs. The most significant area of that, of course, for us is being LBC testing volumes due to interval extensions. So we see that impacting the U.S. We also see obviously the lack of -- just from a timing perspective from a lab automation install. Molecular, specifically, we saw flat overall in the quarter. And that was really a mix of lower GC\/CT volumes that were partially offset by those increasing MAX sales. So we actually saw MAX sales double quarter-on-quarter going from Q2 to Q3, and we're expecting that type of continued trajectory going forward. As Vince mentioned, we reached another milestone on MAX placement at over 200 at the end of the third quarter, and we expect a ramp to continue going forward. So we are seeing that impact of MAX. Of course, Veritor has been another key growth driver of ours. You don't see that in Q3 because it's really a respiratory-focused product. You saw that in our 7.8% growth that was reflected in Q2. It came out of the Q3 numbers. So overall, we are seeing that ramp of MAX, but we are seeing some of those challenges, specifically on overall testing volumes in the U.S. with -- I'll point specifically to that LBC segment.","Vincent A. Forlenza","And keep one other thing in mind as you think about this. As we said on the previous call, a lot of what we're doing with MAX now is converting at our own base, not all but a lot of what we're doing. So you didn't see as big an impact as you might have thought in the quarter because of the cannibalization, which, of course, will change over time.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And are you willing to quantify in any way sort of, if you were to break out the Diagnostic Systems segment, the percentage of the business that's facing some other pressures that Tom just discussed versus the percentage of the business that's seeing growth?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, I think what Tom is really concerned about is the Women's Health and Cancer piece and specifically the LBC business, the pap smear business, where Tom -- testing volumes are down. I think office visits for OB\/GYN were down about 6%, 7%, if I remember. That's the focus for him, right?","Tom Polen","Correct. On a worldwide basis, our Women's Health business actually in the quarter we saw down about 10%. And that was driven by that being a higher number in North America, where the vast majority of our business is. And then you saw continued double-digit growth in emerging markets. And even in Europe, continued strong double-digit growth in that segment. So specifically within the U.S., Women's Health is in that 10% to 15% range of sales. So it's -- the bulk of the business is in our other -- microbiology is by far the largest followed by molecular followed by the smallest piece being our Women's Health.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just squeeze in one more quick one on Bioscience. I believe this is the second quarter in a row, where you talked about delays in Japanese funding, as well as European austerity measures. And any sense that either of those might be abating or anything that you're looking for to see those pressures start to lift?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Bill will address that.","William A. Kozy","David, this is Bill. We have been waiting for the release of some of the funding of the Japan stimulus program. This is part of Abe's economic policy. And we do have a signal that after these delays, we're expecting that some of this at least to show up in the fourth quarter. We have orders in-house for the first time already. And we have some formal release of funding from the government in Japan just in the last 3 weeks. So we're treating those as good signals and expecting to see some impact in the fourth quarter. Hard to predict exactly yet what it is, but it'll get back on the kind of the trajectory that we had described previously.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just maybe a clarification first. So for the fourth quarter, just so we're making sure we're apples and apples here, the implied guidance is $1.44 to $1.47 on continuing ops?","Suketu Upadhyay","That's correct.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, perfect. One thing, Suky, would be helpful. You guys don't talk about cash flows on these calls. And when we got the 2Q from -- sorry, the 10-Q from last quarter, it showed kind of a disconnect in the first half of the year between earnings growth, which I think net income growth was 4%, but operating cash flows were down like 5% to 6%. Can you talk about how cash flows did this quarter and whether inclusive of this quarter or next quarter, we'll see improvement in the back half of the year?","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes, we do expect to see an improvement in overall free cash flow in the back half of this year. We're making several improvements around working capital, as well as we're going to see some abatement or sort of slowdown of overall EVEREST capital spending. So we do expect to see an improvement in the back half of the year on free cash flow.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then Vince, you guys have historically used this call, I'll say it, opportunistically, to touch on the upcoming fiscal year. Is there anything that preliminarily you guys see where the street may be mismodeling or you want us to think about as we go into updating our models post this call for FY '14?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So Mike, there's nothing unique going on right now that we would want to talk about. I think we'll address '14 once we finish up our work for the year. So we'll be talking to you about that in the fall. But there's nothing exceptional to call out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two questions on Bioscience and Diagnostics. Both of those segments do need to rebound sequentially into the fourth quarter. So first on Biosciences, is it strictly your expectation that Japan's [indiscernible] is going to flow-through that leads you to bounce back Biosciences? And in Diagnostics, can you talk about what's happening on the competitive front in Diagnostics and how that will play out in the fourth quarter?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. On Biosciences, Bill talked about improving situation on the Japan funding. Keep in mind, too, that we had some negative timing in this quarter with Advanced Bioprocessing. So that would be the other factor Bill would pick up on. So Tom, in terms of the competitive situation on Diagnostics?","Tom Polen","And maybe just a comment overall on Q4. So we do expect and we do have in-house, as I mentioned earlier, lab automation timing impacted us in Q3 negatively, see that having more of a positive impact in Q4. You have to keep in mind for lab automation, these orders typically come in 6 to 8 months before we actually ship these pieces, so a very large capital. So we do have those orders, not only in-house but equipment built and they're being installed now, which we'll bill in the fourth quarter. So we'll see that as an impact in the fourth quarter. We'll obviously see the continued ramp of MAX we expect in the fourth quarter. Also in Women's Health, as Vince mentioned earlier, in the x U.S., we have Totalys launching and have instruments literally shipping now, which we'll bill in the fourth quarter as well. So those are where we see some rebound expected from that perspective. As we think about competitive dynamics, I would say that we certainly do see within molecular of all the categories, that which has been well-documented across the board, increasing competition there, certain pricing pressures in some categories and also well-documented by others, expect continued pricing pressures in the GC\/CT space and some of the more, call it, mature segments of the HAI market, such as MRSA. And we've been managing through those accordingly. I would say that's the most specific focus from a competitive dynamic perspective.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And Vince, just a quick one on generic injectables. Any guidance you can give us on the contribution from that business in the quarter?","Vincent A. Forlenza","It's very small as we thought it would be. We're encouraged by the fact that we are gaining accounts. And of course, we have the launch, impending launch of this third drug. And for us, it's about continuing to get this breadth of product line out there. But the reaction from the customer base has been very positive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Tom, I appreciate the comments that you just made on the Women's Health space. But if you can just give us a little bit more on kind of what's the long-term outlook here. I mean, you're seeing changes on the competitive front and macro headwinds. How should we think about this business over kind of more than just a next quarter or next couple of quarter timeframe? And what is BD's strategy to kind of offset some of these headwinds?","Tom Polen","Brian, this Tom. So as we look at -- maybe let me just talk -- break that into 2 parts, just an overall comment on the market and where we see that going, and then maybe break down into our strategy. So we still continue to see strong double-digit growth x U.S. And we expect that to continue because the vast majority of women still lack access to basic pap testing. And that's really what's driving the growth x U.S., increased access, as well as in some markets like in Europe, Germany, in particular, would be a conversion from conventional pap to LBC. In North America, we -- again well-documented from our contemporaries as well, this decline in pap volumes due to the extending intervals. The data that we see shows that about 60% of physicians have now implemented that expanding interval testing. That's up from about 25% 2 years ago. So as you think about just the longer-term trends there, the interval extension is not fully matured yet in the U.S. We think there's going to be some further occurrence of that through FY '14. And then of course, you also have to monitor the implementation potentially in the future, it's not certain, but the role of primary HPV screening, which could have a further impact on the LBC market. And we recognize that. Obviously, our strategy is providing a more integrated solution across cervical cancer. And that includes really the next 2 major product launches that we have coming in that category, which is our Totalys front-end automation, which is launching this quarter Q4 x U.S. and next year in the U.S., which fully automates that upfront process, fits with the consolidation of our customer base as well and making it much more labor-efficient and reducing errors. The other pieces, of course, us entering into that HPV market with a highly differentiated genotyping assay, which is also launching, of course, very shortly in Europe and we have not communicated the date yet for the U.S. So participating on both sides of that, we think will be important long term. And we recognize and are investing appropriately in the segments of the market that we think will be most attractive, specifically that molecular HPV segment and creating efficiencies in that large, consolidated customer segment of LBC.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. The second, a follow-up on Veritor. With the Group A Strep product, is that actually being sold right now? I know it's out of season a little bit. But is there anything that has to happen as far as the units that you have to swap those out as you bring in the Group A Strep because of some differences there with the flu and the RSV product?","Tom Polen","Yes. We have not launched the Strep A product yet, but we do have FDA approval for our clinical kit. The CLIA waiver is still ongoing. And so the CLIA waiver market is clearly the largest segment for Strep A, and so therefore, we've held up the launch for that. Regarding reader changes, et cetera, that's still under evaluation if that would ever be needed based on us and our CLIA waiver submission. So it's not something that we're actively doing at this point, no.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","A couple of questions here. First, Tom, sorry to keep harping on this, but obviously, several moving parts in the Diagnostics franchise right now. Just to confirm, it does sound like KIESTRA is going faster than expected since the acquisition. And then secondly, staying on microbiology. Do you expect the MALDI-TOF approval by the end of the calendar year? And then just a quick housekeeping question here. Was there any effect of Quest on the Women's Health franchise in the quarter?","Tom Polen","This is Tom. Yes, KIESTRA is doing actually, as Suky mentioned earlier, better than our expectations. Certainly, we see that ability to lower our lab's overall cost per test through labor efficiencies and accelerating time to results is really hitting home with our customers, particularly in Europe and the U.S. So very positive feedback there. Related specifically to Quest in the quarter, we do not see any impact of that within Q3. That's something that we would anticipate more as an impact going into FY '14.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then just the MALDI approval?","Tom Polen","MALDI, that's -- we understand that's submitted and under active review. That is Bruker's submission, though, so I'd rather not comment on someone else's submission time and approval time.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And then just a quick one, Vince, on the Biosciences franchise. As you think about the performance here over the past couple of years, a bit of a laggard here relative to the other 2 major segments. How are you feeling about the portfolio? Do we need to look at maybe some additional M&A in this space? Or are there some internal developments? How do you think about the franchise for the next couple of years?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, we think that there is opportunity for this business and to broaden the footprint of the business. Primarily right now, I would think it's more organic than acquisition. There's opportunities to use flow in different ways. And we have programs both internally and with partners to do that at the moment. So areas such as using flow as the front end for next-generation sequencing, we believe, is going to be an emerging market. We just published using flow not on the cell surface, but also inside the cell in measuring RNA. So just to name 2 things that we're looking at, but we're also looking at more. So we do think that in a reasonable funding environment, that this business can return to growth. But there's work to do here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So first, just some guidance cleanup, and I guess, this is a multipart one. You noted delays in global automation installations were a driver to -- or one of the drivers to moderation in Diagnostics revenue in fiscal Q3. It sounds like you expect this to be recaptured in fiscal Q4 based on your answer to Amit's question. What was the magnitude of this dynamic? I guess, the second part is, was the delay in the RTI legal dispute, was that about a $20 million pretax charge? And then I guess, related to that, just to make sure we understand this correctly moving forward, is it your policy to exclude legal settlement charges but not litigation charges?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Why don't you do the first one, Tom?","Tom Polen","Doug, this is Tom. KIESTRA in the quarter, we essentially had no KIESTRA shipments in the quarter, so wouldn't have the number right here in terms of the exact percentage on that. But it was essentially 0 within the quarter. And you'll see there's a significant pop in Q4. We also had shipments in Q3. So it was just a matter of timing of those shipments. Again it's not actually anything related to orders. Those orders typically come in 6 to 8 months prior. It's literally just when we do the installation, we get customer acceptance.","Vincent A. Forlenza","We have a very nice backlog of orders.","Tom Polen","Absolutely.","Vincent A. Forlenza","It's just a matter of the customer being ready for installation and those sorts of factors. Suky?","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. Regarding legal expenses around RTI within the third quarter, the expectation, you're directionally right, was roughly around $20 million. We expect now about $15 million of that to now reside in the fourth quarter of the year. And it is our philosophy and our policy on legal settlements to actually put those into adjusted or pro forma basis from earnings per share perspective. But ongoing litigation-type trial expenses or costs, we expect to keep into core earnings.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then Tom, if I heard correctly, I believe you indicated that you saw lower chlamydia and gonorrhea -- yes, I don't know if it was volumes or revenue in the quarter. So correct me if I'm wrong, but if you did say that, I guess, my question is keeping in mind that since the beginning of the calendar year, we've seen the approval of a couple -- I think what could be described as formidable competitive platforms for molecular chlamydia, gonorrhea testing. I'd be curious to get your take, at this point, on competitive dynamics in the U.S. market, specifically with regard to pricing, your ability to lock-in customers and how we should be thinking about how BD is going to position the new products as you get the new approvals over the next few quarters on MAX and Viper.","Tom Polen","Okay. Let me give you one other bit of information actually on KIESTRA just to help maybe give a little bit more perception. The average price of a KIESTRA full automation line ranges from $2 million to $4 million. So just giving some perspective, as you get a couple of those in a quarter or not in a quarter, you can see that swing the Diagnostic Systems business within that 3-month window pretty significantly. Related to GC\/CT and competitive dynamics happening in that space, certainly that is, as I mentioned, an area that's well-documented of increasing competition prices. Price pressure in that segment is happening. Prices are coming down there, and that's something that we are actively managing. We are seeing from ourselves, as we are actively solidifying and renewing our customer base, pricing pressure that we're managing through in that segment. We're working -- we're obviously doing some offsetting of that in other parts of the business. But that is an area that we don't expect to alleviate in the near term, right? As you mentioned, there are a number of new competitors in that segment. In terms of our portfolio and how we really view that, within the lower-tier segment, we'll be, of course, launching our MAX assay next year for GC\/CT, which is really meant for those that are more mid-sized hospitals or those who may be sending it out, so that segment will be covered there. We've got our, obviously, high-throughput Viper platform, Viper XTR, which is on the ultrahigh-throughput segment of the marketplace. And then our Viper LT, which is also launching next year, as our bench-top version, which will also have HPV in the future, is in that, let's call it, upper mid to low high volume segment of the marketplace. That will ultimately replace our ProbeTec manual product as well. So where we do see kind of our oldest platform within that segment, which is ProbeTec, which is a highly manual system, is where we also tend to see the pricing pressures. The Viper LT, as that launches early in 2014, we'll be actively upgrading that business to what we see as a much more competitive and automated system.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I'm sorry, just one follow-up, Suky, on your comments on the legal charge. The fact that you said it was basically about $20 million that slipped out of this quarter and you expect it to be $15 million in fiscal Q4, does that suggest that your expectation now is that the timing of that -- of incurring that charge will be late in fiscal Q4? In which case, is there a chance that this actually slips into fiscal '14?","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. So just one clarification, we said about $15 million slips into Q4, not that full $20 million that I mentioned, which was the absolute amount that we had originally expected in Q3. And we do have a trial date set for early September. And as where we stand today, we still believe that, that trial will occur in September and in the fourth quarter.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So $5 million of the $20 million was in this quarter. You expect the balance in Q4.","Suketu Upadhyay","That's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Just a couple of cleanups, I guess, and I'm sorry if I missed this earlier. But on Quest, I know you said you didn't see anything in this quarter. But have you kind of sized what you expect that impact to be on an annual basis in, say, like 2014?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, we're not going to disclose that. But it will be to your point at 2014. There will be some impact in 2014 and we don't know what that is yet. So we can't even comment on it.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And I mean, have you disclosed before for Diagnostic Systems like what percent of revenues it is for you guys?","Suketu Upadhyay","No, we don't disclose it down to a customer level.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. I just thought it was a fairly -- it was a fairly public piece of information around what had happened there. And then on the microbiology platform, I'm just curious. I think that's still roughly, all-in, close to 2\/3 or so of your revenues in that Diagnostics Systems. And many of us who go out and speak with folks in those labs hear about new technologies obviously on the MALDI Biotyper [indiscernible] the 2. But others think that ultimately that moves to more of a sequencing application as costs comes down. I'm just curious how you're thinking technologically about your position in microbiology over the next, say, 5 years or so.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure, Tom will talk to that.","Tom Polen","And maybe -- and just to give some context of the Quest. We haven't given a specific percentage, but I would just say less than 5%. That is maybe a number I could share because that's how much represents of DS worldwide sales. In terms of then specifically in microbiology, I think we're very actively -- first off, we see the most near-term areas, as you mentioned, will be mass spec, which we have a partnership and now have our own BD branded mass spec that's pending FDA approval. So that is one that we're actively behind and engaged in. Of course, that's being completely automated as part of our KIESTRA system. So those who attend shows would see, for example, at AECC this week, us demonstrating our fully automated colony picking system that completely integrates our KIESTRA with the Bruker mass spec system, taking advantage of that trend going forward. After that, you see molecular starting to really, in the near term, I think, begin to have an impact on optimizing turnaround time and efficiency within the microbiology lab. And you can see we're investing in a series of assays on our MAX platform to do exactly that. The Enteric Bacterial Panel is probably one of the examples that Vince talked about earlier. It's really meant to eliminate enteric cultures within a microbiology lab and upgrade that through molecular testing. We have other assays in our pipeline that are meant to do the same thing, including our OMP assay or our respiratory assay that's in the pipeline that we've talked about. When you look at sequencing, we are making, I would just say, some low-level investments at this point in time in sequencing. We're monitoring that very closely. We would see sequencing within the infectious disease space as being a bit longer term, beyond that 5-year horizon, really driven by, as you mentioned, still iterations of the platform needed but also collapsing of the turnaround time and the level of automation that's required in that space. And that's very consistent with the feedback that we hear from partners within the marketplace, as well as our customers. With that said, we are investing to some level, exploring opportunities for infectious disease and microbiology testing and NGS. But we do see that as kind of the third wave, as I've just described beyond Bruker, beyond molecular. And the next window after that will be NGS.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could have just one more quick one. On diabetes, can you just remind me, Vince or whoever wants to answer there, given these significant reimbursement cuts that have happened there and others kind of commenting around that particular business, can you -- I know it's more around strips and so, can you just remind us whether or not you think that will have much of an impact on your business over the next 12 months?","Vincent A. Forlenza","No, it won't. That's in a very different segment. You're thinking about BGM and durable medical equipment, so different segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'll be quick. Hey, the R&D as a percentage of sales in the third quarter came down a bit, 5.8%, I think, versus some good trading north of 6%. Can you talk about how you see sort of R&D and spending for the rest of the year and, I guess, where you sort of see that number on a go-forward basis?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes, I think Suky guided R&D for the year, if I'm remembering right, is like right around 5.9%. Did I get that right, Suky?","Suketu Upadhyay","It was low 6s, so somewhere around 6.1%.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes. So there's just a little bit of lumpiness here, what's happening from a clinical trial standpoint, those sorts of things.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And Suky, can you just give me the breakout of M&A between Medical and Diagnostics?","Suketu Upadhyay","From what perspective?","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just basically what it was as a contribution to the growth. [indiscernible].","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. We haven't directly quoted that. What we are saying is that our acquisitions from 2012 are beginning to turn accretive in 2013. And those acquisitions that we've done towards the end of '12 and within '13 are starting to approach becoming neutral or slightly accretive into 2014.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So Suky, the acquisitions we're talking about this year are which ones?","Suketu Upadhyay","So they'll be Cato and SSI.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just one quick one...","Vincent A. Forlenza","Which are Medical acquisitions, okay?","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. Okay, great. So just one quick one, I heard there's been a couple of other companies that have noted some issues with order timing and bio process. Could you should shed some light on that, what you're sort of seeing what's going on there?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Anything we can add to that at all?","William A. Kozy","Yes, this is Bill. Not much I can really add. We do expect a normalized fourth quarter, meaning that we'll recover in that timing mode in the fourth quarter with BD AB. And this business because of the kind of the big pharma relationships, it just tends to be lumpy. So we had a softer-than-expected third quarter. We're expecting that to recover in the fourth quarter and be very much in line with our FY '13 expectations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor with Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to ask one on the margins. You had some underlying improvement in gross margins this quarter and negative impact from FX. Could you help us think about those 2 factors over the next few periods? I was just curious in terms of your ability to continue to drive organic improvement in gross margins.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Go ahead, Suky. But we feel good about our continued ability to drive gross margin improvements. And there were some acquisition costs and some other one-off things this quarter. But Suky, maybe you want to mention...","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. So for the year, we talked about ReLoCo -- excuse me, for the quarter, ReLoCo, as well as some improved pricing being offset by some acquisitions and start-up costs, as Vince talked about. Really I think for the full year, it's probably the better way to look at it because there's always going to be lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter when you think about $4 billion cost base of cost of goods. And overall, the way we see it for the year, if you get about 100 basis points of improvement or tailwind from ReLoCo, some of the 2012 acquisitions now becoming accretive, as well as continuous improvement, that's broadly being offset by about 60 basis points, driven by acquisition, startup, several other types of things, like year-over-year resins, et cetera. So that's kind of the makeup. Again, it's primarily driving our operating margin improvement is through gross margin. And we see that profile from a top-level sort of continuing forward as we continue to invest SSG&A against new products and acquisitions.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And I wanted to ask one about SG&A, I guess, and as it's related to investments, specifically in emerging markets. Your emerging market sales growth has been remarkably consistent over a multiyear timeframe. And I'm wondering, is that a growth goal that you're driving towards and gaining your investments to grow at about that level? Could you grow faster? And how has some of the declines in overall GDP in some of those areas impacted or not impacted your business?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. So we were concerned going into this year that we would see a decrease in health care -- the growth of health care spending in those regions. We haven't seen that. We've seen the governments prioritize health care, specifically in China but also in Latin America, of course, where there's been a lot of discussion about potential government cutbacks. And as you saw in the quarter, we're doing quite well in Latin America. We're doing well in the Middle East and in Asia. So across all of those because it's so important to our social stability, we see continued spending. It's not that we have targeted a particular growth rate for emerging markets. And as I said, we're going to fund to that growth rate. We're funding to the opportunities that we have, our capability to build really strong organizations, do the right training and the right partnering in those marketplaces. And that's working quite well for us. So the result has been very consistent growth. And we're very encouraged by what we're seeing, not just on the top line but the capability that we're building.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with ISI Group.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of follow-up questions. One, on LBC, I know that you mentioned the extension of interval is impacting volumes. And when you look at it sequentially, do you think -- can you parse out what the impact of lower overall health care utilization was versus the actual extension of intervals? Do you think the complete 6% to 7% decline was adjusted because of extension of intervals?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So Tom could comment on that, but...","Tom Polen","Vijay, this is Tom. By far and away, intervals is the most significant piece. I mean, again putting in perspective, you're looking at women going from once a year to once every 3 years, in most cases. So that is obviously a significant impact.","Vincent A. Forlenza","And as Tom said, we're up to about 60% of the market or so converting to that longer interval from 25%, Tom, you were saying.","Tom Polen","About 2 years ago, 25%.","Vincent A. Forlenza","2 years ago. So it's been a major shift. That's the biggest portion.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. My next one was on BD MAX. I know you mentioned sort of 50-plus placements in the Q and most of it was replacing your existing installed base. I guess, my question is when you think you'll run through replacing your existing installed base and how should we think of placements beyond that?","Tom Polen","Yes. So Vijay, this is Tom again. So not all of our placements, about 70% of the placements were upgrades, which was part of our base strategy. If you can see the menus, the menu that we began with was an HAI menu, which was specifically the exact same assays that were on our GenOhm platform to secure that, what was a manual system, up to a more automated system in MAX. So we've been working our way through that very aggressively. We are -- there are, of course, a portion of those, about 1\/3, are brand-new accounts that we've been converting to date and within the quarter. And we expect that to continue to ramp as we not only work through our upgrades and our focus now shifts into other areas, but also as our menu expansion goes into areas where GenOhm was not present in. So enteric bacteria is a very good example of that, as well as the GC\/CT Trich assay in that segment of the market is another good example of that, of ones that are in the clinical trial. And of course, pretty much every other assay -- we have over 15 assays in the MAX pipeline. Every other assay that we'll be launching on that platform are new markets for us that are not going after GenOhm upgrades.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Goldman with CL King.","Robert M. Goldman - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Wanted to follow up as well on the step-up you said you're seeing in the European Safety sales growth. I think it was only within the last few weeks that half the member states of the EU enacted the regulation or legislation that was required. So I'm wondering in your quarter if the step-up in growth related near as you could tell to a step-up in the market or a share shift in your favor. And then the second part of the question is, previously, you had thought that the EU Council directive wouldn't result in a step-up. It would just continue the growth that you've already had. But since, in fact, you're now seeing a step-up, just wanted to see if you're internally prepared for greater growth than you've been projecting relative to capacity and your infrastructure for order fulfillment.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, we're prepared for the marketplace. So let me just start there. And just remember, too, a lot of these countries started implementing before the directive went into force. The U.K. started, Germany was moving ahead. But Bill, anything else, any other color that we can add on Safety growth this quarter in Europe?","William A. Kozy","Well, I think to the longer-term piece, the policy work has continued to progress. Remember that not all of the countries had their legislation in place back in May, at the time of the expectation. But there's a lot of good policy work that is being done there, in part, by the way, led by a number of companies from the industry, including BD. And we're seeing really good progress in seeing countries now get their legislation drafted and at least start the front-end process of figuring out how they might move. I don't think that impacted the quarter. And to your question about market growth or share, I think it's more market evolution taking place and particularly, as Vince already mentioned, in the Northern part of Europe, where the conversion rates and the growth tend to be higher than what we've historically seen.","Robert M. Goldman - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And if I could just follow up with that, since as you say, you don't think the regulation and the legislation has yet impacted the market and since I believe every member state of the EU, except for Croatia, has now passed legislation or regulation, is it rational to assume the 10% growth that you saw in the quarter as sort of the new base and you would expect growth beyond that going forward?","Vincent A. Forlenza","It's 1 quarter, it's hard for us to say. Keep in mind that countries, you mentioned Croatia, but Spain and Portugal and Italy, they're going to move slow on this. So it's going to take us another quarter or so to just see what happens here and do they get more aggressive in terms of ramping up Safety. They've moved slow. So we've got 1 quarter at higher rates, so we're not going to project from 1 quarter. But we'll come back and take another look at this at the end of the year. So we should talk about it then and see if we've got 2 in a row.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Eric Criscuolo with Mizuho Securities.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Just filling in for Peter. The share count looks like it ticked up a little bit in the quarter. What was the cause of that? And wondering maybe if you could talk about how you think that's going to look going forward or at least for the next quarter.","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. So as I mentioned as part of my opening remarks, we completed another $50 million of repurchases in the third quarter, bringing our total to about $410 million. And we've been talking through that this year of repurchases, up to $500 million. So we're about 80% there. And we're still on track to continue to work somewhere between the $400 million to $500 million range.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the Veritor systems, are they -- are you placing them with customers that haven't had any real point-of-care testing? Or are they displacing competitive products out there?","Tom Polen","Eric, this is Tom. Nearly all of those are competitive displacements.","Vincent A. Forlenza","[indiscernible] off this marketplace primarily, and now it's starting to go into retail chains.","Tom Polen","Right. It's not a segment that we've been in historically, so we're not upgrading really any BD base.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes. So everything we're doing is...","Tom Polen","All brand-new.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Taking from competition.","Operator","That was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for any closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, thank you very much for your participation on the call. As I said in my remarks as I was finishing up, we're pleased with the progress in the third quarter and year-to-date. We're very happy to reaffirm the guidance and take you up to the higher end of the guidance range. And we're encouraged by both our growth strategies and our operating effectiveness strategies. And we look forward to updating you on our next call. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."],"3236":["Becton, Dickinson and (NYSE:BDX) Q2 2013 Earnings Call May  2, 2013  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Monique Dolecki","Vincent A.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through May 9, 2013, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at (800) 475-6701 for domestic calls and area code (320) 365-3844 for international calls using confirmation number 290460. [Operator Instructions]","Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Katie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our second fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Suky Upadhyay, acting Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, President of Diagnostic Systems; and Gary Cohen, Executive Vice President.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As we've stated in our press release, we are pleased with our continued improved performance in the second quarter. Our results this quarter highlight the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio. We delivered solid revenue growth, which were in line with our expectations.","In early March, we acquired Cato Software Solutions, which manufactures a suite of comprehensive medication safety solutions for pharmacy intravenous medication preparation, physician therapy planning and nurse bedside documentation. The issue of medication errors is one of the top concerns on the minds of health care providers today. Cato provides automated system that creates and shares data to help reduce human error, streamline workflow and increase efficiency from medication preparation to delivery in both pharmacy and clinical drug delivery settings.","Also in March, we announced BD's entrance into the generic injectable pharmaceutical industry. The FDA approved the first 2 drugs to be offered in the BD Simplist ready-to-administer line of prefilled generic injectables. The first BD Simplist product approved was Diphenhydramine, an injectable antihistamine. This product started shipping to customers in April. As we recently announced, the second drug approved was Metoclopramide. We expect that product to ship in the coming weeks.","The launch of the BD Simplist product line and the acquisition of Cato demonstrate how we are continuing to invest in innovation, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. Cato and Simplist are highly aligned with our broader strategy of making health care systems more effective, efficient and safe. We continue to focus on medication error management and enabling safer more effective parenteral drug delivery in both hospital and pharmacy settings.","Moving on to our financial results. Revenue growth in the second quarter was driven by our Medical and Diagnostics segments. Strong international growth overcame slower U.S. sales growth, which was mostly impacted by a timing of orders. We also continue -- we also saw a continued strong growth in international Safety sales and emerging markets. Based on our solid second quarter and the first half of the year, we are raising our previously communicated currency-neutral revenue and earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year 2013. Suky will provide more details on guidance in a moment.","On Slide 5, we've outlined our second quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company revenues were solid, increasing by 4.1%. Fully diluted EPS came in at $1.39, growing at 7.6% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of the medical device tax, which went into effect in January of this year, adjusted earnings per share grew 11.5% in the quarter.","Now I'd like to turn things over to Suky for a more detailed discussion of our second quarter financial performance.","Suketu Upadhyay","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by discussing the key financial highlights for the second quarter. We delivered solid performance in the backdrop of a challenging environment. This demonstrates that we are continuing to effectively execute against our strategy. We have made targeted investments that are delivering consistent, improved results. We believe this is becoming evident as we make progress throughout this fiscal year.","Revenue growth in the second quarter was in line with our expectations driven by new product sales, acquisitions and lower pricing erosion. As expected, growth was unfavorably impacted by tough comparisons and timing of orders. The medical device tax impacted SSG&A by about $14 million. This had a negative effect of about 4 percentage points on our operating income growth in the quarter. On an underlying basis, we are continuing to deliver operating margin expansion.","Earnings per share were $1.39. This is slightly higher than the expectations we outlined for you on the call due in part to the timing of certain label expenses, which we now expect to occur in the second half of the year. Also during the second quarter, we completed an additional $56 million of our approximate $500 million share repurchase plan for fiscal year 2013. Overall, the health of our business is good, and we are on track to continue delivering accelerated revenue growth, underlying margin expansion and a higher quality of earnings.","As Vince just mentioned, our year-to-date results give us the confidence to raise guidance on both our revenue growth and earnings per share. On a currency-neutral basis, our guidance range for revenue growth is increasing by 50 basis points. We expect currency-neutral earnings per share to increase by 100 basis points. I will provide further details later in my presentation.","On Slide 8, I will review our revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. Revenue growth was 4.1% for the company. The impact of pricing erosion was about [indiscernible] points in the quarter, which was better than our expectations. BD Medical second quarter revenues increased 4.2%. The growth in this segment was driven by a broad range of new products across all 3 business units.","Growth in Diabetes Care was 6.6%. This reflects continued strong sales of pen needles, which include our Nano and PentaPoint products. Medical Surgical Systems growth was 4.2%, led by emerging markets and international Safety sales. As Vince mentioned, we acquired Cato and launched our BD Simplist ready-to-administer prefilled injectables this quarter. Both Cato and Simplist will be recorded in the Medical Surgical Systems business unit going forward. These acquisitions did not have a material impact in the quarter, and we don't expect them to have a material impact on the full year.  Pharmaceutical Systems growth was 2.4%. As we expected and communicated to you on the last call, this reflects an unfavorable impact from the timing of orders.","BD Diagnostics second quarter revenues increased 4.9%. The segment's growth was driven by international expansion and new product sales such as KIESTRA and Veritor. BD Biosciences revenue growth was 1.9% versus the prior year period due to solid instrument placements in the U.S. and a benefit from the timing of orders in our Advanced Bioprocessing unit.","Moving to Slide 9. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the second quarter. As we expected, softer growth in the U.S., primarily due to timing, was offset by continued strong international growth. BD's reported U.S. revenues increased 0.3% versus the prior year. We view the environment in the U.S. as constrained but stable.","Revenue in our U.S. Medical segment declined 1.4%, which was largely driven by the timing of orders in Pharmaceutical Systems business. Additionally, our Medical Surgical unit was unfavorably impacted by a difficult prior year comparison with the PhaSeal product. In our Diabetes Care unit, revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by the timing of orders in our retail business and a tough comparison to the prior year. U.S. growth in the Diagnostics segment was 1.1%. This reflects strong growth of Veritor point-of-care platform, which was partially offset by unfavorable timing in the Preanalytical Systems unit. The segment was also unfavorably impacted by extended cervical cancer screening intervals in our women's health care and cancer unit.","U.S. Biosciences growth of 5.8% was driven by continued strong instrument placements as well as the benefit from timing of orders in Advanced Bioprocessing. We remain cautious about the U.S. environment, specifically the impact of sequestration on research funding. This has been contemplated in our full year guidance. As I just described, growth in the U.S. this quarter was largely impacted by unfavorable timing. We expect growth in the U.S. for the total company to return to 2% to 3% for the balance of the year.","Moving on to international. We continue to see strong growth. Revenues grew 6.9% currency neutral, with growth coming primarily from the Medical and Diagnostics segments. The Medical segment grew 8.2%, and Diagnostics grew 8.8%. This reflects strong growth in emerging markets and international Safety sales. Biosciences grew 0.2%, impacted by softness in western Europe due to austerity measures and the timing of government research funding in Japan.","On Slide 10, we continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, which accounted for approximately 23% of total revenues. Emerging market revenues grew 13% currency neutral over the prior year. This was driven by good performance across all segments and regions with particularly strong growth in China of about 30%. We continue to expect low double-digit growth in emerging markets, and growth in China is expected to be in the 20% range for the balance of this fiscal year. Our success in emerging markets is driven by a number of factors, including BD's ability to design products for a specific market. We have had success with products like BD Emerald and Intima II, which are designed to meet the unique customer needs in emerging markets and are competitively priced.","Moving to global safety on Slide 11. Currency-neutral sales increased 5.6% and grew to $514 million in the quarter. Revenues in the U.S. grew 1.6% while international sales grew 11.1% currency neutral, with western Europe and emerging markets both growing double digits. Medical Safety sales grew 9%, driven by a range of safety-engineered products, as well as the acquisition of SSI. Diagnostics growth was 2.4% in the quarter.","Moving on. Since we've already discussed revenues in detail, I will never -- not cover Slide 12. Turning to Slide 13. As we expected and outlined for you on the last call, gross margin declined 30 basis points versus the prior year. Our performance in the quarter reflects benefits from ReLoCo savings, continuous improvement initiatives and favorable raw material costs. These items were more than offset by recent acquisition-related costs, pricing erosion and other onetime costs. Onetime items had an unfavorable impact on performance of about 60 basis points in the quarter. After neutralizing for these events, underlying gross profit would have been broadly in line with our full year guidance range.","Slide 14 recaps the second quarter income statement and highlights our foreign-currency-neutral results. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of delivering solid underlying performance. Our results this quarter were overshadowed by some onetime events. As we discussed, revenue and GP were in line with our expectations. SSG&A increased about 6% due to increased investments in emerging markets, acquisition-related expenses, EVEREST and the medical device tax. The medical device tax favorably impacted SSG&A by 3 percentage points. R&D increased 4.5%. This remains in line with our expectations at 6.1% of revenues as we continue to invest in new products.","Operating income grew 1.1% in the quarter. This was unfavorably impacted by the lower gross margins I just mentioned, in addition to the medical device tax. The tax negatively impacts operating income growth by about 400 basis points. Our tax rate declined 200 basis points, reflecting the benefit of the reinstated R&D tax credit in the U.S. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to remain in line with our previously communicated guidance range.","In the quarter, earnings per share were $1.39, which is a 7.6% increase versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of the medical device tax, adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.44, which represents an 11.5% increase over the prior year.","As we mentioned earlier, our year-to-date results give us the confidence to raise guidance on both revenue and earnings per share. Slide 15 illustrates our revenue guidance by segment. As you can see, we have increased our revenue growth expectations for the total company, which contemplates a stable environment. Our revenue -- our revised guidance of 4.5% to 5% reflects solid core growth, a benefit from new product launches and less pricing erosion. We now expect pricing erosion of about 50 basis points for the total year. The Medical and Diagnostic segments are expected to grow about 5%, and Biosciences remains unchanged at 1% to 2% growth.","Moving on to Slide 16. I'd like to walk you through the various elements of our P&L guidance for the rest of the year. Starting with revenues, we are raising our currency-neutral guidance by 50 basis points. Reported revenue growth remains unchanged at 3.5% to 4% due to the weakening of the euro and the yen. This assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of about $1.30 [ph] and a dollar-to-yen exchange rate of about JPY 99 for the rest of the year.","Moving to gross profit. We have increased our range to reflect 51.6% to 51.8% of revenues. This reflects solid year-to-date underlying performance. We expect slightly higher SSG&A cost. Our new range of 25.6% to 25.8% of revenues reflects increased investments and strategic opportunities, such as our recent acquisition of Cato.","Operating income is expected to be between 20% and 20.2%. This represents about 40 basis points of underlying margin expansion even after absorbing additional cost from acquisitions. We expect the unfavorable impact of the medical device tax to be about $45 million for the fiscal year. This represents a 300-basis-point impact to operating income and a 250-basis-point impact to EPS. This reflects our most recent thinking about the net impact of the tax.","For fiscal year 2013, we expect earnings per share of $5.72 to $5.75. This represents an increase of 100 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, this represents a 50-basis-point increase due to the currency impact I just mentioned. Excluding the impact of the medical device tax and foreign currency, we expect EPS to grow between 11% and 11.5%. This also reflects a 50-basis-point increase versus prior expectations. The increase in earnings per share is driven by stronger revenue growth, as well as better-than-expected results in interest income and other income.","For the balance of the year, we expect our revenue and EPS profile to look slightly different than our historical performance. This fiscal year, we expect a stronger fourth quarter rather than the stronger third quarter performance we have historically delivered. Based on our EPS guidance of $5.72 to $5.75 and our year-to-date results of $2.74, we expect EPS for the remainder of the year to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide a more detailed update on our progress around key initiatives.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, Suky. Moving on to Slide 18. I would like to review the program and product launches in our Medical segment. As I mentioned earlier, we acquired Cato and launched the BD Simplist product line. For BD Simplist, we currently have 2 drugs that have been approved by the FDA. In addition to Diphenhydramine, we received FDA approval for Metoclopramide in April. We have 4 additional drugs in the pipeline at various stages of approval.","In our Pharmaceutical Systems business, we announced the commercial launch of the BD UltraSafe PLUS Passive Needle Guard, which was from our recent acquisition of SSI. In addition to offering needlestick safety in an easy-to-use device, this product is enhanced with special features designed to facilitate comfort and support for health care providers and patients. This device is also designed to meet increasingly complex biotechnology drug requirements, including higher viscosity. This product nicely complements our current Safety portfolio.","In our Diabetes Care unit, we continue to innovate with new products. We recently launched our next pen needle, the BD Nano with EasyFlow technology, which has [indiscernible] benefits. As you can see, we have continued to make good progress with our product portfolio in the Medical segment.","Turning to Slide 19. You'll see the various product launches in Diagnostics. We've made significant progress with our BD Veritor system since it launched early in fiscal year 2012. In addition to receiving FDA clearance for our new Strep A assay in the quarter, we have placed more than 4,007 [ph] units of this system. We continue to broaden our customer base as well as capture share gains with this innovative point-of-care platform.","On the BD MAX platform, as we've been communicating, we have built up a nice pipeline of orders, and we expect sales to continue to ramp up in the back half of this fiscal year. Shipments accelerated in the second quarter, and we have passed the milestone of more than 150 instruments now operating at customer sites.","In April, we received FDA clearance for C. difficile, a key anchor assay that further strengthens our portfolio of assays for health care-associated infections, which also includes MRSA. Our enteric bacteria panel was also CE marked and launched, representing a new served molecular market for BD. This latest milestone demonstrates our commitment to rapidly expand the menu on BD MAX, offering laboratories a broad range of fully automated molecular tests that can meet both their current and future clinical needs.","We also continued to receive very positive customer interest in our KIESTRA microbiology automation platform. KIESTRA is well suited to help our customers navigate through the challenges of health care reform globally with its ability to accelerate time to result and also significantly increase lab productivity. As an example, in April, we announced, with Canada's CML Healthcare Inc., an agreement for CML to install the world's largest KIESTRA microbiology automation system. This fully automated system will be installed later this fiscal year.","On Slide 20, I would like to review the program and product launches in our Biosciences segment, which includes 2 analyzers for CD4 testing. We expect the FACSPresto, our low-cost analyzer designed for emerging markets, to launch in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. This is 2 quarters earlier than our original expectations. Our FACSClearCount is currently on hold as we have other strategic priorities. We'll update you on our future plans to ramp up that platform.","For the past 18 months, we've been reinvigorating the pipeline in our Biosciences business. We have some exciting new developments and continued enhancements to our Canto and Fortessa lines. Additionally, we have other new products that are in early stages, and we will talk about them in more detail as we make progress with [indiscernible]. We will continue to invest in this business in order to continue our expansion in this market and to drive future growth.","On Slide 21, before we open the call to questions, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, with our continued improved performance in the second quarter and our results year-to-date, this is our fourth consecutive quarter of solid P&L performance driving a higher quality of earnings. Second, we continue to demonstrate that we're making progress delivering against our broader strategy of making health care more effective, efficient and safe. The BD Simplist product line and our acquisition of Cato are good examples of this. And third, we are seeing continued success with our key growth drivers. We have made targeted investments that are yielding results, and we believe this is becoming even more evident as we progress through this fiscal year.","Finally, we are positive about our outlook for fiscal year 2013. We're committed to delivering a 4.5% to 5% revenue growth and about 11% to 11.5% EPS growth, excluding the device tax and the impact of foreign currency. Our diverse product and geographic portfolio and the operational effectiveness programs we have in place provide BD with a strong foundation. We believe we're well positioned for continued success in fiscal year 2013 and beyond.","So thank you. We'll now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the beginning because, I think, the line cut out at least on my side. You had mentioned pricing moderated, I think, the pricing impact on the quarter. Can you maybe just talk about what kind of gives you the confidence that price will continue to be more moderate through the balance of the year?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So you're right, Kristen, and thanks for the question. It did moderate. And if you recall, it was -- the same thing was true in the first quarter of the year, so we've seen 2 quarters now where it was not as severe as we projected going into the year. We are not indicating that we're in an easy pricing environment. It's just not as difficult as it has been. Having said all of that, Europe remains a particular challenge, especially in southern Europe. But so far to date, with the trends that we see, we think it's just going to be somewhat less than our initial projections.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And what were the specific numbers in the quarter and your guidance again for the full year?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Suky will do that for you.","Suketu Upadhyay","Kristen, for the quarter, we said it was about 20 basis points, and on a full year basis, we're saying it's about 50 basis points.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe, Vince, if you can just kind of give us your broader overview. I mean, a lot of your peers this past quarter have talked a little bit more cautiously just about the health care environment, with some of the hospitals reporting admissions that are still down and just kind of broader weakness. Can you maybe just talk about what you guys are seeing because your results would seem to suggest you're certainly kind of bucking the trend there?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So we talked of that, what we were experiencing as a stable environment but constrained, so it's certainly not -- I wouldn't characterize it as an improving environment. I think that we've done well because of the diversity in the portfolio, both geographically. The acquisitions that we've been doing are performing well, and our new products are getting traction. So I don't think that we're in a better place from a utilization standpoint than the overall industry. I think that what we have in our portfolio is working well. On the negative side, of course, in this quarter, you did see the timing issues. Suky, would you like to add to that?","Suketu Upadhyay","I think you're right on point, Vince. And then, the fact that emerging markets continue to grow really well, and we're well indexed from a revenue exposure standpoint to emerging markets, I think, is another contribution.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just lastly, can you give us the contribution from acquisitions this quarter and what you have in the full year? I think your prior guidance was for 50-basis-point acquisition benefit for full year.","Suketu Upadhyay","That's right.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I don't know if it's any different. You kind of suggest that Cato would be minimal but...","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. Cato will be minimal. For the full year, we had previously guided that acquisitions would be about 50 basis points. We're taking that up a little bit. We're getting a little bit better expected -- than expected traction, thinking about 60 to 70 basis points on the full year. Within the quarter, it was about 100 basis points. But again, that'll come down over the rest of the year as KIESTRA starts to annualize.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla from Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to go into a little bit more detail on the Diagnostics components. I think in the prepared comments, you mentioned that cervical cancer screening extensions of intervals was impacting there. I mean, that's been going on for a little while. So I was wondering, is there a greater impact in the quarter?  And could Tom maybe give a little more detail on the other product lines within Diagnostic Systems?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure, Amit. And I think Tom would be happy to talk about that. I think you saw that the intervals start before this quarter but continuing. So Tom, maybe you can pick up on it.","Tom Polen","Sure. Amit, this is Tom. So in the quarter we saw, as Vince mentioned, overall strong performance in our microbiology business internationally and also in our point-of-care. Speaking then specifically to women's health and then also comment on molecular. We did see women's health was actually down 10% in the quarter, and that was driven by continued strong double-digit growth internationally. We are seeing continued increases in ACT testing internationally, as well as good conversion from conventional to liquid-based cytology driving that double-digit international growth. But we saw the U.S. down really driving that net decrease of 10% in the quarter, and that's really 2 factors. We saw OB\/GYN visits, the stats that we look at, OB\/GYN visits were down about 6.5% in the quarter. And then we see the intervals continuing to extend. We monitor those intervals and adoptions pretty closely, and we're seeing about 50% to 60% of physicians at this point have adopted those extended intervals. That's up from about 25% 2 years ago. So it's not ended yet, but it's moving towards a more -- it's continuing to increase that rate but that had -- did impact us. Molecular in the quarter was actually down as well, about 4%, and that was really prior losses in GeneOhm continue to annualize, and that offset growth that we did see in MAX. And as Vince mentioned earlier, we are seeing very good customer interest in MAX, continued really pleasure from the customer perspective around the automation of performance and the open system capabilities. We did surpass that 150 total installations in the quarter. It's diff approved, which is a major milestone in our [indiscernible] portfolio, and we've [indiscernible] against a backlog of orders bringing that down. We expect that backlog to be fully relieved in Q3 and moving forward from there.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Because we're ramping up production.","Tom Polen","Exactly.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So obviously, to state the obvious, the one area we are seeing lower utilization as the industry is, of course, is in women's health and cancer with the lower OB\/GYN visits and the increase in the interval. Other than that, I think there's been pretty much stability.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And Vince, could I just follow up on Biosciences? Just the point you made about strong instrument sales. Can you get a little more specific there? I think instrument sales in the industry are pretty volatile. Some companies have said they've been weak. You're talking about strength. Just a little color there.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. And the trend we started to see last quarter, it began to pick up at the higher end. [indiscernible] comment further on it. Bill, would you like to...","William A. Kozy","This is Bill. Just to give you some color, we have just slightly improved performance in the sorters and the high-end analyzers. And if you thought back to last year and remember some of our reports, that was a weak spot. So we've seen that stabilize a little bit, and we're getting some steady single-digit growth in that area. And then, of course, our new instrument, Acurri, continues to contribute very nicely. So the combination of some improvement in the high end and the steady ongoing performance in Acurri is kind of the story on instruments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Suky, maybe one quick question on the outlook and then, Vince, I had a question on China. Suky, I guess the interesting thing about the second quarter is, unlike your peers, we saw comp-adjusted acceleration. Your comps do get harder into the back half of the year. I wonder if you could help us understand some of the drivers that give you the confidence you can maintain this performance into the back half. And I guess the second related the question is if you think about the impact you're having from acquisitions this year and the underlying operating margin performance of 50, 60 points, help us understand.  Is there a way you could see next year not seeing better operating margin leverage than you're actually seeing this year just based on that acquisition drag and the underlying business performance?  And I have one follow-up for Vince.","Suketu Upadhyay","Sure. So I'll start on your 4-part question here. David, thanks for the question. So first off, what gives us the confidence on our outlook? So first of all, in the first half, I think we did perform quite well versus our expectations, 4.7 on the top line. And you could see that we're showing acceleration from an EPS perspective and from margin expansion. Going into the second half, we expect to see a little bit of acceleration from a top line perspective. The growth drivers, I think, as Vince has mentioned, primarily around acquisitions. We're seeing really good growth in customer anticipation around KIESTRA. SSI, we're very excited about. We think it will be a nice growth driver for us for the rest of the year. Our launch of new products, specifically around MAX beginning to ramp up, as Tom spoke about, adding on the new anchor assay of C. diff has us very excited. If you start to think about further on into our portfolio around pen needles, we still have a lot of runway in that business. So it really cuts across many different businesses. And then again from a geographic perspective, we continue to see very strong growth from emerging markets, and Safety continues to be a nice contributor. So we've got confidence, again, in the backdrop also of lower pricing erosion that we could sustain, not only sustain growth but actually accelerate a little bit from a top line perspective. Moving on to the second point of your question, which is -- you're absolutely right. Very good contribution from acquisitions this year, very good margin expansion.  What would you expect for next year? We're not going to guide on next year, but when you think about what are some of the drivers of our margin expansion this year, it's primarily in gross margin, right? And we've talked a lot about ReLoCo and the incremental benefits there, which are right on track and delivering as expected. We talked about our other continuous improvement in some of our G&A efficiencies. Those things don't go away as we look forward. So my anticipation is that we continue to see some margin expansion as we...","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And sorry for my liberty with the questions, but maybe one more for Vince. I guess, Vince, the interesting thing about the China number this quarter, and frankly, the first half of the year, has been versus your arch rival, so to speak, in China, the local player, you're actually probably performing better than your biggest local competitor, at least in our view. And I guess that's not what I think people would have thought heading into this year. So maybe kind of talk to us about why you're being successful in China this year and the sustainability of that trend.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. We are having a good year in China. Actually, we had a good year in China last year as well, and I think we're holding on success that we're putting in place over the last couple of years, and there's a few things. One is that we compete not [ph] just on product, but on clinical knowledge in the marketplace, especially on the device side. We're on our third memorandum of understanding with the Chinese government on infection control. So we're bringing not just a very innovative product, which was designed for the Chinese market, for example, in our Infusion Therapy business, but in addition, we are working with our customers on training, transfer of clinical knowledge, which is highly valued in the marketplace, which the local competition does not bring. Second, from an organizational standpoint, we have been investing heavily the last several years in not just sales capability but in a broad capability in terms of regulatory affairs, quality manufacturing. And I think you're seeing the impact of that as we improve our coverage across the entire country and strengthen partnerships with local distributors. So it's a whole series of things we're putting in place. I don't want to give you the impression that it's just on the medical device side. The medical device side is doing quite well, but it's also diagnostics over the last 18 months has ramped up very nicely in China. It's doing extremely well. BDB also is doing well, both historically with the clinical market; now it's also the research marketplace. And it's the total portfolio there that -- where we can do the small instrument all the way to the high-end centers that China is funding. So it's that mix of all things -- all of those things that is giving us the good performance against both the local competition, and quite frankly, against the international players as well.","Operator","And we'll go to the next line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just make sure I understand the change in the guidance on earnings versus the prior expectations. And then the math that I was getting to was there's a sort of $0.03 benefit from the medical device excise tax being a little bit lower than you had expected, the outperformance in the second quarter of between $0.05 and $0.08 depending on what baseline you use. And then you're raising guidance by $0.03 for the year. Is the entire difference there FX?","Suketu Upadhyay","No. So David, first of all, the medical device tax. Previously, we gave a guidance range of $40 million to $50 million. We're not saying it's around $45 million, so it's a little bit less than a $0.01 or $0.02 if you took the upper end of that range versus the middle of that range versus what we talked about. So we don't see that as a major driver. Overall, EPS we're increasing, on a performance basis, by about $0.05. FX offsets that by about $0.02, and again, it's driven by the underlying uptake in revenue as well as some benefit from some items below the line.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then taking maybe a little bit more of a longer-term view of the story, you're providing a sort of 11% FX-neutral, x medical device tax, earnings growth number for the year. Can you maybe just talk about the moving parts in there about anything unique to fiscal 2013 that might depress that or inflate that and how we should think about sustainable earnings growth for the company? Then just sort of dovetail to that, can you just explain in a little bit more detail the moving parts around the mix of earnings in Q3 and Q4?","Suketu Upadhyay","So first of all, the first question in there was around 2013 and how that looks versus 2014. So sort of trying answer that very simplistically, I deconstruct that 11%, 11.5%. If you think about revenues, the component of that, about 4.5 to 5%. Then you've got our share repurchase program carryover from 2012 plus the shares we're doing this year. It's probably worth about 4% to 5%. And then the remainder of that is due to the operating margin expansion. That's a profile that I pretty much see going into 2014. There's going to be some puts and takes across those 3 levers, but I think that's broadly in line with where we're looking at it. I think your next question was around how do we see Q3 and Q4 into the rest of the year. Again, if you sort of took where our guidance -- what we've delivered so far, $2.74, our guidance range on EPS for the rest of the year, that takes you to about a $3 at the midpoint for the rest of the year. And again, we see that more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. I hope I've answered your second question.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. I'm just trying to understand why more weighted to the fourth quarter. What are the dynamics that make that the case this year?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Just lumpiness in the business, David.","Suketu Upadhyay","Lumpiness in the business. If you think about the uptake on our new products, as well as acquisition, you're continuing to see a steady ramp-up quarter-over-quarter.","Vincent A. Forlenza","We mentioned some spending which got shifted from the second quarter into the third, so you have that combination going on.","Operator","And we'll go to the next line of Brian Weinstein from William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Going back to the question on pricing, can you guys just talk a little bit there? Are there are certain areas where you're seeing pricing a little bit better than expected? And is this something that you're doing or you're seeing success with efforts that you're making to minimize the impact of pricing? Or are there broader market dynamics that are just kind of helping you out there?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So Bill Kozy is going to address that question.","William A. Kozy","Just at a general level, if you remember where we were managing a couple of years ago, we now have changed our price management systems across all 6 of the worldwide business units. We've got the fundamental things in place now that pricing passed those contract approval processes. I think we've gotten a lot more rigorous in the way we manage our price. As Vince mentioned, the environment is still tough. But there's a much greater -- there's basically a diligence process on our major contract management process in all 6 of the business units, and I think that's probably been an important factor. In addition, the new marketing capability and the company being led by our CMO, Nabil Shabshab, is really driving value propositions to a next level across, again, all of our acute care businesses, which is where our price pressure has been mostly concentrated. So I'd say it's the combination of those 2 managerial initiatives that have probably had the most visible impact, from our perspective, on how we think about managing our price more effectively.","Vincent A. Forlenza","And if you think back, we also had a situation where we communicated that there was one product line which had a severe pricing event. We sunseted that, I think, about a year ago, halfway through last year. So with that in mind, we communicated going forward that we thought pricing might improve because of that. It's still negative, but we did sunset that and prices did stabilize in that particular marketplace like we thought. But to Bill's good points I think it's that plus the combination of things that Bill just put on the table.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just maybe cleaning up a couple of items. So if I'm looking at the quarter acquisitions, you said it was 100 basis points and that includes KIESTRA, SSI and Sirigen. Is that right?","Suketu Upadhyay","That's right.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And is Cato 0 for the rest of the year? Because if you -- I'm just thinking about our numbers here, and it seems like the acquisition component would be greater, particularly with the addition of Cato. Or is that just 0 for the balance of the year?","Vincent A. Forlenza","No, it's very small, Mike. So you don't have to figure it into your model. It will start to impact next year.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And so if I look at this quarter, so if I back out the 100 basis points from acquisitions and the 40-basis-point impact of currency gets you to like 3.1% organic, so that's down 200 basis points. The comp was a little bit tougher this quarter, obviously, than last quarter. But do you expect growth to accelerate in the back half of the year x the acquisitions and that's just, to be clear, because of what?","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. So if you think about where we guided you for the rest of the year, Mike, we say 4.5% to 5%. And if you think about acquisitions for the rest of the year, it's going to moderate to somewhere in about the 60- to 70-basis-point range. So we're looking at underlying growth somewhere of around 4% to 4.5%, so it looks all right.","Vincent A. Forlenza","And Mike, recall that we've talked about the timing events in this quarter. So the other thing that we should all be keeping in mind is it was a timing event in Diabetes Care. So we expect strong growth in Diabetes Care in the back half of the year. We all know we've talked about many times the lumpiness in Pharm Systems. So Pharm Systems, we're indicating to you, is going to be improving in the back half of the year versus this quarter. So you see that going on as well. We have the ramp-up of BD MAX in the back half of the year. Remember, we talked about 150 instrument placements. It takes a while [indiscernible] gauge its usage to start to ramp-up. So you've got all of those things, and we expect continued good performance in emerging markets in the back half of the year. So when you put all of that together and you pulled out the timing elements, I think we're pretty confident in terms of the back half.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And if I think about that as well just from geographic standpoint, if I adjust it for acquisition this quarter, it looks like the U.S. business was probably down slightly year-over-year. Is it the U.S. business that turns in part because, as well, Pharm Systems turns just based on timing?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes, Mike. You nailed it.","Operator","And we'll go to the next line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe talk about BD MAX for a second a bit further. The Cdiff approval seems like a pretty significant positive to me. Can you maybe be more specific? Or can you talk a little bit more -- expand on your comments about how it gets rolled out and how we think -- what impact on BD MAX placement the Cdiff approval could have, uptake, et cetera?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So Tom can comment on that. But we really -- just as a foundation, we do believe that it's such a critical assay for us because it's probably the major problem that hospitals have right now in the U.S. So without that anchor assay, we were constrained. But Tom, you want to add some color to that?","Tom Polen","Yes. Rick, this is Tom. I would just say that if you look at, particularly in the U.S. -- so x U.S. we've had about 7 assays launched. This brings the U.S. up to now 3 FDA-approved assays, and we also offer REO assay for the HAI space, as well as CRE. So this -- the launch of Cdiff really rounded out our HAI portfolio. We had MRSA. MRSA is still a growing market, but it's -- the growth rate of MRSA looking forward is not merely at the level of Cdiff. I'd say MRSA defines a bit of a more mature market. Cdiff, as Vince alluded to, is still a very fast-growing market that has a lot of runway ahead. And as you look at someone looking to make an acquisition of a platform for helping to manage their HAI solutions, the fact that we now have MRSA and Cdiff available on the box, it was something that we had a lot of customer actually waiting for. We had some pent-up demand of people waiting for our Cdiff approval, and we saw that immediately upon approval, a series of orders come through the door. And we're still, of course, working on many more beyond that. It's kind of one additional assay. It's not the scale of MRSA or Cdiff that's actively under clinical trials right now. That's our StaphSR assay for pre-surgical screening. We'll be submitting that to the FDA later this year, and that will fully round out our HAI portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Rick, one other thing to keep in mind is that while we are getting new placements, and we are getting new placements in customers we did not have before, a big priority for this year is upgrading the current base. So as I was mentioning, you're going to see the ramp-up of sales, but that's somewhat moderated by the fact that we're also trading out that installed base where we've been selling a very manual product to date. So expect even a bigger impact next year.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] so the impact could be greater next year?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of other quick ones. Suky, investment income was almost double our $6 million forecast, $4 million sequentially better than the first quarter. I know this is an up-and-down number. Just how do we -- what was causing that and how do we think about that number for the rest of the year?","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes, so total investment, you're right, was slightly higher in the quarter primarily due to deferred comp, as you know. We've talked about this in the past, as assets in that plan increase because we've seen good performance in the overall equities market, we recognize additional interest income. Of course, there's an offset in SSG&A, which you'll see in this quarter as well. So that's one of the key drivers to this year. We're also seeing some slight rate improvement x U.S. on our cash balances, so that's a positive. As we think about for the year, interest income we're characterizing at about $35 million, and so that's a slight increase from last quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Vincent -- I think this is a question really for Vincent, Suky. You bumped up your guidance just a little bit for SSG&A spend for the year. I apologize if I missed this, but are you pulling forward any spend that was planned for maybe next year or beyond on really an opportunistic basis given you've seen some better-than-expected revenue this year? And if so, is there any reason we shouldn't be contemplating this as we model out margins moving forward?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Good question. The answer is no. To be more precise, we're seeing there was spending that we thought was going to happen in the second quarter, and it was in the legal area. We thought that is now moving into the back half of the year, somewhere, we think, probably the third quarter, and that's what's going on. It's not us accelerating infrastructure spending or that sort of thing. So no impact on your modeling other than this year.","Suketu Upadhyay","And the increase in overall SSG&A is primarily driven by the new acquisition.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then another BD MAX question for Tom. Thanks for the update on the number of placements, and clearly your commentary today really dovetails with our recent checks that BD MAX is going well, especially as the menu expands. Vince, just a second ago, you mentioned that you're really focused on upgrading existing customers rather than gaining incremental customers. Could you just provide a little bit more detail on how you expect this to evolve over the next year or 2? And then, I guess in terms of just thinking about conversions or upgrades, however you want to put it, what's the revenue opportunity associated with getting a customer -- an existing customer to upgrade from GeneOhm?","Tom Polen","Okay. So this is Tom, and thanks for the question. So just on -- give a little bit of color on the upgrade path and why that's important to us. As we've been reporting, the GeneOhm business has been challenged, I'd say, for really the last year to 2 because of the very manual nature of that, right.  It's been vulnerable. And as we've said, we actually had molecular is down this quarter because of the annualized impact of losses in the past on GeneOhm, and the GeneOhm menu is really purely an HAI menu plus GBS. That GeneOhm menu now, with the approval of Cdiff, is basically been fully replicated on MAX. And so the customers that have been relying on GeneOhm to do their MRSA testing and their Cdiff testing and their GBS testing now have that exact same portfolio available on MAX, and so we're able to go and more aggressively upgrade them, secure that business so that we don't have any underlying negative trajectory in that part of the portfolio. So then with a more solid base, of course, you're looking at a combination of share gains, as well as entry into new market spaces. And really from here on out, most of the new assays that we will be launching on MAX, and we haven't characterized the exact size of those markets publicly, but what you will see is MAX beginning to enter into new spaces for us. So, for example, in the quarter we launched our enteric bacterial panel in Europe. Now that's a new market for us. It's a new market overall because it's upgrading customers from culture to a molecular method. That assay is under active clinical trials right now in the U.S. and will be submitted for FDA approval at the end of this year. We have GC\/CT also moving into clinical trials. GC\/CT, Trich, a new assay on that platform in that volume segment of the market. Of course, it's been playing a bit more in the higher volume segment on our Viper platform. And there's many others. We have respiratory assays in our pipeline, et cetera, which are new markets for us. So we think about, as we get that MAX placement into an account, really growing that account through the addition of menu, and that's an area that we've communicated that we're very focused on, and we'll continue to be, obviously, on the execution side of that, very focused on menu expansion because that's what's going to drive average revenue per account upwards over the many years to come.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful, Tom. Really one quick follow-up. GeneOhm-to-MAX conversion, there's also a pricing benefit as well for you, correct?","Tom Polen","There is. In general, it's in the 10% to 20% range.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","A couple of quick ones for me. First, on the margins, so I'm just trying to understand a little bit more what happened either year-over-year or sequentially. Even if I strip out the medical device tax, the margin seems like a little bit weaker than I would have anticipated. And I think you said you had 60 basis points of just onetime items, and then you noted the legal spend pushed out. So I was just trying to understand a little bit more what was happening on the margin line, the 60 bps.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Suky can take that for you.","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes, so from a gross margin perspective, you're right. We have onetime items, about 60 bps. It really relates to a lot of smaller items. For example, we had the write-down of a plant that we're closing as a result of our ReLoCo initiatives. There's been some other items related to cost compliance. All in all, they add up to about 60 bps for the quarter. Again, we expect those to turn in the next quarter. So that was the key driver of gross margin. And then when you look below that, again, a medical device tax worth about $14 million or about 60 bps to operating margins as well.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So Suky, maybe you want to comment on the good productivity in the quarter because we actually had the productivity we expected to have.","Suketu Upadhyay","That's right. If you sort of broke gross margin apart, it is down 30 bps, 10 due to performance. But unfortunately, some of the onetime items masked a really good performance we're seeing against ReLoCo, continuous improvement. And actually, our 2012 acquisition is now becoming accretive to gross margins in 2013. Those all in were worth about 130 basis points improvement year-over-year. So a good point, Vince, and that is really the underlying story.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And then, on the 3Q, 4Q dynamic, just so I'm clear, do you know specifically -- because you said diabetes was pushed out and you expect it to be stronger in the second half, is that something you know was going to be a 4Q versus 3Q event? Or is that some just conservatism that you don't really -- you know some things are coming and it's just difficult to predict when it's coming? And I guess, another kind of follow-up on the revenues there. It looks like, Tom, on the -- for Diagnostic Systems, to be up as much as it was, given what you said about women's health and molecular, that microbiology must have been up double digits, which is not a business that, I think, most would expect to have that kind of growth. So can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of that?","Vincent A. Forlenza","First, on Diabetes Care. It was a onetime supply chain event. It's already resolved itself. So going forward, we're not concerned about this. So you can pretty much take that off the table. And Tom, microbiology is doing very well.","Tom Polen","It is. So this is Tom. Microbiology is doing well overall. I would say in that segment, you also have to put in the Veritor point-of-care platform, which is also doing very well. As Vince mentioned, we're up to over 4,700 placements since launch, and really, most of those sales, of course, are concentrated in the flu season, which was Q2. So I look at Diagnostic Systems as really getting the benefit of concentration of a very successful new point-of-care launch with flu, with also very good growth internationally across the portfolio and solid performance and increasing strength in our microbiology business. And that's driven by not only just the core products, but also the integration of KIESTRA and now the broader solution that we're offering in that category around automation.","Vincent A. Forlenza","KIESTRA is really giving us a total offering in this segment that we didn't have before.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And just to be clear, on the 3Q, 4Q, do you know specific items that are going to happen in 4Q versus 3Q? Or is that just kind of uncertainty with the lumpiness?","Tom Polen","No, I think it's just -- as we've talked about before, it's just the calendarization and really the ramp-up of the new products and the acquisitions that are driving sort of a sequential uptake to the fourth quarter.","Vincent A. Forlenza","We do know Pharm Systems is going to be bigger in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. That's the main one.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First question I think probably for Tom, and this is a follow-up to a question you had regarding MRSA and Cdiff and kind of how you think about those from a longer-term growth standpoint. Any comment around the recent CMS proposal that came out earlier this week around the in-patient quality scores and tying those to HAIs and potentially giving this business a shot in the arm here in a couple of years?","Tom Polen","Good question. This is Tom. So just around MRSA and Cdiff, we continue to see Cdiff, I'd say, the market overall is growing very strong double digits, closer towards the 20% range is what we see. And with the adoption of molecular Cdiff methods, it's still well under 50% across the market. So you've got significant overall health care issues that's happening across, particularly in the U.S. with a continued upgrade from what is very clearly documented as a -- going from an inferior method to a superior method going from EIA to molecular technology. MRSA, I described as a bit more mature. You're seeing that growing more in the very high-single digits to very low-double digits. For MRSA as a marketplace, as people have -- that's been -- the conversion from culture to molecular has been going on for quite a bit longer period of time, and we described that as a bit more mature. The combination of the 2 though, of course, we still see HAI as a very attractive market. On your point regarding reimbursement and kind of value-based purchasing going forward, certainly, we have always recognized that there's going to be increased incentives for hospitals to reduce HAIs, and we've been positioning ourselves for that, not only through expansion of our portfolio, but we've been very involved in helping to influence those guidelines and the laws that have been passed in several states around mandatory screening, et cetera. So overall, the market access and market development around HAIs, including influencing the rules around future payment structures, et cetera, is an area that we remain very active in.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great, and then a follow-up. We've certainly seen kind of first-hand the effect of KIESTRA being at the ACTMED [ph] meeting over the weekend and candidly seeing some pretty impressive traffic at that piece of your booth. Can you talk a little bit about, I guess, one of the other new technologies in microbiology that I think is probably driving the franchise, and that's mass spec, and what you're seeing both in Europe as well as in the U.S. and kind of how this fits in the entire equation?","Vincent A. Forlenza","That's a great question. Tom, why don't you?","Tom Polen","Yes, very good. So appreciate the feedback on ACTMED [ph]. The -- so I would say, as you saw, KIESTRA is going very well, and it's performing at our expectations. Mass spec is a very exciting new technology that's, of course, really allowing identification of organisms to occur in minutes rather than in hours. You may have seen at ACTMED [ph], we did a joint press release with Bruker.  We have entered into an OEM agreement with Bruker on a BD-branded MALDI-TOF, which is going to be -- we'll sell that as a standalone and connected in with our Phoenix AST solution. We have launched an AST on our Phoenix, so that customers can do the ID on mass spec, AST on our Phoenix and connect all of those results to our informatics platform called EpiCenter. We're also in the process of integrating that Bruker MALDI-TOF OEM that we've done in line with our KIESTRA system to be able to fully automate that moving forward. And you probably saw we actually were sharing the early prototype versions of that we're demonstrating at the convention that you're at.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of just really quick ones. What was the year-over-year benefit from flu?","Suketu Upadhyay","So the year-over-year benefit from flu was a little bit better than what we expected in the second quarter. If you recall, in the first quarter, we said it was about 50 basis points.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a quick one. On the Simplist products, what's sort of your expectation to organic revenue growth contribution for that in 2013? I guess, just some general guidance on how to think about it for 2014.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So for 2013, small. And we're just starting to ramp this up, but we are starting to ship products. But in terms of the back half of the year, it's going to take a while for these contracts to roll and the product to get through the system and whatnot, so not much. So you're going to see a bigger impact in '14. '14 is going to be our really first sales year of this product. But we're not going to get into a particular revenue guidance on it at this point in time.","Operator","And we'll go to the next line of Matthew Taylor with Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a bigger-picture question. I wanted to ask about the cadence of Safety growth in Europe, just given the legislative mandate there and how you see that through the rest of the year and then through the next couple of years.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Bill is going to take that.","William A. Kozy","This is Bill. Most of the countries at this point are still in their final stages of transposing that directive to the localized country legislation. And as you know, that's supposed to become effective May 11. There is a little bit of a variance across the countries in terms of capability to be ready by mid-May. You've got some people that are very far along. Examples would be Austria, Finland, France, Germany and Ireland. You've got a few people who are lagging. I'm less certain this would be the countries in southern Italy. And Denmark and Czech Republic are a little different. In terms of where we're sitting right now, and of course, we're just trying to get a handle on today, we see the European safety market about 53%, 55% converted on infusion therapy, maybe about 10% to 13% on injection and about 42% to 45% on our blood collection products. Those are the real key drivers. We've also got an early-stage entry in diabetes right now, and that safety market is about 10% converted. Now we've seen our revenues growing at about 9.5% or so year-to-date on Safety. We expect that number to kind of continue itself. We don't see anything dramatic happening suddenly in the second half of the year, but we do expect that high-single digit growth to continue, hopefully over the next several quarters.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And I just wanted to ask another question on the margins. I guess it was interesting that you called out the acquisitions are becoming accretive. And given your programs in terms of ReLoCo, can you talk about your acquisition strategy and how that relates to margins? And do you think that a lot of your expansion the next couple of years is going to come from gross margins? Or is there more -- is it more going to be cost-cutting-driven?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So I think we have a mix going forward. We do expect to continue to get gross margin improvement as we go forward. I think from a principal standpoint, you should think that the kind of ReLoCo program you've seen in Medical is now a way of life, and that we would look to keep extending that kind of thinking in program throughout the company. We're actively working on those things. Also second piece, you're right. We do expect that these acquisitions will become more accretive over time. The way I think about it is our strategy is to continue doing these plug-in acquisitions. So there's always a baseline cost of the program. But as the -- as some of these acquisitions mature, then we see benefits from them, and that whole program becomes more positive over time. But we do expect to continue this program and continue to move into adjacencies. Moving into SSG&A, we will continue to drive our efforts in shared services as we bring up our global shared service network and continue to look for operating efficiencies in SSG&A as we move forward on the EVEREST program as well. So it's going to be a combination, and it'll probably vary from year to year depending on what's going on.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Just a question around the pharma business. I mean, does that change the acquisition strategy going forward? And is there any way you can kind of help us around 2014 on the outlook for that business?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So we're not going to start guiding that business now. It's too early on, Peter. Let us get some traction, and we'll come back as we talk about 2014 more holistically, then we'll update you on that business. But we're just taking the first orders for that business. So just way too early for that. What was the first part?","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Just around acquisition strategy.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So I don't think it changes our acquisition strategy. We're still focused on plug-in acquisitions. If you think about what we're doing in the Medical side of the business, what we're communicating is we're focused on medication error reduction and improving parenteral drug delivery. That's the core of that strategy. I'm sure we would continue to look to expand our footprint in that area as we're continuing to expand our footprint in Diagnostics and Biosciences.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And then just on BD MAX and Cdiff, what kind of hospitals are you targeting? I guess, what's your go-to-market strategy there? And is that more of an international business, you think, than a U.S. business?","Vincent A. Forlenza","It's very much a U.S. business and an international business. But pretty much all the major -- the acute care hospitals have significant programs around first, HAI reduction. And then as Tom was talking about before, we see this opportunity for a broader menu across the acute care segment. What Tom's doing is broadening the footprint of molecular within the acute care segment. You want to comment any more on that? Because it's been very concentrated a little bit now.","Tom Polen","I think you summarized it very well. If anything, I would say Cdiff is a bit more concentrated in the U.S., where the adoption of molecular is more widespread. Europe is much further behind in the adoption curve. U.S. is 3x to 4x ahead in the adoption curve, I'd say, at least of Cdiff than really most other geographies around the world, so...","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And just a follow-up around that. Is Asia a focus for your BD MAX?","Tom Polen","Well, we placed quite a number of BD MAXs in Asia. We have not necessarily entered into China with BD MAX yet. But more of the mature geographies in Asia, particularly ANZ, Singapore, et cetera. We're seeing strong adoption of BD MAX. They have existing HAI screening programs in those markets, and we also see very positive feedback on our future menu in those geographies as well.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Jeff Frelick with Canaccord.","Jeffrey Frelick - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","You've mentioned earlier not seeing broad improvement in the overall market, especially around utilization. So given the kind of the solid quarters you've strung together here, you must be taking some share. I just wondered if you can point to which products are contributing to that -- to those gains.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, I think there's a number of businesses where we're doing quite well in. And you see our results, first off, just broadly in international and especially in emerging markets. We're doing well as we build out those infrastructures, as we talked about, as we have some products particularly targeted for those markets. So in Medical, we're doing well. Remember -- we haven't talked about it today. The Emerald Syringe we've launched, and we're moving into markets that we haven't served before. I think we're doing quite well in the Diabetes Care business in pen needles as well. In Diagnostics, we're reporting out the point-of-care, and Veritor, we entered the physicians marketplace, where we have been in clinical but we were not there before in the flu market in physicians. Now we have Strep and RSV going forward as well. So we're as excited about that. Remember, there's also adjacencies going on here, which -- where we're moving into spaces we just haven't occupied. Tom just talked about now he's got mass spec unit. We've moved into laboratory automation. So I think we're doing better because we're moving into adjacent spaces, new products and gaining some share at the same time. I think it's more the adjacencies' international piece than share gain right now, but getting some on the margin.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to follow up on Derik's question just regarding the flu to make sure I understood it correctly. Last quarter, you guys said there was a 50-basis-point benefit in 1Q, which you characterize is going to be more of the pull-forward from the second quarter. And then I thought, if I understood you correctly, you said this quarter was a little bit better than what you had been expecting. So can you maybe just help us understand in this quarter what kind of flu was?","Suketu Upadhyay","Sure. So you're right, Kristen. Flu is worth about 50 bps in the first quarter. It was smaller in the second quarter, a little bit better than we expected. So when you think about -- when you look at the actual market dynamics, what happened, we clearly saw from the CDC a big drop-off in the second quarter. There was a bit of a spillover.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So it was small in the quarter. It wasn't a big driver, less than 50 bps. But where it was was in the physician's office with the new product.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So we should be thinking about underlying growth, the 4.1%, less the 100 from acquisitions and then kind of reducing -- further reducing for flu, which you say that given...","Vincent A. Forlenza","I wouldn't do that.","Operator","And there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to Vince Forlenza. Please go ahead.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So I thank all of you for your questions and your participation on the call. We were very pleased with our second quarter results. It was great communicating that to you. I'm very happy to raise our guidance for the year. I think that we're seeing strong growth as we communicated both on international, good performance from our acquisitions and our new products, which is driving that growth. We didn't talk a lot today about our operating effectiveness programs, but they remain on track, ReLoCo I and ReLoCo II, and we will continue to drive those programs going forward. And it was a pleasure to raise our guidance.","So we look forward to updating you on the balance of the year. Thank you very much.","Operator","This does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for using AT&T Teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thanks very much."],"3588":["Becton Dickinson and Co (NYSE:BDX) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call February  5, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Monique Dolecki - VP, IR","Vincent Forlenza - Chairman & CEO","Christopher Reidy - EVP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer","Simon Campion - EVP & President, Interventional Segment","Alberto Mas - EVP & President, Medical Segment","Patrick Kaltenbach - EVP & President, Life Sciences Segment","Thomas Polen - President & COO","Conference Call Participants","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Kristen Stewart - Barclays Bank","Robert Marcus - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates","William Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Matthew Taylor - UBS Investment Bank","Richard Newitter - SVB Leerink","Amit Hazan - Citigroup","Operator","Hello, and welcome to BD's First Fiscal Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through February 12, 2019, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 7064558. [Operator Instructions].","Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our first fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. ","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","As a reminder, to provide additional revenue visibility into the new BD, inclusive of Bard, we will speak to our fiscal 2019 first quarter revenue results and fiscal 2019 revenue guidance on a comparable currency-neutral basis. The comparable basis includes BD and Bard in the current and prior year periods and excludes intercompany revenues and revenues associated with divestitures as detailed in the financial schedules and our press release. Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, Executive Vice President and President of the Interventional segment; and Patrick Kaltenbach, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As many of you already know, in December, we celebrated the one year anniversary of the closing of the Bard transaction. Together with Bard, we accelerated our strategy to provide our customers and their patients with leading medical technologies and innovative solutions. We are extremely proud of our achievements over the past year. It is evident that the combination of BD and Bard is delivering value to our customers, patients and shareholders.","Turning to Slide 5 and our first quarter highlights. We are very pleased with the strong start to fiscal 2019. As we stated in our pre-announcement in mid-January, our first quarter results were ahead of our previous expectations, largely driven by the timing of certain tax items as well as better-than-expected performance across all three segments. Our results reflect continued momentum across our businesses and regions and strong margin expansion after a very strong Q4 in 2018. Our integration of Bard is on track, and we are continuing to realize cost and revenue synergies as expected. During the quarter, we held our first combined sales training meetings. In every region of the world, there was tremendous energy and excitement about the opportunity we have to make a difference in the lives of others. We are already seeing traction with our combined biosurgery and infection prevention sales force in Europe, which is evident in our financial results.","We are also making good progress integrating and simplifying our systems and processes, which delivers cost savings and helps associates work more efficiently. We are leveraging BD shared service centers and the infrastructure investments we made during the CareFusion integration by bringing legacy Bard associates onto our IT, finance and HR operating systems and technologies. We've also made progress with supply chain efficiencies and also with our real estate footprint, combining BD and Bard sites in several key locations, including our New Jersey headquarters.","Looking forward to the total year, we expect continued momentum and are reaffirming our fiscal 2019 revenue and EPS guidance.","I will now turn things over to Chris for more detailed discussion of our first quarter financial performance and our fiscal year 2019 guidance.","Christopher Reidy","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7, I'll review our first quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights. As Vince mentioned, we are off to a strong start in fiscal 2019. First quarter revenues grew 5.2% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. This includes a pricing decline of about 20 basis points, which was in line with our expectations.","First quarter revenue growth was driven by mid-single digit growth across all three segments. At the business unit level, there are some puts and takes, which are driven by year-over-year comparisons, along with timing within this fiscal year. When we adjust for these items, we still drove total company revenue growth of over 5% on an underlying basis. I'll provide more color on revenue growth in the quarter in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and geography. Adjusted EPS of $2.70 grew 8.9% or 14.9% on a currency-neutral basis. As we stated in our pre-announcement, this was ahead of our previous expectations, as the quarter benefited from some timing within the year related to certain tax items.","In addition, performance was better than expected across all three segments. We also continued to delever during the first quarter, paying down approximately $400 million of debt. As a result, our gross leverage ratio declined to 3.8x as of December 31. We continued to be on target to achieve our commitment to deleverage to below 3x over three years. Now moving on to Slide 8. I'll review our Medical segment revenue growth.","BD Medical first quarter revenues increased 5.2%. Revenues in Medication Delivery Solutions, or MDS, grew 2.9%, driven by strength in vascular assess and infusion disposables. Performance in MDS reflected tough comparison to the prior year in the U.S. Revenues in Medication Management Solutions, or MMS, grew 6.7%. Growth in MMS was driven by stronger-than-expected capital placements in infusion. Diabetes Care revenues grew 0.6%. Revenue growth was impacted by the timing of distributor orders in the U.S. and the timing of tenders in EMA. Orders that were anticipated to occur in the first quarter are now expected to occur over the second and third fiscal quarters.","Revenues in Pharmaceutical Systems grew 15.7%, driven by strong demand for core products and continued growth in SAIS. Performance also reflects the favorable timing of customer ordering patterns, which benefited the first quarter and is expected to negatively impact growth in the second quarter. Turning to Slide 9 and the BD Life Sciences segment. First quarter revenues increased 4.7%. This includes a headwind of approximately 50 basis points related to the strength of last year's flu season as expected. As you're aware, the timing and severity of the flu season can impact our year-over-year comparisons.","Revenues in Diagnostic Systems grew 2.7%. Performance was driven by our instrumented microbiology platforms, including blood culture and IDAST and our BD MAX molecular platform. Performance in Diagnostic Systems reflects a tough comparison to the prior year for Kiestra installations as well as a headwind of approximately 130 basis points related to the flu grow over. Preanalytical Systems revenues grew 7.6%. Growth was aided by recent capacity additions that have eased constraints on the supply of push-button collection sets as well as the timing of distributor orders.","Biosciences revenues grew 3.6%. Growth was driven by research reagents as well as growth in newer instruments, such as the FACSLyric. Performance in Biosciences reflects the unfavorable timing of tenders in EMA. Now turning to Slide 10 and the BD Interventional segment. First quarter revenues increased 5.7%. Revenues in Peripheral Intervention, or PI, grew 0.6% as we expected. This reflects a tough comparison to the prior year, which included sales related to a distribution agreement that has since ended.","On an underlying basis, growth remained strong and in line with our full year expectations. In terms of DCBs, performance was in line with our expectations, and we did not see a negative impact as a result of the paclitaxel study released in December. Performance in PI also reflects strong growth in oncology products, particularly in emerging markets and China. First quarter revenue growth in Surgery was 10%. This reflects a favorable comparison to the prior year related to Progel. We continue to receive a very positive response to Progel being reintroduced in the market. Performance in Surgery also reflects a favorable comparison to the prior year in our hernia business related to Hurricane Maria, which partially reverses in the second quarter. We're also pleased that our hernia business has regained almost all of its shared following the hurricane. Growth in the Surgery unit also includes strong performance in infection prevention in Europe, where we expanded our direct sales presence as part of our revenue synergy investment.","Revenues in Urology and Critical Care, or UCC, grew 7.3%. Performance in UCC was driven by new products in acute care urology as well as strength in our home care and targeted temperature management businesses. Now moving on to Slide 11. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter. U.S. revenues grew 6%. This is above our normal growth rate and primarily reflects strong growth in MMS and Pharmaceutical Systems within the BD Medical segment, Preanalytical Systems and BD Life Sciences segment, and Surgery and UCC in the BD Interventional segment as discussed previously. ","Moving on to international. Revenues grew 4.1%. Strong performance in Asia Pac and Latin America was partially offset by lower growth in Europe due to Kiestra and Pharmaceutical Systems order timing as well as a tough comparison to the prior year and timing of tenders in EMA as previously discussed. Developed market revenues grew 4.7%, driven by strong performance in the U.S. Revenues in emerging markets grew 7.8%. Performance was driven by growth of 13.3% in China and double-digit growth in Latin America, partially offset by EMA as previously discussed.","Growth in China reflects strength across the Life Science and Interventional segments as expected. Performance in the Medical segment in China was slightly ahead of our expectations due to the geography of orders in Pharmaceutical Systems. Turning to Slide 12, which recaps the first quarter income statement. As discussed, revenues grew 5.2% in the quarter on a comparable basis and 37.1% as reported.","Moving down the P&L. Gross profit improved during the quarter, increasing 42.8% year-over-year. I'll provide additional details on gross profit in just a moment. SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 25.7%, which reflects Bard's higher SSG&A spend profile, partially offset by the achievement of synergies. R&D as a percent of revenues was 6.1%, which reflects our continued commitment to invest in innovation. Operating margins increased 80 basis points or 170 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. We continued to deliver significant operating margin expansion, which reflects strong P&L leverage as the new BD.","Our tax rate was 11.2% in the quarter, which is significantly below our full year guidance range due to the timing of some discrete items. As expected, we paid preferred dividends of $38 million in the quarter. As we have been discussing, the preferred shares are not included in the shares outstanding calculation. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.70, which is an 8.9% increase versus the prior year or 14.9% [Technical Difficulty] basis. ","Now turning to Slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the first quarter. Gross profit margin was a strong 56.3% in the quarter. On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by 230 basis points. This reflects the inclusion of Bard's more robust gross margin profile as well as our continuous improvement initiatives, cost synergies and favorable mix. These items were partially offset by headwinds from raw materials and pricing. Currency had a negative impact of 90 basis points on gross profit margin as expected.","Operating margin grew 80 basis points in the quarter or 170 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Margin expansion was driven primarily by gross margin improvement combined with synergy capture. Currency had a negative impact of 90 basis points on operating margin in the quarter. I'll take you through our fiscal 2019 guidance over the next several slides, but while we're discussing margins, I'd like to point out that we continue to expect to deliver margin expansion of 100 to 150 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. This is in addition to significant margin expansion of approximately 750 basis points over the last 5 years.","Now moving on to Slide 15 and our full fiscal year 2019 guidance. As we discussed, while there are a number of moving pieces within the year, our underlying performance is strong, and we have reaffirmed our revenue guidance. We continue to expect total company revenue growth of 5% to 6% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. By segment, we expect BD Medical revenues to grow between 5% and 6%; BD Life Sciences to grow between 4% and 5%, which includes a headwind of approximately 90 basis points reflected to the flu -- related to the flu; and BD Interventional to grow between 6% and 7%. We continue to anticipate developed market growth of 4% to 5% and growth of about 10% in emerging markets, driven by a diversified base with low-double digit growth in China and strengthen in EMA and Latin America.","Now moving on to Slide 16 and our full fiscal year 2019 EPS guidance. We have also reaffirmed our adjusted EPS guidance. On the left side of the chart, you see that we continue to expect strong underlying growth, driven by revenue growth and robust operating performance as well as the benefit from a lower tax rate due, in part, to the achievement of tax synergies. Partially offsetting this growth, there are a number of headwinds. First, while the pressure from raw materials has eased slightly, we continue to expect a headwind of about 2%. In addition, we continue to expect an impact of about 1% from tariffs, which includes the postponement of the increase from the 10% rate to a 25% rate. We continue to work with our partners to minimize the unfavorable impact to the company going forward. ","Our guidance also continues to assume a normal flu season, in contrast to the severe flu in fiscal 2018, which results in a headwind of about 1% in fiscal 2019, the majority of which will occur in the second fiscal quarter. The divestiture of Advanced Bioprocessing at the beginning of fiscal 2019 and the annualization of the divestitures to merit Medical will also impact our EPS growth in fiscal 2019.","On a currency-neutral basis, our strong underlying performance is expected to drive adjusted EPS growth of 13% to 14% despite the pressure from headwinds and divestitures. Based on current rates, we continue to expect currency will be a sizable headwind of about 3.5% in fiscal 2019. This assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.14. All in, we continue to expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $12.05 to $12.15, which represents growth of approximately 10%.","Now from a phasing perspective, we continue to expect revenue and EPS growth to be weighted towards the back half of the year. And as a result, the timing of a few items within the year that are impacting growth, we are providing explicit guidance for the second fiscal quarter. Starting with the top line, we expect revenue growth to be below our full year guidance range by about 100 basis points, driven primarily by the flu comparison. On the bottom line, in addition to the unfavorable impact from raw materials and tariffs, we now expect the headwind from FX will be most pronounced in the second quarter due to profit and inventory. We also assume a tax rate at or above our full year guidance range. However, as we saw this quarter, the tax rate can fluctuate depending on a number of items, including the possibility of special items arising in the quarter. Based on these variables, we expect EPS to be between $2.50 and $2.60 in the second quarter. ","Now turning to Slide 17. The balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2019 remain unchanged. We continue to expect to achieve approximately $100 million in cost synergies in fiscal year 2019, and we're committed to fully realizing $300 million in annualized cost synergies over the three year deal period. We're excited about the momentum we have across our businesses and are confident that we will deliver on our commitments in fiscal year 2019 and beyond.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our product portfolio.","Vincent Forlenza","Thank you, Chris. Turning to Slide 19 and our planned product launches by segment. As you can see, on this slide, we have a rich pipeline of planned product launches in fiscal 2019 across our segments. There are a number of things we continue to be excited about. I'll touch on just a few of the recent launches here. Starting with the BD Medical segment. We recently launched two new cloud-based applications, BD HealthSight Data Manager and BD HealthSight Diversion Analytics. Both are part of the BD HealthSight platform that enables an enterprise-wide connected medication management system. The data manager application simplifies the management of drug formularies for customers by allowing for a consistent understanding of every drug's identity across all BD devices and customer sites.","The diversion analytics application is designed to help hospitals and health systems identify potential narcotic drug diversion through the use of augmented intelligence and integrated workflows. We are pleased with the strong customer interest in HealthSight, as the number of customer sites adopting the platform continues to accelerate. These newest applications are attracting even stronger demand and are already getting traction in the marketplace. Regarding our Type two Patch Pump, as expected, we submitted our regulatory approval applications for the U.S. and Europe and continue to anticipate our early access launch will occur late in calendar year 2019. We continue to be excited about bringing this differentiated solution to the market for people living with type 2 diabetes.","In the BD Life Science segment, we recently received U.S. FDA clearance of the BD Phoenix CPO Detect test and the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel. BD MAX continues to perform very well and drive growth in this segment, growing over 30% this past quarter. The BD Phoenix CPO Detect test expands BD's portfolio of solutions for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of infections caused by CPOs. CPOs or superbugs, as they're more commonly called, represent a prominent threat to public health because these dangerous microbes are often resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. This new test gives laboratories an accurate and cost-effective method to rapidly identify CPOs and support patient management and is another example of the company's commitment to providing solutions to help address the global burden of AMR.","With the approval of the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel, BD now offers a broad suite of solutions for the detection of intestinal conditions of bacterial, viral and parasitic origin in clinically relevant targeted panels. With this launch, BD suite of assays for diagnosing gastrointestinal conditions will provide clinicians with greater flexibility for more efficient and cost-effective patient management.","In the BD Interventional segment, as expected, WavelinQ, our solution that provides a minimally invasive nonsurgical option for creating critical AV fistulas for hemodialysis procedures, launched in the U.S. in the first quarter. We are pleased with the early results and feedback and look forward to introducing our next-generation product later in the year.","Regarding Lutonix BTK, as you are aware, the first releases of our IDE trial data for our Lutonix 014 Drug Coated Balloon with a below-the-knee indication were provided at the VIVA and VEITH meetings in late 2018. The data has been well received and continues to generate interest and excitement in the marketplace.","We have also continued to work with the FDA towards regulatory approval, and our projected time lines remain on track for commercialization by the end of fiscal year 2019. In addition to Lutonix BTK, we also continue to look forward to several new product launches later this year that will enhance growth in the interventional segment, including Venovo venous stent and Covera stent graft fistula indication. As you can see, we have a rich pipeline of new products across our businesses, and we look forward to sharing additional updates with you along the way.","Before I move on, I would like to remind you that we have again included a slide in the appendix of today's presentation that provides an update on our sustainability initiatives. We hope you find the information useful in understanding BD's commitment to this important topic.","Moving on to Slide 20. I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. We are very pleased with the strong start to fiscal year 2019. Our results reflect continued momentum across our businesses and regions, strong margin expansion and excellent execution by our BD associates. I want to thank all of our BD associates for their tremendous efforts on behalf of our customers, their patients and our shareholders. You've done an outstanding job.","The integration of Bard is on track, and we are confident in our ability to achieve our cost and revenue synergy commitments. New product innovation is continuing to fuel growth, and we are excited about the robust pipeline across our businesses.","In summary, we have a significant opportunity to deliver innovative health care solutions to our customers and their patients around the world. Looking forward, I am confident that we will deliver on our commitments in fiscal year 2019 and beyond. Thank you. We will now open our call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","I thought we could just start with the phasing throughout the year just trying to understand that a little bit better, first half versus second half. Is this any different than what you originally thought? And can you talk about your confidence on the acceleration that's needed? It looks like you have to do kind of mid- to high 6s in the back half of the year here to get to the midpoint of the revenue guidance. So can you talk about your confidence on the acceleration there and dig into the drivers a bit more, both on the top line as well as on the bottom line?","Vincent Forlenza","Yes. So I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Chris for some more detail. Yes, we feel good about it. This is how we expected the year to play out with the exception, of course, of the tax item that occurred in the fourth quarter. But if I go to operating results, this is pretty much what we thought would happen. Of course, we knew we had the large flu coming up that we had to jump over in the second quarter. We did a little better in the first quarter than expected as you heard in our remarks, but we always knew that the back end of the year, the second half of the year, we were going to see higher growth and accelerating EPS. And that's driven by actually all three segments and improving performance across each. There was a bunch of timing things that happened in the first quarter that Chris will walk you through, but you're going to see strong performance across all three segments, the phasing of the cost synergies in the second half and then FX turns around as well. So Chris, those are your high-level comments...","Christopher Reidy","Sure. And I think Vince covered most of the points. I think it is in line with what we expected, with a couple of adjustments in terms of timing for Q1 to Q2. So for example, the higher tax rate in Q2 is to be expected considering 11% tax rate in Q1. So there will be some catch-up there. FX will be a little bit worse in Q2 than we had originally expected, and we know there are some other offsets to that. But that will hit us mostly in the second quarter. And then Pharm Systems growing nearly 16% in the first quarter. There will be some bounce-back on that in the second quarter, but the first half of the year just about where we would have expected. In terms of the rest of the year ramping, we did expect that, and we're very confident in that. On the revenues side, we've got a lot of new product launches in the pipeline across the business. You've got WavelinQ product that we talked about from the TVA acquisition, Venovo, Covera and Lutonix 018 and even some BTK upside potential. Progel, as we said, is doing very well, and our reintroduction of that product is going very well. As you know, we have revenue synergies ramping in the back half of the year, and then on the P&L side, FX abates in the second half and you start getting the cost synergies ramping. And so all those things give us great confidence in the second half of the year, and we're very comfortable with the full year guidance. It is a little bit lumpy, and that's what we had expected.","Vincent Forlenza","Brian, just to add 1 or 2 more comments on the Life Science side. What you saw in the first quarter is a bunch of CD4 tenders that got shifted to later in the year, that's going to improve Life Sciences' growth. It also negatively impacted EMA in the first quarter. That's going to come back in the second part of the year as well. And then you saw some Kiestra timing that's going to help. So there's a whole bunch of things across the segments you're playing out that way. And then lastly on the Medical side, we're expecting continued strong growth in MMS as we do well, both in dispensing, but in -- particularly on the pump side of things. And Pharm Systems is going to continue to be strong for the year. It will be a lumpy next quarter, but then bounce back. So those are a whole bunch of things that are going on. And maybe, Alberto, you want to comment on what's happening in the pump space.","Alberto Mas","Yes, thanks. This is Alberto. Yes, we are feeling very pleased about the performance and very confident on the MMS side this quarter, in particular, and for the rest of the year. On the infusion side, we're seeing continued above-market growth. We do feel very confident that we are gaining category share in the infusion in the U.S. A lot of that has to do with great acceptance of our refreshed Alaris M2 pump with our complete focus on interoperability, where we are seeing now 350 live sites in interoperability, and that's not -- that is a very difficult operational thing to pull off as we know by experience, and I think we've dialed in the process. And we're expanding interoperability beyond Cerner and Epic to new platforms as well, Meditech and Allscripts. And the last element that, I think, is driving the business as well is what I would call more horizontal interoperability as we've put into play all our platforms, and our HealthSight Analytics platform that leverages all our platforms together, not only the pumps, but gives really a lot of visibility across the different platforms is really engaging our customers and providing us nice wins in the marketplace. So very pleased with the performance of that business.","Vincent Forlenza","Yes, thanks, Alberto, and of course, we grew 6.7% after we had such a strong quarter in the business. So last year, we were $50 million moved ahead and a bunch of that was pumps. So I think, overall, that should give you a good sense across the segments. Chris, do you have anything else you want to...","Christopher Reidy","No, I think that covers it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen","One question on emerging markets, one question on -- one follow-up question on MMS. So on emerging market, Vince, growth was 7.8% this quarter, little -- slightly softer versus recent quarters. The outlook is still 10% for fiscal 2019. Why the confidence there? And then just a follow-up on MMS, obviously, very strong this quarter after 23% growth in the U.S. in Q4. So maybe could you give us a little bit more color on share gain that you expect this year versus last year in pumps and Pyxis?","Vincent Forlenza","Yes, sure. I'll talk to emerging markets. Yes, we're confident in emerging markets and what you actually saw was a decrease in EMA, which was actually two things, a strong comp, but also these tenders which have moved from the first quarter into the second, third and fourth. And so we're going to see a very strong bounce-back in EMA. We have the orders. That's why I am so confident. It's a matter, of course, setting up the financing, which is something that takes a bit of time to do. So you look at that. Latin America was strong right at double digits and, of course, China was strong and did extremely well. So it was really just EMA, and it bounced back. We have visibility to do gives me the confidence. So I bet a little bit more on share gains and also how we're doing with Pyxis too. You've been talking about the pumps.","Alberto Mas","Yes. In terms of the category shares, it's very consistent with what we've said before, which is slightly accelerating share gains, more toward 200 basis points in infusion and closer to the 100 basis points on the Pyxis side, on dispensing side. And in dispensing and Pyxis, we really are supporting our core platform with a lot of new launches, Pyxis Logistics, Pyxis IV Prep for the pharmacy and Pyxis Supply as well that happened in the last quarter. So there's a lot of things, together with our overall platform. Again, HealthSight is the overall envelop, if you like, that really helps us in some of the conversion. So also a good performance on the Pyxis side.","Vincent Forlenza","Okay. Great. So you get a sense that our new business model that we've put in place a year ago is really working for us. And Larry, thanks for the questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Just two questions for me. Vince, I appreciate the comments on the peripheral business this morning. But given the investor focus there, it sounds like most of the momentum deceleration there is really the distributor dynamic. But maybe just sort of talk about your confidence in sustaining growth in that business prior to the BTK launch and why you're convinced that there's been no sort of clinical response to the recent paclitaxel toxicity concerns. And then maybe for Chris, maybe just a little bit more detail, I think, we think about the earnings dynamics for this year, you laid out a lot of headwinds and tailwinds. I guess, some of those headwinds in our mind look a little less significant, just given where you came in here in the first quarter, your confidence in the back half of the year. I guess, in our -- by our math, I think there could have been a little more upside to the earnings guide, potentially this early in the year, but you held your earnings guidance. But maybe just talk about the pacing of earnings and your confidence in that earnings number and the headwinds and tailwinds into the back half.","Vincent Forlenza","So Chris will talk first and then Simon will talk about the business question.","Christopher Reidy","Okay, sure. Thanks, David. So in terms of the headwinds, I would say that the headwinds for resin costs, as we said, are getting a little bit better, as is the tariffs. But both of those have to flow through the inventory. So you're really not picking up all that much this year. And we would expect that to be offset by a little bit worse on the FX side as you see the dollar continue to strengthen, not only against the euro. The $1.16 versus $1.14 metric there doesn't seem to be too much, but it's pretty much against every other currency around the world. And so that's a little bit worse. So on balance, that evens out. And in terms of the guidance, it's still very early in the year, and we still have the flu season, which is a big variable that we're watching as well. So it feels like the headwinds and tailwinds are balancing each other, and it's a bit early to call the flu season.","Vincent Forlenza","Okay. Simon?","Simon Campion","Good morning, David. Simon here. So just at a macro level, we do have a lot of confidence in our projections going forward for PI. We have several new product launches that are coming up, not least BTK, but also Venovo and the Covera Fisher indication. So we're coming in just where we thought for Q1, notwithstanding some of the comments that Chris made earlier on. So our confidence is high, as we move through the rest of the year. In relation to the paclitaxel study that came out in December, we didn't see any impact in December or in Q1 rather clearly, there's been a lot of talk about it. And I think you have noted that on January 17, FDA came out and said that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks and some customers that we'd seen moderate their behavior as a result of the paper have now turned back on as a result of that paper -- as a result of the publication. And in addition, we released data at link, we continue to work with regulatory agencies domestically and globally. And we continue to have data that supports our position that we have -- we do not have any safety concerns with any of our Lutonix products.","Vincent Forlenza","So I just wanted to add a little bit too on the 0.6%. So obviously, the takeaway is that it had nothing to do with the paclitaxel. It was a tough compare to last year. We had 11% growth and that is, as you refer to the Boston Scientific distribution agreement, which is now ended. Basically that was a loading of the channel that we have to jump over. There's also some timing when you're closing out the year with the transaction. Don't forget it was the last quarter for Bard and that's always a big quarter from a sales comp standpoint, so that made it a tougher compare as well. And there was even a little bit of drag from revenue recognition, we talk about that being immaterial at the BDX level, but it did have a data 100 basis points drag to the PI business. So a tough comp that had nothing to do with that paper, and we do expect that to be rebounding in Q2, the PI business. And we're still calling it to be high single digits for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on Swatch, on the insulin kind of patch technology, just in terms of how you expect to approach the market? Does this require you guys to build up a sales force or just kind of any color in terms of kind of market activities that you may be looking to do as this year progresses, and then I have a follow up request.","Vincent Forlenza","Yes, sure. I think Alberto is going to take that.","Alberto Mas","Yes. We're obviously in the process of defining that, as was mentioned before. The early access units will be available towards the end of the calendar year first quarter of next fiscal year. So we have some time to -- but we're beginning to -- it has to do with obviously, typical evidence generation, it has to do with engaging the payers, it has to do with what channels do we use, in what way do we use in each of the channels. And yes, some additional focus resources that will be paced with our sales and our revenue generation appropriately. So we are looking at all these factors. It's a little bit too early to define these things because -- but we've started the process, certainly in terms of engagement of outside parties. And we're still defining our own channel strategies in detail, so stay tuned on that.","Kristen Stewart","Will there be any clinical -- any of the clinical experience presented at ADA? Or any other meetings?","Alberto Mas","I don't think so, but maybe on follow up, we can define that better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins","So just two quick questions. And I apologize, if I missed this but just on the FX headwinds for the second quarter and really the first quarter. Can you just quantify the headwind to EPS that's implied in that Q2 guidance and then also what the specific EPS headwind was in Q1? Just so we can get a sense for the -- FX state in the first half versus the second half?","Vincent Forlenza","Sure. So as we had called out in the first quarter, there was about $0.15 of headwinds. We see that accelerating to about $0.22 in Q2. Again, the dollar's moved, strengthened a little bit. We have visibility into the profit and inventory coming through in the second quarter. And then the second half of the year, you basically lapped the strong dollar year-over-year, so those FX headwinds abate. So it's really a first half story but accelerating drag in the second quarter for about $0.22.","Robert Hopkins","Right. Okay, perfect. Makes for easy math in the back half. And then the other thing I just wanted to discuss really quickly on the MMS side was, obviously you had a fantastic last quarter and a strong quarter this quarter, but obviously very different growth rates from the low 20s down to where we are today. And I was wondering if you could just kind of help us understand the moving pieces driving those big swings and what the cadence looks like for the division over the course of the rest of the year.","Vincent Forlenza","Okay. So Alberto can talk to that.","Alberto Mas","Yes. This is Alberto. This -- most of the business on the infusion side is cash sales if you like as we sell the product. So it has to do a lot of with -- a lot of times when we place the instruments, when we install the instruments and that is defined by, obviously, the contracting process but also when the customer is ready for that implementation. So there's a bulk -- a bit of a bulky sales quarter-to-quarter, depending on the disposition of the customer to actually install the resources there, and we can't always control it -- the quarter-on-quarter. Obviously, that normalizes on a yearly basis. On the Pyxis side, most of that now is, given our trace methodology. 75% of that business is very predictable so there's less variability there. But 25% continues to be what we call cash business and that depends on what the timing of the contracts and installations and things like that so that's what's driving that. And we do have some visibility on these things, but ultimately it's when you schedule some of these installations and placements with the customer that drives the quarterly revenues. But we're -- we have some visibility obviously in the coming quarters, and we feel confident that overall, in the year, we'll have the expected results and if not -- we're confident about the overall results for the year.","Vincent Forlenza","Yes. And Bob, I would add that yes, we had 20% growth in the fourth quarter, which was particularly strong but that's really not indicative of what we would expect for the year. But having said that, MMS is very strong and a 6.7% growth rate in Q1, following up that pull forward of quarters into the fourth quarter is really very strong growth. We see that continuing in the second quarter as well with high single-digit growth. So clearly, MMS is growing very strong, it has got a lot of great momentum based on some of the things that Alberto has been talking about. So we really feel good about that part of the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Chris, I wanted to come back to the comment on fiscal 2Q EPS guidance. The [indiscernible] like -- more like $2.92 so clearly the FX dynamic, we miss modeled, you gave us the bottom line FX I think $0.20. Could you maybe go a little further up the pineal, and give us a little bit more detail on what the FX means for gross margin and net margin just so that we get the quarterly trend proper there?","Vincent Forlenza","Sure, let me go through each step. So obviously, we talked about revenue growth being down around 100 basis points from low end, so think about 4% and that's really primarily two big things. It's the tough flu compare of about 70 basis points and then you've got farm systems, which grew 16% in the first quarter and you know that's a lumpy business. So that moderates in the second quarter and that's a drag of about 50 basis points year-over-year. Then there's a bunch of other puts and takes in biosciences and a tough PI compare. Those kinds of things will be another 30 basis points or so. So about 150 basis points of drag on the topline that obviously flows down. Then you've got the drag on from FX, which is most pronounced in Q2 as we talked about and that will have a greater impact on the gross margin. You also got the rollout of some of the raw material and resin cost and tariff cost that we talked about, that really hit us more in the second quarter than it did in the first quarter. And then another point I'd make is on a year-over-year basis. We started to ramp the investments to get revenue synergies in the second half of last year and those are ramping, and we continue to spend that or make those investments. And so in the second quarter, the year-over-year impact is a headwind as well. Now it's positive in terms of those investments at driving revenue synergies that show up in the second half of the year, so there's unfavorable timing of spending on things like that. And then lastly, obviously you have the tax rate being 11% in the first quarter, and that's going to moderate somewhat to get to our 14% to 16% for the remainder of the year. You put all those things together. We didn't want anybody guessing. We put out the number of $2.50 to $2.60 just to get everybody aligned with that.","Isaac Ro","Really helpful. And then maybe Vince, a follow-up question for you on end markets, specifically China. If I look at the Life Science part of the franchise and listen to what your peers have had to say, it seems like the outlook there remains pretty healthy, anywhere from high singles to low double digits for the rest of the year. Can you just comment on what's baked into your expectations there and just kind of your visibility as to the pace of spend. We're obviously all looking at macro data points to try and get a sense of the economic effect as we enter 2020 and that region seems the most sensitive towards changing the cycle. So I appreciate your view.","Vincent Forlenza","Yes. Let me take you to the high level, and then I'll turn it over to Patrick to talk about Life Sciences in China, which is doing quite well. And so we actually had the leader of China in here about a week ago, and we see -- even though with the economic slowdown, we could see continued spending on health care and neither real change in the cost control mentality that was there a year ago. So kind of steady on that sense and not doing big capital projects building hospitals but they are funding continuing care. And so we had a good first quarter across all of our businesses. And as I mentioned, a little better on the medical side, including Life Sciences. And so as we look at, not just over the base, the rest of this year, but even in the next couple of years that seems to be the pattern that we're going to expect continued funding of the health care system. It drives stability in the country so that's the way we're looking at, that's where our China team is looking at. So Patrick, maybe you want to talk a little bit about Life Sciences and what you're seeing there.","Patrick Kaltenbach","Sure. I'm happy to. Yes, definitely -- I mean, if you look at Q1, we grew about 14.7 -- close to 15% in China. In Life Sciences, they've very, very strong underlying growth. And also, for the full year, we continue to project double-digit growth for sure. And as Vince said, there's a lot of investments, not only in health care, there's a lot of investment in pharma and also a lot of investment in life science research, where we played a lot of our B2B products. So we are very confident that the underlying growth and demand in China will continue for the remainder of the year and also next year. There's, as you know, the current five year plan in China really is focused on providing better health care to the population in China, and it will drive a lot of the underlying growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robert Marcus","Two for me. One, can you talk about where you stand in terms of sales and operational synergies with the Bard business? We've seen now a one plus one equals more than two from the combination. And then maybe just spend a minute on the Urology Business. One that was growing low single digits with Bard but since the deal it has been in the mid- to high single digits. Just help us understand what's going on there.","Vincent Forlenza","Sure. So first Tom will talk to you about the Bard synergies and where we're going with that and then Simon can talk about the really strong performance in the Urology.","Thomas Polen","Robbie, this is Tom. So I can touch base very briefly on, certainly, the cost synergies but that will really focus on the revenue synergies. Obviously, cost synergies are going as planned, as you've heard earlier, and we expect that to continue to ramp up through the back half of the year. I think, probably the more interest to you is on the revenue synergy side. And so as we think about that overall, we still expect Bard revenue synergies of about $250 million by FY '22 that's greater than the CareFusion revenue synergies of $150 million to $175 million by the end of this year, which is well on track. And of course, both of those are five year targets. So in FY '19, we see revenue synergies to be -- think about it in the 10s of bps. Relatively -- minimal to no profit impact in our EPS benefit in FY '19 because we're investing behind getting those initiatives. We started seeing EPS benefits of the revenue synergy starting next year, more meaningfully. So as you think about what the drivers of those are, as we've said in the past, we invested about $15 million in FY '18 towards revenue synergies. ","Most of those in selling, particularly around our vascular access portfolio, bring together the PICC, the midline, the catheter sales team as well as investing in a new surgery sales force in Europe. And so, the three areas that we've talked about historically on revenue synergies are all progressing to our plans. Those three are vascular access, where we've got the broadest portfolio of vascular access devices, again, from PICCs to central lines to catheters. And we've integrated our sales forces in the U.S. and Europe so that they're all selling now the entire portfolio. And we're seeing really positive customer feedback, again, we just did that this past summer. But as we look at our pipeline in those categories, I'd say it's certainly stronger than it ever has been, pre BD and Bard coming together. So we really feel good about the momentum there, and we expect some benefits in the back half of the year. Second on surgery, again, we've just put in -- also late last year, the biosurgery sales force in Europe, and we're seeing some early positive signs there.","So we're seeing infection prevention growth rate in Europe went up this past quarter. We're feeling good about the next quarter. And so that momentum is heading in the right direction. We put in -- just to know, we went from 0 to about 50 reps in biosurgery, in Europe, as part of that investment strategy, so it's a meaningful number. And then second -- I'm sorry, third was the geographic expansion. And so right there, we had talked that legacy Bard has invested heavily in China, and saw a strong growth there but had relatively limited penetration in Latin America, EMA, rest of Asia outside China. And so we've started registering -- I'm sorry, we started expanding the channels in some of those markets as well to get after some growth opportunities that we see. So I think that sums up hopefully on -- where we stand on synergies, but we feel good about it. And I'll turn it over to Simon to talk about Urology.","Vincent Forlenza","Maybe just before Simon starts, a little bit more data on the cost side. Chris?","Christopher Reidy","Sure. So just to kind of talk about the phasing a bit. As you know, we drove about $75 million of cost synergies last year, in fiscal year '18. We'll do a $100 million and the rest flow into another $100 million in the following year and then the last $25 million. So if you think about what we said, $300 million, essentially $100 million, $100 million, $100 million per year, but because we only had three quarters last year, some of that flows into '21. I would say that what we're seeing is great traction in terms of supply chain and procurement synergies. And as Vince had mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're really leveraging our platforms and the infrastructure investments that we made during the CareFusion integration, by bringing Bard on to our IT, Finance and HR operating systems. And then notably, some efficiencies in our real estate footprint, think of that as sales offices at this point, those kinds of things, as well as the headquarters here in New Jersey. So we've made good move in getting all the Bard associates up here to Franklin Lakes and closing down the Murray Hill facility, so good traction on all of those points. And then as we think through the remainder of the synergies, think distribution centers and manufacturing plant synergies, those kinds of things, continuing some of the infrastructure as well into '20. And -- so really feel good about the visibility that we have and the traction that we have on cost synergies.","Simon Campion","Robbie, its Simon here. Listen, as you know, in UCC, there are three legs to that stool: there's the acute Urology, there's targeted temperature management and there's home care. So across all three of those legs of that stool, we've seen great performance in Q1. Acute urology was driven by new products and TTM, and home care was driven I think, by a renewed focus. Particularly with home care, where we've identified several opportunities here, as a result of a review that we did last summer, as to how to accelerate the growth in that business and make it more meaningful. So as we look forward for the rest of the year, we've got high confidence in the UCC team to continue to deliver the growth rates that we've experienced so far.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Just maybe on the guidance here. Chris, if I understand what you're saying -- are you saying gross margins are going to be down sequentially and OpEx up just for us to get to that guide? And given your revenue commentary, some of it implies back half of 6%, but you do have tough comps back half. So I'm just trying to understand the back half cadence.","Christopher Reidy","Sure. So what you'll see is, in Q2, the gross margins, for example -- actually a slightly favorable year-over-year, but it should be around the 56% level and then those ramp considerably in the second half of the year and that flows down to operating margin as well. So you really get the pressure in the second quarter and then as synergies and continuous improvement and FX abates in the second half, we see that building. So think about the low end of -- below the guidance range of 56.5% to 57.5% on gross margin, kind of in that 56% range in the second quarter. And so there is a bit of lumpiness but strong rebound in the second half.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Quick one for Chris, just curious if you could quantify the impact of that tender timing, whether it's in Life Sciences or biosciences, either one in the first quarter?","Christopher Reidy","So this is -- in EMA, I think you're referring to, and it is a big drag in the first quarter. It rebounds considerably for the remainder of the year and that is Biosciences. It's in a little bit in other areas as well, Diabetes Care, we referred to in our prepared remarks. So primarily, in those areas. And as we talked about, if you look at the emerging market growth of 7.8%, you've got China growing over 13%, you've got a double-digit on Latin America. So you can see EMA was a significant drag to get you down to 7.8% and that's just a timing of orders. And as Vince said, we have the orders in hand, we feel we're confident that, that bounces back for the remainder of the year. And we close out EMA for the full year with a double-digit growth rate. So just an anomaly in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Lawrence Keusch","Chris, just on the synergies, again, the cost synergies. Clearly get the sense that they are built through the year, but cause again, just help us think about that second half. Is this really more of a fourth quarter event? Or do you start to see some rebound in the third quarter? And then also just, Vince, any quick comments on just sort of the environment in Europe as a whole?","Christopher Reidy","Yes. So Larry, you do see it's starting in the third quarter, so think there and fourth quarter, probably a little bit more in the fourth quarter than the third quarter but still very strong in the third quarter as well.","Vincent Forlenza","And the environment in Europe, I would call it stable from our business standpoint, we really didn't see any major changes in demand or pricing or anything.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William Quirk","Two quick ones for me. Vince and Tom, I know, you don't break it out anymore, but any comment on safety adoption and some of the major geographies and I'm thinking specifically kind of emerging markets in Europe? And then, secondly, Patrick, just a comment regarding the reimbursement shifts in infectious disease panel. You guys are obviously doing very, very well in that space, and it looks like that it may get more attractive as some of the prior payers follow CMS.","Vincent Forlenza","So on safety, Alberto, you going to take that?","Alberto Mas","Yes. On the health care worker safety, which is some of our traditional like year, I think obviously in the U.S. that is mostly behind us. In Europe, the big push is there's still more to do, but I think, it'll be a slow, a slow gain in terms of the penetration safety. The big push also is probably behind us, but there'll be steady growth there. And the opportunity still remains in the emerging markets as the standards of livings and the availability of funds happen, there will be -- it'll be adopted more. So that's probably where the upside to it is. We're also not pivoting more to patient safety, a more comprehensive view of safety, and I think there, we're seeing -- we're putting in place some pilots that really can -- we think that can begin to move the needle beyond just the health care worker's safety and more centered around the patient. And there's this other components like a hazardous drug safety as well, which is related then also to more health care. But it's not from a needles and syringes and catheter perspective, but more protecting the pharmacist doing the preps against oncology-type drugs that are hazardous to health.","Vincent Forlenza","Yes. Just to support what Alberto was saying. You step back and you look at our safety, how we're focused in safety, remember, once we've done, we did the Bard transaction, we now cover 75% of the HAIs. And so as Alberto was indicating, we have a broad infection prevention program, that is more of the growth driver than a needlestick safety at this point in time, and we think that's where the real legs are.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Frederick Wise","Chris, maybe just picking up on your early comments about the accelerated debt paydown. I think you said, you paid down over $400 million in the quarter. I mean, clearly, you're on track to get below three, but just remind us why you need to get below three, it sounds like the debt paydown could even accelerate as the year unfolds and maybe evolving use or cash priorities or balance sheet priorities or options over the next 12 to 18 months as you get toward obviously a very much delevered position? Congrats on all that.","Christopher Reidy","Thank you. Well, we did pay down $400 million in Q1, and we paid down $1.6 billion since the transaction closed. And we're down to 3.8x leverage at this point on a path to 3x leverage by December of 2020, and you can think about that as ratable. So you mentioned accelerated, this is pretty much in line with what we had anticipated. Now when we committed to 3x leverage, we also left ourselves some room to do tuck-in acquisitions and to continue to invest in the business. And so we've continued to do that. You saw the TVA Medical acquisition as an example of that. So we're not feeling constrained in terms of doing tuck-in acquisitions. And I think it's important that we get back to our commitment levels because when you flex your leverage like that, you're committing to the rating agencies that you're coming back to a more normal leverage level. And we did that on CareFusion, we got back down to the 3x leverage. And so we're very focused on living to that commitment again, and well on our way to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.","Matthew Taylor","I wanted to ask one about Medication Management Solutions. You continue to do well and you've talked about above-market growth there for infusion and Pyxis seems to be doing well as well. So with the new HealthSight platform and with this outperformance that you've driven now for years, I was hoping you could give us an understanding of how long you think you can drive the above market performance? Where are the enhancements that we could see going forward? And where are you gaining share from? Is it new sites or you're actually taking competitive share?","Alberto Mas","Well, I'll start -- this is the Alberto. And I'll start with the last portion of the question. I think there's two aspects to that. One is that we're expanding the market with new capabilities and HealthSight is an example of that, that we're not there before, and we're doing that fairly uniquely. So that obviously affects our share of the other part, if you like. And then we -- in terms of what the visibility that we have, we think that the current environment and competitive environment will continue in the sense that we anticipate to continue to do that in the foreseeable future. Beyond that, it's more difficult to say, but we could continue to invest in our platforms, in our capabilities and mostly, this comes as better as one. All our platforms are unified in terms of the tax stack, in terms of the analytics and we think that's a big, big driver in the medium term and the long term.","Thomas Polen","Matt, this is Tom. Maybe just to compliment Alberto's comments. So we don't comment on specific competitors by, let's say, we were taking share across most everyone in both the pump-end and the dispensing space at this point. And so we do feel good about that momentum and as you've heard from Alberto as well, we've been continually shifting since BD and CareFusion came together. We certainly continue to invest in the platform itself, let's call it the hardware, which has been traditionally, where a lot of investments are gone. We do have and we've recently released NexGen pump, of course, with the M2. We've got NexGen pumps beyond that as well deep in our -- deep and well underway in our pipeline. And we have the same thing for Pyxis, of course, we launched Pyxis ES, we have got NexGen versions also in our pipeline as well. But we have very purposely shifted a chunk of that investment increasingly into the software solutions. And you saw that with HealthSight, you saw that with the narcotic division, analytics, et cetera. And we see that's -- right when customers look at our solutions versus what may be available from others in the marketplace, it's that software connectivity across the platforms that really allows someone to manage the medication management process in a unique way that we think, we become a very preferred and unique offering in the marketplace because of the solutions that we've been able to bring together. That's in the hardware, but through the software that connects everything and eliminates the inefficiencies in the process and eliminates the opportunities for medication errors in a way that, again, is very unique in the marketplace.","Alberto Mas","This is Alberto, I just compliment one data point to give you a sense of how HealthSight is getting traction. HealthSight Viewer which is something that we -- it's a product that we launched in fiscal '18, already has over 140 sites that are live, for example. There's obviously some others like Diversion, and we've been through optimizations and a little bit too early to say, we do certainly see some contracts flowing through but the 140 sites for HealthSight Viewer are live.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SEB Leerink.","Richard Newitter","Just a follow up on MMS. With respect to the capital spend environment in the U.S., we've seen number of competitors and companies in the space that have put up some strong capital numbers. The environment seems pretty robust and they're like also -- I would imagine just confusion for some of your confidence in the outlook for this division. So I guess, how much of the robust outlook is underlying capital investment? We're already in the cycle under review and again, how much of a lift or the optimistic outlook is underlying spend versus the market share gain that you can allude to that?","Vincent Forlenza","I think there's a couple of things going on here. One is hospitals in terms of capital spending are doing well, and we don't see any significant change in that in the short run. The other thing that's going on is that, we've seen remarkable concentration of our customer base and starting to see a shift in governance. And let me call it improved governance across large systems. And as that happens, they want the standardize care, they want to standardize their systems, and I think what you're seeing is, early on in that conversion with that mentality, in the marketplace and the kind of approach that we are taking with HealthSight, and the informatics tying us across the entire system. Alberto just gave you a quick update on the fact -- the number of accounts and whatnot, we think we're very early on in that story and the winners in the marketplace are going to have to run that way.","Thomas Polen","And this is Tom. And maybe just one other comment as well just to keep in perspective. Obviously, we get very focused on what's happening in the U.S. with the Pyxis and Alaris and the software solutions we've talked about. But I would say that we're also getting strong performance in the other areas of MMS as well and that includes our CME acquisition that we did the other year, which is for the alternate site home infusion market, primarily outside of the U.S. And also our roll-up platform, which is for retail pharmacy dispensing. We've begun having some sales in the U.S., but that's still as primarily an ex-U.S. business, and it's also growing very nicely double digits. And it's getting of increasing size because we've been growing it double digits for the last few years. So areas we don't speak as much about, but certainly are helping to fill the MMS growth rate as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Citigroup.","Amit Hazan","I want to come back to the interventional and peripheral segment, and just ask it looks regionally that the slowdown was both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. So just a clarification, if you can help us understand if in the Boston Scientific distribution agreement impacted both regions and then, just given the focus on DCBs here, a little bit increased focus. If you can just give us a reminder of how DCBs grew in your fiscal '18 and what you expect for fiscal '19 for DCB growth?","Thomas Polen","So Amit, this is Thomas. So with respect to outside the U.S. we -- as Chris said earlier on to -- there were some tender issues here in Q1 on a global basis that we're coming back from in Q2 and beyond. And with respect to DCBs, across the board, we expect mid- to high single-digit growth in DCBs across the SFA and AV platforms. But I think it's very important that we don't isolate the DCBs when we have a full complement of solutions. So DCBs, PTAs stent grafts, we have the whole bag whether it's SFA intervention or AV intervention. So to focus on one aspect of that is not doing the kind of the leadership of the position that we've worked out to generate any favor. So we look at it as a total solution here.","Vincent Forlenza","And so great new products coming out there. Thanks, thanks for the question.","Operator","And presenters, there are no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks?","Vincent Forlenza","Yes, thank you very much, and thanks to everyone for their questions and a really great dialogue. So let me just go -- move my closing remarks. In December, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of the closing of the Bard transactions, and I have to say, we're really proud of our achievements over the past year as a combined company. It's just off to a great start. Secondly, fiscal 2019 is off to a strong start with continued momentum across our businesses and regions after a strong finish to the year in '18 and looking ahead, I'm confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitments. So thank you very much. We look forward to updating you next time.","Christopher Reidy","Thanks, everyone.","Vincent Forlenza","Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions].","Beginning today's call is Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at BD.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our first fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedule is posted on the BD.com website.","The first quarter comparable revenue growth rate and fiscal 2017 comparable revenue guidance provided today excludes the revenues of divestitures, most notably the respiratory solutions business that was divested in October of 2016 just after our 2016 fiscal year end.

Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Administration; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical Segment; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences Segment. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vince Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone and Happy Groundhog Day. Let\u2019s get started on slide 4, most of you participating on today\u2019s call attended our analyst day back in November and more recently the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference. At these events you heard us detail our strategy for sustainable growth with a pathway to a target of 5% plus revenue growth and 10% plus earnings growth. ","At analyst day, you were also able to see first-hand, many of the exciting products and solutions that we believe will help us drive more sustainable healthcare globally. As we partner with healthcare systems to address their key priorities, we are broadening our served markets through our focus on major healthcare challenges, where we believe we can have the greatest impact. ","To achieve our objectives, we laid out a comprehensive plan centered on three key components. First, it\u2019s the broad array of new products that we are either launching now or we plan to launch over the next two years. Second, it\u2019s our move to solutions. As we do that and move in to adjacencies, we are becoming more impactful across our businesses on these major healthcare issues. ","And third, is our geographic expansion including revenue centered synergies from CareFusion. I\u2019m pleased to say that we\u2019re on track with that plan that we laid and we are off to a strong start in fiscal year 2017. ","Moving to the first quarter highlights, performance from both the medical and life science segments contributed to revenue growth that was ahead of our initial expectations. Our results this quarter continued to demonstrate the benefit of our diverse product and geographic portfolio. We continue to drive strong underlying margin expansion with the achievement of synergies, operational efficiencies and continuous improvement. ","Looking forward to the total year, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 currency-neutral revenue guidance. Our first quarter performance along with our current outlook for the total year, gives us confidence to raise our currency neutral EPS guidance. Since we provided guidance in November, the dollar has strengthened broadly relative to the euro and other currencies and a negative impact from foreign exchange is now more pronounced. ","Chris will give you more details on this in just a moment. In summary, we are delighted with our strong start to fiscal year 2017 and are confident in our outlook for the full fiscal year. I\u2019ll now turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2017 guidance. ","Chris Reidy","Thanks Vince and good morning everyone. As Vince said we are off to an excellent start to fiscal year 2017. Moving on to slide 6, I\u2019ll review our first quarter revenue on EPS results, which I will speak on a currency-neutral basis. Total first quarter revenues of approximately $2.9 billion grew 6.1% on a comparable basis which was ahead of our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $2.33 also exceeded our expectations, growing at 19.4% over the prior year. ","EPS growth was driven by revenue outperformance, coupled with strong operating performance. We are also pleased that we have continued to de-lever as we reduce the debt associated with the acquisition of CareFusion. ","During the first quarter, we paid down a $500 million debt maturity and are currently at approximately 3.1 times gross leverage. We remain on track to achieve our commitment 3.0 times gross leverage by March of this year. ","Looking forward to the total year as Vince mentioned, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 currency neutral revenue guidance. Our first quarter performance along with our current outlook for the total year gives us confidence to raise our currency neutral EPS guidance to a range of $9.70 to $9.80, which represents growth of 13% to 14%. ","Since we\u2019ve provided guidance in November, the dollar has strengthened broadly relative to the euro and other currencies and a negative impact from foreign exchange is now more pronounced. We expect to be able offset about half of the increased currency pressure and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.35 to $9.45 which represents growth of 9% to 10%. ","Moving on to slide 7, I will review our revenue growth by segment on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Performance from both segments drew first quarter revenue growth of 6.1% which was ahead of our initial expectations. Growth was positively impacted by the timing of certain revenues that occurred in the first quarter, which we originally anticipated would occur later in the fiscal year. I\u2019ll discuss this as I take you through the business results. ","Adjusting for these timing related items, revenue growth was in line with our full year guidance range of 4.5% to 5%, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. In the quarter, pricing was about flat. ","Moving on to revenue growth by segment, BD Medical first quarter revenues increased 7.5%. Medication and Procedural Solutions or MPS growth was 4.3%, which reflects strength in Flush and continued growth in infection prevention. Revenue growth in Medication Management Solutions or MMS of 11% was driven by capital installation in both dispensing and infusion. ","Growth was positively impacted by increased installation efficiency and the timing of placements that occurred in the first fiscal quarter earlier than originally anticipated. Diabetes care grew 4.5%; this reflects strength in pen needles which was aided by the timing of customer orders in the US, which occurred in the first quarter earlier than initially anticipated. ","Pharmaceutical systems growth of 15.5% was driven by strong performance in Europe, which was favorably impacted by the timing of customer orders that occurred earlier than anticipated. In addition, we experienced continued strength in our self-injection platform. ","Adjusting for the timing related items, BD Medical revenue growth in the first quarter was at the high end of our full year guidance range. BD Life Sciences first quarter revenues increased 3.2%. Growth was driven by performance in pre-analytical systems and diagnostic systems. Biosciences revenue declined slightly as growth from favorable customer ordering patterns and advanced bioprocessing and strength and research instrument sales in the United States was offset by a difficult comparison for the prior year and other geographies. ","Revenues in diagnostic systems grew 6.4%; this reflects continued strength in core microbiology including Kiestra, BD Max and an increase in flu-related sales. Pre-analytical systems growth of 4.2% was driven by safety engineered products, primarily in emerging markets. ","Moving on to slide 8, I\u2019ll walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter on a comparable currency neutral basis. US growth was very strong at 5.5%. This was comprised of BD Medical growing 6.5% and BD Life Sciences growing at 2.8%. ","Performance at BD Medical reflects strong growth in capital placements in our dispensing and infusion businesses in MMS and a wide range of infusion disposable products in our MPS business. Growth was also driven by our diabetes care business. BD Medical growth in the US was aided in part by the timing of capital installation in MMS and customer ordering patterns in diabetes care as previously mentioned. ","BD Life Sciences growth reflect strong performance in our Biosciences business, driven by favorable customer ordering patterns in our advanced bioprocessing business and sales of research instruments and reagents. ","Growth in our US diagnostics business was driven by core microbiology including Kiestra and an increase in flu related sales. Revenues in (inaudible) medical system declined slightly due to limited US availability in one of our product lines. ","Moving on to international, revenues grew 6.8%. Medical segment grew 9.1%. Growth was driven by our pharmaceutical systems business which was favorably impacted by the timing of customer orders as previously mentioned and performance from infusion disposable and infection prevention products in the MPS business. Capital installation in our dispensing in MMS also contributed to growth in the quarter. ","Growth in the Life Science segment was 3.5% driven by sales of safety engineered products in emerging markets, as well as strength in Latin America and Asia Pac in diagnostic systems, which included a favorable comparison the prior year in China. ","An increase in flu-related sales also contributed to growth in diagnostic systems. Biosciences revenues declined due to a difficult comparison to the prior year, related to instrument sales in certain geographies. ","On slide 9, developed market revenues grew a strong 5.8% and emerging markets grew 7.7%. The first quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects a strong performance in China and Latin America, partially offsetting this growth are declines in the Middle East and in our Biosciences business in Africa, as we anticipated and communicated in our last quarters\u2019 earnings call. And Middle and Africa had a negative impact of approximately 200 basis points on growth in the quarter. Excluding these regions emerging markets grew approximately 10%. ","China growth for the first quarter was in line with our expectations at 9.1%. Revenue growth was driven by capital equipment purchases and higher reagent sales and diagnostic systems, as well as continued strong demand for consumables in both segments. Growth was partially offset by a difficult comparison to the prior year in Biosciences as expected. ","For the total year, we continue to expect China to grow in the low double-digit range. We continue to anticipate emerging markets growth of high single digits. ","Now moving on to global safety on slide 10, currency neutral sales increased 4%. Safety revenues in the US grew 1.6%. This is below our normal growth rate and reflects a decline in pre-analytical systems as previously mentioned. International sales grew 7.6% currency-neutral, driven by strength across emerging markets, which grew 18.1%. ","Medical safety sales grew 3.7%, driven infusion disposables and diabetes care. This growth was partially offset by a decline in the Middle East as anticipated and a tough comparison to the prior year and Asia-Pac. Life Sciences safety sales which are driven by our pre-analytical systems unit grew 4.4% in the quarter, as strong growth across emerging markets more than offset developed market revenues that were about flat. ","Slide 11 recaps the first quarter income statement and highlights our currency neutral results. As discussed, revenues grew a strong 6.1% in the quarter on a comparable currency-neutral basis. ","As we move down the P&L, I\u2019d like to point out that our result from the prior year include the respiratory solutions business, while the current period does not, as the business was divested in October 2016. BD\u2019s ownership interest in the Vyaire joint venture will be recorded with another income beginning in our second fiscal quarter. ","Gross profit was strong growing 1.7% despite the loss of gross profit related to the Respiratory Solutions business. On a comparable basis, gross profit would have grown in excess of revenue growth as the divestiture of respiratory business resulted in an estimated 6% headwind to gross profit growth. I\u2019ll provide more details on gross profit in just a moment. ","SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.3%; we\u2019re very pleased with the continued leverage we\u2019re getting in SSG&A. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.2% as we continue to invest in innovation to drive future growth. Operating income grew 9.8% reflecting strong P&L leverage. ","Our tax rate declined to 17% in the quarter, which is in line with our full year expectation of 17% to 19%. In the quarter adjusted earnings per share were $2.33. This represents a 19.4% increase versus the prior year which is very strong growth even after the dilution impact from respiratory solutions. The impact of currency in the quarter was a headwind to EPS of about one penny. ","Turning to slide 12 in our gross profit and operating margins for the first quarter. As we just discussed, the impact of currency was not meaningful in the first quarter though we do expect currency headwinds for the balance of the year. ","On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by a 190 basis points. This growth was driven by a continuous improvement initiatives, cost synergies and favorable mix, which includes the positive impact of divestitures. ","On an operating margin basis, we are extremely pleased to have delivered about 250 basis points of margin expansion, as we continue to drive cost synergies. In addition, margin expansion was positively impacted by the divestiture of the respiratory solutions business. ","Moving on to slide 14, our strong performance in the first quarter and our full year outlet, gives us the confidence to raise our currency neutral adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2017 by 1 percentage point to a range of 970 to 980. ","Offsetting this increase performance, our incremental currency headwinds of approximately 2 percentage points that resulted from the US dollar strengthening relative to the euro and other currencies since we\u2019ve provided guidance in November. ","Our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.06. On an adjusted basis, we expect to achieve of $9.35 to $9.45, which represents growth of 9% to 10%, which as a reminder include dilution of approximately 1.5% from the respiratory divestiture. ","Turning to slide 15, I\u2019d like to walk you through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year of 2017. We continue to expect total company revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a comparable currency neutral basis with growth of 4.5% to 5% in BD Medical and 4% to 5% in Life Sciences. Based on our current view of the environment, we continue to expect a small amount of pricing pressure for the year. ","As a result of our strong first quarter performance and outlook for the year, we now expect underlying operating margin to improve by 200 basis points to 225 basis points. This excludes the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and also excludes slight pension headwinds. Beyond revenues, EPS and underlying operating margin, all other P&L guidance from November remains unchanged. ","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio. ","Vince Forlenza","Thank you Chris. Moving on to slide 17, I\u2019ll walk you through updates on new product innovation and strategic and business initiatives, starting with a few quick updates in our recent product launches. Some of you already know that as part of our pilot launch, we temporarily paused shipments for our insulin infusion sets. The customers who have already received the product have been told they can continue to use it. ","During our initial pilot, we received a moderately higher than anticipated rate of complaints associated with insertion. If you recall, we initiated a limited launch to gather customer insights prior to broad commercialization and to detect opportunities for improvements like this. These early learning\u2019s which are not unusual are invaluable to ensure that patients ultimately realize the full benefits of BD FlowSmart technology. ","We are continuing to work closely with Medtronic towards full commercialization. In Life Sciences, we have received very positive feedback from customers on our Barricor blood collection tubes since launching in September this past year. ","We\u2019re also pleased that we continue to see strong growth in BD Max across our portfolio of assays including CT, GCTV and our extended Enteric Bacterial Panel in Europe, both of which launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Our menu expansion continued in the first quarter with a MAX vaginal assay launch in the US. The vaginitus panel is the first FDA cleared PCR based panel in the US. ","We have over a dozen accounts in various stages of validating the new assay. We also anticipate the launch of extended Enteric Bacterial Panel in the US later this fiscal year. ","Moving on to our more recent new product launches, within our medical business, we recently launched the BD Neopak 2.25 ml pre-filled glass syringe. This syringe is specifically designed for high value and sensitive biologic drugs that require higher quality levels and performance. This new syringe enables the development of drug-syringe combination products with extended injection intervals which will provide patients with more time between injections and decrease the frequency of injections. ","Within our Life Science business, we recently announced the commercial availability of the new BD Precise WTA kits that provide an easier method to identify and quantify genetic information in individual cells for genomic based research. These kits provide researchers with more accurate and easy to use genomic tools to enable more efficient identification of genetic markers for disease.","The combination of our reagents, sales orders and data analytics enables BD to support researchers from sample preparation to any data analysis. We\u2019re also pleased that BD was recently named the 2016 Top Global Innovator by Clarivate Analytics, a distinction that honors the most innovative corporations and institutions in the world. ","Within strategic and business initiatives, we\u2019re pleased with the successful launch of Vyaire Medical, a respiratory solutions joint venture. Vyaire will enable more strategic focus and investment to build a leading global respiratory company. We\u2019re also pleased that we continue to make strong progress achieving revenue synergies related to CareFusion. We now have over 160 product registrations either approved or in process. ","Moving on to our business update on slide 18; we continue to make progress with our cross synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the first quarter. We are pleased to have implemented a new global HR and payroll systems in January. We also remained focused on ongoing supply chain optimization in our distribution centers. ","Our manufacturing related synergies remain on track and we continue to expect a majority of these to be achieved in the later part of our deal of Horizon. We continue to expect 325 million to 350 million in total cost synergies related to the CareFusion acquisition, as we exit fiscal year 2018. ","Starting with operating margin expansion, we have driven significant operating margin expansion on a multi-year trajectory. Starting with fiscal year 2015, we delivered 100 basis points of operating margin expansion followed by another 200 basis points in fiscal year 2016. ","In fiscal year 2017, we expect to deliver another 200 basis points to 225 basis points of margin improvement. The consistent performance of our business, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture is driving continued, underlying operating margin expansion, which will result in over 500 basis points of cumulative margin expansion over the three year period. ","Moving on to slide 19, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, we remain on track with a comprehensive plan we laid out at our recent analyst day and we are very pleased with our strong start to fiscal year 2017. Second, both segments performed ahead of our initial expectations and our results highlight the benefit of our diverse portfolio, both from a product and a geographic standpoint. Third, operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture are generating significant operating margin improvement, as evidenced by our increased guidance for the total year. ","Finally, we are confident in our outlook for the full fiscal year and our ability to drive currency neutral revenue and earnings growth. We remain very optimistic about BD\u2019s prospect for the future and our ability to continue to drive shareholder returns. ","Thank you, we will now open the call to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. ","David Lewis","Vince and Chris, I wonder if we could just start with the outlook for the year. I think there\u2019s two elements people are focused on, your strong first quarter revenues, but maintaining currency neutral revenue guidance and lowering earnings by $0.10 despite much stronger quarter, better underlying margin strength. So can you walk us through these two dynamics and your confidence in the remainder of the year? Thank you ","Vince Forlenza","So I\u2019ll start-off David. From a revenue standpoint, we are delighted with the start that we had and we feel very good about the outlook for the year. We just thought it was a little early to take up the revenue guidance. Now looking at the underlying markets, they do seem to have stabilized, so we\u2019re feeling good about that. ","We just think that from a much broader perspective we are in to an uncertain environment. So, it was the first quarter, we feel good about it, we have confidence in the year, and we\u2019ll come back in the second quarter and take another look. ","Now in terms of the impact of currency and what now, I\u2019ll turn that over to Chris. ","Chris Reidy","So looking at our EPS guidance, we feel really good about the performance in the first quarter as well, and we think a portion of that is going to flow through to the year. As you see we raised the FX and guidance which is what we control and we feel really good about where that stands. We don\u2019t control the currency. Now we did do all of this based on a 30 day average which is what we\u2019ve always done and that was $1.06.","As you saw over the last couple of days, it\u2019s moved up to a $1.08. It\u2019s been very volatile, we haven\u2019t adjusted for that so clearly there\u2019s some upside effect continues and it would be a pleasant surprise to see currency finally moving in the other direction and being at our back instead of in our face. ","So, our guidance does not take that in to consideration, because whatever it is its going to flow through. So we feel good about the fact that we raised the FX and guidance and then currency is going to be what currency is and we\u2019ll walk through that as we go forward, as we it settle out. But wasn\u2019t too long ago that people thought the dollar was going to go to parity, now it seems to be heading the other direction. Who knows, we hope for the best.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with JP Morgan. ","Andrew Hanover","Hey this is Andrew Hanover in for Mike, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on that specific question just to understand the cadence based on what guidance is today. And obviously you had the one-time items in this quarter that were pulled further, came in earlier than expected. But anything that would change what you were expecting for the rest of the year, and how should we think about the cadence for the second to fourth quarter? And the as a follow-up I just wanted to get an idea on the status of the Barricor launch and how that is going?","Chris Reidy","On the first piece of that I would say, clearly ahead of expectations in the first quarter. If you remember we said that going to have a little bit more of a difficulty comparing the first quarter primarily because they grow over in the Middle Eastern and Africa. Middle East was about what we expect; Africa was just actually a little bit better because of the timing of some contracts. ","But clearly we blew that 4% kind of guidance in the first quarter out of the water. I\u2019d say about two-thirds of the revenue over achievement was timing related. You can look at pharm systems growing 15.5%, that\u2019s a lumpy business, it\u2019s not a 15% grower, but it\u2019s a good grower, but it\u2019s mostly timing or a chunk of that is timing. So we about two-thirds, one-third breakout at this point. ","So clearly revenue is moving up in the range, and as Vince said it\u2019s a little bit up early in the year we still have things like flu ahead of us, it\u2019s still not clear where that\u2019s going to go, although it\u2019s somewhat encouraging but that could turn on a dime. So we\u2019ll see where that goes, pricing is still a bit ahead of us. ","So it\u2019s early in the year, but clearly feel a lot better about our revenue guidance and a lot more confident in that guidance range. So we\u2019ll see how it goes, but we\u2019re off to a great start.","Andrew Hanover","And for Barricor?","Alberto Mas","Yes, as Vince mentioned we do feel very positive about the feedback that we\u2019re getting from our customers. We\u2019ve seen some early wins around 30 accounts have now converted to Barricor. We have a healthy pipeline of just over 150 accounts; they are validating and evaluating the product. It is a product that takes quite a long time to validate between three and five months. So although all the signs are positive, this is going to be a slow conversion process that we\u2019re going to see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair. ","Brian Weinstein","Just coming back in to FX a little bit, last year you guys were very successful at offsetting all of the FX headwind that you had. It sounds like you\u2019re thinking you can offset about 50% of them this year. Can you be a little more specific on where you\u2019re able to offset those FX headwinds this year and did you sort of fully exhaust some of those options last year. And I guess as part of that, can you just talk about where we are specifically in the 325 million to 350 million in cost synergies that you guys are targeting from CareFusion, thank you?","Vince Forlenza","If I take you back 12 months ago, we were getting the same kind of questions in terms of had we exhausted what we could do at the end of the first quarter, you can\u2019t do anymore and then of course we actually exceeded and overcame the FX. So this is early in the year. ","We were expecting some volatility in FX, we were very careful in our expense in terms of how we role that out in the first quarter and I think we did an excellent of managing. But we\u2019re feeling very good about the P&L as we look across the rest of the year. Chris anything else you\u2019d add to it?","Chris Reidy","Yeah I just did on that before I get to the second part of your question. That it\u2019s our job to offset as much of that FX headwind as we can, and I think we\u2019ve done a great job with that last year. We continue that with our first quarter guidance raising the FX and neutral. So that\u2019s our job to do that, and its - basically the cost synergies, the continuous improvement, all of those things go in to our ability to do that. ","We feel really good about where we are in cost synergy. We have the 325 to 350, we feel very good and confident with that. As you know some of the cost synergies come towards the backend and as we get increasing visibility towards that we\u2019ll address where the total cost is going come out. But the traction that we have is terrific and it\u2019s still a little bit early to give any more specificity to where we\u2019ll ultimately end up, but we feel really good about the synergy progress that we\u2019ve made and continue to expect that to be strong. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch from Raymond James.","Larry Keusch","Chris perhaps for you, the 3.1 times gross leverage obviously impressive in tracking right to the three times that you were targeting by the end of March. I guess the question is, and I sort of will wrap in the billion dollars of stranded cash that you have overseas. To the extent that you to get that money back and you leverage comes down to that three times target, how do we think about the cadence of broadly capital deployment and specifically share repurchase and dividend.","And then the second question is and it\u2019s sort of been touched on, but given the outperformance in the first quarter on sales on a constant currency basis, how we specifically think about the cadence of the remaining quarters, given some of that timing pull forward. Does that imply that the 2Q would not be below the 4.5% to 5% outlook for the year? ","Chris Reidy","On that last point, I think in terms of the cadence I think somebody else asked that too. As we look out, it\u2019s going to be pretty ratable. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any spikes in the second, third, or fourth quarter, and so it will be within the range that we had provided for the year. And obviously because of the timing, it\u2019s probably towards the low-end of that range to keep us within the 4.5 as you do the math. ","The other part of the question capital deployment, sure, my favorite. So the way to think about that, one of the things you said Larry was the billion dollars of stranded cash. Remember that a company our size needs certain amount of working capital, so I don\u2019t see all of that as a billion dollar, some of that is just normal working capital needs. ","As we pay down to the 3.0, we\u2019re going to get down to vey historically low levels of cash. It will take a little while to kind of go back up to normal working capital levels. And then a little while longer to actually start accumulating the cash that you need for further deployment. ","So as I look out, the impact this year of any share buybacks would be de-minimus because of what I just subscribed in building back up the cash balances. But clearly we\u2019re not going to let cash build upon the balance sheet and we will deploy that as that cash starts building up again. ","But the way you should think about it for this year is that the impact of any share buybacks which would occur later in the year would be de-minimus to the year. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","So maybe just one housekeeping question on the guidance here. It looks like FX was an incremental $0.17- $0.18 headwind, but the reported EPS was only lowered by $0.10. So could you maybe just walk me through on where you\u2019re getting the offset from, I think that would be helpful. ","Chris Reidy","Yeah, we\u2019re actually seeing a little bit strength in the revenue side, and our margins as you can see were very strong in the first quarter as well. So the combination of those two things, the beat in the first quarter some of that\u2019s going to flow through. So we see about a third of the revenue, about a third of the bottom line flowing through and that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing it. ","Vijay Kumar","And maybe one more for Chris. What is the net impact of corporate tax reform and border tax? Is that a net neutral, net positive?","Chris Reidy","Well on the border tax we certainly - we are a net exporter. So that\u2019s positive, certainly as the lowering of the US rate would be positive. It all depends on all of the other factors that go in it, and that\u2019s very volatile in terms of what other factors there might be such as the interest expense and the price of repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. So it\u2019s too quick and too soon to know because it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess as to what will actually end up in the ultimate rules, and we still got a way to go. But there\u2019s some positive, there\u2019s some negative, we\u2019ll see where they come out. But the one thing that I would want you to take away is that we are a net exporter. We do have over 30 plants in the US, so we feel good about that aspect of it. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Doug Schenkel","My first question is on China and I just want to have a quick circle back to Brian\u2019s question from a couple of minutes ago. So first on China, you grew over 9% in the quarter against a difficult compare. You didn\u2019t call out CareFusion contribution specifically. So with that in mind, I was just hoping you could comment on how much products that have completed the registration process contributed to growth and what\u2019s the right way to think about ramping over the coming quarters. ","And then just to go back to Brian\u2019s question, one area of clear focus today seems to be the concern that you may be reaching a limit on your ability to keep offsetting FX with operating discipline without cutting into bone over the next several quarters. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a bit more pronounced that I would have expected largely because you didn\u2019t reiterate reported EPS and I think a lot of folks thought that you maybe could have. ","Could you just comment more directly on how you feel about how much dry powder is left and kind of back that up with some data that tells us that there is or there isn\u2019t a lot of operating discipline left to be had in offsetting some of the FX headwind thank you? ","Vince Forlenza","Okay, lets start with China first. And we did have a strong performance in China and a lot of it was on the medical side. So Tom why don\u2019t you talk about a little bit about that and the CareFusion impact?","Tom Polen","Sure. Hey Doug, this is Tom. As Vince mentioned earlier we have made really good progress on the registration as we were after revenue synergies up to 160 plus either approved or under active review. As we had always shared, of course China has one of the longest registration time, and so as we think about our synergies, we do have synergies coming in China but that\u2019s certainly not the main source of them at this point. We\u2019ll see those coming in over the next couple of years. ","As you think about revenue synergies overall, it was a good contributor to the segment in the quarter. Think about it in tens of basis points impact on BD Medical revenue growth in the quarter on a global basis. ","Vince Forlenza","Okay. So we\u2019ll come back to this question about where do we get potential offset as we look forward through the P&L? And you\u2019ve mentioned operating discipline and of course we will continue that. But Chris we have other levers that we can fall to?","Chris Reidy","We do, certainly as we talked about the synergies. In our ability to drive more synergies, we\u2019ve gotten a lot of traction on that, there\u2019s still a lot to come and so there\u2019s potential to continue to drive more synergies and that would be a potential. ","We feel good about the fact that we are able to offset a good chunk of the FX headwinds in our guidance. As we go down to 106, its now 108, there\u2019s certainly some upside there as well. It\u2019s somewhat out of our control where FX goes, but our job as I said before is to offset as much of that as we possibly can and I think we have some options and opportunities particularly around synergy acceleration and those kinds of things that we would be pushing up. ","Vince Forlenza","And the only other thing I would add Chris is that, if we continue with a strong revenue, we saw a very good margin on that incremental revenue. So we have that as a looking forward as well. So those are the elements. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Gorberg with UBS.","Jonathan Gorberg","Can you give us, Vince I know one of the things from a new product standpoint investors had been anticipating was that insulin infusion set, and just maybe a little bit more color on what should investors be expecting given early feedback that you\u2019ve gotten either from a timing or what you\u2019re going to do from a product standpoint?","Vince Forlenza","Yeah Tom can talk to that.","Tom Polen","Hi Jonathan, this is Tom. So as Vince mentioned in October we began the initial pilot launch with Medtronic in the US to collect customer insights and inform about the rollout. As we said, we did put out a safety notification a few weeks ago and it stated that although the majority of customers are using the product successfully and we\u2019re getting great feedback on that, there was a small percent that had reported some issues. And so we had an agreement with Medtronic temporarily pause the shipment so we could review that customer feedback. ","We also indicated that any customers who have the product, it\u2019s okay to continue to use it. Again we\u2019re getting overall very good feedback, and we recognize that it\u2019s a new and different technology and we need to make sure that we\u2019re rolling out the right training so that we\u2019re getting our customers the right instructions for use a 100% are having that right experience. ","So we\u2019ve been analyzing that feedback, we\u2019re finding some of the training practices etcetera. Obviously we\u2019re disappointed with the shipment pause, but as Vince also mentioned, we view this as part of a learning critical to maximize the potential of this over both the near and long term. ","It doesn\u2019t change at all our outlook for the product. We continue to be very positive on the opportunity and extremely positive on the benefit of the flow-smart technology. We also don\u2019t see any impact of this on the guidance for the medical segment of the company. ","Vince Forlenza","So we\u2019re still working towards full commercial launch changing some of the training materials. Thanks Tom. Thanks John. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik de Bruin","A couple of question, first, when you look at the respiratory JV on that other income line, how should we think about that for the rest of the year. And going forward on that is a low single digit sort of growth estimate for that a reasonable assumption on that business or in that contribution?","Chris Reidy","It\u2019s not going to be very material and we\u2019re not counting on it being very material for the rest of the year. And its\u2019 on a lag just because of the reporting piece which is not unusual. So I wouldn\u2019t expect too much there. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to really be a driver. ","Derik de Bruin","And then just one follow-up, you call that flu several times and historically flu has been anywhere if I think what 12 million to 15 million in a good flu season for you. Could you call up the contribution in Q1 and then sort of expectations for Q2?","Vince Forlenza","Yeah, I don\u2019t know that we can give you an expectation for Q2, but Alberto can comment on what we\u2019ve seen so far and what happened in this quarter. Alberto?","Alberto Mas","Yes, flu seasons specifically in Asia. So Japan and Korea were earlier than last year as well as in the US, the last year\u2019s flu season was late. So we saw strong demand in Asia in Q1, and very, very late in December. There was a little bit of a spike in the order from distributors in anticipation of what we\u2019ve seen an increase in flu for the last three weeks or so. We don\u2019t know exactly obviously how that\u2019s going to, going forward how that\u2019s going to evolve. But there was a very late buy-in of inventory by distributors in the US moderate still. It contributed about just over 1.5% growth rate to the DS growth rate for the quarter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. ","Bill Quirk","Couple of question I guess for Vince or Tom, just curious as there was a broadening of an EU sharps directive that might get expanded in scope to some non-healthcare workers like police and lab workers and such. Just kind of thinking about the potential size of this opportunity, I\u2019m guessing this is more of an \u201918-\u201919 sort of event, but would love any colors there. ","And then just a quick one for Chris share count, you got it to 219 for the year. We\u2019re comfortably under that at this point, so just kind of help us think about some of the puts and takes there? ","Vince Forlenza","Tom do you want to comment?","Tom Polen","Yeah, this is Tom. Certainly we see Europe is about 50% of the way through their safety legislation. I think the add-on that you\u2019re talking about is not something that we see as fundamentally being a significant scale to move the needle beyond kind of the current trajectory. So we will continue to be very positive overall on safety growth in Europe and as well as in emerging markets.","Chris Reidy","And on the share count, so that assumes - and we\u2019ve seen since we\u2019re not buying back any shares we got a little bit of a lift from conversion of options, and we\u2019ve seen that over the last several quarters. So it\u2019s just a continuation of that and no assumption of share buybacks for the remainder of the year. ","Operator","The next question comes from the Brandon Couillard from Jeffries. ","Brandon Couillard","Just curious if you could elaborate on the US safety weakness in the first quarter and whether or not that we should think that\u2019s about the normalizing in 2Q, and then secondly, curious if the International Biosciences experience was actually in line with plan?","Vince Forlenza","So first safety, and in the US there was a little bit of an impact on the Life Science side because we had some capacity constraints on one particular product in PAS and we\u2019re working to add that capacity. So that\u2019s what you saw there. We\u2019re adding some capacity and we\u2019re going to be tight for the balance of the year. But Tom?","Tom Polen","We saw a pretty solid performance from a medical perspective in the US in the quarter, no change in that. I think as we think about safety overall in the quarter, we recognize that at the BDX level it was maybe a bit more of an impact from international safety, so also some headwinds in the Middle East and Asia, but we see those basically moderating as we go forward for the year as those annualize and overall see a positive outlook for safety to the balance in FY\u201917.","Vince Forlenza","And Alberto international safety I think you did pretty well too. ","Alberto Mas","Yes, and we did particularly well and above average because some of the supply in some of the constrained product and push-button recollection went outside the US. So we saw particularly high safety numbers. ","Vince Forlenza","So little less growth in the US, but more international. Okay, great. ","Chris Reidy","And emerging markets over 18% growth asset. ","Operator","Your last question comes from the line Rich Newitter from Leerink Partners.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Robby in for Rich. Just one on price, you mentioned the pricing environment a couple of times. How should we think about and how you are thinking about that. It sounds like you\u2019re taking a little bit more of an incremental cautious approach there? And just a follow-up, could you just highlight what US growth would have been X the order pull through thank you?","Chris Reidy","So on the pricing piece, I think it\u2019s very consistent with the way we always approach pricing. There\u2019s no question that there is pricing pressure in different parts of the business. We tend to be able to offset a lot of that, and so we started this year opening guidance with tens of basis points of pressure. The first quarter was about flat as I mentioned and so we\u2019re still having our guidance, the tens of basis points coming from the remainder of the year, that\u2019s got some room for upside. If we\u2019re able to outperform, but right now it contains that tens of basis points of pricing pressure. ","Vince Forlenza","Well thank you very much. May be to then go on and just wrap up the call. We are very pleased with the strong start to the year. We\u2019re implementing our strategy that we laid out for you at analyst day. That whole plan is on track, we\u2019re excited about the new product launches. You saw the increased performance on the margin as well. So when we step back and look at this in totality we\u2019re viewing very good across the continuum of the entire P&L. ","So thank you very much for your questions and look forward to updating you next quarter. Thanks everyone. ","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through February 13, 2020, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 6886458. ","I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment.","Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Pasha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our fourth fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Our first quarter results include a charge of $59 million related to a voluntary recall in the MMS infusion business to address certain software and alarm prioritization matters. This item along with the details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release and in the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. A copy of the release including the financial schedules is posted on the bd.com website.","Leading the call this morning is Tom Polen, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, Executive Vice President and President of the Interventional segment; and Patrick Kaltenbach, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Polen","Thank you, Monique. And good morning, everyone. You saw in our earnings release this morning where we brought down revenue and EPS guidance for the year, and let me just say that resetting expectations is certainly not how I want to start my first call as CEO. ","And so, before we jump into what's happening with Alaris, I want to say that how we're going to discuss topics on today's call is what you can expect from me \u2013 straight talk, accountability, and an unwavering commitment to quality and regulatory compliance, our values and doing what's right.","At our core, BD is a very purpose-driven company. It's what defines who we are, how we operate, and what actions we take. And you can expect that our purpose and values will be at the heart of how we respond to the current situation with Alaris.","Every company is going to face challenges, and the real measure of the company\u2019s strength isn't whether or not we face challenges, it's how we respond. And I'm personally focused, along with my entire leadership team, on fully resolving this situation.","So, let me take you through what happened starting with what we said in November and even more recently and how our conversations with the FDA have continued to evolve, even specifically this week.","In November, we told you we were planning to make some improvements to our Alaris pump software, including upgrades to alarm prioritization and optimization. We indicated then that we were in active discussions with the FDA about the timing and implementation of these improvements.","Relying on our quality process within the infusion business and how we've managed Alaris software updates over time, the team believed we could take a phased approach to releasing Alaris software updates and that these releases did not require a 510(k) clearance. We then issued the first phase of our software updates in December, and we resumed shipping as we shared with you last month. ","Through our ongoing dialogue with the FDA, including an in-depth discussion this past Monday, we learned that the FDA disagreed with our conclusion about the need for a new 510(k) clearance for these software upgrades. ","And in light of the consent decree, the FDA has requested that we combine all Alaris software enhancements, recall remediation updates, and changes made to the Alaris system over time into a single comprehensive 510(k) filing, which we're going to submit in the fourth quarter of FY 2020. We're actively continuing to collaborate with the FDA to ensure we meet their expectations for this upcoming regulatory submission. ","I want to be clear here that while we relied on our infusion quality process and system, we've now learned that in this case it did not meet FDA's expectations, and we're committed to taking the appropriate actions to get this right.","I also want to be clear that we fully stand behind the safety and the clinical benefits of our product, which is used in the care of 70% of patients undergoing infusion therapy, and that's a responsibility we do not take lightly. We've provided guidance to our customers on how to mitigate potential risks until our software is fully remediated. We've also created a dedicated team of clinical consultants to support live training for healthcare providers, and we will continue to support existing customers to ensure they have access to the Alaris system under medical necessity.","As CEO, my foremost focus is on ensuring the right supporting processes, capabilities, and execution within the company to ensure we deliver on FDA expectations.","Chris will discuss this more, but as you saw in our news release, based on this situation, we reduced our guidance range by approximately $400 million in revenue and $0.60 in EPS for fiscal year 2020.","I also want to comment on China's volume-based procurement initiatives and which we've shared would be impacting our MDS catheter business and that we now have a much better sense of how the situation is evolving than we did last month.","So, while it's progressing faster than we initially forecasted in November, we expect to fully offset the impact at the BDX level. We've got several upsides from the rest of our business in China, which are expected to grow double digits during the year, and there are also a few other areas that we're doing better than expected in so far, including flu testing, DCBs, and FX.","We are a strong company with a diverse portfolio, both in terms of our products and our geographies, and there's a lot of good things happening across BD. And I want to highlight just a few.","First, our Q1 results were in line with the expectations we shared with you in November. The businesses and the regions delivered solid performance, led by Life Sciences where we saw an incremental benefit from the flu and our Interventional segment where we saw growth from new products and DCBs also started a bit better than expected.","During the quarter, we continued to make good progress on the BD-Bard integration. We remain on track to deliver $100 million in cost synergies this year, which brings our total to $300 million over the three-year deal period. We also continue to scale our commercial programs as part of our commitment to achieve $250 million in revenue synergies by 2022. ","We've continued to make good progress there with things we've talked to you about in the past, such as the European biosurgery incubator, vascular access management, and our international product registrations.","Another strength in FY 2020 is our ability to deliver on a robust pipeline of new products, and we're already off to a solid cadence with 11 new launches so far in Q1. ","And there's three I'd like to just call your attention to. In Medical, we're continuing to innovate in our vascular access portfolio. And we recently launched the new PowerPICC Provena catheter with SOLO 2 valve technology, which makes the catheter easier to care for. Our early feedback from customers is extremely positive.","In Life Sciences, we recently introduced the BD COR molecular system that's targeted in Europe. This flagship innovation completely automates the molecular laboratory workflow, and our initial system configuration is available with the BD Onclarity HPV assay, which is used for cervical cancer screening and diagnosis.","We're still very early in this launch, but we feel really good about the progress we've made so far, having already signed 10 high-value volume accounts in Q1. Of course, we're new to the HPV market, and so all of that is new business for BD.","In Interventional, we received clearance for EleVation, our next-generation vacuum assisted breast biopsy device, which helps ensure tissue samples, high-quality tissue samples regardless of the density of the breast tissue. It's early, but we're getting very positive clinical feedback here as well.","We're excited by these and our other launches and our long-term innovation pipeline. ","What you see on slide five captures our major launches for FY 2020, but it's only a small portion of the total active R&D projects that we expect to bring to market over the next three to five years.","We're also entering several new higher growth market spaces with our overall R&D pipeline focused in markets growing 1% to 2% faster than our existing product portfolio. And we see elements of our automation and informatics capabilities in the pipeline across each of our three segments, including now in Interventional where we're starting to leverage BD's capabilities to digitize the legacy Bard portfolio.","Before I turn things over to Chris, I want to make some comments on the coronavirus. First, as it comes to the coronavirus, the health and the safety of employees in China and around the world is our top priority. ","We're closely tracking the virus in China and we're paying particular attention to the guidance from the US CDC, the WHO and health officials in China. ","As you'd expect from us, we're also supporting response efforts in China by providing in-kind and monetary donations to the Wuhan Red Cross and Project Hope.","BD doesn't manufacture \u2013 we don't have any manufacturing or distribution operations in the Wuhan or Hubei province and we are adhering to the guidance from the Chinese government and extending the Chinese New Year holiday until February 10 at our offices and facilities in Suzhou and Shanghai.","From a supply chain perspective, about 95% of the products we manufacture in China are sold and used within China. We currently have sufficient inventory of the few products that we export from China to meet current demand. And within China, imports of goods and raw materials are being received as expected.","In terms of business impact, of course, the situation is still very dynamic. We are closely watching and balancing two trends. First, we are seeing fewer people go to the hospital to seek standard care. At the same time, we have received and installed several urgent orders for additional BD MAX molecular systems, which are being used in coronavirus testing. Chris will take you through how we're contemplating this within our guidance.","We'll continue to closely monitor the situation and keep you updated as it evolves.","With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher Reidy ","Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. Before I take you through our first quarter results and guidance for the full year, I'd like to reinforce Tom's remarks on the Alaris pump issue.","As you would expect from us, we take this matter very seriously. We did not anticipate the current Alaris pump situation to materialize the way that it has and I assure you that the senior management team is fully committed to resolving the situation.","So with that, let me review our first quarter results. As Tom mentioned, we delivered solid performance in the first quarter. First quarter revenues grew 2.5% on a currency neutral basis. Revenue growth was in line with our expectations. I'll provide more color on the first quarter revenue growth in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and geography.","First quarter adjusted EPS was $2.65, which is at the high-end of our guidance range. Adjusted EPS declined about 2% year-over-year and was about flat on a currency neutral basis. As expected, adjusted EPS growth reflects solid operating performance, offset by the expiration of the Gore royalty and a very tough compare to last year's first quarter tax rate of 11.2%.","Operating margins of 24% were in line with our expectations for the quarter. We also continued to de-lever during the first quarter, paying down approximately $90 million of debt. At December 31, our gross leverage ratio was 3.5 times and we remain on track to achieve our commitment to de-lever to below 3 times this calendar year.","Moving on to slide 10, I'll review the medical segment revenue growth. BD Medical revenues declined 1.1% in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. As expected, first quarter performance in the Medical segment was impacted by the new volume-based procurement process being adopted in certain Chinese provinces, which is specific to our catheter business within our medication delivery solutions portfolio of China. Outside of China, we saw strong growth in our vascular access management portfolio of solutions.","In addition, as anticipated, revenues in medication management solutions declined due to limited installations of Alaris pumps.","In pharmaceutical systems, strength of over 9% reflects our ability to meet high demand for prefillable syringes as a result of our ongoing investments in capacity as conversion from vials to prefillable devices continues.","As expected, diabetes care revenues were about flat compared to the prior year, driven by anticipated pricing pressure in the US and the timing of orders that drove the strong Q4 last year as discussed on our previous earnings call.","Now, turning to slide 11 and the BD Life Sciences segment, revenues increased 7.4% in the first quarter. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in diagnostic systems and biosciences units. ","Growth in diagnostic systems was brought based across point-of-care, flu, our molecular diagnostic platforms and our microbiology solutions, as well as our woman's health and cancer portfolio.","With continue to see over 20% growth in BD MAX and are receiving very positive feedback on our BD COR launch in Europe. ","Very strong growth in biosciences was driven by licensing revenues and demand for instruments and reagents. This was partially offset by a tough comparison due to the divestiture of the advanced bioprocessing product line during last year's first fiscal quarter.","Growth in pre-analytical systems reflects a tough comparison to the prior year when revenues grew 7.6%, driven by additional capacity brought on to meet demand for our pushbutton blood collection sets and the timing of distributor orders.","Now, turning to slide 12 and the BD Interventional segment, revenues increased 5% in the first quarter, with mid-single-digit growth across all three business units. ","Revenue growth in peripheral intervention was broad-based, including performance in our WavelinQ, Covera and Venovo products that continue to perform extremely well. ","DCB-related revenues was slightly better than planned as the trend we have been seeing since the FDA letter has improved. Excluding the DCB impact, revenues in peripheral intervention grew over 8%.","First quarter revenue growth in surgery reflects strong double-digit performance in biosurgery and high single-digit growth in hernia. We saw robust growth across the US, Europe and China. As you may recall, we relaunched Progel last year and are now approaching our historical run rate in sales.","Revenue growth in urology and critical care continues to be driven by performance across our acute urology, home care and targeted temperature management business. ","Moving to slide 13 and our geographic revenues, developed markets grew 2% in the first quarter as growth in the US in the Life Sciences and Interventional segments was partially offset by a decline in the Medical segment as anticipated due to the infusion pump software upgrade, as previously discussed.","We also spoke saw strong performance in Europe in vascular care within MDS. Molecular diagnostics, lab automation in women's health and cancer and diagnostic systems and hernia and biosurgery within the surgery unit.","Emerging markets revenues grew 5.1% for the first quarter. Performance was driven by nearly double-digit growth in China and the broader Asia-Pacific region. China revenues reflect strong double-digit growth in Life Sciences and Interventional segments as anticipated. The Medical segment's performance in China was also in line with our expectations as strong double-digit growth across MMS, diabetes care and pharmaceutical systems was offset by the impact of volume-based procurement related to peripheral catheters in MDS.","As we started the new fiscal year, the situation in China remained fluid. When we provided guidance in November, we told you about a new volume-based procurement process that several provinces had adopted, which was modeled after similar initiatives for generic drugs and other spending categories.","While the program covers a wide variety of consumable medical products for BD, it's focus on our $200 million peripheral catheter portfolio within our MDS business. While we anticipated that it would expand, we have now seen volume-based procurement expand at a faster rate.","In addition, we are seeing distributors reduce inventory levels in large part due to, and in anticipation of, this new procurement process and we are assuming that will continue.","As Tom said, we expect to fully offset the impact at the BDX level. However, as a result of these dynamics, we now expect low-single-digit growth in China for the full fiscal year. Excluding the MDS portfolio, we are seeing high double-digit growth in China and are pleased with our performance in that region.","Now, turning to slide 14 which recaps the first quarter income statement. As discussed, revenues grew 2.5%. This includes 80 basis points of pricing pressure, which is in line with our expectations as we had anticipated pricing would be most acute in the first quarter as certain prior-year pricing agreements annualize. For the full fiscal year, we expect pricing to decline approximately 50 basis points to 60 basis points.","Moving down the P&L, gross profit grew approximately 3% year-over-year. Gross margin was a solid 56.5%.","SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 26.5%. This reflects additional deferred compensation expense due to strong stock market performance in the quarter. For your reference, deferred compensation expense is fully offset in the other income net line. On an underlying basis, SSG&A expenses grew in line with sales and reflect our ongoing focus on disciplined spending and the achievement of Bard cost synergies.","R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6%. For the full fiscal year, we expect to invest $1 billion in R&D which reflects our continued commitment to drive innovation. ","As a result, operating margins decreased 50 basis points or 40 basis points on a currency neutral basis which is in line with our expectations.","Our tax rate was 15.3% in the quarter, in line with our full-year guidance range of 14% to 16%.","And as expected, we paid preferred dividends of $38 million in the quarter. As a reminder, the preferred shares will convert in May of this year.","Adjusted earnings per share were $2.65 as previously discussed.","Now, turning to slide 15 and our gross profit and operating margins for the first quarter. Gross profit margin of 56.5% improved 30 basis points on a performance basis. This reflects our continuous improvement initiatives and cost synergies, partially offset by the impact of pricing.","Operating margin of 24% declined 50 basis points in the quarter or 40 basis points on a currency neutral basis. As previously discussed, this was driven by higher deferred compensation expense recorded within SSG&A that is offset below operating income in the other income net line item. Excluding the impact of deferred compensation, operating margins would have increased 40 basis points currency neutral.","Currency had a negative impact of 10 basis points on both gross and operating margins in the quarter.","Now, moving on to slide 16 and our full fiscal year 2020 revenue and P&L guidance. As you've already heard from Tom, we are revising our revenue growth guidance to 2.5% to 3.5%, specifically due to the Alaris situation.","Our updated range reflects several scenarios based on our ongoing conversations with the FDA, with the bottom end of our range assuming a very limited ability to ship Alaris pumps this fiscal year.","By segment, for the full year, we now expect BD Medical revenue growth to be about flat. We expect both BD Life Sciences and BD Interventional revenue growth be at the high-end of our previous guidance ranges of 6% to 7% and 5% to 6% respectively.","We now anticipate low single-digit growth in developed markets in fiscal 2020. In emerging markets, we now expect mid-single-digit growth, driven by a diversified base of low single-digit growth in China, as previously discussed, and strengthen in EMA. ","Based on our new guidance for FY 2020, we now expect revenue growth in the second quarter to be approximately 2% and EPS to be between $2.40 and $2.50. This includes an approximately $20 million to $30 million headwind from coronavirus within the quarter. This impact is contemplated within our full-year guidance range.","Moving down the P&L, we have updated our gross profit margin, SSG&A and operating margin guidance to reflect the infusion pump impact. Our updated SSG&A and operating margin guidance ranges also include the first quarter impact of deferred compensation.","For the full fiscal year, we now expect gross margin to be about flat year-over-year at the midpoint of the range and operating margin to improve approximately 50 basis points on a currency neutral basis. The balance of our P&L guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2020 remain unchanged.","Moving on to slide 17, this reflects our revised EPS guidance for the total year. As you can see, we now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $11.90 to $12.10, which reflects our latest view on FX and the impact of Alaris pumps.","In summary, we delivered a solid first quarter, in line with our expectation. We continue to make good progress on the BD-Bard integration and on bringing to market our robust innovation pipeline, launching 11 new products during the quarter. ","Moving to the balance of the year, we take the news we delivered today very seriously and we are fully committed to resolving the Alaris situation and returning to our long-standing track record of delivering value to customers, their patients and shareholders. ","Thanks. And I'd like to now open the call up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan.","Robbie Marcus","Great, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe we could just start with the pump impact, and help us understand of the $400 million plus or minus that you lowered guidance by, how much exactly is for the pump? Will this linger into fiscal 2021? ","I'll just ask all my questions here. Maybe as you walk us down through the P&L, it seems like there is a 40% contribution margin hit from that $400 million to the $0.60. Help us get to that number.","Tom Polen","Hey, Robbie, this is Tom. I'll take the first two questions and then turn it to Chris for your last one. So, of the $400 million, that is essentially pump capital that we're unable to ship. Of course, we have a very large install base in the field. We aren't expecting any meaningful impact on our consumable business there. We actually have seen some increase in consumable demand certainly because of the flu season. And as we mentioned, we stand very strongly behind the quality of the products and its continued usage in delivering 70% of infusions, particularly in the US.","Lingering into 2021, what I could say at this point is, look, we know what we need to do to address this situation, and that's to submit the updated 510(k) within Q4, as I shared. So, that's what we're focused on right now.","The timing in which we're going to get \u2013 we're working collaboratively with the FDA, and I'd say we'll give you updates as that progresses in terms of our ability to open up and resume shipping. So, as we continue that collaboration with the FDA, we'll have more visibility and we'll keep you updated.","Christopher Reidy","I would just add to provide clarity to the guidance change. Up until the infusion pump issue this week in our meeting with the FDA this week, we were fully planning to reaffirm our guidance for fiscal year 2020. The 2.5% to 3.5% revenue growth guidance assumes essentially, on the low-end, that we sell virtually no pumps. And of our 450-ish kind of US infusion pump business, the range above that would expect the normal range of guidance that we would've had prior to this issue as well as the potential of selling some pumps under medical necessity. ","Robbie Marcus","And so, maybe just quickly, what's the breakdown of how much you're lowering for pump versus coronavirus and for the increased reimbursement?","Christopher Reidy","So, what I would say is, it's 100% pumps because as you think about the puts and takes that we had this year, we are seeing upside on the flu side. We're seeing better performance in DCBs as we talked about. So, we have some strong performance in the rest of the business. China, outside of the value-based \u2013 volume-based procurement is doing extremely well, strong double digits across Interventional and Life Sciences. So, we had some upside. We did take into consideration the acceleration of the volume-based procurement. That stepped up. Just to kind of give you a sense, that's $200 million peripheral catheter business for us. Last quarter, we took it down by about $40 million. We've accelerated that by about $60 million, partly because of accelerations in the province tenders that we are seeing, but even more dramatically, the distributors taking down inventories in anticipation of these tenders. And so, that's an additional $60 million. So, we've taken down an additional $60 million. So, that takes us down to about $100 million left in that business going forward. That $60 million, plus the coronavirus of about $20 million to $30 million, we're offsetting with the strong performance, as I talked about, in other parts of the business. ","So as I said, going into this week, we had all of that in the mix and would have still reaffirmed our guidance for the year. So, you can think about the takedown as entirely the Alaris pump issue.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks a lot. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to start initially, Tom, if you go back historically and look at the Baxter Colleague recall, that share loss built, Tom, over a series of years. So, do you have any early comments on what can be done to support customers and incentivizing them to wait for resolution? Or how customers are going to evaluate this, buy from another provider or wait decision during this interim ship-hold period?","Tom Polen","Hey, David. So, what I would say is, of course, customers have been increasingly selecting the Alaris product, as you know, for many years and we've seen that in continued share gains in the category. I would say, going into FY 2020 this year, we've had really \u2013 that momentum is continuing to be very, very strong. So, high level of customer engagement and interest, going right up to this point, and continuing to convert to the platform. ","So, I think people's conviction in terms of they see the value of the product, obviously, not only the power of having one integrated system, but the interoperability ability which we have. We'd expect nearly 90% of all interoperable pumps in the US are BD pumps today. It's a capability that we have that we think is at another level than others are able to offer. And we also, of course, have the integrated medication management solution that connects more broadly. And so, feedback early on is that customers still see that value and will be working to help people as possible to wait for that.","Of course, we have a very, very large install base, and that normally takes \u2013 we see people upgrade every \u2013 let's say, 10 years in general. We see people begin to refresh their fleet. So, we also recognize people have flexibility in terms of do they do that right now or do they wait until we get our updated 510(k) in place. Of course, we'll have a better sense of how fast we'll be able to re-engage with customers as we continue our dialogue with the FDA and as we get that 510(k) updated and submitted. And that's our number one focus right now, is getting that filing done, which will reflect not only the upgrades that we're making right now, but it's going to reflect the changes to the software that have also been made historically, will all be included in this updated 510(k) that we'll be submitting.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can you be a little bit more specific here on the steps that are required with respect to submission of the 510(k)? The software upgrades that that you're doing, can you tell us kind of where you are there, why that would take so long to maybe submit sometime in the fourth quarter? It seems like some of these software upgrades were kind of already done and you've got to kind of repackage them? I just want to dig into what specifically did the FDA come in say that they didn't like about your quality systems. What changes do you think you need to make more broadly on the quality system side? Thanks.","Tom Polen","Yeah. Hey, Brian. It's Tom. So, let me start with your last question and then work our way forward. So, as I mentioned, based on the quality system in our infusion business, we've made software upgrades over time to the Alaris system. And over that period of time, and we're talking \u2013 not this year, we're talking a number of years, our quality process determined that those upgrade that we've been making in that business did not require a 510(k) clearance. ","And so, most recently, on the most recent changes and updates that we've made, we follow that same process and our team determined based on that process that those recent updates in November also did not require an new 510(k) clearance. And so, we released that software improvement in December and we resumed shipping, as we had shared with you last month.","Since what we've learned \u2013 and as I mentioned, we had a key meeting with the FDA as recently as this Monday. Through our ongoing dialogue with the FDA, we learned that the FDA disagreed with that determination about the need for a new 510(k) clearance for the updated software. And that applies not just to the upgraded software that we're talking about in November, but that decision process that had occurred over time. ","And so, as I said, we're collaborating with the FDA on their request to combine all the Alaris software enhancements and remediation upgrades with the additional changes made to be Alaris system over time, over years, into a more comprehensive regulatory filing which is going to be submitted this summer.","And so, while you're right, we are ready to \u2013 we have the information ready for the recent software upgrades, the work that has to take place between now and the submission date is more referenced to the historical changes that have been made over multiple years going back and some additional testing that we need to do on those historic changes to reflect the testing requirements today. So, that's the work that has to be done.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And good morning.","Tom Polen","Good morning.","Bob Hopkins","Morning. On Alaris, I guess the question I have is a little bit bigger picture. In your view, is this 100% Becton-specific issue with the FDA or is the FDA changing their requirements for pumps broadly? The reason I ask the question is I'm struggling to understand kind of how you got caught off guard and how this went from sort of a software upgrade to something much more significant?","Tom Polen","Bob, this is Tom. I can't comment on other organizations, but what I can say is that it's not unprecedented where there are situations where over time a product evolves and then the FDA looks and says, wait a minute, your current 510(k) needs to be updated to reflect those series of changes over time. ","And in this case, there was a process in the business and there's a specific quality process within the infusion business, within the consent decree that the team was following that said, each of those individual changes didn't require a 510(k) process. Again, when the FDA looks back at it over a 5, 10-year period, they say, wait a minute, you actually need to put in a 510(k) given that series of changes that have been made. And that's the exact work that we're doing.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just to not to beat a dead horse, but on Alaris, I guess once you do submit the software upgrade platform, I guess, in the summer, what would be the timeline that you would expect for this package to be approved by the FDA? And then, what would be your expectation for it to be rolled out to customers? I'm just trying to gauge again, going back to the impact for FY 2021 and, I guess, how should we just think about this in terms of customer waiting on the sidelines and just the degree with medical necessity? How difficult is that for customers to qualify for? Thanks.","Tom Polen","Yeah. thanks, Kristen, for the question. So, let me answer your last question first. When it comes to medical necessity, we are working collaboratively with the FDA to put in place a process for customers to continue to get access to new Alaris pumps under medical necessity. And that's again as required for medical necessity and that process is getting finalized now. We'll be reviewing that process with the FDA and then providing that to customers. Of course, it is a life sustaining product in many cases and there will be needs for medical necessity pumps, we expect, and we have requests for those now, certainly in house.","When it comes to clearance and timing for that, I'd say, of course, we're very focused right now on getting that 510(k) submitted. Clearance timing, we're working again with the FDA. I think it's probably not prudent to speculate until we get the feedback from the FDA. ","In parallel, though, I would say that the work on the catch-up 510(k) that I've described, we've started that work in full and have momentum well underway. That's why we have a good sense of and confidence in the timing of submission. ","Thanks, Kristen.","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Tom, just one on \u2013 just trying to go through the math. The $400 million cut to pump revenues, is that assuming no placements at all, pump placements? If the market is $2 billion, I'm just trying to map work here on the impact for the back half there. Or if this is just a software, given you guys are so deep in the connectivity part, on the digital part, this is connected to your Pyxis. Cancustomers purchase an older version of the pump and then upgrade the software once the FDA, I guess, approves the new 510(k)? And related to that, do you think this has any impact on Pyxis at all now because I know you have some bundled up sales going on? Thank you.","Tom Polen","Hey Vijay. Tom. Thanks for the question. So, we don't expect any impact on Pyxis. We continue to have strong momentum there. And again, we have late stage ongoing discussions with customers who we think many of them will wait for the Alaris product to be able to resume shipping in order to either convert or to upgrade their fleet. Again, we stand by the safety of the products, and so this is a delay in terms of when we can ship new pumps is what we're focused on. ","By the way, when we ship under medical necessity, we will be shipping, we expect, the prior version of the software, to your question, and we can't ship \u2013 I think you had alluded to, can we just go back and ship the prior version of the pump more broadly. And, no, the answer is no, we can't do that. We're limiting shipments of pumps exclusively to that under medical necessity as we work with the FDA. And again, we'll keep you updated as we progress and once we get past the 510(k) submission.","Christopher Reidy","And I would just say, in response to your first part of your question, just again for clarity, that the low end of our range, the 2.5%, would assume that there are essentially no pumps sold and the entire amount of revenue was taken out. And we would have to assume that there would be \u2013 pumps sold under medical necessity would be limited, but the rest of the range up from the low end of the range would account for some sales of pumps under medical necessity, as well as the normal range that we would have in the guidance.","Tom Polen","As you can imagine, given the situation, we want to be particularly prudent and make sure that, again, as we work collaboratively with the FDA here, we'll know more as those discussions progress.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Lawrence Keusch with Raymond James.","Lawrence Keusch","Thanks. Good morning. Just a two-part question here. So, I guess, once you have this new software package cleared by the FDA, I'm curious as to where that puts you relative to overarching FDA desires within the pump space? It's my sense that the FDA has been a little bit frustrated that a lot of the pumps out there really are not up to the standards that they would like. So, I'm trying to get a sense of where this ultimately puts you once you kind of go through the pain of getting this all done. ","And I guess the second part of the question is, in other areas of the business where there have been software upgrades over time such as Pyxis, have you gone back and had a review there or might you need 510(k) filings there as well? Thank you.","Tom Polen","Hey, Larry. Thanks for the question. So, in terms of the question regarding the overall pumps, this catch-up 510(k) is going to be extremely comprehensive. And so, to your point, we feel that this will put us actually a good spot in terms of getting full compliance. Again, we're working with the FDA, so that, at the end of the day, once we get this 510(k) established, the new one, we'll be fully meeting the expectations of the FDA and we're having that active dialogue, obviously, understanding their expectations, how our process may have led us to make some different decisions there. But we're getting all of that reflected and put into an FDA that will be completely comprehensive with the latest expectations and requirements. And that's the reason for that submission timeline because we are being prudent and fully comprehensive to the full expectations of the FDA. So, you could say that should put us in a good position going forward. ","On Pyxis is not a 510(k) approved product. It's not regulated in the same way as it's a dispensing system. So, certainly, on other products in the company, we are assessing that, but it doesn't pertain to Pyxis.","Lawrence Keusch","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel.","Rick Wise","Good morning, Tom. Hi Chris.","Tom Polen","Good morning.","Rick Wise","Two questions from me and I'll just ask them upfront. I was last night rereading your comments at the BD annual meeting where you very clearly restated\/emphasized your goals for a 5% to 6% durable top line growth, I think was your language, and low double-digit bottom line. I guess I'm wondering how you're thinking about those goals today. ","Two, what impact do we imagine this has on your goal of 50 basis point to 100 basis point annual improvement in operating margin?","And last part of this, it's sort of all of a piece. We're all going to have to contemplate what to do with our fiscal 2021 and beyond numbers. I'm sure you're not ready to give guidance. But do we imagine that wherever we end up this year \u2013 and obviously, I hope it a little better than you're shaping today. But the longer-term guidance, should we imagine that you'll frame \u2013 taking these long-term goals, framing the longer-term outlook off this year or would we imagine, no, fiscal 2021, if all goes well, could be a year of accelerated growth relative to these targets? Thank you.","Christopher Reidy","So, let me take a shot at that, Rick. Thanks for the question. I'd say that we're only a quarter into this year. So, clearly, it's a little tough to talk about 2021 at this point. This is very recent developments that occurred this week with the FDA which we're addressing. ","With size of the impact for FY 2020, keep in mind that a big chunk of the revenue base is coming out this year which does create a bit of an easier compare year-over-year. That's not our focus. Our focus is getting through this issue and working with the FDA to get the pumps shipping again. And I think there's nothing about this situation that changes are 5% to 6% double-digit growth going forward, the underlying business is extremely strong and continues to be strong and will continue to be strong. As I said, the only thing taking our guidance down is this issue. We'll get past this issue and be back to that same standard of delivering value going forward.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.","Richard Newitter","Thank you for taking the question. I just was curious on the \u2013 going back to the China volume-based pricing pressure that you've kind of \u2013 took that guide a little bit more conservative based on what you saw between the two quarters. I guess what gives you confidence that this is the right level of headwind to put in there for that issue? And just remind me again, sorry if I missed it, what was contemplated in the full year outlook and what gives you confidence this doesn't kind of become a moving target. Thanks.","Tom Polen","Richard, let me just start and then I'll turn over to Chris. Certainly, as we've shared, it was just getting started when we gave guidance. It hadn't started really rolling out across the provinces. It was in discussion. Very few of them had at started their processes and others were beginning the dialogue. And so, the pace of that happening and the number of provinces was still uncertain. And we made that very clear, I think, when we shared that at that time. ","So, we've had another quarter to understand how that's involving and I would say it's evolving a bit faster than we had originally thought it would. Again, we've seen \u2013 this has happened in the generic drug industry. So, we have surrogates to see the model, the pace at which it goes and we've also seen some of the tenders now go through in the last quarter and we've been able to see exactly what pricing changes are being finalized in those tenders. And so, now we've been able to say, okay, here's the exact pricing reductions that we're going to see and the number of provinces and we've built that in. ","As we mentioned, as Chris said, so the $200 million business today in China, again, that's out of a $1.2 billion total China business, it is a significant drop in that $200 million business. We've built that in. At the same time, we are redirecting resources from that portfolio of businesses into some of the areas and opportunities we see in Life Sciences and Interventional and we see some opportunities for acceleration in China in those two. It's not a level to offset fully, as you've heard from Chris, but it's certainly that combined with the increased level of flu testing, DCBs and other areas that are doing better than expected. It offsets it for us across the company, and thus why Chris' comment that the complete change in guidance here is 100% associated with the Alaris pump.","Christopher Reidy","The only thing I would add to that is that the other thing that we saw as the situation developed is the distributors taking down their inventory levels much quicker than we would have originally anticipated as they saw this issue develop as well. So, a big chunk of that happened since the last time we spoke. And we really see that mostly impacting the second quarter. And so, the biggest hit from that additional $60 million that we took China down will hit us in the second quarter and then moderate somewhat in the third and fourth quarter. ","But, again, just to kind of go through the math, $200 million business. The last time we spoke, we took it down by $40 million, $200 million being the FY 2019 number. We took it down by $40 million and we're now taking it down an additional $60 million. So, the impact this year across that is $100 million just for that specific item, taking that business down to $100 million going forward. And there will be some spillover into next year, but as you might expect, to a somewhat lesser extent.","Tom Polen","Richard, maybe just to give you a little bit more color because it can be a little tricky. The comment on the distributors, the way that works \u2013 and it has a little bit disproportionate impact in the first year \u2013 is of course we're selling, we and other companies in China, we sell our products to distributors who then sell them to the customers. And so, if we've been selling them at a certain price to the distributors and they have a large inventory of those, they see this process now happening and the ability to now \u2013 they don't get stuck with a bunch of inventory at a higher price if the market price is going down. And so, they're bringing down their days inventory on hand, both so that they wait to see the pricing of all because they don't have bought at high prices and selling at low, and the other thing is they're looking at who's going to win these tenders becomes more uncertain in this environment. And so, again, they don't want to get stuck with a large amount of inventory and you see the channel then taking down the inventory concurrent with the situation. That's all comprehended in the updated guidance that we've given, but just want to give a little bit more color on why we made the comment on distributors have an impact.","Richard Newitter","That's really helpful color. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one the pump and one on DCBs, Tom. So, first, on the pump side, is the consent decree new? I'm sorry if I missed that. And what's the status of your next generation pump? Alaris has, obviously, been very successful, but I think it's been in the market for a while. ","And I'll just ask my follow-up up now. On the below-the-knee refiling, what's the status there? And how do you think the 12-month data link and the new metanalysis could impact the chances of approval? Thanks for taking the questions.","Tom Polen","Sure, Larry. I'll take the first question and I'll turn it over to Simon. So, the consent decree, of course, that's been in place from CareFusion at the time of acquisition. That does put certainly heightened regulatory oversight over that business, which also can influence certainly a dialogue with the FDA as well and expectations. And so, that's always been in place. That's nothing new and we're moving forward there. ","As we think about timing of our next generation pump, we do have a next generation pump in the pipeline. I'd say we \u2013 it's progressing well. We certainly don't want to talk about timing of submission of that today. The Alaris pump remains \u2013 it certainly is clearly the most preferred product by clinicians across the US and you can see that based on the trajectory over the last several years. And we remain very confident that it will be in a position to continue not only because of the benefits of the product itself, but how it's integrated across a broader medication management suite of solutions. It is very well positioned to be of continued preference going forward.","We've got to get this 510(k) catchup submitted, so that we can return to making that available to our customers and for patients. So, Simon, on DCB?","Simon Campion","Yeah. Good morning. Simon. With respect to the submission on BTK, I would say that we're well advanced in our preparation of that submission and I would say we'll be going into FDA sooner rather than later. So, that's about the size of things on that. ","And then, with respect to \u2013 I think you were asking about the more recent data that was published by Katanos, if you saw the information from Link [ph], a couple of weeks ago where we published three-year safety data, we continue to not see any safety signal with our data. And indeed, despite the limitations of the Katanos 2 paper, I think you will note that the significance with respect to the hand signal [ph] that they were seeing was not \u2013 or did not exist when you use a low dose DCB, which is what we have. ","So, is it going to material the impact FDA? I don't know. But we're well advanced in our preparation for that and the data that we continue to \u2013 really supports the safety of our products.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.","Matt Taylor ","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to have two little follow-ups on this Alaris situation. The first is, for the comprehensive 510(k) that you are filing and you guided to the end of the year for that, can you talk about any risks or upside there could be to the timing? How is that progressing? Is that a date you're pretty confident about? Is there any risk that flips or could get pulled forward?","Tom Polen","Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Again, we just had this \u2013 the most recent discussion with the FDA this Monday. So, I don't want to \u2013 certainly, we're very focused on \u2013 and we're already starting that work on the 510(k). We had had some of that momentum going well before then. But we're going to be in a better position to give you an update on that once we get through it. Our goal right now is to submit and seek clearance as quick as possible and to meet the expectations of the FDA. So, I think it will be premature to speculate on any timing of the clearance process. Thanks.","Matt Taylor ","Assuming that you do file that\u2026","Tom Polen","Sorry, Matt. I think we lost you.","Christopher Reidy","We go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.","Joshua Jennings","Good morning. Thanks. I was hoping to just ask about the Interventional business. You commented about the paclitaxel drug-coated balloon headwind improving. Any details you can provide just relative to that 50% decline stake that you put in the ground historically? ","And then, also any details just around the shifting of products from vascular surgery into the peripheral and what those products were and any rationale for that? Thanks a lot for taking the question.","Tom Polen","Josh, I would let Simon answer that.","Simon Campion","Yeah. So, Simon here, Josh. I think we've seen a sequential increase in performance here with respect to SSI DCBs. I won't give you the specifics, but it's \u2013 I would classify it as a material increase in our performance prior to what we saw in Q3 and Q4 last year. ","And then, with respect to sales force alignment, we transferred some of our PleurX business which is our drainage catheter business from the surgery business into the peripheral intervention business, and that's simply synergistic with the call points that we have there. We focus heavily on breast biopsy and implantable ports and delivery of chemotherapy. So, taking care of patients at the end of their life in relation to their pre-existing cancer, PleurX is a perfect fit for that sales force. So, that's what we've done.","Tom Polen","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.","Matthew Mishan","Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a quick follow-up and then a broader one. Does this also expand to the syringe in the pain pump in addition to the LVP pump? And then, as I think about Becton, I think the broader value proposition in medication management you have in the hospital, on the good side, I think that probably allows customers to be patient as you kind of work through some of these issues, but on the other side of it, would this not also affect the overall conversation or conversion of some of the broader portfolio with some of your customers or is it not related and maybe some delays in the conversion in other areas?","Tom Polen","Hey, Matthew. Thanks for the question. So, Alaris as a system it includes \u2013 it's all one system, right? So, the Alaris system which is \u2013 one of the reasons the customers do prefer it so much is that it includes an LVP, the syringe and the PCA. They all snap on as modules that you can choose from based on the patients and the types of medications that the patient requires and the administration route. So, those are all fully in scope and comprehended within the guidance that we gave you an update on. ","In terms of broader medication management strategy, I think you're exactly right that customers deeply value the full set of solutions there and that that provides an impetus that people want to move in that full direction and not necessarily say I want to just move to having an isolated product that's not helping me manage medications, it's just literally doing a pumping activity and I can't use the data to do things that I can, like how we're using data from pumps and Pyxis and other things to do diversion analytics that you just can't do with other solutions. ","So, I think you're right there. We don't see at this point impact even as we are doing broader medication management deals. Of course, there's multiple other products as part of that suite of solutions. There's Pyxis, there's Pyxis Logistics, there's Pyxis Prep, there's HealthSight, there's a number of other products. And those products, of course, can still be used with the existing Alaris space. So, there's nothing stopping people from continuing to add those products on as they continue to use their Alaris products and utilize the data coming off of Alaris to be used as part of that full solution. ","Thank you for the question.","Operator","Our final question is a follow-up from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to, I guess, China, what's the risk that \u2013 I know you're talking about the $200 million business, but just that it continues to spill into other product categories within the broader China business for you. Maybe just talk about the number of provinces that you are seeing and, I guess, just risk that it spreads more broadly within medical products. Thank you.","Tom Polen","Thanks for the questions, Kristen. I'll turn it over to Alberto to answer that.","Alberto Mas","Yes. The first thing that I'll say is that we're seeing no evidence of the [indiscernible] procurement applicable to any other category at this moment. The way that we tend to think about it is that there's probably three big variables for you to consider, whether they will consider any new categories that we're in. ","The first one will be the total spend of that category \u2013 is it in the top 10 or in the top 20 spend in the hospitals? And the two biggest parts of portfolio they have left, which is flush and PICCs do not fall into that category. The number of competitors \u2013 and again, the other categories within MDS, there's a significantly a less amount of categories. We're talking about a handful versus the peripheral catheters where there are over a dozen, approaching 20 plus small players. And then, the perception of commoditization as well is another factor. We do not think these conditions are necessarily all that applicable today to the other categories.","Tom Polen","Thank you, Alberto. Thank you, Kristen. ","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back over to Tom Polen for closing remarks.","Tom Polen","Great, thank you. So, as we close today, I want to reiterate BD's strong commitment to product quality, regulatory compliance and patient safety. You expect it, our customers deserve it and our patients depend on it. ","While I'm very disappointed that we had to lower our guidance today, I'm also confident that we'll look back on this moment as a catalyst for driving a better BD. Let me assure you that we are taking accountability, we're acting with urgency and we're proceeding with an unwavering commitment to our purpose and the patients we serve. ","I'm also confident that our broad portfolio, our global reach and our passionate team of associates provide an incredible opportunity to drive long-term growth and enable us to make a bigger impact on customers, patients and shareholders around the world. ","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"3369":["Becton, Dickinson & Co.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through May 14, 2015 on the Investors page of the BD.com website or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 21629817. I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment. Beginning today's call is Miss Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique N. Dolecki - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Christy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to review our second fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at BD.com.","During today's call we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our second fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of recent SEC filings. We will also discuss the non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release including the financial schedules is posted on the BD.com website.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Administration; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President of BD Medical; and Linda Tharby, Executive Vice President of BD Life Sciences. This quarter, we recorded certain pre-tax adjustments, which primarily reflect acquisition-related charges and financing charges. Details of these and other smaller charges can be found in press release attachments or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","As a reminder, our second quarter results are on a standalone basis and represent only BD. We will report combined BD-CareFusion results beginning with the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. In preparation for the newly combined company or new co-reporting, we have also provided slides which illustrate changes to our P&L, our new reportable segments, and the way we will report our geographies going forward. In addition, we have also provided pro forma historical revenue information on a combined basis, consistent with our new reporting structure. They can also be found in the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","Also, for the purposes of today's call, we will provide guidance for BD as a standalone company for the balance of fiscal year 2015 in addition to the combined BD-CareFusion outlook. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As we stated in our press release, we are proud of our final standalone quarter as we welcome CareFusion to BD.","Our results this quarter highlight our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio. We delivered solid revenue and EPS growth, which were in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, we delivered revenue growth of 5.1% and adjusted EPS growth of 11.6%, which reflects a growth profile consistent with our external commitments and long-term goals. As you already know, we officially consummated the acquisition of CareFusion on March 17. This transaction significantly advances our strategy in the Medical segment and accelerates our evolution into a customer-focused provider of complete solutions. Integration activities are progressing as planned, and the CareFusion business performance to date is mostly in line with our expectations.","Today, we're pleased to share our financial outlook on a combined basis. We are forecasting solid revenue and EPS growth, consistent with our expectations and with high level qualitative guidance we've provided over the past several months. On an annualized basis, we expect pro forma organic revenue growth of about 4.5%. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $7 and $7.10, which represents growth of about 19% to 20%.","On slide five, we've outlined the guidance for BD on a standalone basis, the impact of CareFusion for the remainder of our fiscal year, and summarized the total guidance for our combined company. As you can see, we continue to expect BD on a standalone basis to grow at about 5% on the top line and about 9% to 10% on the bottom line. The acquisition of CareFusion will add 23% to 24% accretion to revenues and about 10% accretion to earnings.","This results in revenue growth of 28% to 29% and earnings growth of about 19% to 20% for the total fiscal year. On a pro forma annual basis, which sums the organic results of both companies, we estimate BD and CareFusion's organic revenue growth would be about 4.5%. These financial metrics are consistent with our previously communicated high teens earnings accretion in fiscal year 2016. We're also reaffirming our commitment to deliver $250 million of cost synergies, which will be fully realized in fiscal year 2018. We will continue to update you as we make progress.","Now, I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our second quarter financial performance and our fiscal year 2015 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Vince, and good morning everyone. I'd like to begin by discussing our second quarter revenue and EPS results, as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter.","Total company revenues was solid increasing by 4.9%. Fully diluted adjusted EPS came in at $1.61, growing at 8.2% over the prior year, reflecting a difficult comparison to the prior year period as expected. As Vince mentioned earlier, our results this quarter highlight our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio. We experienced solid growth in both our Medical and Life Science segments. We also saw continued strength in safety-engineered products. We saw some softness in emerging markets mainly due to timing issues. Conversely, growth in the U.S. was strong, and I'll provide more color on these items in just a moment.","To summarize, we feel very good about the final standalone quarter and the year-to-date results. Our results year-to-date give us the confidence to reaffirm guidance for BD on a standalone basis. We expect to continue to deliver a very consistent growth profile of 5% on the top line and 9% to 10% on the bottom line.","We're also pleased to announce that we've already begun to deleverage the debt associated with the acquisition of CareFusion, paying down $650 million of the term loan at the end of April. I'll provide more explicit guidance details for BD and CareFusion later in my remarks.","Moving on to slide eight, I'll review our second quarter revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. Organic revenue growth was 4.9% for the total company. The impact of price erosion was about 10 basis points in the quarter. Year-to-date pricing is better than our expectations, but we are maintaining our full-year guidance of about 30 basis points of pressure.","BD Medical's second quarter revenues increased 5.4%. Growth in this segment was primarily driven by our Medical Surgical Systems unit. Medical Surgical growth was 7.5%, which reflects strong international safety sales. Growth in Diabetes Care was 4.1%, reflecting solid growth of pen needles, partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 2.6% also reflects an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period as expected.","BD Life Sciences second quarter revenues increased 4.4%, primarily driven by Diagnostic Systems and growth in Preanalytical Systems. Diagnostics Systems' growth of 7.8% was led by strong, clinical microbiology sales. We also continue to see good traction with the BD MAX platform internationally, where we expanded our menu offering. Preanalytical Systems' growth of 4.5% was driven by safety-engineered products and emerging markets.","Biosciences revenue growth was 0.8% in the second quarter, with strong instrument growth in U.S. and Western Europe. This was unfavorably impacted by the timing of government funding in Japan as we expected and communicated to you on our previous earnings call. Funding has been approved, and we expect growth to normalize by the end of the fiscal year.","Moving to slide nine, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the second quarter. Softer growth in our International business was supplemented by strong growth in the U.S. BD's reported U.S. revenues increased 4.5%, primarily driven by strength in Medical Surgical Systems, Diagnostic Systems and Biosciences. We view the environment in the U.S. as stable to improving slightly.","Revenue in our U.S. Medical segment increased by 3%. This was driven by our Medical Surgical Systems business, which benefited from strong growth in our flesh (10:26) product line. The Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical System units were partly impacted by the aforementioned difficult comparison to the prior year.","The U.S. Life Sciences segment grew by 6.1%. This reflects strong growth in Diagnostic Systems of 7.5%, driven by clinical microbiology sales. Biosciences growth of 7.7% was driven by strong research reagent and instrument sales.","Moving on to International, revenues grew 5.2% currency-neutral. Medical segment grew 6.9%, reflecting strong growth across the business and in international safety sales. The Life Sciences segment grew 3.2%, reflecting very strong growth in Diagnostic Systems of 8.1%. This was partially offset by the aforementioned impact of the timing of government funding in Japan in Biosciences.","On slide 10 you will see that emerging markets accounted for approximately 25.2% of our total revenues. Emerging market revenues grew 7.6% currency-neutral over the prior year, bringing our total growth year-to-date to 10%. In the second quarter, emerging market revenue growth was negatively impacted by the timing of orders in China as well as in EMA.","We also experienced a deceleration of growth in Brazil due to a slowing in government orders, as we expected. We indicated to you on our first quarter earnings call that we would keep an eye on Brazil given the macroeconomic conditions there. We expect our growth in that region to improve in the second half of our fiscal year.","For the total year, we expect growth in emerging markets of about 10%, with growth in China expected to be in the 18% to 19% range. Safety revenues grew 10.8% in emerging markets, due to the aforementioned items in China and Brazil.","Moving to global safety on slide 11. Currency-neutral sales increased 8.7% and grew to $550 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 2.2% while International sales grew 16.3% currency-neutral. Medical safety growth was 11.6%, with strong international growth driven by all three businesses. Life Science safety growth was 5.8% in the quarter.","Turning to slide 12 and our gross profit margin for the second quarter. On a performance basis, margin expansion was driven by favorable product mix and continuous improvement initiatives. These contributions were slightly offset by higher pension expenses and other items. Raw materials were about flat in the quarter. Also, you will see that currency did not have an impact on gross profit. This was driven by translation adjustments recognized in the quarter due to the timing of inventory movements, otherwise known as profit and inventory.","Slide 13 recaps the second quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency-neutral results on an adjusted basis. As we discussed, revenue and GP were in line with our expectations. SSG&A increased about 4.5%, which reflects increased investments in emerging markets, higher pension expense and an unfavorable comparison to the prior year. R&D increased 3.7%. This remains in line with our expectations at 6.3% of revenues as we continue to invest in new product development and innovation.","Operating income grew 6.5% in the quarter, reflecting solid P&L leverage. Our tax rate declined by 90 basis points, which benefited from favorable geographic mix. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $1.61, which is an 8.2% increase versus the prior year, reflecting a difficult comparison to the prior year period.","On slide 15, I'd like to provide a little more color on the revenue growth phasing for BD and CareFusion, which operated on different fiscal years. Most of you may already be familiar with CareFusion's publicly disclosed fiscal year 2015 revenue growth guidance of 5% to 7%. As illustrated, the results for CareFusion's fiscal year 2015 are in line with that guidance, which we expect to land at about 6%. We expect a revenue decline in CareFusion's fourth fiscal quarter of 5% to 7% due to a very tough comparison versus the prior year period in the infusion business, which grew at about 40%.","Growth is also unfavorably impacted by a voluntary recall on the Respiratory Solutions business, which I'll touch on in just a moment. We expect growth to normalize in CareFusion's first fiscal quarter of 2016 and return to 3% to 5%. This will result in BD's organic revenues growing 1% to 2% in the third quarter and about 4% to 5% in the fourth quarter, driving rateable earnings in the back half of the year.","As Vince and I mentioned earlier, BD has maintained a consistent revenue growth profile of about 5%, which we expect to continue for the balance of BD's fiscal year. To summarize and to arrive at BD's NewCo organic revenue growth, we have combined BD's full fiscal year with CareFusion's second quarter and third quarter and our expectations of CareFusion's fourth quarter and for what would have been their first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The result is pro forma organic revenue growth of approximately 4.5%.","For transparency, we'd like to take a moment to provide some color on CareFusion's third quarter of fiscal year 2015. Tomorrow we will issue our 10-Q. The filing will show revenues, net income and earnings per share for BD and CareFusion for the period ending March 31. Due to the numerous adjustments for both companies, there will be limited visibility into CareFusion's underlying business performance in their third fiscal quarter. While we do not plan to discuss their third quarter results at length, we wanted to share some of the key insights into the business performance in the quarter.","CareFusion's revenue growth was solid at 5.4% currency neutral. Revenue growth was impacted by about 240 basis points from unfavorable currency translation. While CareFusion has a relatively small international presence, FX has been very volatile and has negatively impacted their results. There are a number of items that negatively impacted operating margin in the quarter, which we estimate would have been about 18% to 19% of revenues on an underlying basis, or at about 19.5% year-to-date.","Prior to our completion of the acquisition, CareFusion recorded a charge related to a recall in Respiratory Solutions. We are anticipating lost revenues in addition to the remediation costs associated with this recall. This was not contemplated in our original forecast for CareFusion and has an unfavorable impact of about $0.05 to earnings per share for BD's fiscal year. We expect to be able to start shipping again by the end of our fiscal year.","On the dispensing side of CareFusion's business, we are pleased with the traction of Pyxis ES. As the CareFusion management team indicated previously, there is a healthy demand for this product which also comes with a lengthier implementation process. This is in line with our expectations. And due to the more complex implementation process, there has been and will continue to be a more significant investment of resources dedicated to Pyxis ES.","CareFusion's third quarter results reflect a more significant investment here, in addition to lower revenue growth, which was impacted by a pull-forward into the second quarter. On the infusion side of the business, CareFusion delivered strong results as the team worked to continue to install the record number of committed contracts it had coming into the quarter, as well as to realize the benefit of the strong capital placements it had over last year.","As CareFusion's previous management team shared with you, strong capital placements in the infusion business results in pressure on the overall company's margins in the short term. We expect to see higher margin consumables in the long run. Lastly, we are pleased with the performance in the former procedural solutions business, which lacked the vital signs acquisition last quarter and continues to leverage its clinically differentiated product portfolio. As a reminder, these businesses will be reported in BD's new reporting structure going forward.","Now moving on to slide 16, there are a number of moving parts that impact earnings per share in fiscal year 2015. For modeling purposes and to ensure consistency, I'd like to provide more color on EPS guidance.","Starting with BD's legacy business, adjusted earnings per share for fiscal year 2014 were $6.50. In fiscal year 2015, we expect to grow earnings by about 9% to 10% on an underlying basis. This is very consistent with the earnings growth profile we've communicated for some time. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency is about 10%, which is an incremental 100-basis point headwind to the guidance we provided in February. This contemplates a euro-to-dollar exchange ratio of about $1.11 and brings our current adjusted earnings per share to $6.43 to $6.50.","In addition, we expect underlying currency-neutral accretion from the CareFusion acquisition of about 11%. As I just mentioned, we also have an unfavorable impact from the Respiratory recall of about $0.05. From an investment standpoint, we plan to accelerate our product registration process and international markets, and this is dilutive to earnings by $0.02. The net of these items results in 10% accretion. Due to the volatility of FX movements, we anticipate an additional currency headwind to CareFusion's earnings of about 100 basis points. This results in NewCo earnings of $7 to $7.10 or growth of 19% to 20% on a currency-neutral basis.","While it's still too premature to talk in detail about fiscal year 2016, we think that it's important to be clear on the new baseline in which to calculate future earnings for BD. As I just mentioned, our new fiscal year 2015 EPS base for BD standalone is $6.43 to $6.50. Starting from this point, you can apply BD's traditional earnings growth profile of about 10%, and then add our guidance of high-teens earnings accretion on top of that. We hope this provides more clarity around the base earnings assumption to help in calculating the accretion from the transaction.","Another important element to note is that while we expect to deliver about 10% FX and accretion in fiscal year 2015, we are reaffirming our guidance of high teens accretion of fiscal year 2016. Some of the anticipated accretion benefits have been accelerated into this fiscal year, as we're able to reduce duplicative public company costs quickly. From a phasing perspective, this means that we expect to achieve approximately $40 to $50 million in synergies in fiscal year 2015, with the balance being fairly rateable. We are committed to fully realizing $250 million in cost synergies in fiscal year 2018, but as Vince mentioned earlier, we will update you on our synergy expectations as we make progress.","Now turning to slide 17, I'd like to walk you through the additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2015. We expect revenue growth for NewCo to be 28% to 29%, with BD Medical growing at 48% to 49%, and Life Sciences growing at about 5%. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 52% to 52.5%. BD and CareFusion have similar gross margin profiles when reclassifying certain items consistent with BD's legacy reporting structure. As expected, we do not anticipate material incremental synergy improvement in GP in fiscal year 2015 beyond the operational efficiencies in the company's base plans. SSG&A is expected to be about 25%. The dilutive effect of CareFusion's SSG&A profile is offset by our expected synergies, resulting in a spend profile similar to BD's historical average. As I just mentioned, we continue to see a significant opportunity leveraging our global infrastructure to sell CareFusion's products, and we are accelerating our product registration process in international markets.","We expect our R&D investment to be in line with fiscal year 2014 at about 6% of revenues. As a new company, we will continue to invest in new products and platforms, including incremental R&D investments in emerging markets. As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 20.5% and 21% of revenues. Similar to SSG&A, the dilutive impact of Carefusion's margin is offset by synergy achievement as we anticipate seeing an acceleration of operating margin expansion in the back half of this fiscal year.","Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and pension expense, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve by about 60 basis points to 80 basis points for the total fiscal year. As you can see, we expect our tax rate to be between 23% and 24%, with a rate of 21.2% in the first half of BD's fiscal year and a higher blended tax rate for the second half of the year. This reflects a new geographical mix of profits. Please keep in mind, this higher tax rate is reflective of the six-month impact from CareFusion.","Next, while we normally don't provide guidance for these line items, for clarity and for consistency, we anticipate Interest\/Other to be about $250 million, and an average fully diluted share count to be 207 million for fiscal year 2015. In fiscal year 2016, we're expecting an average fully diluted share count of $218 million.","In a sizable acquisition like this, the success of the integration is of critical importance. We are very comfortable that we are off to a great start and feel confident in our ability to deliver on the financial guidance we provided. Of course, we'll continue to keep you updated as we move forward.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide a brief update on our progress around our key initiatives.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Chris. Moving on to slide 19, I would like to review the program and product launches in our Medical segment. As we announced in March, we closed our acquisition of CRISI Medical Systems following FDA approval for Intelliport. It gives BD access to the injection safety market with a differentiated platform that we believe, when combined with our new CareFusion portfolio, will significantly enhance our growing end-to-end I.V. medication safety offering.","Also, we recently received 510(k) clearance on our Infusion \u2013 Insulin Infusion Sets. We continue to expect a product launch in fiscal year 2016. This product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery, simplify the user's experience and it increase a patient's overall satisfaction with insulin pumping.","Turning to slide 20, you will see the various product launches in Life Sciences. Within the Diagnostics business, our BD MAX molecular instrument continues to gain traction with customers in Western Europe, where our expanded menu is enabling increased placements. We remain focused on menu expansion on that platform, and in the second quarter, we launched the new CE-marked GC\/CT and GC\/CT Trich assays on the instrument.","Within Biosciences, we continued to anticipate the launch of two additional BD Horizon Dyes based on the Sirigen technology. As we have been sharing with you, these dyes are enabling significant gains in multiparameter flow cytometry analysis. We also anticipate the launch of two instruments, the X-14 high-parameter multi-color research instrument and the BD FACSVia clinical instrument aimed to enable increased market adoption in emerging markets, particularly in China. In addition to these new product launches, we are also focused on successful commercial launches of our many recently launched products. As you can see, we continue to have strong opportunities in our pipeline, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year.","On slide 21, before we open the call to questions, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, we're proud of our final stand-alone quarter. We have built a strong foundation for future growth while delivering on our financial and operational goals. Second, we continue to evolve into a customer-focused provider of complete solutions. The combination of the two companies will further enable us to deliver end-to-end solutions from drug preparation through dispensing and administration, that increase efficiencies, reduce medication errors, and improve patient safety in both hospitals and pharmacies.","Based on our visits with customers, early feedback has been extremely positive as they see the value we can deliver by improving both cost and outcomes. We very much look forward to growing our business together with CareFusion. Third, we are pleased with our solid NewCo financial performance. Given our proven track record of success, we are confident in our ability to integrate this sizable acquisition. We believe we can continue to deliver on our commitments and further leverage our capabilities as we strengthen this new company. Finally, we are well-positioned for continued success in fiscal year 2015 and beyond. We look forward to the future with confidence.","Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. (Operator instructions).","Thank you. Our first question is coming from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. I was trying to -","Unknown Speaker","Good morning, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'm just trying to slip in two quick ones here. I apologize. The first one, thanks for the earnings bridge you provided into 2016. They're just for clarity, I think, in light of some other competitive reports. If you think about fiscal 2016 and the bridge you provide, it kind of sticks you in sort of the mid-$8s, mid-$8 range for fiscal 2016. I just wondered if you comment on whether that's a reasonable range.","And my second question is just digging in deeper, Vince, on CareFusion, you have two specific elements. You talked on the deal announcement about Pyxis and the tailwind of Pyxis. Can you talk about in light of the sequential change in growth rates, how you're thinking about that Pyxis tailwind across multiple quarters and any updated thoughts on the backlog?","And then, on the Respiratory recall, are we still talking about NV and (30:21) ReVel? And maybe you could quantify perhaps the impact on revs or growth that that recall is having. Thank you very much.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well, let's do the CareFusion side first. And what I would say, and then I'll ask Tom to comment is, we really don't have any change in our perspective on the growth rate around Pyxis. We see solid customer demand. We see a continued strong backlog. The thing was quite lumpy as we went through the transition in terms of ownership, but in terms of fundamental demand, I don't think we don't see any changes. Tom?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hi, David. This is Tom Polen. Certainly on Pyxis, we still are at a record high in terms of the backlog itself. And I think as prior management had talked about in CareFusion, the insulation is a more complex insulation than the predecessor product. And now that we own CareFusion, we're very, very focused on driving forward to improve our ability to install the systems in a fast and more efficient manner. And so a lot of those core BD process improvement strengths we actually have now our Lean and Six Sigma teams engaging very deeply with that ES organization to help lean that out and hopefully shorten that cycle time as we move forward.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","David, on the 2016, I think that's why on chart 16 we gave the basis of $6.43 to $6.50, and then you would grow that at around the 10% that we normally guide to and then grow that by the high-teens accretion, and it puts you right into that range that you mentioned in the mid-$8s.","So I think we're comfortable with that. But what I would point out is that there's still models out there that aren't getting the number of shares right and so that's why we actually gave the 16 shares of the $218 million. I'd also caution on tax rate, the tax rate we're giving for 23% to 24% this year only has the 27% to 29% CareFusion impact for half a year. So when you annualize that next year, you get another tick-up or so of a percent in the tax rate. So I'd caution on that. And then interest expense is always difficult to calculate going forward. So we gave the base for this year, and should be able to use that going forward. So those are the three that I think a number of models out there aren't getting right, but in terms of the general neighborhood, it's right on.","So, I'll turn it back over to Tom, and he'll come back to the recall for you, David.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hi, David. This is Tom. So the recall is not on ReVel, it's on AVEA. And just maybe a little bit of comments on that further to those that Chris and Vincent made. So, prior to completion of the acquisition, CareFusion had initiated the process for that AVEA ventilator recall. We've since notified the FDA and applicable customers. We're not aware of any patient injuries resulting from the defect and we're doing this proactively. As Chris mentioned, a liability was recorded on the CareFusion opening balance sheet for the cost to remediate.","We have identified the root cause, we're actively handling the remediation. However, during that remediation period, we're going to be unable to ship the new AVEA ventilators for a period of time here in the second half. We do expect to begin re-shipping this summer, and so we'll see some sales growth headwind in that business unit while that product's on hold, which will alleviate as we begin to ship again in the second half of this fiscal year.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay, thanks, Tom. Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Mike.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you hear me okay?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","We can now.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Now we can, yeah, Mike.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. I'm sorry. So, I've got a long list of questions, but I'm going to try to narrow it down. So, let me start with the CareFusion portfolio. The ventilator business is giving you \u2013 or at least, the Respiratory business is giving you a little bit of a headache with the recall. But can you just talk more broadly how you're thinking about some of those assets, Respiratory and other, some of the lower margin consumable pieces within the CareFusion portfolio and whether those will stay with the company longer term?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, Mike. So as we previously said, we're going through a strategic review process with those businesses. We've actually tied that process into our normal strategic planning process now, which I think you're familiar with. It goes on basically during the summer and wraps up then. So we're working hard to get to a decision. We want to go through this and look at it both strategically and financially in terms of the value that we can create. And so we want to get to answers over the next few months. We do see some opportunities in those businesses so we want to be thoughtful about this, but we haven't made a decision yet.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. It sounded like from the BD side that growth actually should get better in the second half of the fiscal year. Japan and the Biosciences business sound like it will start to improve off of what was, obviously, a very difficult quarter for that piece. The Latin American business sounded like it was going to get better, China sounded like it was going to get better. So are there any offsets that we should be aware of relative to what was basically a bunch of positive comments for the second half relative to the second quarter?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I don't think there's any significant negatives, Mike, that we're talking about. We do think that Mexico is going to get a little better. I think that, getting into a little bit more detail, that we're not expecting Brazil to get better. We expect that to be continued softness for the balance of the year. You're right about Japan coming back because we know that the funding has been released in Japan. So we're confident on that piece. And there was, coming back to China, we do expect that was really timing within the quarter and China's gonna grow around, what, 19% or so, Chris, if I remember, 18% to 19%?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, yeah, I would say that's a pretty good picture. For the most part, most of those items that you talked about we contemplated in the last call and pointed towards. I think the only watch-out is still Brazil. We do expect that to rebound a little bit based on timing of orders, but, as you know, the economic environment there is still under a lot of pressure. So that's still a watch-out.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then two more real quick for you, Chris. So, one, the accelerated paydown of some of the debt is positive and it looks like there's the opportunity for the debt load to reduce faster than what we were originally assuming, so could you talk about that?","And then second, on the pro forma tax rate, I just want to push back a little bit. The BD's pro forma tax rate was basically running at 22% plus or minus. CareFusion's was coming down through a number of initiatives that they had. But even if we look backward and assume that their rate stayed where it was, you guys shouldn't be at 25% plus. You guys should be probably more in the 24% to 25% range before any tax strategies. So can you just talk a little bit about that and whether there's some conservatism there on the guidance? Thanks.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So let me address that piece first. That's what I was implying. We gave guidance for the remainder of this year of 23% to 24%. And the point I made that next year they still are at 27% to 29% based on their own previous guidance.","And so when you put the full weight of that in next year, you are in that range of 24% to 25%. So I didn't mean to imply we're over 25%, but it's a little bit up from the 2015 guidance that we gave of 23% to 24% just based on the weighting. But that brings you to the zone that you talked about.","In terms of the paydown of the debt, this was in line with what our expectations were, as we described if you recall, in 8-K in November we talked about that. And what we were guiding to is committing to be being below 3 times leverage within a couple of years. And so the $650 million of paydown was right in line with that.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to start on the BD Diagnostics business, which showed very strong performance in the quarter, particularly in the U.S. And I was hoping you could go into just a little bit more details into the underlying drivers there and what we're seeing from some of the new product launches that you introduced a number of years ago, whether it's Veritor or BD MAX or something going on in the underlying business.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. I'll turn it over to Linda Tharby.","Linda Tharby - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, David. So yes, good strength in our business in the U.S. That was driven by our core blood culture business, so a number of placements there and increased share position and the pull-through on that. And also, as you noted on our flu business continued to gain share in both our Veritor platform, and then a strong early flu season, which we saw the tail on that in the second quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question -","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, it was really core microbiology that drove it. Thank you, David.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Brian Weinstein of William Blair.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Vince, you had mentioned some acceleration in spending for product registrations. Maybe Tom can speak a little bit to specific products that you're talking about, and does this change the timing of expected revenue synergies that might come from those products? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Tom, you want to talk to that?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Hey, Brian. This is Tom. We're specifically focused right now on \u2013 we've talked a lot about China, obviously being a high area of interest for us from a synergy perspective. And so, that's right now, the primary area that we're focused on registrations in. There are other geographies. So as we have shared in the past, we're looking at -- the revenue synergy opportunities being more in the 2017-plus window. And as you know, registrations in China typically can be up to a two-year process. And so, we don't see that changing, but we see us just getting a jump start on moving forward with what we've already shared.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jeffries.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Quick one for Chris. In terms of the operating cash flow outlook for the year, are there any discrete cash outlays related to the acquisition to be aware of, either in the back half or as it relates to next year?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I wouldn't say anything specific to point to. Obviously, we have impacts of the cost that we're driving to get synergies, so that's obviously cash, but that's one of the reasons why we wanted to give some guidance on what the combined company was. And that would be about $2.1 billion on that NewCo basis for the remainder of the year. If you remember, we were at about $1.85 billion and about half of the CareFusion operating cash flow runs around $250 million or thereabout. So, on a combined basis, so nothing really to point to there.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Rick Wise of Stifel.","Rick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Rick.","Rick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Maybe just to start with a bigger picture question, Vince, for you, just reflecting again on the strategic rationale for CareFusion. I know it's early in the process, but, Vince, do you feel like you're seeing any early indications that putting CareFusion in Becton is having, just an impact on the kinds of conversations you're having with hospitals about your concept of continuum of care? I'm asking less about new business one, but is it changing conversations? Do you feel more optimistic that it's going to change your dialogue with these customers?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Rick, absolutely. I had the opportunity to go out in the field, and I visited quite a few customers. In fact, we had a number of people from the management team out with CareFusion and BD sales reps. And I would say it is a \u2013 it's a very full and deep conversation around the process. It's not just about the product. It's about the integration of that product into the process and the IT components. And so, it's \u2013 it is a very different conversation with the management team at these hospitals. So I was very encouraged by the feedback that I got directly in person from these accounts. So, yeah, I would say so. I feel real good about it. Tom was out there with me. He was on a second team, and we hit quite a few large customers.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to, I guess, talk through \u2013 I guess for clarification, I guess you mentioned that the U.S. benefited from \u2013 in the Diagnostic business a stronger flu season. Any way to quantify that from a broader top-line perspective?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, I think the comment was really back about the previous quarter, not so much in this quarter. Very small in this quarter. I mean, we're talking like $3 million. So, negligible.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.","Vijay M. Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Vijay M. Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking my question. So, Vince, I just want to go back to the earlier question on sort of having this breadth of product portfolio. I think in your prepared comments, you sort of touched upon it. And we certainly see consolidation being a team within the whole med supplies channel. Now, I'm just curious, do you feel like from an assets perspective, do you have the right mix of assets? Do you have the right breadth as you go after these larger accounts in a changing healthcare environment? Sort of, what are your longer term thoughts on the mix of assets?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So I think in terms of the medication management space, if you go back and look, and remember that chart we showed you about medication management being a $20 billion industry and the breadth that we have across that, I think we feel very good about that breadth. I would say what was new for me in the field was the excitement that combining BD and CareFusion was bringing, as the customers saw both the concept of Intelliport and CRISI added to what CareFusion already had. And so I think with that, we're in very good shape in terms of the portfolio.","I think that we're also excited about the small pump from Cesar Medical (46:15). And including that in the portfolio, we see opportunity there. We do think that we will have to do more work in the long run as we think about expansion in emerging markets. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we've started the whole registration processes for the products that fixed. But we do believe over the long run, it's not so much an asset purchase as it is market development and it is strategic marketing to understand the needs in those areas and how we can drive that further.","Tom, would that be consistent with your thinking?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Absolutely. I think one of the other things is maybe, Vijay, to answer your question around longer term is how we in the longer term leverage now the strength that we have in the hospital and begin to follow that into new care settings that are being driven by payer changes, right, as patients are moving into lower cost settings. So we think we have optionalities going forward that maybe we didn't have in the past.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, I think that's a great point. Thanks, Vijay.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co","Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning, Bill.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co","So, on microbiology, we certainly noticed a trend over the past couple of years where we're seeing a relatively dearth of new products coming out of the chemistry and the immunochemistry side of the market. On the other hand, we're seeing a lot of innovation coming out of microbiology, broadly speaking.","So, can you comment a little bit on the drivers here for BD. And I guess, specifically, help us think about how sustainable this increase that you saw in the quarter is, maybe over the year and the next couple years. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, I think Linda can talk to that.","Linda Tharby - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So let me maybe handle the second part of the question first, which is the sustainability of the growth. So, certainly for the U.S. market, we have been seeing improvements in that platform broadly on our core blood culture business. bioM\u00e9rieux had some issues in the front half. We see them coming out of that now in the back half. So, we will see some stabilization back to more normal market growth rates in the back half.","But more broadly, for our microbiology business, we have been focused very much on improvements in our ID\/AST platforms, and also in our lab automation. So, our KIESTRA platform now, we're very excited. We're really starting to see increased placements now in the U.S., which we'll start to see in the coming year. So, a lot of evolution in the core micro lab that BD is really driving.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. We're just getting started with KIESTRA in the U. S. We're just making our first placements. We think that we have a long way to go, as Linda was indicating, with lab automation there. As Linda also indicated, we have gained some share in that business because both some competitive difficulties, but some new products and new resins we've had out in the marketplace in blood culture. So we're performing very well in that core business, and, of course, on top of that then, we're looking to continue to drive BD MAX and get that menu done, but I think the business is doing a good job.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Wondering if you could just go back into the emerging markets growth, which is, you pointed out, was slower than we'd been seeing in the past. And I think you called out some timing of orders and some other things. But I'm wondering if you could kind of dive back into that and help us understand why those businesses, particularly China, comes back.","And then, also, just so I understand, the gaining of the synergies, are you basically saying what's left over, the $40 million to $50 million that you get this year, what's left over from that out of the $250 million is ratable through fiscal 2018?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Chris, why don't you start?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay, let me start with that one. So the way I would talk about the synergies, if you think about the $250 million over a three and a half year period, kind of implies $70 million a year and about half of that \u2013 and half year would be $35 million. That's why we're saying we really got a little bit more than that from a ratable standpoint in the initial six months. But as we look out, we see that as more of a pull-forward, so the remainder of the next three years kind of gets you to that $250 million on a ratable basis.","Moving to your other question, I think that what we were pointing to in the timing, particularly in an area like China, is the fact that it's not an indication of the underlying growth. And China's been growing very nicely now, as you know, for a number of years, and we're not seeing a tick-down that's significant, particularly on the dollar increase. Clearly, the bigger the base that we have, it will have an impact on the growth rate going forward. But right now, we're seeing the China business in that area of 18% to 19%, and we wanted to point to the fact that this quarter was an anomaly of order timing. The same is actually true in EMA where we had some order timing issues and so we wanted to make it clear that that was not systemic.","Now, in Brazil, a little bit different story. We had some order timing based on government orders and government tenders, but a little bit more of an issue there in terms of the economic environment. But we do expect that to come back a little bit in our second half of the year, but not as robust as it's been in the last couple of years. So we just wanted to give you that kind of flavor.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And just to add a little bit more detail on China, that was mostly Pharm Systems order timing; we're not talking about the government delaying orders.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Right.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","This is the normal lumpiness that we have globally in Pharm Systems.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Clearing customs.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, clearing customs. So this was the normal stuff that happens there, not a Chinese-driven situation.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners.","Rich S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a quick one on buybacks. Can you just remind us what and when you might resume buybacks?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So we mentioned that we would be committed to paying down the debt, and so that's our first order of priority. And we're committed to getting under 3 times leverage in the next couple of years. That'll be the priority. So we don't envision any share buybacks during that period of time.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I guess I have a question for each of you. Vince, in one of the opening lines to your prepared remarks, you indicated that CareFusion was performing largely in line with your expectations. Did you use that language specifically and solely because of the AVEA recall?","And then, Tom, what's the criteria you're using to evaluate potential divestitures and what's the associated timeline? Chris, your comments on tax rate for fiscal 2016, just to be clear, that guidance is based on weighting of geographic exposure solely and doesn't seem to incorporate assumptions for further tax optimization efforts. And then, Linda, any update on Viper LT? It's been quiet on that front for a little while. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","There you go. A good five-part question that you have. It's funny because when I read that line, I was wondering if somebody would ask me that question. But the answer is, yes, it was the AVEA recall that I was referring to specifically when I said that. So that's part number one.","Part number two was around I think the timing in terms of the portfolio, if I remember correctly. What we're working on is a process that is integrated with our strategic planning process. So in terms of making the decisions, we said that process is going to continue through the summer. But we're looking to try to get to a real conclusion around that in that kind of timeframe.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And with regard to the tax issue, from the very beginning we were saying that tax optimization is something we would expect to be able to get to but was not in our model because it takes a while to do that. That's a lot of pick-and-shovel work. So what I was referring to is that in the early years, it's going to be 27% to 29% of their rate. Our rate of 21.5% to 22.5%, you get some shield for the interest, obviously. That would be in that 50 basis point to 75 basis point range. That's a complicated calculation that has implications on foreign tax credits and a number of other things that offset it.","So when you put all that in the mix, you would expect to be in the 23% to 24% this year and 24% to 25% next year, but not contemplating any tax optimization because it won't come that quickly we wouldn't expect. And we would expect that to be something a couple years down the road that we'll be able, as we did with the BD tax rate, to drive that down through optimizing tax structures. We would expect to be able to do that, but it'll take a little while to get there.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And Linda, on the Viper LT.","Linda Tharby - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, so on the Viper LT platform, of course, that's replacing our ProbeTec platform. We're seeing some gains in Western Europe, particularly with the ProbeTec CT Assay\/ ProbeTec GC Assay that we talked about earlier on that platform, and we're beginning to see traction in the U.S. market on the platform.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay, thanks. Thanks, Linda. Thanks for the question. All five parts.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. I only...","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","HHave a two-part question. So just thinking about the CareFusion organic revenue growth rate of the business going forward, I mean you're talking about exiting in your Q4, their first quarter, in that 3% to 5% range. Is that a sort of a good basis just to think about the long-term organic revenue growth rate characteristics of that business? Assuming we're not talking about the synergies coming from international sales, your base assumption for the core.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, the way I would say that starts getting back into the range. We've been saying all along that we see it more as a kind of a 3.5% underlying organic. And I think that's about right.","If you notice on my chart 15, we said for the pro forma fiscal year 2015, it was around 3%. But they had a particularly difficult compare in their fourth quarter, which we pointed to, of 5% to 7% down against a very significant quarter they had the prior year. So, if you normalize for that, it takes you up to that kind of 3.5%. So that's probably the way to be thinking about that going forward.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is coming from Mark Massaro of Canaccord Genuity.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This will be a two-part question here. So, you guys called out good performance in Western Europe on BD MAX. Would be curious if you could describe the competitive environment in the U.S. and what you're seeing, and if that increased year-over-year in the United States. And then, secondly, on Veritor, could you update us maybe on your install base and thoughts on what the next gen Veritor will have that the existing platform does not have? Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Linda Tharby - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay, so on the MAX platform specific to the U.S., what we're seeing there is we have got \u2013 now we're seeing increased placements but leveled off in terms of quarters. And we're really working on the efficiency of that platform and the reliability of that platform, as well as the expanded menu. So we're encouraged by what we see in Western Europe. It's just going to take us time to get those assays through the FDA. So look for more to come towards the back half of 2016 and 2017 on that platform.","And then the second part of the question is on the Veritor. We continue to see expanded share placements on that platform. I don't have the total number of placements now in the U.S. market. But continue to see expanded placements, particularly in physician offices and in the retail setting.","The second generation, we're really going to be working on, as Tom mentioned earlier. As we see care shifting to new environments, it's really important for us on the interconnectivity of IT on those platforms. So that's what the next generation of Veritor will bring in 16. So total placements now on Veritor, just over 15,000 placements globally.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay, thank you for your questions. Any more questions? That's it. Okay. So thank you very much for being with us today. It was an exciting start to bring in these two companies together. As I mentioned in my remarks, we look forward to the future with a lot of confidence. We're excited about the solution that we have pulled together and look forward to talking to you about it as the year progresses. Thanks very much.","Christopher R.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through February 12th, 2015, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at (800) 585-8367 for domestic calls and area code (404) 537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 64069271.","I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only-mode until the question and answer segment. Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first fiscal quarter results.","As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our first fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules is posted on the bd.com website.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Administration; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, Segment President; Linda Tharby, Segment President; and Alberto Mas, President of Diagnostic Systems.","This quarter we recorded pretax adjustments totaling $97 million or $0.34 per share. These adjustments consisted of acquisition related charges, legal charges and the amortization of acquisition related intangibles.","Last quarter we noted that we would be moving to a cash EPS basis going forward. These adjustments were also made for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 for comparison purposes and can be found in the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","I would also like to note, that the guidance provided today is on a BD standalone basis. If we close on the transaction before the end of the first calendar quarter, we plan to provide guidance for BD's together with CareFusion on our regularly scheduled second quarter earnings conference call.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As we stated in our press release, we're off to a really good start this fiscal year. We're pleased with our first quarter results, with strength coming from both our Medical and Life Science segments.","Our first quarter results were also aided by a stronger than expected flu season. Our core business remained strong, which is consistent with the results we've recorded for the past 10 consecutive quarters. We continue to have a robust pipeline, with recent product launches continuing to gain traction.","Growth in the quarter was also driven by strong sales in emerging markets and safety engineered products. Our pending acquisition of CareFusion remains on track with an expected closing date before the end of the first calendar quarter. I will provide an update on our integration planning later in the call.","Overall, things are progressing quite nicely. Our solid revenue growth in operating performance this quarter in combination with our performance in fiscal year 2014 gives us the confidence to raise our fiscal year 2015 currency-neutral revenue and earnings guidance.","Moving on to slide 5, I will review our first quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company revenue growth was strong at 5.3%. Fully diluted EPS came in at a $1.20, which included a number of charges which Monique just mentioned. Adjusted EPS was $1.53, which represents growth of 15.4% over the prior year.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris, who will walk you through our first quarter financial performance, and updated guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin on slide 7 by discussing the key highlights for the first quarter, which I'll speak to on a currency-neutral basis.","As Vince just mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which were ahead of our expectations. Revenue growth of 5.3% was aided by stronger flu season in last year. This contributed about 80 basis points to grow.","Our tax rate declined year-over-year representing the impact of the reinstated R&D tax credit as we had contemplated in our guidance. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.53 grew 15.4% in the first quarter when compared with the prior year. Earnings were ahead of our expectations, primarily due to stronger revenue growth, coupled with a lower tax rate.","As Vince just mentioned, our strong performance in the first fiscal quarter gives us the confidence to raise currency-neutral revenue and EPS guidance for the year, which I will talk to in more detail in a few moments.","On slide 8, I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. As you know, we have recently moved to a two segments structure, for transparency and to align with how we provided guidance, we are providing additional summarized information for the Life Sciences segment.","As I just mentioned, first quarter revenue growth was 5.3% for the total company. The impact of pricing pressure in the quarter was about 20 basis points as expected.","BD Medical first quarter revenues increased 4.2%. Within the Medical segment, Medical Surgical growth was 6.8% this quarter, aided by strong international safety growth. Diabetes Care growth of 3.6%, reflects continued strength of pen needles, partially offset by order timing in the US and an unfavorable comparison for the prior year.","Pharmaceutical Systems' decline of 1.9% was unfavorably impacted by ordering patterns, subsequent to strong fourth quarter revenue growth. This was inline with our expectations and consistent with our communications on our last earnings call.","BD Life Science first quarter revenues increased 6.5%. The segment's growth was driven by strong sales across its three business units. Growth in Diagnostics was 6.5%. Preanalytical Systems' growth of 5.2% was driven by safety-engineered products and geographic expansion.","Diagnostics Systems growth of 7.8% was driven by core microbiology growth which reflects a stronger flu season and strong blood culture performance. We continue to capture significant share with our Veritor platform. We now have over 15,000 instruments and used today at hospitals, clinics and doctor's offices. We also continue to see good traction with the BD MAX platform. Biosciences' revenue growth was 6.7% in the first quarter driven by strong instrument placements and international growth.","Moving to slide 9, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter on a currency-neutral basis. BD's US revenues increased 3.7% versus the prior year, which benefited from some timing in the medical segment and flu sales in the Life Sciences segment. We view the hospital environment in the US as stable to improving slightly.","Revenue in our US Medical segment increased by 3.6%. This was driven by pharmaceutical systems order timing, a favorable comparison to the prior year and solid growth in medical, surgical systems. The Diabetes Care unit was partly impacted by the aforementioned timing of orders.","US Life Science segment grew 3.9%, strong diagnostic systems US growth was negatively impacted by continued declines in our women's health and cancer business, which have been \u2013 we have been discussing for some time now. Biosciences growth reflects strong research and clinical instruments placements.","Moving on to international. We continue to see strong growth. Revenues grew 6.4%, driven by solid growth across both our Medical and life Sciences segments, which grew 4.6% and 8.5% respectively. Both segments continue to experience strong growth in emerging markets and international safety sales. Medical results were negatively impacted in part by the previously mentioned ordering patterns in pharmaceutical systems.","On slide 10, emerging market revenues grew 12.4%, and accounted for 26.5% of total revenues. This strong performance was driven by growth across both segments. China revenues grew 23.1%, and safety sales in emerging markets grew 17.8%. Strategic investments in emerging markets continue to drive robust growth.","Moving to global safety on slide 11. Currency-neutral sales increased 5.9% and grew to $573 million in the quarter. Revenues in the US declined 1.9%, which was impacted by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year.","International safety sales grew 16.1%. Medical and Life Science safety growth was 6.6%, and 5.3% respectively. Both segments results were driven by strong international growth, particularly in emerging markets.","Turning to slide 12. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of about 70 basis points on our gross profit margin in the quarter. On a performance basis, margin expansion was driven by positive contributions from continues improvements and favorable mix. These contributions were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of pricing and pension.","We also incurred some one time cost related to the Kiestra platform, which included the integration into our business information systems. Raw materials were about flat in the quarter. For the full fiscal year, gross profit expectations remain inline with our previously communicated guidance.","Slide 13 recaps the first quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. Since we've already discussed revenue and gross profit, I'll move down the income statement to SSG&A.","As a percentage of sales, SSG&A decreased in the quarter. This was driven in part by sustained cost containment. R&D was 6.3% of sales in the quarter, operating income grew 10.1% driven by solid revenue and gross profit growth, coupled with better leverage and SSG&A.","Our tax rate improved 380 basis points over the prior year. The improvement was due to continued favorable geographic mix and the impact of the R&D tax credit reinstatement, which was contemplated in our full year guidance range. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.53 or an increase of 15.4%.","Turning to slide 14, I'd like to walk you through our expected revenue guidance for the full fiscal year 2015. In summary, we are increasing our guidance and now expect revenue growth of about 5% for BD in total. This increase reflects our improved performance in the first quarter, relative to our overall expectations.","On a reported basis, revenue growth is expected about flat to a decline of 1%. This reflects a currency headwind of about 600 basis points and assumes the euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.14. At current spot rates, all major currencies relative to the US dollar are down about 15% to 20% versus last year.","We continue to anticipate pricing pressure of 30 to 40 basis points for the year. We are increasing our adjusted earnings guidance to 9% to 10% growth currency-neutral. This is an increase from our previous guidance of 8% to 9% growth reflecting an improved revenue growth profile, along with lower oil prices.","On a reported basis, earnings growth is expected to be about flat to 1% reflecting a currency headwind of about 900 basis points. All other full year guidance ranges provided on our November earnings call remain unchanged.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, Chris. Moving on to slide 16 and product launch updates in the Medical segment. We recently announced the FDA approval of the BD Intelliport Medication Management System, intended for manual IV bolus injections.","This product is the first and only solution providing real-time drug identification, dose measurements and allergy detection at the point of injection. Real-time wireless data collection is sent directly from the patient bed side into their electronic medical record.","This product underscores our commitment to BD's medication management franchise, and is complementary to CareFusion's smart pump and informatics platform. This represents the next wave of patient safety related products.","In Diabetes Care, we're looking forward to the FDA submission for our approval of our new BD infuse insulin, insulin infusion set this fiscal year. We expect a product launch in 2016. This product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery for insulin pump users.","On slide 17, you can see the anticipated products in our Life Sciences segment. Within the Diagnostics business, our BD MAX molecular instrument continues to gain traction with customers and we remain focused on menu expansion on that platform.","We anticipate launching a number of new enteric panel assays, including enteric parasite in fiscal year 2015, followed by enteric viral and extended bacteria, also in 2016, we expect to launch the Vaginitis and Vaginosis assays.","As Chris mentioned earlier, we've seen a lot of success and we continue to gain notable share with our BD Veritor instrument. In 2016, we expect to launch the next generation of this instrument which will have smart device features.","We continue to anticipate the full launch of BD's Totalys system in our Women's Health and Cancer area for cervical cancer screening automation. Within Bioscience's, we have launched another of our BD Horizon dyes, based on the Sirigen technology. As we have been sharing with you, these dyes are enabling significant gains in multi-parameter flow cytometry analysis.","We continue to anticipate the launch of two additional instruments towards the end of this year, the BD X-15 high parameter, multi color research instrument and the BD FACSVia low cost clinical instrument.","The FACSVia is primarily for emerging markets, with an initial focus on China. The diversity of these instruments, both in application and target demographic illustrates the wide customer base that we are enabling.","In addition to these new product launches, we are also focused on successful, commercial launches of our many recently launched products. As you can see, we continue to have strong opportunities in our pipeline and we look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year.","Moving on to the CareFusion acquisition timeline on slide 18, we continue to make progress in finalizing this acquisition. We successfully completed the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process in November, our financing was secured in December and most recently the CareFusion shareholders voted to approve the transaction on January 21st.","Regarding Europe, we plan to file our final submission tomorrow. The EC has a 25 working day review period to decide whether to clear the transaction or enter into a second phase investigation. Assuming EC clearance at the end of the review period, we expect to close the transaction before the end of the first calendar quarter.","Regarding integration planning and talent retention, things are on track and in terms of the value drivers we've outlined, we remain confident that we will deliver on these commitments.","As a result of the financing structure we communicated in November, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to cash earnings on a high teen percentage basis for the total company in fiscal year 2016. We continue to expect to deliver $250 million of cost synergies, which will be fully realized in fiscal year 2018.","As we focus on de-leveraging, we will consider appropriate timing to restart our share repurchase program, which we expect when we return to a leverage ratio of about 2.5 times gross leverage. We remain enthusiastic about the financial and strategic benefits of this acquisition for our shareholders and customers.","On slide 19, before we open the call to questions, I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today.","First, we are pleased with our strong start to fiscal year 2015. We are delivering on our commitment to top line growth, bottom line growth and underlying margin expansion.","Second, our core business is strong, as evidenced by our consistent performance for the past 10 quarters. We continue to see good performance in both segments, coupled with strong growth in safety, and emerging markets. Our strategy continues to deliver results, as evidenced by our performance for this quarter.","Third, we are on-track for anticipated CareFusion acquisition. Teams across both organizations are hard at work, planning for a successful integration. The powerful combination of the two companies will further enable us to deliver end-to-end solutions that increase efficiencies, reduce medication errors and improve patient safety in both hospitals and pharmacies.","Finally, our strong financial performance in the first quarter enables us to raise currency-neutral revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal year 2015. We look forward to the future with confidence.","Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your firs question is coming from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Hey, good morning. Good results today. I was just wondering if you could walk through the guidance and just kind of the components that gives you confidence. How much I guess is flu, that's adding to the increased top line? And can you maybe just walk us through your commentary around lower oil costs and resin costs and how that could be contributing as well to the EPS line?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Chris, can do that, but we had strong performance across all of our businesses, with flu on top of that. And flu was a combination of a stronger season and continued share gains in that business. So that\u2019s kind of behind what we saw on the revenue side, plus we see good growth in emerging markets. We haven\u2019t seen any turndown in any of our emerging markets.","Though look at Brazil, and we are \u2013 we're careful about that and keeping an eye on it, because from an macroeconomic standpoint, you'd be concerned, but we saw good performance there this quarter. So, good emerging markets, good across the portfolio and good flu, that\u2019s what got us to the top of the range. Chris, if you want to walk through the rest of it?","Christopher R. Reidy","That sums it up in terms of the top of the range, flu certainly helps and we see that sticking. We don\u2019t know what's going to happen in the next quarter regarding flu, but so far it\u2019s been strong and again that\u2019s been a combination of a strong flu season, as well as our taking share. So, that\u2019s really what's driving the top line.","The bottom line, is a number of things, certainly the contribution of the stronger revenue growth, including the lift from fluctuations, then as we look out at our cost structure, we do see the decline in oil prices.","That\u2019s going to have more effect in the back half of the year. It\u2019s not directly related to the price of oil. The resin prices are going down about \u2013 at a one third rate of the oil price decline and some of that has to do with the dynamics of the market and others \u2013 in other industries still having a high demand. But we do see some impact to that. But you get about a half of year that because it runs through inventory.","So, I think on the EPS, contribution from flu or contribution from oil prices, as well as the fact that we've got some upside on the tax side as well, coming a little bit to the low end of the range, primarily driven by the R&D tax credit that was re-enacted.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys. Can you hear me okay?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes. Good morning, Mike.","Christopher R. Reidy","How are you?","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Perfect. I just wanted to circle back on two things. So one, the CareFusion commentary, just with regards to the accretion. The high-teens accretion commentary, is that commentary first 12 months or is that FY 2016 commentary?","And then, second, I was hoping you could spend a little more time on the China performance this quarter, which was north of 20% and I was hoping you could shed more light there. Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes. Mike, on the first one, it is consistent with what we said in the past fiscal year 2016.","Christopher R. Reidy","And then on China Mike, we continue to see strong performance pretty much across the board in China. And so the Medical segment continues to do very well. We're continuing to kind of expand our footprint there and as that\u2019s happening we see the government continuing to spend on healthcare. We have not seen any slowdown. We track a number of measures. So, we haven\u2019t really seen any significant issues in China.","Tom, would you want to comment at all on the Medical side, Linda on the Diagnostics and Life Sciences.","Tom Polen","I think you said we had a very strong north of 20% growth in the Medical segment in China this quarter, and we continue to see strong performance across all three businesses in the segment.","Linda M. Tharby","On the Life Sciences segment, again, over 22% growth this quarter and we continue to see as expansion occurs in healthcare amongst different tiers, strong opportunity continuing for us in the China market.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So pretty much across the board Mike. Thanks, for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Just one quick question, maybe for Tom or for Vince. I wonder if you could discuss the development of the pro forma growth story with CareFusion. Specifically what I wanted to center on was, how long is it going to take to really see benefits from CareFusion international product registration, and sort of what provides that confidence that the underlying CareFusion growth can sustain pro forma top line around 5% until that process sort of plays out and develops? So, confidence and timelines any development thoughts would be very helpful.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. We're doing a lot of work on that right now and Tom can comment and kind of bucket this thing for you in terms of near term opportunities where we don\u2019t have registration issues, registration and then, longer term some of the kind of market development stuff. So Tom, why don\u2019t you walk us through that?","Tom Polen","Yes. Hi, David. Good morning. So, as we've shared in the past, we look at revenue opportunities really evolving more in the 17 plus timeline. And we see that in, in kind of three different buckets. The first is, there is a series of products in the CareFusion portfolio that do not require registration in emerging markets and ex-US and those would be primarily around the Roland Pyxis portfolio for pharmaceutical dispensing and automation.","Then you've got \u2013 so that\u2019s the near term horizon. And in the mid term horizon, then you've got products which do require registration, but fit into very strong existing BD channels. And so those were the portfolio components such as IV valves, sets, chloraprep can fit into that category where we got the existing infrastructure and it\u2019s really sold as integrated solution with our current portfolio.","And then I put the other third kind of horizon there as more complex capital that \u2013 such as pumps in certain markets where they are not already registered. And those require both registration, as well as building some basic infrastructure around service et cetera of that type of capital.","And with that said, they do have of course, through the CMD [ph] equity stake that they took, position in a company that does have pumps registered in a series of emerging markets and we see that as a near term opportunity.","But we're actively working with the CareFusion team on just further defining and putting timelines around each of those sub-components, and we'll be sharing certainly more of that after close.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is actually Kyle calling on behalf of David Roman. Thanks for taking the question.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Good morning, Kyle.","Unidentified Analyst","Morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit about your woman's health segment and diagnostics. You called out kind of the extended interval screening for roughly a year now, it\u2019s creating a headwind to growth in that segment.","When can you see interval screening is kind of fully incorporated into, excuse me, as fully incorporated as behind you, and when do you see yourself as lapping that headwind going forward?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Linda, will take that.","Linda M. Tharby","Good morning, Kyle. So declines from our increased interval recommendations, we look at continuing for another 12 to 18 months as more physicians adhere the recommendation. So we estimate at this point about 70% are using the increased interval timelines. And I think of note this is obviously affecting us in the US and we continue to see very strong growth ex-US, on our share path platform.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thanks, Linda.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel.","Frederick A. Wise","Good morning, everybody. Couple questions. Maybe touch if you would on the current NIH budget proposal. I think it was a better proposal than we've seen, 3.3% I think in Obama's proposal. Is that good, bad neutral in your view? We feel more optimistic on the outlook as a result and maybe talk about US bioscience and was it helped by end of quarter budget releases?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So, I think that it\u2019s a good thing. I think that\u2019s better than its been for quite sometime. We'll have to understand their priorities and how they spend that. Certainly, we're hearing about the whole program in next generation sequencing and the million people, individuals they are looking to do. But overall, I would say it\u2019s a nice positive.","So, things heading in the next direction. I think there is going to be continued debate in congress over this as well, with some, let say, thinking that supporting research is an important part of an innovation strategy for the country and that\u2019s becoming more rationale debate. I think we're past the sequestration. But Linda do you have any other thoughts you might want to add?","Linda M. Tharby","I think Vince summed it up very nicely, maybe the only the thing that I would add on the comment around priority of spending, obviously we're looking at how much goes into areas like core immunology versus translational research and of course with our acquisition of GenCell we're very excited about the news happening in the US on personalized medicine.","Maybe the only thing we're watching on a global basis is the spending in Japan, where we're seeing some reductions overall and push-outs in spending in that environment.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes. There was a little bit more than a 3% reduction Linda, if I remember correctly in Japan. And so we're watching that and we know that\u2019s going to give us a little bit softness in the back half of year in biosciences, but overall, positive.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin","Hi, good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Good morning, Derik.","Derik De Bruin","In your microbiology segment, there is a number of new technologies that are emerging for both pathogen ID and in particular for antibiotics sensitivity testing. That potentially accelerate and automate the process in AST.","Could you sort of talk about what you're doing in tech development in that area and how you see about protecting that franchise as some of these new technologies go out? This goes on to a question on, can you sort of like update us on Kiestra and where you're on that and how many systems have been installed? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So on Kiestra, we haven\u2019t said how many systems have been installed, but we're continuing to make good progress. We've got a very nice pipeline on Kiestra and we're expecting very strong growth there, this year and continued demand. But Alberto, do you want to talk a little bit about rapid detection methodologies.","Alberto Mas","So we are \u2013 good morning. We are definitely watching the space very actively and I would like to highlight as well the partnership that we have from a multi-talk perspective with Bruegger, we're partnering with them, not only on current technology, but potentially making an evolution next step, bringing our expertise in microbiology to their expertise from an instrumentation perspective and making an impact to the market that way.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Okay. Thanks, for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk","Great, thanks. So with the CareFusion acquisition closing next quarter, or it seems like it's going to close next quarter, when should we start to see some of the costs and revenue synergies leak through?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So we said we're \u2013 our expectation is that by the end of the first calendar quarter it should close as long as we do not get a \u2013 I'll call it a second request from the EC just to make sure you understood what we said a few minutes ago.","And so, with that, in terms of when do we expect to see the synergies, was that the second part of your question?","William R. Quirk","Yes.","Christopher R. Reidy","So let me jump in on that, at the next earnings call what we will do is tell you what the new color looks like on a combined basis for the remainder of 2015. So we'll address that then. We have obviously talked about the accretion in the high teens for fiscal year 2016, and again, a lot of that driven by cost synergies. I think Tom addressed it on an earlier question, the timing of revenue synergies which were not baked into that sort of more of a longer term synergy.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes. First, revenues I think Tom said, starting about fiscal year, three years out basically, is what we said and that\u2019s really driven by product registrations, as much as anything else.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Thanks, for taking my question. Maybe a big picture question for you. Historically, you guys have been pretty conservative when it comes to cap deployment. You've been extremely focused on organic, the core if you will. And now that you've done the CareFusion deal, you've seen a lot of enthusiasm around the stock with investors cheering your strategy.","As we look forward at this company, right, is this a new Becton, Dickinson, how is management thinking about cap deployment? Can you please just contrast sort of the old versus the new strategy if you will?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, I would say that we move from a phase of being primarily tuck-in acquisition, building our acquisition capabilities, but at the same time being strategy driven and when that strategy calls for a larger acquisition that made sense both strategically and financially we did it. And that is still the way we think about things. It has to have attractive returns and it has to have a clear and compelling strategy, that hasn\u2019t changed it all.","And so, as we do this, we'll continue to build our capabilities. We have gone through a large integration process. We'll step \u2013 we always \u2013 we'll continue to step back and look at the corporate strategy and look at what is the next logical move. And that could be a series of tuck-in, so something, somewhat larger. But right now, we are focused on CareFusion getting that integrated and getting both the cost and the revenue synergies as we look forward.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel","Hey, good morning, guys. So I want to go back to I think what was really the very first question in the Q&A session. FX and revenue growth was much better than consensus in the first quarter, and it was strong across all businesses, not just diagnostics and flu. It was broader than that. And yet it looks like your revenue guidance for medical and biosciences was unchanged, really all it looks like you did was bump up diagnostics. And this seems pretty conservative relative to your tone and certainly the balance Q1 beat.","Keeping in mind, running off a few things off the top of my head, I mean, women's health should presumably return to growth over the course of the year as you annualize the account loss. It seems like China momentum, if anything's building in really all segments, based on your prepared remarks there was some timing dynamics that actually seemed to push some revenue out of Q1 into the balance of the year, and you clearly have a good pipeline of products.","So I'm just wondering, what's behind this? Should we view this as a continuation of your practice of being conservative with guidance increases earlier in the year, along the lines of what we've seen the last couple years? Is it about an uncertain macro environment? Just trying to dig in here.","And then, I guess, related to that, the stronger than expected performance we've seen in the last couple quarters, has that allowed you to accelerate some of the investment that you need to make as you head into the CareFusion deal? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So, starting with your last part of your question, I think our investments are really on track with what we expected for CareFusion and other things that we're pursuing within the company, whether it\u2019s GenCell, on the Life Science side, or in Intelliport or whatever. And so that really remains on track.","Now, in terms of the \u2013 absolutely, we feel good about the first quarter and how it went. We didn\u2019t change the bioscience guidance, because of the issue that Linda was putting on the table, which was what's happening in Japan with research spending being, I think it was 3.5%, somewhere around there approximately. And so we're going to have a tough compare in the back half of the year in biosciences.","Good performance, improving performance, but from a market standpoint internationally that\u2019s going to impact us. So that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t change it there. Diagnostics we did and I would say on medical and Tom can comment this, we are pretty much where we expected to be. It was strong and there was some puts and takes within that.","And so we are encouraged about the remainder of the year, but we though 5 was about right, do you have any comments you'd want to make on medical.","Tom Polen","Hi, Doug. This is Tom. I think obviously in the quarter we were at 4.2% growth versus our guidance for the full year of 4.5 to 5. So, obviously weren\u2019t looking to raise from there. But we are confident that we were expecting a slightly lighter first quarter, its well within our expectations.","We knew after a very strong performance in Q4 in pharma systems we are expecting some lighter ordering patterns in Q1 and a big higher year comparison in diabetes care. And so, our Q1 performance is right in line with our expectation and it does reinforce our confidence and our full year guidance so for the medical segment.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes\u2026","Vincent A. Forlenza","Do you have anything else you'd like to add?","Linda M. Tharby","Maybe just one other comment Doug, on the Life Sciences side, for Biosciences in particular, which is our competitor in Western Europe and particular we had a pretty strong first quarter, sorry light first quarter last year. So we're working off a weak competitor ourselves.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So one last I like to, we saw a good performance across all of emerging markets. We're watching what happens in Brazil and whether that situation changes. And the reason I put it on the table is because we've seen good performance, but we're reading about some of our peer companies which are not doing as well. So we're watching it, and I think we've got a good organization. We're on top of it, but that was another part of our thinking.","Operator","Thank you. Your next comes from Rich Newitter with Leerink.","Rich Newitter","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just going back to cervical path testing, it sounds like your comments relative to a competitor, a little bit more conservative about the market outlook. They seemed reluctant to call it bottom, but things have improved, the declines have gotten less bad. And they also called out market share gains. So I'm wondering if you can maybe help parse that out a bit. Do you think the market may be \u2013 the margin is getting close to a bottom, anything on market share?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Linda will take that.","Linda M. Tharby","So, thanks, Rich. So as we commented earlier, we see about 70% of the market now having transition to interval testing. So continued impact of that and we also are seeing specific to the US market, some competitive loss occurring on that side and again, ex-US very strong performance on the platform.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So with 70% it\u2019s difficult to say does that finish off at 85% to where that goes. There probably would be some people who never make the change. So we're thinking it\u2019s at least another year before we see the market flatten out.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital.","Glenn Novarro","Hi, good morning, guys. On safety, two questions here. In the US, I think you called out a tough comp. So maybe talk about how you see safety playing out for the rest of the year? And then outside the US you called out very strong emerging markets in the quarter. Can you talk about how Europe performed in the quarter and your outlook for Europe for the rest of the year? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. So, US safety and I think that\u2019s what you are referring to was down a little bit, but there was a product line that it was SSI, it was an acquisition, it was all reported in the US last year, and now we're reporting it in each of the regions where it sold. So that was the impact year-on-year. Otherwise you're really seeing no change in US safety sales. And Tom, maybe you want to comment on safety sales outside the US and what you're seeing?","Tom Polen","Sure. So we were basically flat in the US when you take that reclassification and Glenn, you'll see that continue to annualize that effect in the US for the next couple of quarters. It will be \u2013 that re-class will be out like Q4, but you will see that have a slight drag on the US safety reported numbers for the next two quarters as well.","Internationally, we were really pleased with 16.1% international safety growth, really driven by very strong performance in emerging markets. We continue to grow into the double-digits, really led by Asia and Latin America. And we're seeing good progress and continued interest in partnering in the number of emerging countries who continue to improve the safety of their healthcare worker. So, continued strong trajectory in emerging market performance there.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So in Europe, it was 0.9% growth, but it was all driven by unfavorable timing in the pharma systems business. The usual lumpiness we see within that business, anything else you want to comment on\u2026","Tom Polen","Life Science strong and med surg, but really what we saw in pharma systems which we expected was this ordering pattern and that really hit you in Western Europe.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So underlying we're releasing no change.","Tom Polen","And as expected.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Larry Keusch","Just a couple quick ones for you. Could you just, I'll rattle them off. How much was the R&D tax credit worth within the tax rate? And then, secondly can you remind us of resins, how much of that was in cost of goods, just trying to get a sense of magnitude of your resin spend.","Vincent A. Forlenza","On the last one in terms of resins, about $260 million and so again, as you think about that oil prices declined about 40%. We see resin prices about a third of that rate and only about a half of it gets impacted because of the capital rolling [ph] inventory. The first part of the question was\u2026","Larry Keusch","The tax credit, the R&D tax credit?","Vincent A. Forlenza","On tax credit. So, as we had said on the last call, that if the R&D tax credit was enacted we would be at the low end of our guidance range for the year, which is the way to think about that, towards the low end. Because if you really look at what they did, they didn\u2019t do it the way they had done in the past, and extended out for this full year.","We only re-enacted it through offers fiscal quarter, December 31st of last year, so you got to catch up, but you didn\u2019t get the benefit of the next three quarters. But even with that it had a good impact in bringing us towards the low end of our tax rate range, which to remind you was 21.5 and 22.5. So things towards the low end of that tax rate, primarily driven by the R&D tax credit enactment.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","Hi, good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in here. With respect to your Veritor product, you've called it out a couple of times on these calls as being particularly strong on placements. Obviously has an approval on the molecular side for a CLIA waiver.","Can you talk about the potential impact from that product launch and your general thoughts about the need for a molecular product in the point of care, or CLIA waived chatting?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Alberto, will take that.","Alberto Mas","Yes. We are seeing the new product potentially over time impacted more on the hospital segment than in the point-of-care and retail segments where we are particularly strong in. So that will be a little bit of a transition over time in certain segments of the market.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Okay. How we're doing. Any more questions?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Novarro with Canaccord Genuity.","Mark Novarro","Hey, guys. Thanks, for taking the question. Maybe just to follow up on that flu question. Obviously flu prevalence was significant in the quarter and continues to trend above last year's levels. What was your flu revenue in the quarter and can you comment on what you're seeing presently in the competitive environment?","And finally, to what extent do you think your investment in smart device features can potentially accelerate your run rate somewhere above 1000 per quarter?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So, Alberto, why don\u2019t you comment on what you're seeing competitively, how you see importance of the smart features, the connectivity and what not and then I think we'll take a look at what the flu sales were.","Alberto Mas","Yes. In terms of the competitive environment, about a third of our growth versus prior year is driven by share gains, and most it\u2019s the [indiscernible] that we're seeing the gains. In terms of our next generation Veritor system, it will have connectivity associated with it, which will be a very positive obviously from a physician emphasis, but also integrated delivering networks, so they can actually get a better sense of the quality and the compliance of the flu. In addition to that, we'll have other features like bar coding and other capabilities, so we can develop future assays on the platform.","Vincent A. Forlenza","The flu contributed about 80 basis points to our growth if I remember right Chris.","Christopher R. Reidy","So if you translate that to the year, its worth about 20 basis points or so based on where we are today.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is coming from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Hey, thanks for the follow up. I just wanted to go back to the CareFusion deal and I wanted to get your thoughts on what you consider to be the underlying sustainable growth rate of that business. How you're looking at that and integrating. I think one of the other questions had mentioned about a 5% top line growth. And I'm just wondering if that's what you are expecting from that franchise and how to think about that. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So, when we value the deal, we did not value it at a 5% growth rate, we are looking more at it underlying growth rate, that was about 3.5%. and what we said is the challenge over the long-term based on the work that Tom was describing was that BD is about a 5% grower as we're seeing on the call today, and the work would be try to accelerate their growth rate up to forward into the 5%.","But we didn\u2019t start out with saying it\u2019s a 5% grower, that is the work that we're doing and that would be a goal that we would have and we're working to try to put those plans in place, we'll be dependent on the three buckets that Tom talked about over time the geographic expansion and we're very also excited about long run how we leverage smart works and what other applications could be put on that.","Christopher R. Reidy","Tom, do you have anything else, you want to add to that?","Tom Polen","Maybe the only thing to add is, as Vince mentioned I think we see them in at 3, 3.5% underlying growth rate. We certainly recognize that\u2019s primarily based on being a US company, which is very comparable or even slightly better than our US base growth rate.","That\u2019s of course we're 60% international, they will be less than 25%, we're 25% emerging market, they are less than 10% emerging market. And so, right that, that 3.5% underlying primarily US business we see an opportunity to really accelerate that based on international growth opportunities and continue to expand that as a percentage of the total sales.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Vince Forlenza for any additional or closing remark.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, thank you very much for your participation today. We look forward to updating you as we move closer to the CareFusion acquisition. We are very excited about the start of the year and the strong start in core business and thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day."],"3589":["Becton Dickinson and Co (NYSE:BDX) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call May  9, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Monique Dolecki - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","Vince Forlenza - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Chris Reidy - EVP, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer","Tom Polen - President and Chief Operating Officer","Alberto Mas - EVP and President, Medical","Simon Campion - EVP and President, Interventional","Patrick Kaltenbach - EVP and President, Life Sciences","Conference Call Participants","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Kristen Stewart - Barclays","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Robbie Marcus - JPMorgan","Brian Weinstein - William Blair","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Larry Keusch - Raymond James","Rick Wise - Stifel","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc","Operator","Hello, and welcome to the BD's Second Fiscal Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through May 16, 2019, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 1284128. [Operator Instructions]","Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Darla. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us to review our second fiscal quarter results. As we've referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our second fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website. Our second quarter results include a non-cash charge in the period related to product liability matters of $331 million pertaining to certain legacy Bard surgical products.","In addition, in April, we notified customers of the recall expansion of the Alaris pump to include all pumps with a certain molded component that was manufactured between April 2011 and June 2017. We have recorded a cumulative charge of $65 million related to the recall to reflect the estimated costs of the remediation efforts that will occur over the next three years.","We are working closely with our customers and the FDA and our remediation actions are guided by our proactive commitment to patient safety and minimizing the disruption of patient care. These items along with the details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules and our press release or the appendix of the investor relations slides.","As a reminder to provide additional revenue visibility, we will speak to our fiscal 2019 second quarter revenue results and fiscal 2019 revenue guidance on a comparable currency neutral basis. The comparable basis includes BD and Bard in the current and prior year periods, and excludes intercompany revenues, revenues associated with divestitures and an adjustment to the prior year related to customer rebates and incentives, as detailed in the financial schedules and our press release.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, Executive Vice President and President of the Interventional segment; and Patrick Kaltenbach, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vince Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. At BD, our strategy is driven by our purpose advancing the world of health. We are confident that our strategy is working, our core remains strong and we continue to invest in innovation to deliver even more impactful comprehensive solutions for our customers.","Turning to Slide 5 and our second quarter highlights. Our performance in the second quarter was broadly in line with our previously communicated expectations. Strong performance in our core combined with our continued focus on driving operational efficiencies and Bard cost synergies drove revenue growth the 3.4% and earnings per share value -- their earnings per share in line with our guidance range for the second quarter. Our results through the first half are right where we expected them to be. As we've been discussing with you, we plan for revenue growth in the second quarter to be below our full year guidance range. This was driven by our expectations for strong underlying core business growth, partially offset by a tough flu comparison and timing within the year in pharmaceutical systems.","There were two additional items that impacted our growth this quarter, the market reaction to the FDA letter regarding DCBs and timing in the medication delivery solutions business in the U.S. When we factor in these items, underlying revenue growth was in line with our expectations year-to-date. In addition, we remain pleased with the integration of Bard. We are on track for our costs and revenue synergy capture targets, and we have gained momentum on the investments that we made last year.","In addition, notable progress has been made on IT systems integration and in planning for supply chain initiatives. We are reaffirming our full fiscal year 2019 currency neutral revenue guidance despite near-term pressure to our DCB business. Our updated EPS guidance reflects strong underlying performance, partially offset by the headwind to our DCB business as well as additional foreign currency pressure due to broad strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","Looking forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2019. We have confidence in our planned back half acceleration. There are a number of growth drivers across our segments, which we will review later in the presentation in addition to easing comparisons.","I'll now turn things over to Chris for more detailed discussion of our second quarter fiscal performance and our fiscal year 2019 guidance.","Chris Reidy","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7, I'll review our second quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights. Second quarter revenues grew 3.4% on a comparable currency neutral basis. As Vince mentioned, our second quarter performance was broadly in line with our expectations, driven by strong underlying core business growth. There were two items in the quarter that brought the revenues slightly below our expectations. First in our Medication Delivery Solutions business in the U.S., our results reflect the impact of distributor inventory adjustments in our hypodermic business. Inventory levels are now normalized, and we expect strong demand for the remainder of the year. Second, our results this quarter also reflect an impact to our DCB business. The FDA's mid-March update regarding the use of all paclitaxel-coated devices has negatively impacted companies that manufacture and sell these products.","I'll provide more color on revenue growth in the quarter in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and geography. Adjusted EPS of $2.59 grew 7.2% on a currency neutral basis. This was in line with our previously communicated expectations for the quarter. We also continued to deleverage during the second quarter, paying down approximately $500 million of debt. We remain on track to achieve our commitment to deliver to below three times over three years.","Moving on to Slide 8, I'll review the Medical segment revenue growth. BD Medical second quarter revenues increased 3.8%. Revenues in Medication Delivery Solutions or MDS grew 1.3%. As expected, our second quarter results reflect a tough comparison to the prior year in the U.S. The inventory adjustments previously discussed also impacted growth in the quarter. However, we expect strong demand and growth in this business in the second half of the fiscal year.","Outside the U.S. growth in MDS was driven by strength in Europe across vascular access management and vascular access devices. Revenues in Medication Management Solutions or MMS grew 7.3%. Growth in MMS was driven by strong performance and infusion and strength and retail dispensing. Diabetes Care revenues grew 4.7%. As expected, revenue growth rebounded from lower growth in the first quarter with strengths in both the U.S. and international businesses, aided by timing of orders. Revenues in Pharmaceutical Systems grew 3.9%. Performance in farm systems reflects the timing of customer ordering patterns, which benefited the first quarter and negatively impacted growth in the second quarter as we expected.","Now turning to Slide 9, and the BD Life Sciences segment. Revenues increased 2.7% in the second quarter. As expected, this growth reflects a headwind of over 200 basis points related to the strength of last year's flu season in comparison to a more typical flu season this year. As you're aware, the timing and severity of the flu season can impact our year-over-year comparisons. As a result, revenues in Diagnostic Systems declined 1.6%, reflecting a headwind of approximately 550 basis points from the tough flu comparison. Underlying performance was solid and driven by double-digit growth and IDAST and our BD MAX molecular platform. Preanalytical Systems revenues grew 3.5%. Growth continues to be aided by recent capacity additions that have improved the supply of push button collection sets. As expected, partially offsetting this growth was the timing of distributor orders that benefited the strong first quarter. Biosciences revenues grew 7.9%. Growth was driven by research reagents our FACSymphony and FACSLyric platforms and strengths in emerging markets.","Now turning to Slide 10, and the BD Interventional segment. Second quarter revenues increased 3.5%. This reflects an unfavorable impact of 170 basis points from the hurricane and DCBs. On an underlying basis, growth was approximately 5.2%.","Revenues in Peripheral Intervention or PI grew 3.8%. Our results this quarter reflect the previously mentioned impact to our DCB business. On an underlying basis, PI revenues grew approximately 6%, driven by strong global growth in end stage renal disease and growth across the entirety of the business in emerging markets. I'll provide our updated assumptions for DCB growth over the remainder of the fiscal year later in my remarks.","Second quarter revenue growth and surgery was 1.2%. As expected, this reflects a tough comparison to the prior year in our hernia business when we released supply for back orders following Hurricane Maria. Growth in the surgery unit includes strong performance in biosurgery and infection prevention, where we continue to see the benefits from our revenue synergy investments.","Revenues in Urology and Critical Care, or UCC, grew 6%. Performance in UCC continues to be driven by products and acute Urology as well as continued strength in our home care and targeted temperature management businesses.","Now moving on to Slide 11. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the second quarter. U.S. revenues grew 2.2%. This is below our normal growth rate and reflects the impact of DCBs and the distributor inventory adjustments within MDS. In addition, this reflects a tough flu comparison as expected.","Moving on to international. Revenues grew 4.9%. This reflects solid performance from all three segments with strength and emerging markets and across the medical segment in Europe as previously discussed. Developed market revenues grew 2.4%, driven by solid performance in Europe, partially offset by lower growth in the U.S. Revenues in emerging markets grew 9.2%. Performance was driven by growth of 11.8% in China, which reflects strong performance across all three segments. In addition, emerging markets benefited from double-digit growth in EMA.","Turning to Slide 12, which recaps the second quarter income statement. As discussed revenues, grew 3.4% in the quarter on a comparable basis. Moving down the P&L, gross profit grew 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of currency. I'll provide additional details on gross profit in just a moment. SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 25.9%. This reflects additional deferred compensation expense due to stock market performance in the quarter. For your reference, deferred compensation expenses fully offset than other income expense. SSG&A was also impacted by unfavorable timing from the harmonization of Bard's compensation and benefit plans, as expected. On an underlying basis expenses are growing slower than sales and reflect our ongoing focus on discipline spending, and the achievement of Bard cost synergies.","R&D as a percentage of revenue was 5.8%, which reflects our continued commitment to invest in innovation. As a result, operating margins decreased to 150 basis points, or 50 basis points on a currency neutral basis, which was in line with our expectations.","Our tax rate was 16% in the quarter, which was also in line with our expectations at the high-end of our full year guidance range. As expected, we paid preferred dividends of $38 million in the quarter. As we have been discussing the preferred shares are not included in the shares outstanding calculation. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.59, which is a decline of 2.3% versus the prior year or an increase of 7.2% on a currency neutral basis.","Now turning to Slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the second quarter. Gross profit margin was 55.3% in the quarter. On a performance basis, gross profit margin was flat year-over-year in line with our expectations. This reflects margin improvement driven by our continuous improvement initiatives and cost synergies, while offset by unfavorable mix driven by lower flu and DCB revenues, as well as headwinds from raw materials and pricing.","Currency had a negative impact of 90 basis points on gross profit margin, which was greater than anticipated due to the broad strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Operating margins declined 150 basis points in the quarter, or 50 basis points on a currency neutral basis. The decrease in operating margin was driven by increased SSG&A in the quarter as previously discussed.","Moving on to Slide 15 and our full fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance. As we discussed, our underlying performance is strong. Through the first half, we are right where we expected to be. Looking to the second half of the fiscal year beyond these in comparison such as the flu there are a number of drivers across our segments that give us confidence in our planned acceleration. Within the Medical segment, these include continued momentum in share gain and MMS and revenue synergy capturing MDS driven by our leading vascular access portfolio.","In Life Sciences, we expect continued strong growth in BD MAX MDS and the timing of instrument sales and reagents the benefit growth in BD. Within BD Interventional, we've recently launched several new products such as the 4 French WavelinQ, Covera and Venovo, which are performing as anticipated and are being well received in the market. And we anticipate several more product launches across BDI in the second half.","We also expect continued double-digit growth in China in the second half of the year. While we now expect revenue growth of 4.5% to 5.5% to the BD Interventional segment, due to anticipated DCB headwinds, we have reaffirmed our total company revenue growth guidance of 5% to 6%. Our updated guidance reflects a reduction in DCB sales of approximately 50% over the remainder of the year.","We continue to expect BD Medical revenue growth of 5% to 6% and BD Life Sciences growth of 4% to 5%. We also continue to anticipate developed market growth of 4% to 5% and growth of about 10% in emerging markets, driven by a diversified base with low-double-digit growth in China and strengths in EMEA and Latin America.","Now moving on to Slide 16 and our full fiscal year 2019 EPS guidance. Our EPS guidance reflects our expectation for continued strong underlying performance, driven by revenue growth and solid operating performance, partially offset by near-term headwinds. On a currency neutral basis, we expect adjusted EPS growth of about 12%. This reflects a headwind of approximately 150 basis points related to DCBs.","Based on current rates, we expect currency will result an additional headwind of approximately 200 basis points. This is driven by a broad strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Our current forecast reflects the euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.12 versus our original expectation of $1.16. In addition our updated forecast also reflects incremental pressure attributable to profit in inventory. All-in, we expected to deliver adjusted EPS of $11.65 to $11.75.","Now, before we move on, I'd like to take a moment to walk you through the additional information we've provided on Slide 16 this quarter. In response to questions we've received this fiscal year, we thought it was prudent to provide investors with a snapshot of our ability to offset headwinds to the business. This year, the magnitude of the headwinds we are facing is significantly greater than the headwinds we've encountered in recent years. The total headwinds this year amount to approximately $400 million. We have the ability to offset approximately $150 million this year, which is 50% more than we've offset in each of the past few years. To summarize, this chart demonstrates that our core is strong. The integration of the Bard deal was very much on track. And together, we have an even greater ability to offset headwinds by driving robust operating performance.","Turning to Slide 17, we have also updated our detailed P&L guidance to reflect the headwinds from DCBs and FX. We now expect reported revenue growth of 8% to 9% as a result of approximately 50 basis points of incremental FX pressure. Gross margins are expected to be between 56% and 57%, and operating margins between 25% and 26%. Our margin guidance is approximately 50 basis points lower than our previous guidance as a result of both DCB and FX headwinds. We expect operating cash flow to be approximately $4.1 billion. The balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2019 remain unchanged.","In addition, we continue to expect to achieve approximately $100 million in cost synergies in fiscal year 2019. We are on track to fully realizing $300 million in annualized cost synergies over the three year deal period. We feel good about the momentum we have across our businesses. While we're facing some near-term headwinds, we are confident that will deliver on our commitments in fiscal year 2019 and beyond.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who'll provide you with an update on our product portfolio.","Vince Forlenza","Thank you, Chris. Turning to Slide 19 and our planned product launches by segment. As you can see, by this slide, we continue to have a rich pipeline. There are a number of things we continue to be excited about. I'll touch on just a few of the recent launches here starting with the BD Medical segment. We are excited about the consistent cadence of innovation within BD Medical and are seeing strong uptake from recent launches. Notably, adoption of our new Alaris M2 pump is aiding the strong growth and infusion. Also, the recent additions of our health side platform have continued to gain great interest and positive feedback from customers.","Another good example is in our Diabetes Care business, where we are seeing good uptake of our new best-in-class pen needle Nano Pro. Within BD -- within MDS, we also launched two new products during the second quarter that strengthen our vascular access product family, the PowerGlide Cue and BD Provena PICC. Regarding the Type 2 insulin Patch Pump, we recently received feedback from the FDA in our 510(k) submission. We're in the process of evaluating and responding to the agency's feedback, which was more comprehensive than we expected. Given the FDA's comments, we are considering a variety of options and strategies, but do expect a launch delay. We plan to provide you with an update on our August conference call.","In the BD Life Sciences segment, we recently launched the BD FACSDuet, a new automated flow cytometry sample preparation instrument with CVD IVD certification. The BD FACSDuet system raises the bar on flow cytometry automation, offering a fully integrated sample to answer dilution with a BD FACSLyric clinical flow cytometry. This is a new fully automated sample preparation instrument enables clinical laboratories to improve their efficiency by reducing errors and limiting the manual user interactions required to run assays under BD FACSLyric. We also started shipping the new 12-color FACSLyric further enhancing the capabilities of this platform.","In the BD Interventional segment, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the BD WavelinQ 4 French Endovascular AV Fistula System. We're excited to add the 4F system to our portfolio of technologies that create, restore and\/or maintain AV access for patients on hemodialysis. With its slim profile, the 4F system increases the fistula location options by enabling risk access points to be created. This provides increased procedural flexibility for clinicians, while reducing the risk of scarring or arm disfigurement for patients compared to open surgical AV Fistula creation. We also received approval from the FDA for the Venovo venous stent, which is the first venous stent indicated to treat obstructed or narrowed blood flow specific to the iliac and femoral veins located near the growing. Most importantly, it is engineered to address the special challenges of venous lesions that are very different than those posed by arterial narrowing. As you can see, we have a very rich pipeline of new products across our businesses. And we look forward to sharing additional updates with you along the way.","Before I move on, I would like to remind you that we have, again included a slide in the appendix of today's presentation that provides an update on our sustainability initiatives. We hope you find this information useful and understanding BD's commitment to these important initiatives.","Moving to Slide 20, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. Solid revenue and EPS growth this quarter was driven by strong underlying growth in our core across our businesses and regions. Through the first half, our results are right where we expected them to be. The integration of Bard is on track, and we are confident in our ability to achieve our costs and revenue synergy commitments.","Looking forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2019, there are a number of drivers across our segments that give us confidence in our planned back half acceleration.","In summary, we are confident that our strategy is working, our core remains strong, and we have a significant opportunity to continue to deliver even more impactful, comprehensive solutions for our customers and their patients around the world. So thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Just two for me, one on revenue and one on currency. Just if you could just -- starting with revenue for a second, our sense is the DCB update probably reflects a 50% reduction in that business in the back half. I just guess the question is, is that worse than the existing trend or how risk adjusted is that for the disease panel. And just given the quarter and DCB within that 5% to 6% range, should we be thinking toward the lower half of that range? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Chris Reidy","Yes, David. This is Chris, you got that right. 50% is what we're projecting for the remainder of the year. And that is in fact what we're seeing through the month of April and late March. So we're calling it as continuing along those lines. Obviously, we'll see what happens when the FDA talks at the end of June. But right now, we're calling it as we're experiencing it. What we are also assuming is that BTK, while we continue to talk to the FDA about BTK, but we would expect that launch to be in the next fiscal year as well. So it's a combination of those two impacts. And when you take that impact against our original guidance range of 5% to 6%, it does bring us down to the low end of the guidance range.","Operator","Your next question is from Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","Just in terms of, Chris, you had mentioned the ability to kind of offset some of this, what are some of the actions that you have generally taken year-to-year, as you think about kind of offsetting some of these headwinds, there's obviously concerns out there just with next year with the Gore royalties coming off, and then some questions I guess on how to think about DCBs going forward, with BTK, maybe being a potential offset, I guess, mixture to a degree helping the trend, if we get approval. Just -- how should we just think about this flexibility that you have and the levers that you can pull?","Chris Reidy","Sure. So I'm going to start, just to put things in perspective. Then I'll turn it over to Tom. As we showed on the waterfall chart, we're driving 19% to 20% underlying growth and that -- clearly, 3% of that comes from the year-over-year tax rate. But we're driving 16% to 17% growth as well. And we've been able to do that kind of growth in the past. And so that -- I would point you to the fact that 12% FXN despite the $400 million of pressure that I'm talking about is evidence of our ability to still drive good strong FXN growth despite that kind of pressure. And so, Tom is going to talk a little bit about the kinds of things we did to get there.","Tom Polen","As we think about in FY'19, I'd say all the businesses are very tightly managing expenses. So if you look at our underlying SSG&A growth, we're 3% or less year-to-date in the core businesses that reflects that level of discipline that we're driving across the organization. And, of course, as we planned for '20, and we're deep into planning there. Of course, we're way ahead of where we normally would be given the situation with the Gore royalty. I'd say, again very, very disciplined expense management across the Board, both G&A, and obviously the selling and marketing as well as continued management of our R&D lines. We continue to drive a number of efficiency programs across all of those organizations, where appropriate, moving, for example sustained engineering to lower cost locations where we can be doing that. That's a trend that we've been accelerating actually within the Bard organization, substantial progress this year. And when it comes to paclitaxel, specifically, of course, and we can comment on this later through Simon, but, of course, as we dig further in, all we see is becoming more and more confident in our data on paclitaxel that we do not have -- we're very, very confident in the safety of Lutonix. And again we can comment on that further later on.","So we're looking forward to the FDA discussion in June. We're not doing any restructuring of that organization at this point in time. We're going to be hiring for the launch of BTK. And so, one thing that we'll be monitoring very closely is how we come out of the FDA session and then making a decision after that and as was mentioned before, we are still in active discussions with the FDA on the BTK product, right. It's a very unique, new solution in the marketplace. There are no valid treatment options other than amputation for patients suffering with below the knee blockages. And so, right, we are still hopeful that while that won't occur in FY'19 that it will occur later on and we'll get a better sense of that, we think after the June meeting as well too, so more to come. We're planning behind the scenes, but we think it's prudent to see where that evolves too.","Vince Forlenza","So, Kristen, you can get a strong sense there, we're doing everything we can, as Chris said, to offset those headwinds. We're being prudent around the DCB situation and then 2020 is a whole different work stream in line with what we have been communicating all along in terms of how we will offset that. We're making good progress in all of these things. We'll see how the DCB situation comes out. One thing that I would add is that we have done -- we've taken our data to a third party and have them take a look and actually do the analysis for us, we're feeling very good about those results and the safety results that they show and Simon and his team are looking to get that published. So we look forward to getting our data out there. So thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","One on FX, and then one on the P&L guidance. So starting with FX, I think initially, it was a 2% top line hit, with about a 3.5% EPS impact from currency. And now, I think it's 2.5% at the top line, but 5.5% EPS hit. So could you just help us understand why it seems like the ratio from the top line hit to the EPS hit is greater now? And now I'll ask my second question on the P&L guidance right now. Chris, can you help us bridge kind of from the first half operating margin of about 24% to the implied second half operating margin of about 27%? Hopefully, I'm doing the math right at the midpoint there. Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Chris Reidy","Great, Larry. Two good questions. So let me step back on FX a little bit and as you pointed out, we had estimated about a 3.5% EPS impact or about $0.40, thereabouts. Our new guidance is 5.5%. And we have certainly seen since November a broad strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro, but also more directly against all other currencies around the world. Through the first half, we are already experiencing the $0.40 or 3.5% of FX pressure, and Q2 was slightly worse than we had expected. We had thought it would be $0.20 to $0.22 and we saw a $0.25.","As far as the remainder of the year goes, we had expected FX pressure in Q3, but we are now expecting that to be worse than anticipated as the dollar continues to strengthen. And as we looked at Q4, we had originally thought that that turned around and offset the impact of Q3 to essentially be neutral in the second half. That doesn't look like it's going to happen now as the dollar continues to strengthen and the Q4 is neutral, but certainly not an offset to Q3. So when you put all that together, it drops about $0.20 more in the third quarter and then the fourth quarter would be relatively flat. And some of what's making that happen as well as the profit and inventory that as the dollar continues to strengthen, that come back from profit and inventory that we expected in the fourth quarter is lessened. And so that's what makes the fourth quarter neutral. One thing to consider in terms of the drop through is as we've seen in past years, when the pressure comes from currencies other than euro. And of the $0.60 pressure that we're seeing this year, only $0.15 of that is from the euro, so the rest is all other currencies. When the pressure comes from other currencies, the drop through tends to be greater than it was in prior years. So that's the story on FX. In terms of your other question, in terms of the way to think about margin from where we are, the first-half margin is, as you said, about 24%. We're guiding 25% to 26%, which implies about a 27% second half. And a number of things go into that very much consistent with what we said on the call last quarter. FX does abate in Q4, as we annualize headwinds, the cost synergies that we have ramped in the second half, particularly on a year-over-year basis. We also have additional SSG&A leverage on higher second half sales. And we feel very good about the acceleration of revenues in the second half that generate that as we went through in the script. So we feel real good about our ability to get to that 25% to 26% operating margin improvement despite the headwinds.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","So just, I wanted to start out maybe with a little bit of a longer-term question and on the upcoming paclitaxel panel, if we just hypothetically say that doesn't go well, are you guys still comfortable with that 5% to 6% that you've talked about is still doable, even if paclitaxel panel goes poorly and you have to kind of really draw down your thoughts on what the below the knee opportunity might look like?","Vince Forlenza","So, we think that, by the time the panel meets, there is not much time for the substantial impact in this year. And so if it doesn't go well, then we would have to take a look at this business and look at the expense structure and how we would manage that. We actually believe that the industry from talking to other companies that all of us have good data. As I mentioned, we want to get ours out there and published. So we're actually looking forward to that June meeting, we wish it was coming sooner. Simon, anything else you would add to that?","Simon Campion","No. Just once more, as Vince said, we have reaffirmed the safety profile of our product with an independent group of physicians involved. All the interventions that would use our product and oncologists, and we said we do that back in the Q1 earnings call. We've done that, we've reaffirmed it, and we're going through the publication process. The other thing to note, while DCB is undoubtedly a headwind for us, there are many other -- many other legs to the Peripheral Intervention stool and indeed the BDI stool that can help mitigate some of those headwinds. So as we break down our business, we can see a good growth in the other segments on a global basis, the other parts of PI on a global basis. So DCB is very important, but it's not the only positive story that we have to express as we serve patients globally.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robbie Marcus","Maybe just a follow-up on Kristen's question a little bit. I think a lot of us are sitting here looking at some of the headwinds, some of them going into fiscal '20, some of them not. I know it's still pretty early in the year and we won't get full '20 guidance here, but maybe if you could just help us think about three times 13% EPS growth going into fiscal '20, is that still something that's achievable off these new lowered numbers? And any puts and takes you could help with that with early in the year here with all the headwinds? Thanks.","Vince Forlenza","Sure, Robbie. So you're right, we're not going to give guidance for 2020 this early in the year, but I would say that the deal model is very intact. Obviously, we have to keep our eye on the DCBs and the impact next year. But we still have strong performance and momentum across the business and continued synergy capture. And so everything we talked about and offsetting the Gore royalty, clearly, is still in place. Now the Gore royalty as is clear is running a little harder than the original deal model. And so that's something we're clearly working toward to getting too. So as we look at the -- as we look at these significant headwinds that we have in the short term, clearly, there is some -- like you wouldn't expect the kind of pressure we are getting in FX, if the FX, if the dollar stays right where it is, there would be about a push next year, so no 5.5% kind of headwinds. And so that is great. And obviously the divestiture was a one-time item and you wouldn't have that again. Flu kind of normalizes. We had a normal flu season this year. We would plan for a normal flu season. So you don't have that headwind going forward. Resins, we had a spike in resins just before we gave guidance last year. That's gotten slightly favorable and it's kind of held right there. So we'll have to watch that. Oil prices are going up, but it seems like the pricing there has more to do with supply right now than oil prices, as it had in the past. So we'll certainly watch that, but no indication that there is additional pressure there. And your guess is as good as mine on tariffs. And so we'll see. We'll do everything we can to offset tariffs and do what we can to move sources et cetera. But that remains to be seen whether that's a headwind going forward or not. So it's clearly an indication that the level of headwinds that we had this year tend to abate. And so we'll address more of that going forward as we go throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","Just wanted to talk about the DCB reduction here, the $57 million, it seems like the EPS impact is greater than what we would have expected there. Can you talk about the margins on that business? And am I right to think that nearly 100% of that is falling through the bottom line. And if so, why would that be? Thanks.","Vince Forlenza","Well, first, the margins in that business are very high. It's a very attractive product line, one. Two, we're continuing to manufacture the product. And so, but, of course, had significantly lower volume. So then we have the variances that go along with that. And Chris can give you more detail.","Chris Reidy","Yes. So it's clearly not 100%, but they're really good margins, and we don't like for competitive reasons to give the specifics, but it's very strong. I think what you might be missing in your model is our assumption on below the knee. So you're right about the $57 million at strong margins, but then you got below the knee coming out of our numbers as well, which certainly has an impact of about $20 million to revenue or thereabout. So that would get you in the ballpark.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","So just a couple of -- on guidance, I roll it into one question. When you think about the back half step up, it looks like a couple of 100 basis points on the revenues. I just want to make sure that step-up in the back half, there's nothing changed versus three months ago. And then we know it looks like it's a first-in-class product, right, maybe some color on what it means. And then a follow-up on margins, gross margin is down sequentially. Is this all FX or maybe just some comments on what happened on gross margins? Thank you.","Chris Reidy","Sure. So a couple of comments in there. So first of all, on the confidence on the second half revenue, it is exactly as we called it last quarter as well. And the things that go in there are the tough flu comp in the first half. So if you look at Life Sciences year-to-date is 3.7. Clearly, we're calling it much higher than that in the second half. And so you've got that benefit sticking in Life Sciences, you've got the EMA tender timing and Biosciences that we talked about. We continue to see strong performance in BD MAX. So we're very confident on that acceleration.","On BDI, you mentioned Venovo. We also have the 4 French WavelinQ. You saw that we got approval for 4 French. So we have that, and Covera. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a number of other product launches in the second half. And then, moving to surgery within Interventional, we have Progel back and that's accelerating nicely. So -- and surgery essentially won't have the impact of the hurricane that we were fighting in the first half of this year. So that returns to normal. And then on the medical side, we mentioned that we expect MDS to accelerate based on the strong hypo demand that we're seeing, and that was a supply issue in the past. And so that's writing itself. And so, we expect strong demand there. And then MMS, as you see, the performance at MMS, we continue to see that performing well in the second half of the year. Don't forget revenue synergies also build. The timing is we haven't seen too much revenue synergy in the first half. We've seen some, but we have strong confidence in seeing that build in the second half. So we're very, very confident on the revenue build in the second half. And so when you think about it, we're about 4.3 year-to-date, which is about where we expect it to be for the first half of the year, even though, Q2 is a little lighter. We are actually a little bit better in Q1 as you might remember. And so the back half of the year implies kind of a 5.5% to 6% growth, which we feel very, very comfortable with.","In terms of your comment on margins, most of that is the FX impact. And so that's what's driving that. On an underlying basis, FX and the margin was right where we expected to be. The bigger driver of that is SSG&A, as you can see, was a little bit harder in the second quarter. That's just a timing issue. When you normalize for the integration of Bard, so, Bard wasn't in the first quarter, so you saw a big -- first quarter last year. So in the first quarter, you saw a big change. In the second quarter, that comes back in. What you see happening is things like comp and benefit plan, you're taking two companies that are on different year-ends -- fiscal year-ends and normalizing that. So you're getting some hits in the second quarter that normalizes over the course of the year. Those benefit plans aren't incremental there. They are the same as they were. It's just out of quarter. The best indication of that is something that Tom mentioned is that for the first half of the year, on a comparable basis, SSG&A is running about 2.9%. That's about where we expected to be for the year, which is showing that we are able to drive down costs through synergies and continuous improvement. So we feel good about the gross margin. And that will improve through the second half of about 57% on average to get us to the 56% to 57% guidance range we mentioned.","Operator","Our next question is from Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Larry Keusch","I was just hoping that you guys could talk a little bit about the pump market. Obviously, competition is certainly set to increase over the next 12 months or so. So just wanted to get a sense for sort of what you're seeing out there in the market? Thoughts around your market share gains and what really is the differentiator that you think that you have for the Alaris system at this point as the competitors come in?","Vince Forlenza","So Tom is going to kick that off. And then we'll go from there.","Tom Polen","Hey, Larry, this is Tom, and I'll make a couple of comments and then turn it over to Alberto for anything further there. So we feel really good about our position in infusion pumps, of course, another great quarter from MMS here, and certainly very strong year-to-date performance. Customers continue -- we continue to gain share in that one to two points. We're on that exact same trajectory this year as we have been for the last several years and certainly the power of the system is not just in the pump itself, obviously, the integration of the LVP, the syringe, the PCA, the interoperability. We're at over 400 interoperable sites, which is a multiple higher than I think all the rest of the market combined. And now, the power of HealthSight, in particular as well where we're leveraging data across, not just the infusion platform, but across dispensing and our other solutions around compounding and inventory management to help provide outcomes for the customer leveraging that data to do things such as reducing inventory costs or preventing diversion of drugs, improving patient safety and those are things that we alone are uniquely positioned to provide because of the breadth of our portfolio and we see a lot of excitement from customers there. The majority of our deals, north of 50% of our deals, when we close them today, are not just pump deals, they're deals that include multiple elements of our portfolio and again that's quite unique to us and not something that those who are in this space can offer. So Alberto, anything else to add to that?","Alberto Mas","No, I think you summarized it well. So we continue to develop our core platforms nicely and Pyxis side adding, for example, Pyxis Logistics IV Prep. So we continue to invest in our core platforms and the interoperability on the Alaris is really a significant differentiator for us. And then the wraparound for really the integration of our core platforms to provide really unique analytics for our customers is really that -- where we're seeing the big winners. We do, obviously, have visibility into the future and some of these upcoming contracts and we feel very confident that we'll continue that category share gain consistent to what we've always said and that Tom as highlighted.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise","Two quick questions, maybe Vince at a high level, your emerging market business continues to do well, you called out China specifically. Maybe talk to us about how sustainable it is, given the trade issues, economic uncertainties, the back and forth and just more specifically on the Type 2 diabetes pump delay because of complex feedback and you're reflecting on options. Does this diminish your confidence in the product to make it to the market the next year or so, how quickly would you hope to work it through and make a go-no go kind of decision. Thanks so much.","Vince Forlenza","Right. So let me start out on emerging markets, and thanks for the questions, Rick. So you're right. We saw very strong performance in China, good performance in Asia, good performance around EMA as well too. So we're actually confident that we're going to continue to see that. I would tell you my experience with the China team is that the trade situation is being kept very separate from what's happening in our business. And it just remains so important to China to continue to develop that healthcare system. It's foundational to their strategy and the stability of course that they're always seeking. So we are seeing strong performance across all three of our business segments and as we look forward, we continue to see that. One of the reasons why is that, the funding of the Chinese healthcare system is actually improving over time and most people don't know and understand that, but our team walked us through that about a month ago or so. So we're feeling very good on that side.","On the Diabetes pump, we did get the feedback from the FDA, and we're in a situation where we're really assessing the options that we have, the technical pathways that we have in responding to them, some can be simple, some can be longer term. And so that's why we said, hey, listen, we've got to call that out for you. We've got to do that work before we can assess exactly where we end up in terms of launch date with that. And so that's where we stand and that's why we think it's going to take us another quarter or so to really understand how those potential solutions play out.","Tom, is there anything else you want to add to that?","Tom Polen","No. I think you did very well.","Vince Forlenza","Okay. So that's where we stand and we'll talk to you later in the summer about it.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard","So first question on Slide 16, appreciate all the heavy lifting to offset the headwinds. But can you clarify -- have you taken incremental actions to offset the incremental worsening foreign currency in DCB troubles? That's my first question. And then my second, just a housekeeping, did you quantify the distributor inventory adjustments in medical delivery and if not, is it possible to quantify those. Thank you.","Chris Reidy","So this is Chris. On the first question, what I would say is the incremental FX impact, we are already driving 19% to 20% underlying growth and we're not going to offset FX by cutting into muscle at that point. And that was the point of saying, we're already driving $150 million of offsets. As it relates to DCB, we're not assuming any offsets at this point, as we talked about, but if things went negatively, which we don't expect in June, but if they did, we would clearly take actions to offset the impact of that. So the actions that we're talking about are things like sales, comp incentives or whatever, and we're not going to take short-term action to hurt the sales force that we need, when things come back. But if things got materially worse after June, we certainly would look at that and manufacturing, et cetera.","Tom Polen","And maybe Dan, this is Tom. Just to add to Chris's comments, I would say, so as you heard from Vince and Chris, of course, our core business is very much on track, is on budget for the year across the board. With that said, we have taken above budget actions to manage expenses. So we have done things such as there are hiring freezes on non-manufacturing non-sales related roles. We have launched initiatives to more aggressively manage, particularly indirect spend as an example, right. And so every one of the businesses and parts of the organization are driving expense initiatives to reduce expenses below budget, and we are implementing those very actively, I would say. So again, that's driving that base 19%, 20% number that you heard Chris talk about.","Operator","Your next question is from Rich Newitter with SEB Leerink.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Jaime on for Rich. I was just wondering if we could go back to kind of the Bard cost synergies, any additional progress that you guys made in the second quarter. And how we should be thinking about some of the things that you've highlighted in the past around the surgery sales force expansion as well as geographic expansion in the back half contributing? And then just the second part of that question, relative to the deal model, is it still fair to assume that if upside were to materialize that would primarily be from the revenue synergies? Thanks for taking my question.","Vince Forlenza","Okay. So there is a bunch in there. Let me start with the cost synergies. So we're right on track with the cost synergies. As we said, the most recent achievements we pointed to are kind of in the IT infrastructure space as well as in the supply chain. And so some of those things are like moving data centers and collapsing data centers and moving off of older IT systems like MFG Pro and beginning to move those kinds of items. We did close down the Murray Hill office, including the data center and moved it out. So those are the kind of synergies that you start achieving. This is on top of last year's achievements, which included duplicate public company costs and some of the procurement savings. As we look out into 2020, we would be looking at more of the operational kind of synergies like plants and distribution centers and that kind of thing. So we're right on track where we expected to be from a cost standpoint. The same is true on the revenue synergies, as we said, we invested to get some revenue synergies. And I'll pass it over to Simon to talk a little bit about the surgery component of that.","Simon Campion","Yes, good morning. It's Simon here. So I think we mentioned again last time on the biosurgery and infection prevention, sales organization within Europe. We invested heavily there and that sales force is performing as expected and actually above our plan. Now we did something similar in the U.S. where we combined the same two sales forces. And we're getting good leverage between the legacy Bard, biosurgery sales force and the legacy BD infection prevention sales force. The other point I think is important to note here is that the investment profile and the investment agenda that Bard had set forth has been fully supported by BD. Example of that is acquisition of TVA Medical to fill out our end-stage renal disease portfolio and that acquisition has gone to plan. As Chris noted earlier, we got FDA clearance for the 4 French. We've rolled that out, and the progress in that business continues to be very good. And then on a global basis across all three businesses, we continue to do very well, particularly in the emerging markets in China. So overall, all the investment plans are on track and the investment agenda that we set forth has been fulfilled by BD.","Operator","Your next question is from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.","Matthew Mishan","I'm going to ask my first one, and then I'm going to have a follow-up. On the surgery side in Interventional, you guys talked about a tough comp, especially in hernia. But maybe talk a little bit about the biosurgery piece of that, you'd have a -- you probably have a very easy comp around the Progel ramp? And I'm also just curious about the performance of the Hemostat Arista powder where there is increasing competition?","Simon Campion","Simon again. Indeed, yes. Progel, we reintroduced back to the market. I think it was in the October-November timeframe. And we're really pleased with how that has performed. We are -- I would say, we're slightly ahead of where we thought we would be with that. As you rightly mentioned, we have seen increased competition on the Hemostat side and the evaluations have certainly eaten in a little bit into our business there. But I think from a clinical perspective, we feel really comfortable with where we stand with the performance of Arista versus some of the competitors that have entered the market. So I think while there's some short-term pain as their products are evaluated, a lot of institutions and the clinicians have come back around to Arista. And then the final point I'd like to make about that business is, as you may have seen, we have received approval for sterile ChloraPrep, which further differentiates us in the infection prevention business. And we are getting ready to roll that out over the summer months. And we've seen great growth on that in the past two quarters. We expect that profile to continue as we roll out a further differentiated product in that category.","Matthew Mishan","Okay. And then on to this continued strength that you're expecting in MMS, you're running up against some very serious back half comps. I'm just trying to understand how much visibility you have there to new placements or maybe there is a lag from the increase in placements to the benefit you're going to get on the consumables part of that business.","Vince Forlenza","Go ahead, Alberto.","Alberto Mas","Okay. So yes, we do, obviously have visibility of some of the contracts that are coming up. There are two variables used, contracts and then installation or placement timing. And we have a sense for -- the placement can sometimes change because it's not depending on us, and we had to accommodate the customer as well. But we feel fairly more than confident that we're going to see the same similar type of trajectory in the second half than in the first half. So we're -- and the dynamics, as Tom mentioned, and I mentioned before, are basically the same, because we're not trying to compete like with like, but more a comprehensive approach to our portfolio and putting in front place some of the differentiators such as interoperability and some other, the HealthSight Analytics and so on.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for closing remarks.","Vince Forlenza","Well, thanks to all of you for joining us today on the call. Let me make a couple of remarks here. Our performance year-to-date with some puts and takes is right in line with our expectations. We expect a strong back half and have confidence we will deliver it, consistent with our proven track record and historical performance. Even in the phase of significant headwinds, we continue to weather the storm. Our core remains strong. The deal model is tracking in line with our plan. Yes, we have to handle DCBs, and we will do that. And together, BD and Bard have the ability to deliver robust operating performance. So having said all that, we look forward to updating you again next time. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day."],"3482":["Becton, Dickinson & Co. (NYSE:BDX) Q4 2016 Earnings Call November  3, 2016  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Monique N.

At the request of BD today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through November 10, 2016, on the Investors page of the BD.com web site or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 94169710.","Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique N. Dolecki - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Christy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at BD.com.","During today's call we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our fourth fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the BD.com website.","As a reminder, we annualized the acquisition of CareFusion in March, and as such, our fourth quarter results reflect the new BD in both the current and prior year periods. In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude the sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of SMP's respiratory care products. The impact to the bottom line was not material. Comparable organic revenues are adjusted to further exclude the impact of non-annualized acquisitions and closed divestitures. The fiscal 2017 comparable revenue guidance provided today will exclude revenues of closed divestitures, most notably the Respiratory Solutions business that was divested in October of 2016, just after our fiscal year end.","In the fourth quarter the company recorded a non-cash impairment charge for capitalized internal use IT software assets. This charge, along with the details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical Segment; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences Segment. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. First, congratulations to the Cub fans out there, especially the BD associates in Chicago. In the words of Brian Weinstein, go Cubs!","Moving on to my presentation. As we stated in our press release, we are extremely proud of our accomplishments in our first full fiscal year as the new BD. As you already know, the acquisition of CareFusion 18 months ago significantly accelerated our strategy. And the powerful combination of BD and CareFusion continues to deliver positive results. We've seen significant benefits as a result of this transaction from a customer, employee, and shareholder standpoint. And we think there's more to come.","Turning to Slide 4, I'd like to highlight some key achievements in fiscal year 2016. First, our results reflect our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio. Legacy BD remains solid. And the CareFusion portfolio has performed in line with our expectations.","Second, emerging markets continue to be a key growth driver for the company. We experienced some headwinds this year, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, but remain confident that emerging markets are well positioned for continued growth. We also continue to create new growth opportunities for CareFusion products in these markets and expand their global reach by leveraging BD's international infrastructure. We're on track with our new product approval and submission plans and look forward to providing more color at our analyst meeting later this month. Developed markets continued to show stabilization. And growth has accelerated over the past year.","Third, we made key strategic decisions to optimize our portfolio. This included the divestitures of BD Rx and the Spine business in conjunction with the joint venture for the Respiratory business, which we just completed in October. These actions further enable the organization to prioritize and invest in the most important opportunities for future growth. We were deliberate in increasing our R&D investment in targeted high growth areas and fully utilized the benefit of the medical device tax suspension.","Fourth, we remain focused on our operating effectiveness and efficiency initiatives, which have generated significant margin expansion. This year, we drove approximately 200 basis points of underlying margin expansion, which includes approximately $120 million in cost synergies. We also delivered robust earnings growth of almost 30%, which is greater than our initial expectations.","Lastly, we closed our first full year as the new BD, having achieved all important milestones. And also demonstrated that we are successfully executing on our acquisition of CareFusion. As we look forward, we continue to build on our solid foundation and look to fiscal year 2017 and beyond with confidence.","Moving to Slide 5, you will see the guidance for fiscal year 2017 on a currency neutral basis. For the fiscal year 2017, we expect currency neutral revenue growth of 4.5% to 5%, based on our current view of the environment and various macroeconomic factors. There are a number of items that could bring us to the top or bottom end of that range, including a stronger or weaker flu season than expected, the performance of new product launches, emerging market growth, and pricing.","On the bottom line we will continue to deliver high quality earnings growth. For fiscal year 2017 we expect EPS of $9.45 to $9.55, or $9.62 to $9.72 currency neutral, which reflects growth of 12% to 13%.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris who will walk you through our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year, along with the additional details about our fiscal year 2017 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7, I'd like to begin by discussing our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results, as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year. Total fourth quarter revenues of approximately $3.2 billion grew 6.4% on a comparable basis. Fully diluted adjusted EPS came in ahead of our expectations at $2.12, growing at 16.5% over the prior year.","As Vince mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our solid finish to the year, as the first full year as a combined entity with CareFusion. For the total year revenues grew 4.3%. We significantly expanded our margins and captured approximately $120 million in synergy cost savings. Adjusted EPS of $8.59 exceeded our expectations, driven by solid revenues, margin expansion, and an improved tax rate. In addition to the cost synergies, tax synergies have materialized sooner and have exceeded the benefits we anticipated in the early days of the transaction.","We are also pleased to announce that we have continued to delever, as we reduce the debt associated with the acquisition of CareFusion. We are currently at 3.3 times gross leverage and remain on track to achieve our commitment of 3 times gross leverage by March of 2017.","On Slide 8 I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a currency neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenue growth was 6.4% for the total company. In the quarter pricing was about flat.","BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased 7.9%. Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 6.6%, which reflects strength in Flush [PosiFlush], ChloraPrep, and safety engineered products. Revenues in Medication Management Solutions, or MMS, grew 12.8%. This was driven by double digit growth in both dispensing and infusion sales. Respiratory Solution revenues increased 12.7%, as expected. This reflects strong capital installations and a favorable comparison to the prior year period. Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.6%. This reflects solid growth in pen needles which was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 5.1% reflects strength in our self-injection platform. For the total year, BD Medical grew 4.7%.","BD Life Sciences fourth quarter revenues increased 2.7%, primarily driven by growth in Preanalytical Systems and Biosciences. Diagnostic System revenues were about flat compared to the prior year. This reflects continued strength in core microbiology in BD MAX, which grew double-digits in the quarter. This growth was offset by the timing of Kiestra installations outside the U.S., which I will speak to in just a moment. For the total year we are extremely pleased with our Microbiology business with Kiestra growing at about 19%.","Preanalytical Systems growth of 4% was driven by safety engineered products and growth in the U.S. and emerging markets. BD Biosciences growth of 4% was driven by continued strong research instrument placements in the U.S., and reagent sales. For the total year Life Sciences grew 3.4%. The headwinds we experienced in Africa negatively impacted segment results by 60 basis points, bringing underlying growth to 4% for the total year.","Moving to slide 9, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the fourth quarter on a currency neutral basis. U.S. growth was very strong at 7.2%. This was comprised of BD Medical growing at 7.7% and BD Life Sciences growing at 5.8%.","BD Medical's performance reflects strong growth in capital placements and a wide range of infusion disposable products in our Medication and Procedural Solutions business. Growth was also driven by our Pharmaceutical Systems business.","BD Life Sciences growth reflects strong performance across the segment in the U.S. The growth in our Biosciences business was driven by high parameter research instruments, including FACSymphony, our FACSCelesta midlevel analyzer and the launch of the FACSMelody. Our U.S. Diagnostics business saw continued growth in Microbiology, including Kiestra and the BD MAX molecular platform. The Preanalytical Systems business grew 5%, driven by safety engineered products.","Moving on to international, revenues grew 5.2%. This is below our normal growth rate, which is primarily related to the Life Sciences segment.","The Medical segment grew 8.2%. This was driven by strong performance from infusion disposable products in the MPS business and strong performance in China. Growth was also driven by medication management, reflecting double-digit growth in both dispensing and infusion.","Growth in the Life Science segment was about flat compared to the prior year. We experienced a decline in Diagnostic Systems due to the timing of Kiestra installations. Increased installations in the third fiscal quarter negatively impacted the fourth fiscal quarter in conjunction with a tough comparison to the prior year fourth quarter. Biosciences growth was slower in the quarter due to continued declines in Africa, as we anticipated. The Preanalytical Systems business grew 2.9%, driven by strength in China, which was partially offset by a tough comparison to the prior year period.","On slide 10, Developed Markets grew a healthy 5.8%, bringing the total year growth to 4.1%. Emerging Market revenues grew 8.5%, currency neutral, bringing our year-to-date growth rate to 5.3%. China growth for the fourth quarter was 17.7%, bringing the total year growth rate to 10.1%.","Growth in Emerging Markets this fiscal year was slower than initially expected in the Middle East and Africa. And we believe those challenges are largely behind us after we exit the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Emerging Markets remain an important growth driver. And given our robust international footprint, we are well positioned to drive growth well into the future.","Looking into fiscal year 2017, we expect Emerging Markets to grow high single digits, driven by a diversified base, with China growing low double digits, continued strength in Latin America, and fewer headwinds in EMA and Africa. In terms of Developed Markets we believe the stability we have seen in the market over the past 12 to 18 months will continue, yielding a growth rate of about 4%.","Moving to Global Safety on slide 11. Currency neutral sales increased 5.9% and grew to $783 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 5.7%. This reflects continued strength of safety catheters, as well as a benefit from the timing of orders across our hypodermic products. International sales grew 6.2% currency neutral. International performance in the Medical segment was driven by continued strength in China. And safety revenues grew 13.8% in emerging markets.","Medical Safety sales grew 7%, driven by infusion disposables, catheters, and a range of safety engineered products. Life Sciences Safety sales, which were driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4% in the quarter.","Slide 12 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our currency neutral results. Revenues grew a strong 6.4% in the quarter. Gross profit was strong, growing faster than revenues at 7.9%. And I'll provide more details on gross profit in just a moment.","SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.4%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which is masked in this quarter by key strategic investments in product launches in both segments.","R&D as a percentage of revenues was 7.8%, which is higher than normal due to the timing of spend, as anticipated. As a result of the medical device tax suspension, we were able to make additional investments in a number of high growth areas. After normalizing for the significant additional investment in R&D, underlying operating income would have grown about 10% in the quarter.","Our tax rate declined to 16.2% in the quarter, due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, tax synergies materializing earlier than expected, and continued favorable geographic mix.","In the quarter adjusted earnings per share were $2.12, which is a 16.5% increase versus the prior year.","Turning to slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the fourth quarter. On a performance basis gross profit margin improved by 90 basis points, driven by continuous improvement initiatives. This was more than offset by significant currency headwinds of 110 basis points.","On an operating margin basis we're extremely pleased to have delivered about 100 basis points of underlying margin expansion. As I mentioned on the previous slide, the leverage we are getting in SSG&A as we continue to drive cost synergies is being masked in the quarter by investments in key product launches. In addition, margin expansion was partially offset by significant R&D investments, as expected, and unfavorable currency.","I'd like to take a moment on slide 14 to highlight some of our key operational achievements for fiscal year 2016. The acquisition of CareFusion provided BD a unique opportunity to leverage the transaction to optimize the combined organization through functional transformations. And we have made significant progress in this area. All of our efforts have yielded results, and we are on track to deliver continued synergies. In aggregate we have achieved over $170 million in total cost synergies to date.","We have also driven significant margin expansion on a multi-year trajectory. Starting with fiscal year 2015, we delivered 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. This year we achieved another 200 basis points. And we believe we are well positioned to deliver another 175 to 225 basis points in fiscal year 2017. Over those 3 years we will have driven over 500 basis points of cumulative margin expansion. And I believe that we continue to drive robust performance with additional synergies in conjunction with continuous improvement going forward.","We are extremely proud of the organization's ability to continue improving on our skills and expertise by executing against our synergy commitment initiatives through these transformations.","Moving on to slide 15. I'd like to highlight our robust EPS growth, which exceeded our expectations this year. Starting with 2015 EPS of $7.16, we had communicated last November that we would grow EPS 22% to 23% on a currency neutral basis. Beyond our initial expectations, we delivered an incremental 400 basis points from margin improvement. We also realized incremental benefits from our tax rate improvement, which yielded 300 basis points, bringing EPS to $9.24.","Unfavorable currency headwinds impacted earnings per share by 900 basis points. Despite that significant headwind, we were still able to deliver $8.59 of earnings. On a currency neutral basis earnings grew 29.1%, which we believe demonstrates our ability to deliver on our commitments.","Moving on to slide 17. There are a number of factors to consider when discussing our earnings per share in fiscal year 2017. For modeling purposes and to ensure consistency, I'd like to provide more color on our EPS guidance.","First, as I mentioned, we are extremely pleased with strong EPS growth this year. Looking forward, we expect currency neutral EPS to grow between 12% and 13%. This is partially muted by the impact of the Respiratory JV, as we have previously communicated. Pension also presents a headwind next year of approximately 100 basis points.","Contributing to EPS growth is approximately 200 basis points from the adoption of a new accounting standard related to the tax accounting on our stock compensation programs. In addition, we estimate that currency will once again present a headwind. Our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.10. On an adjusted basis we expect to achieve very strong earnings of $9.45 to $9.55.","Turning to slide 18, I'd like to walk you through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2017. As Vince mentioned earlier in the presentation, we expect revenue growth of 4.5% to 5%, with BD Medical growing 4.5% to 5% and Life Sciences growing between 4% to 5%. Growth in both segments contemplates a small amount of pricing pressure.","From a phasing perspective we expect currency neutral revenue growth in the first quarter to be below this range. This is primarily due to some lingering softness in the EMA region and the timing of tenders in our Biosciences business. This will result in a currency neutral revenue growth of about 4% in the first fiscal quarter. We expect revenue growth to return back to our guidance range in the second fiscal quarter with continued acceleration over the back half of the year.","We expect gross profit margin to be between 53% and 54%, which is a significant milestone for BD. SSG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 23.5% and 24%. Our guidance also reflects continued investments in emerging markets as well as costs related to new product launches and registration cost.","We expect our R&D investments to be in line with fiscal year 2016, at about 6% to 6.5% of revenues, as we continue to invest in new products and platforms. As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 23% and 24% of revenues, up from 20.8% (sic) [21.8%] this year. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve by 175 to 225 basis points. This also excludes slight pension headwinds.","We expect our tax rate to be between 17% and 19%, driven by tax synergies, favorable geographic mix, and a benefit from accounting change in our stock compensation program.","For fiscal year 2017 we anticipate our average fully diluted share count to be approximately 219 million. Cash flow is expected to remain strong with operating cash flow of about $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2017. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $700 million.","In summary, we have good momentum exiting this fiscal year. And looking forward into 2017 we are building off a solid foundation. I'm confident that fiscal year 2017 will be another strong year of performance, positioning us well for continued success.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with our concluding remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Chris. Moving on to slide 20. We are pleased with the progress we continue to make on our pipeline and believe we have the most robust pipeline in the company's history. We have recently obtained a number of approvals. I'll touch on just a few.","On the Medical side of the business we are pleased that our partner, Fresenius, received their first FDA approval for IV solution products. Additional approvals are expected. And we are on track to start shipping these products late in the first half of the year.","Last quarter we received our first orders for FlowSmart, our new insulin infusion set, where Medtronic serves as our distribution partner. Early patient feedback has been extremely positive.","On the Life Science side of the business, we are pleased that the FDA has approved the BD MAX vaginal panel and also the GC\/CT\/TV [CT\/GC\/TV] assay. We launched our new Phoenix ID\/AST instrument. We launched the FACSMelody and received approval for Barricor in the U.S. We plan to share more about our pipeline on November 17 at our upcoming analyst day.","Also on analyst day we will discuss the company's strategy and vision for the future and how we are helping to address healthcare's most pressing challenges. The segment leaders will do a deep dive into our business units, which will include some key product launches that we will be unveiling for the first time. We will conclude the day with a financial framework that will outline our plans for sustainable revenue growth, continued margin expansion, strong cash flow generation, and capital deployment. And ultimately demonstrate how all of those things will drive long-term value not only for our customers and patients they serve, but also for our employees and our shareholders.","Moving on to slide 21, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, we're extremely pleased with our first fiscal year as the new BD. We believe that we have demonstrated that we can successfully execute on the integration of our \u2013 of the largest transaction in the company's history.","Second, the diversity of our portfolio from a product and geographic perspective provides consistent and reliable earnings growth.","Third, we continue to invest in key strategic areas and at the same time deliver significant margin expansion and double digit earnings growth. We're looking forward to sharing more details about our pipeline at our analyst day in 2 weeks. We believe we have the most robust pipeline in the company's history. And we look to fiscal year 2017 and beyond with confidence.","Finally, I would like to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for our successful first full fiscal year as a combined company with CareFusion. It's a testament to the hard work of all of our employees that we delivered on our commitments. I believe we have a tremendous opportunity to create a true industry leader, as we continue to advance the world of health.","So with that, thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Unknown Speaker","Operator. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. So as a starting point, Vince, I'd love to hear your thoughts, just as you looked at FY 2017 about some of your end markets. And some of the businesses, as I look over the quarter and the full year 2016, did a little bit better. Some businesses were a bit more challenged. And so maybe just focusing a bit on the more challenged businesses first, can you just talk a little bit about some of the headwinds that you saw? Particularly internationally in the Life Sciences business this quarter, this year? And how you think about some of those end markets in FY 2017? And then if you think about that in aggregate, that 4.5% to 5% revenue growth target for FY 2017, what gets you to the higher end of that range? Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Yeah, Mike, sure. Happy to do that. I feel good about the 4.5% to 5%. And let me walk through the markets, and I'll hit the Bioscience issue which you brought up, which was really the real drag, along with, quite frankly, the flu early on in the year.","So from a market perspective, let me just start with the developed markets. The developed markets certainly have stabilized. And you've seen that our growth rate going up in the developed markets, in the U.S. The U.S. was very strong by the way, including Biosciences. Europe was good. Japan was good. So we feel good about our position in developed markets and the product pipeline we have for those marketplaces.","If I come to emerging markets, the issue really this year was, number one, Saudi Arabia, where we saw the government do a 35% cut of all types of expenses, not just healthcare. And that will annualize during the year. We already saw stabilization in Saudi Arabia.","In terms of Africa, Africa was basically CD4 testing. And CD4 testing was driven by, one, some conversion to viral load, and two, actually confusion over a change in the purchasing organization for CD4 and viral load. And we think we have one more quarter of that. We did start to see some CD4 orders come in in the fourth quarter and a little bit of a rebound. But we know we have that in the first quarter, and then that annualizes and improves.","Coming back to opportunities on China. You saw the strong growth in China in the fourth quarter. If you actually go back and look at China, after the first quarter, where we had some inventory takedown, China was strong for the other three quarters. We expect that to continue. It was especially strong this year on the Medical side of the business. And we think we're well positioned with the work that Tom and the regulatory team have been doing with the CareFusion product lines there. And as I've mentioned on previous calls, we've started with some of those product lines, kind of the simpler disposables. And I'm sure Tom will talk more about that later on in the call.","If there was any softness in China this year from a true demand standpoint, it was on the Life Science side. And it was related to those anticorruption campaign. And what we saw was stabilization starting in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter. And Alberto can mention to you, he's starting to get ramped up. The Bruker deal in China as well, which was a whole new thing for us. We had to learn how to do that and work our way through some issues.","So we feel good about China. The rest of Asia has been good. Latin America has performed well this year, in spite of all those issues in Brazil. It's been the rest of the geography that has done fine.","Come back to the 4.5% to 5%. Then the other element that you have to think about is two other things. One is we will not have Respiratory anymore. And that has been a bit of a headwind for the company. And then we think in the back half of the year you'll start to see more traction with our product launches. Things like Barricor, they have to do the validation first. So that takes a little while to get going. Customer feedback has been excellent. Alberto can talk about the product launches that you heard for BD MAX. Those are really critical assays to that program. We're excited about them.","And so there's a whole list of these things. And we'll show you more about that as we do the analyst day. So that's the way we're thinking about it.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","One way to sum that up \u2013 this is Chris \u2013 is that if you back out the light flu season and the headwinds from Africa and Saudi, the rest of the business was at the high end of the 4.5% to 5% this year alone. We see those headwinds abating after the first quarter. Because it really came up in the second quarter \u2013 second, third, and fourth of this year. So we still have a little bit of a tough compare in the first quarter that we talked about, particularly in Saudi and Africa. But once we get through that with the new product launches that we're seeing, the strength of the rest of the business, we feel real good about our prospects for 2017.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So what takes you to the top end of the range? Obviously, if those product launches, we get faster traction on them, number one. Two, with flu, flu was very mild last year. It's hard to believe that it would be milder. So if we got a strong flu season, that would take us up, too. Those are probably the two factors that I see. So thanks, Mike, for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Two quick questions. I'll just \u2013 I'll throw them both at you here and jump back in queue. So I guess first off, hats off to Antoinette and the tax team in reaching your target here at least 2 years early from our model. So, Chris, is this a structural kind of new low? Can you do better? And obviously, you're reinvesting these savings both in the fourth quarter and next year. Can you give us a sense of where the 2017 reinvestment is going? And can you do better than these levels long term?","And then for Vince or Tom, o-U.S., Pyxis, and Alaris, very strong this particular quarter. Can you talk about the drivers? And sort of update us on how those numbers relate to progress on the CareFusion cross sell? Thanks so much.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, David, thanks for the question, and thanks for the call-out to Antoinette and team. We've been talking about taking the tax rate down to the high teens for some time now. And we've been making great progress against that.","As we mentioned on the last call, the tax synergies coming from CareFusion happened faster and greater than we ever expected. And so we're seeing the benefit of that. So as we look out into next year, we see that bringing us to the high teens.","Then we've got the benefit of the stock comp accounting adjustment. That brings us down to the 17% to 19% range. So this move down is part of the march down in the tax rate that we have been seeing, coupled with the benefits that we're getting from the synergies from CareFusion. And so we really feel good about that.","We've also closed out a lot of tax exams in multiple jurisdictions. We're part of the IRS's CAP program, so they're auditing us on a real-time basis. So the sustainability of this tax rate is extremely strong. And we feel real good about it.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay, thanks, Chris. Tom, you want to pick up on the second part?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hi, David. So as you mentioned, MMS had a very strong quarter, a little under 13% growth in the quarter, about 7% growth for the full year. And maybe just to touch base on the two areas that you mentioned, Pyxis and Alaris.","Certainly, Pyxis ES continues to go very well. We had talked earlier in the year about some of the process improvements we had made to accelerate the installation process. I think you're seeing the results of that work come to fruition now with faster installations, getting those systems in. We now have over 1,100 sites live on ES or about a third of our install base is now upgraded to the ES platform. And the receptivity is very solid. And we expect strong demand on that going forward.","Alaris, we continued to gain about 2 to 3 points of category share this past year in FY 2016. And we're looking at kind of a similar progress outlook for FY 2017 as well.","And so we certainly do have organizations that are cross selling those as an integrated offering. You'll see at analyst day us talk about some new informatic capabilities and other new products coming out that will further strengthen the integration and the value that we can deliver to customers who are using that complete end-to-end offering. And so we'll look forward to talking to you about that very shortly.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning, Kris.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, as you're approaching your I guess targeted debt levels, how you guys are thinking about M&A kind of beyond that? Are you guys looking at doing some strategic tuck-ins? Or just given the success that you've had with CareFusion, whether or not you'd be willing to do another larger deal? Or would it be back to doing more share repurchase activity?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, Kristen, thanks for the question. When we think about M&A, we are strategy driven and shareholder value driven. And so the size of the transaction actually follows from the strategy.","As Chris mentioned, we're about 3.3 [times] right now. By the time we get to March, we're pretty sure that we're going to be meeting our requirements to the rating agencies. What I would say is that gives us more flexibility around those strategic imperatives.","And so we believe we now have the capability to do large. And of course continue to have that capability to do tuck-ins. And a little bit more flexibility to do the tuck-ins in the short run than we've had over last 2 years. And so I'm not sitting here saying we're going back to do a large one. We'll be strategy driven around this, with increased flexibility and capability that we have built over the last couple years.","Chris, you want to talk about share buybacks?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, sure. So what I would say though is in addition to that, the continued strong cash flow is terrific. So we have a lot of flexibility. And as Vince mentioned, the balance sheet will be very strong. It is strong now at the 3 times 3 (sic) [3.3 times], but when we get to 3 times leverage, we get a lot of increased flexibility.","So as we think about the use of that cash flow, we'll probably do something on the dividend rate. You know that the payout ratio has come down a little bit. We increased 10% a year for the last couple years. The good news is our EPS has gone up over 20%. So the payout ratio has come down a little bit. And we will have to address that going forward.","I think CapEx, as you think about it, will be in the $700 million range. That's pretty consistent with where it has been.","So that leaves a lot of cash left over. We'll allocate some of that for tuck-in acquisitions. And that will still leave a lot of cash left over. And we're not going to let that cash build up on the balance sheet. So we'll return to doing some share buybacks. You'll hear more about that at analyst day. And certainly as we approach the March period of getting to the 3 times leverage, we'll be giving a little bit more specificity on where we're going. But the good news is, really strong cash flow and a really solid balance sheet with a lot of flexibility.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just one other question. You had mentioned building in a little bit more pricing pressure into the forecast. Can you maybe comment on where you're seeing a little bit more pricing pressure, or expecting that to occur?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So we haven't really seen the environment change all that much. We know that there's going to be pricing pressure. We've talked a lot about it being in Europe. And of course over the last few years we continue to see consolidation in the U.S. marketplace. So I think we're being prudent in terms of how we're thinking about this. And we'll continue to work as we have in the past to offset it.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And it's already built into the range of guidance that we're giving.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Right.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So it's kind of the part of the range is the pricing.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Kristen.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Rick Wise of Stifel.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Vince. Hi, Chris.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Maybe I'll start off with the gross margin. Chris, you emphasized, underscored the excellent gross margins and hitting significant milestones. I'd just be curious to hear your thoughts on your aspirational goals from here over the next 2 to 4 [years], 3 to 5 years. And maybe talk about the drivers, volume cost, mix. I mean what gets us to those higher levels I have no doubt you aspire to?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Thank you, Rick. We are really pleased with what we've seen this year. The FXN growth rate was 140 basis points. That's a little bit of synergy from CareFusion. But more it's just the continuous improvement that we've demonstrated that we can execute on within our operations group over the last few years.","And as we look forward, the guidance that we gave of 53% to 54%, and that would be inclusive of FX headwinds and pricing headwinds, et cetera, is extremely strong. It's a significant milestone for us to hit that 53% to 54%.","We do see a little bit of more synergies coming, because as we execute on the synergies that affect gross profit and the cost of goods sold, which we said would come towards the latter end of our synergies, and that is the way that it's playing out. But again continued continuous improvement in that area. So feel really good about the gross profit margin.","Also that flows down to the operating margin. So as we mentioned, this year 200 basis points, last year 100 basis points, next year in that 200 basis points kind of range. 500 basis points in total, again driven both from execution of the synergies as well as continuous improvement initiatives. So feel real good about that.","And as we look forward even past next year, 2018 will have continued cost synergies. And you'll see some benefits from that. So all in all, really strong margin improvement. And we feel real good about it","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question come is from Larry Keusch of Raymond James.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, good morning, everyone. I was just wondering if we could go back and expand a little bit on \u2013 I know Tom talked a little bit about Alaris. But I was wondering if you could weave in some thoughts around the Fresenius IV solution that was approved, a little bit about what you do anticipate launching with towards the end of the first half, and what drives that share gain for the year that you're sort of suggesting of 200 to 300 basis points.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hey, Larry, this is Tom. So that share gain that we saw this year is actually relatively consistent with the share trajectory that we've seen over the last, let's call it 4 to 5 years within the Alaris platform. I think what customers certainly value in the platform around the power of one, the ability to do not just large volume but also syringe based and narcotic infusions off the same platform, as well as its leading interoperability position with electronic medical records are some of the key reasons why people have been choosing it at a higher rate and continue to do so going forward.","Again we do have some new technologies being added to the platform, which we'll share also at the upcoming analyst meeting. So we're very positive on the outlook there.","I think we think about IV solutions, and we've mentioned before, that you're going to see a \u2013 I would expect a rolling series of approvals on that platform. This is the first. Of course, there is a number of different formulations of IV solutions as well as bag sizes when you think about building out a portfolio that customers really need to run their institution.","And so what you just saw get approved was the first in a series of products. And we would expect additional products to be coming out over the months ahead. And that leads us up to where we'll have an early critical, kind of mass of a portfolio for a launch at the end of the first half of the year. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning, Vijay.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Hey, morning, guys. It looks like the numbers were actually a lot better than what it seemed like at first blush there. Just maybe a couple of questions from the guidance, Chris or Vince. What does the guidance assume from a pricing assumption for next year? And can you just talk about the quarterly cadence, Chris? Because obviously this year was a back half loaded on the revenue front. And given the flat share count and your comments on free cash generation, it looks like maybe there's some upside from cap deployment potentially. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, pricing is just slightly negative in the plan. And as Chris said, it's already in the guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, which is no different than the beginning of just about any year. You got to look at that. The pricing environment, as Vince said, hasn't really changed.","And so then I think the next part of your question came to the phasing of revenue going forward. And as we said, we do see some headwinds continuing as we annualize the headwinds from Saudi and Africa. That'll bring us down in the area of about 4% in the first quarter, plus or minus 20 basis points, particularly as that's a high quarter for the flu. So it could go one way or the other on us.","But then the ramp in the second quarter brings us back well within the range, the high end of range. And the ramping of new products we see in the second half of the year brings us back to a strong 4.5% to 5% range. So that feels real good.","In terms of capital deployment, the share buybacks, we were committed to not buy back any shares, other than what we've already done for Respiratory, which we've talked about. But we're not looking to do anything until we get to the 3 times leverage. We want to hit that commitment that we had. And that brings us through March, so halfway through the year.","And then from that point on, you're right. There could be some. But you don't get the full year impact of that at that point. So more to come on that. But there is some potential as we buy back shares to have a little bit of impact on 2017, but probably more likely the impact would be on 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Weinstein of William Blair.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. You'll obviously excuse the crackly voice this morning. It was a late night for us in Chicago, and a good one, a very good one.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Congrats on that.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Congratulations.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Wanted to ask about kind of U.S. headwinds that we've heard about from others, specifically flu year over year was a tough comp for a lot of people. Utilization seems to be a little weaker. We're hearing about things taking longer to get through committees on capital projects and worked out of inventory distributors. So how do you guys think about those? And how do you think about kind of the U.S. market going forward? What are the positive offsets that you're seeing to those? And are you guys seeing any of those same headwinds that I described? Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well we're generally not procedural driven. An Alaris conversion to make the hospital safer and more effective, they're not being driven by this on the margin procedures. And in fact Tom was talking about interoperability before. And just to give an example, Brian, we were at one account, and we were saving 5 million keystrokes a year. It's a kind of thing that you want to do in this environment. And it was a very intentional part of our strategy.","So what I would say is generally across the board, we're seeing pretty good stability and some increase. We're just getting started with Kiestra , for example, in the U.S., which is a major cost saving, whether it's in the hospital market or in the clinical lab market. And so we don't have a lot of exposure to the kind of headwinds that you were mentioning.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I think what demonstrates that, Brian, is the 7.2% growth we saw in the U.S. across the company, which was strong in both segments, 7.7% in Medical and 5.8% in Life Science. And I'd also point to Biosciences growing in the U.S. around 8% for the quarter and for the year. A lot of that was new product introductions, the Symphony [FACSymphony], Celesta [FACSCelesta], the new Melody [FACSMelody] introduction, whatever. So U.S. is feeling particularly strong for our business.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jon Groberg of UBS.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, thanks a million. So Vince, it's the first analyst day coming up since \u2013 in November here since 2011. And I know you don't want to give away all the details. But just kind of big picture, maybe you can help us understand what you hope people take away from the meeting?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. I hope that they take away a true understanding of when we are talking about this move to complete solutions for the customer based on anchor products and then value-added services, all the way to complete solutions, what that means from a portfolio standpoint. And when I'm saying that we have the most robust pipeline in the history of the company, I want you to understand what that all means.","And we will lay that out for you in a lot of detail. So that's number one on the list, that you understand why we have that confidence going forward. And I think it's going to be fun, quite frankly. It was fun doing this 5 years ago. So I'm looking forward to it. And then we're going to take that, and Chris is going to kind of give you a financial model of how this all holds together.","And lastly, we're going to talk about the capabilities that it's going to require to do all this. And we're going to show you how we built the capabilities foundationally over the last 5 years. And then how we build upon them. Tom mentioned informatics, for example. But we'll also get into how we approach emerging markets, what's different about our strategy, and why we see that continuing to work.","And some of the other capabilities that we will be bringing to bear, which all is an extension of the work we've done over the 5 years. So that's the kind of day and look forward to seeing you there, Jon.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Look forward to it. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Couple of questions here. First off, international safety, Vince, you mentioned China in particular as the standout. Just remind us where we are on the ongoing European conversion.","And then secondly, the Life Sciences business, at least relative to Medical, has been a little less predictable. And we certainly appreciate all the new product launches, both in launch as well as the near term development. But do you think this can improve the predictability of the business? Or do you think we may have to look at some tuck-in deals to improve the consistency? Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well let me just take Life Sciences first. And the lumpiness that we've seen on Life Sciences, there's two elements. One is just Kiestra, which is a positive thing. These are big installations. They're $2 million. And so you're seeing some quarterly jump arounds as customers are ready for us to install. And because there's some major changes that they have to make to the laboratory, number one.","Number two, and we've had this issue with Africa, and that's been a bit of a problem. We think that's going to annualize.","Are we interested in tuck-in acquisitions there? Absolutely, as we are on the Medical side. I'm just going to ask Alberto to comment on Kiestra. And kind of what you're seeing from a pipeline standpoint. And how you see the U.S. market evolving, because we just got started there.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes, good morning. Where we're seeing the most growth and positive growth is in the U.S. market. Traditionally this has been an acquisition that was based in Europe and that market was most developed there. But we're beginning to see some significant traction here in the U.S. In fact the sales this last year doubled versus the previous one, admittedly on a small base. But we're seeing a lot of positive momentum, especially as we build the platform. And you'll hear the capabilities of the platform that you'll hear about in the analyst day. So we would continue to build on those capabilities. And that gets the customers very excited about the future of the platform, not only the present of the platform.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Great. And so the second part of the question was on where are we in Europe from a Safety conversion standpoint. And if I remember right, Tom Polen gave you a baseball analogy last quarter. So what inning are we in, Tom?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Hey, Bill. Tom. So we're in the middle innings when it comes to E.U. Safety. And maybe it'll be an overtime as well, like there was last night.","But overall, we see Safety continuing to perform well in Europe. Compliance with the regulation certainly is fueling that. We see implementation strongest in the conventional hospital settings, a little weaker in the alternate settings. That's true in most markets where individual doctor compliance may be less than a large, governed hospital setting.","Strongest conversion rates we see in infusion therapy and blood collection, a little bit lagging in injection. That's also the exact same trend that we saw in the U.S. So still good growth prospects there. And we're in the middle innings.","You also mentioned China. Overall, in Emerging Markets we see Safety in the very early innings at less than 15% conversion, so still quite a ways to go.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning, Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A lot of the questions been answered. But just wanted a little bit more color on sort of your emerging market expectations. I mean there was a number of reductions in terms of the outlook and the growth over the year \u2013 or during 2016. And I realize a lot of that was sort of due to the Africa and the Middle East situation. But what sort of gives you confidence that that's going to reaccelerate this year, other than tougher comps, or easier comps? What are you sort of seeing right now that gives you confidence that that's going \u2013 you're not going to have to face another slower year?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well I think you have to start with Saudi Arabia, which was a major impact to our emerging market growth this year. And as I said, government policy was, cut all expenses by 35%. Now if you're going to run your healthcare system, you can't just stop buying product, number one. So our expectation was they were running down their inventories, and then \u2013 and they would start to buy.","What we've seen in this quarter was stabilization there. And so it didn't come all the way back to positive growth, but there was significant improvement. So that gives us a sense that our hypothesis in this case is right, number one.","Number two, it's really Africa and the annualization of Africa. It was still negative. But we started to see, and Alberto could give you more detail, some CD4 orders starting to come in, which we did not see.","So, and then we saw good performance across Asia, as I was mentioning before. I expect that to keep happening. I expect Latin America, that Brazil is going to remain status quo. And we're going to continue to see strong growth in the other marketplaces. But, Alberto, any other comments on CD4?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. I just want to go back to a comment that you said before, in terms of the change in the supply chain.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, yeah.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","That created a little bit of instability in the ordering process and the delivering. And that created a little bit more variance than we had anticipated too.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, where people didn't know how to order.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And that's behind them. Then, Chris?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I think the other point is that China, we saw a little bit of inventory adjustments in the first quarter of last year. But since then, as Vince mentioned earlier, it's been growing very nicely. And you see the fourth quarter grew extremely nicely. A little bit of an easier compare there, but still very strong. Vince and I and Tom just got back from China. I can tell you that there's a lot of enthusiasm for the \u2013 some of the newer products that we're bringing in. So we see a lot of good stability. And as we mentioned, we're looking at low double digits on China in the next year.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And then the last piece is that we do expect to start getting some traction with the CareFusion products. And that's tens of basis points for the corporation, but it's more than that obviously for the Emerging Markets.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Just a couple topics. First, could you provide a bridge for 2017 operating margin guidance? I guess I'm just trying to get at how much of this is synergies, removal of respiratory, mix, et cetera.","And then second, on the topic of new products, what was new product contribution to 2016 revenue growth? And looking ahead to 2017, it seems like new product contribution to organic growth should account for a bigger part of overall growth, as you accelerate revenue synergies and some important launches, such as the infusion sets. Could you comment on that? Thank you.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So this is Chris on the first part of that question. As we look at the margin next year, the roughly 200 basis points of operating margin, about 50 basis points of that from the normal continuous improvement kind of stuff, another 50 basis points coming from cost synergies, and about 100 basis points coming from the Respiratory JV coming off our income statement. So we get a benefit there. And on the gross profit, it's roughly the same kind of area. There's a benefit from Respiratory. About half of it coming from Respiratory, about half of it coming from CI and synergy.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","In terms of new products, the growth that you're seeing in Biosciences is really driven by the new product instrumentation. So I can point you directly to that.","But in terms of the other major new product launches that we are talking about, they really haven't gotten traction yet. Barricor, people are just starting to validate Barricor. The approvals on BD MAX we just got in the last month or so. So they really haven't hit. And then you're talking about tens of basis points in terms of the CareFusion products in the emerging markets at this point in time.","We haven't done the \u2013 we haven't completed the work, let me say it that way \u2013 in terms of trying to get a really good analysis around breaking out new product from the entire company. As we're going through the CareFusion integration, we haven't counted the geographic extension of those products as new products. But we're working our way through that. And you'll have a better sense after the analyst day of how this is coming together.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Matt Taylor of Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could comment, given that you do have some bigger product cycles here coming up in the fiscal year, and one of the more robust pipelines at the company. Could you comment on some of the bigger opportunities, like fluids, diabetes, and some of the diagnostic launches, in terms of how we should expect the revenue contributions from those to flow? Help us size them? And just give us some thoughts on timing?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So I'll ask Tom to start with talking about diabetes and FlowSmart. Okay?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Hi, Matt, this is Tom. So certainly we're excited about the upcoming launch or the recent launch of the infusion set. In September we did make our first shipments to Medtronic on the MiniMed Pro-set with our FlowSmart technology. Medtronic has begun shipping that to patients. And the feedback that we're hearing is very positive.","And there's been a number of bloggers actually write their experience. You can look that up online. But it's very, very good feedback as that's moved into the marketplace just over the last couple months. We do expect that that pilot will expand to a broader full launch in early Q2. And that's well on track.","So I think back to one of the earlier questions, as we think about within the Diabetes Care business, we do expect \u2013 and obviously we don't give guidance by business unit. But we expect an uptick in 2017 in Diabetes Care, driven by that FlowSmart launch. And that's on track, proceeding as planned.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. So Alberto, why don't you comment on BD MAX and Barricor as well, in terms of kind of phasing on those things?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. So for the BD MAX, the two approvals that we got in the U.S., FDA approvals, we're very excited about, because they're very unique assays. They're very differentiated assays that will bring a lot of value to the market. The CT\/GC\/TV assay is the first one that is integrated, which is a guideline from the CDC to do the three tests all in one. And we're the only ones that will have it in the same assay.","The vaginal panel will be a significant improvement versus the only approved assay, the Affirm assay that we have out there will be better accuracy, more targets, and much improved performance from that side.","That will take a little bit of time to be built into the sales, as people evaluate and accounts evaluate and convert to these. But we are very, very optimistic. And all the interest has been very high in both accounts.","And on Barricor, similar thing. The evaluations are beginning to happen. There's more than 50 accounts currently evaluating the Barricor products. And that momentum we anticipate to continue in the rest of the year.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So if you think about it, Alberto, from a cycle standpoint, an evaluation of a new assay takes about how long generally? 90 days? Customer...","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, between \u2013 yeah. I would say between \u2013 the quickest 45 [days] to it can be up to 100 days. So somewhere in there.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","To 100 days.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. And then you have to \u2013 they got to work off their old inventory and whatnot.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Correct.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Now the last piece we haven't mentioned at all, and we will talk to you about it at the analyst day, of course is Genomics. And Genomics, where we stand there is for BD CLIC, we are putting our first instruments as early access into customer accounts. So they will just start to do their validations as well. And so I don't expect that to be a big contributor this year. I expect since it's such new technology, it's going to take a little longer. But we're also starting to get good feedback there. Anything else you want to add?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And we will be issuing and launching new protocols as well, new assay protocols...","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","...as we go along the year.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And that will build up momentum at the same time.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. It's really coming into I think 2018 with those protocols.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much for the question.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Christy, do we have any other questions?","Operator","Yes, your final question is coming from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning, no problem.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Just you've now had some time to kind of digest all the opportunities that maybe you had in front of you, that CareFusion had in front of it, but didn't have the means to exploit. And I'm thinking a little bit more about the dispensing business in Europe. And I know the business model in that part of the world is just different, and it hasn't historically lent itself well. But I do believe you had begun to talk a little bit about Rowa and leveraging that technology.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","I'm just wondering if that's going to factor in in 2017 in the cross sell or the synergy phase of the acquisition integration? And any kind of thoughts there? And is that something that we could hear more about at the analyst day? Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes, you will hear more about it at the analyst day. It's not so much a cross selling opportunity, but an additional opportunity is the way that I would think about that. And we will share that, because we haven't kind of detailed what that product line looks like for you. And there's multiple aspects to that. So, yeah, we'll be happy to talk about that. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well thank you all for your participation on the call today. It was a pleasure going through, which was a strong year for BD, to talk about 2017. And we're looking forward to getting together with you at the analyst day in 2 weeks. So thanks very much, and we'll see you there.","Christopher R.

It will be available for replay through November 9, 2017, on the investor's page of the BD.com website or by phone at 1-800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 92540524. I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment. Beginning today's call is Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique N. Dolecki - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at BD.com. During today's call will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our fourth fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release including the financial schedules is posted on the BD.com website.","The fourth quarter and full fiscal year comparable revenue growth rates provided today exclude the revenues of divestitures, most notably the Respiratory Solutions business that was divested in October of 2016, just after our 2016 fiscal year end. As a reminder, this is the last quarter in which we will have a year-over-year impact due to the Respiratory Solutions divestiture as we reach the anniversary of the divestiture with the start of the new fiscal year. The details of purchase accounting and other adjustments and a comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedule in our press release or the appendix of the investor relations slides. Please note that all fiscal year 2018 guidance provided today is on a BD stand-alone basis.","Regarding the acquisition of C. R. Bard, all the strategic and financial parameters remain unchanged from the deal announcement. After the transaction closes, we'll provide more detailed guidance for the combined company. Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, President; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 4, as you read in this morning's press release, we are very pleased with our performance for the year. I'm extremely proud of all of our accomplishments this year and how hard our organization worked to achieve them. Our core remains strong and we continue to execute on our CareFusion commitments. At the same time, we announced another transformational acquisition and are making excellent progress towards a successful closing.","We achieved all of this while overcoming multiple headwinds. Despite the impact from the transformation of our U.S. dispensing business model, lost earnings from the divestiture of the Respiratory business, the impact from the severe hurricane season and continued currency pressure, we grew revenues 4.5%, drove approximately 180 basis points of margin expansion and delivered double digit EPS growth. The bottom line is our business continued to deliver solid consistent results.","Before I highlight some achievements in fiscal year 2017, I'd like to take a moment to comment on the severe storms that occurred in the fourth quarter. We are grateful that all of our associates are safe and accounted for. As an organization, we are working to support our associates in Puerto Rico by delivering much-needed food water and power supplies as well as by setting up an employee relief fund. I'm proud of response by our global associates to personally contribute and help their peers in need. I'm also impressed by the fortitude of our associates in Puerto Rico who are enduring continued hardship and yet find a way to come to work so that we can continue to meet the needs of our customers and their patients. Chris will provide commentary on the business impacts from the hurricane in a few moments.","Moving along to our key achievements this year, first, the strategic transformation of the U.S. dispensing business model was successfully implemented and our strategy for end-to-end medication management is resonating with our customers. We are continuing to see sales pull-through as customers understand the benefits of our integrated offering. Second, emerging markets continue to be a key growth driver for the company. Our momentum in China and the broader emerging markets is reflected in our strong fiscal 2017 performance in both segments. Third, we're extremely pleased with the excellent progress we continue to make with our CareFusion cost synergies. We expect approximately $350 million in total CareFusion cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2018.","For the three years ending fiscal 2017, on a cumulative basis, we achieved underlying margin expansion of approximately 500 basis points. And fourth, we are making excellent progress in preparing for the integration of Bard and BD. We are excited by the opportunities the new company will have to bring more comprehensive clinically relevant solutions to customers and patients around the globe.","Moving on to slide 5, we have achieved several significant milestones towards the Bard closing in the six months that have followed the acquisition announcement. This past spring, we went to market shortly after the deal announcement and successfully issued approximately $5 billion in common and preferred shares. We also launched nearly $10 billion in senior notes. All offerings were oversubscribed by a multiple of over 3 times, clearly a positive indicator of investor sentiment about the transaction.","In early August, Bard shareholders approved the merger with approximately 99% of the share votes cast in favor of the proposed merger. More recently, conditional clearance was received from the European Commission. As expected, we have committed to divesting certain assets associated with our soft tissue core needle biopsy product line, which we acquired with CareFusion, to satisfy the conditions to the Bard closing requested by the European Commission.","From an integration standpoint, once we receive all regulatory approvals, we will be ready. Our teams have been engaged in extensive integration planning, including day-one readiness. We continue to expect that the BD and Bard transaction will close in the fourth calendar quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions and additional regulatory approvals, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other regulatory bodies.","Moving to slide 6. You will see the guidance for fiscal year 2018 on a stand-alone, currency-neutral basis that excludes any expected impact from the Bard acquisition. For fiscal year 2018, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth of 4% to 5% based on our current view of the environment and various macroeconomic factors. As a reminder, the U.S. dispensing change will continue to impact our year-over-year growth by 100 basis points in both the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018, resulting in an estimated headwind of approximately 50 basis points for the full fiscal year. Of course, there are a number of items that could bring us to the top or bottom end of our guidance range, including a stronger or weaker flu season than expected, the performance of new product launches, emerging market growth and pricing.","On the bottom line, we will continue to deliver high-quality earnings growth. For fiscal year 2018, we expect adjusted EPS of $10.55 to $10.65, which reflects currency-neutral growth of approximately 10%. As Monique stated earlier, we will provide guidance for DB plus Bard after the transaction closes.","I will now turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our fourth quarter financial performance and our fiscal year 2018 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'm also extremely proud of our achievements this year as well as the extraordinary efforts made by our organization in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to slide 8, I'll review our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year. Total fourth quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4.4% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. For the total year, revenues of $12.1 billion grew 4.5%, in line with our previously communicated expectations. The fourth quarter and full-year results include the impact from the U.S. dispensing change, which lowered total company revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and 50 basis points for the full year. Excluding this impact, we drove full-year revenue growth of approximately 5%, which is the high end of our full-year guidance range.","As Vince mentioned, our underlying performance is strong. As we communicated to you last quarter, our confidence in achieving our outlook was based on strong fourth quarter performance in MMS and Diabetes Care and across the Life Sciences segment, combined with continued strength in emerging markets, all of which we achieved. In addition, through the excellent efforts of our associates and our distribution and logistics partner as well as strength across the business, we overcame the logistics-related issues we described to you in mid-September. I'll provide more color on revenue growth in the quarter in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and geography.","We significantly expanded our margins and captured an additional $80 million in annualized synergy cost savings related to CareFusion, reaching $250 million in annualized cost savings on a cumulative basis through the end of fiscal 2017. We are on track to achieve approximately $350 million in total annualized cost synergies by the end of fiscal 2018, which is the high end of our previously communicated range.","Adjusted EPS growth of 13.2% in both the fourth quarter and the full year reflects our ability to overcome the dilution from the Respiratory divestiture and the U.S. dispensing change. Combined, these headwinds impacted EPS growth by approximately 700 basis points in the fourth quarter and 400 basis points for the full year. We are also very pleased to have continued our longstanding record of delivering an increasing dividend. Fiscal 2017 marked our 45th year of consecutive dividend increases.","Now moving on to slide 9, I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a comparable currency-neutral basis. As discussed, fourth quarter revenue growth was 4.4% for the total company, including an estimated headwind of 100 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change. Pricing declined about 10 basis points in both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Due to the timing of Hurricane Maria late in our fourth quarter, there was very little impact to our fourth quarter results.","BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased 3.9% which includes a headwind of 160 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change. For the full fiscal year, Medical revenues grew a strong 4.3% which includes an estimated 80 basis points headwind from the U.S. dispensing change.","Medication and Procedural Solutions, or MPS, fourth quarter growth was 1.5%. Broad strength in infusion-related disposables was partially offset by a tough comparison to the prior year. For the full fiscal year, MPS revenues grew 3.8%.","Revenues in Medication Management Solutions, or MMS, grew 6.7% in the fourth quarter including a headwind of approximately 600 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change. Growth in MMS was driven by our international dispensing business and by global strength in infusion. For the full fiscal year, MMS revenues grew 4.9% including a headwind of approximately 300 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change.","Diabetes Care revenues grew 6.4%, driven by strong growth of 8.7% in the U.S. and double-digit growth in emerging markets, as expected. International growth continued to be impacted by some softness in Europe, primarily in the UK. For the full fiscal year, Diabetes Care revenues grew 3.6%.","Pharmaceutical Systems revenues grew 3.4% in the fourth quarter. Strong growth in Safety and SAIS were partially offset by the impact of timing of customer orders that benefited growth earlier in the fiscal year. For the full fiscal year, Pharmaceutical Systems grew 5.3%.","BD Life Sciences fourth quarter revenues increased 5.4%. Growth was driven by strength across the segment. For the full fiscal year, BD Life Sciences revenues grew 4.8%.","Revenues in Diagnostic Systems grew 5.2% in the fourth quarter. Strength in core microbiology was driven by blood culture and IDAST. In addition, we saw continued strong growth in our BD MAX molecular platform. For the full fiscal year, Diagnostic Systems grew 6.4%.","Preanalytical Systems growth of 5.3% in the fourth quarter was driven by strength in core products. For the full fiscal year, PAS grew 5.2%.","Biosciences revenues grew 5.8% in the fourth quarter. This reflects growth in our newer research instruments such as the FACSMelody and FACSymphony as well as continued strength in research reagents. In addition, FACSLyric, our more recently launched next-generation clinical flow cytometer for HIV and leukemia and lymphoma applications, also contributed to growth in the quarter.","For the full fiscal year, Biosciences grew 2.4%. This was driven by strong momentum in the second half of the year, which we expect to continue in fiscal year 2018.","Moving to slide 10, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the fourth quarter on a comparable currency-neutral basis. U.S. revenues grew 2.1% in the fourth quarter, which includes an estimated headwind of 200 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change.","BD Medical revenues grew 2.2% including an estimated headwind of 280 basis points from the dispensing change. BD Life Sciences revenues grew 2% in the U.S. For the fourth quarter, growth in BD Medical in the U.S. was driven by performance in Pharmaceutical Systems, Diabetes Care and the infusion business within MMS. Within MPS, continued strength in prefilled flush devices was offset by a tough comparison to a strong performance in the prior year across the portfolio.","For the fourth quarter, BD Life Sciences growth in the U.S. reflects strength in core products in Preanalytical Systems and in Research Instruments and Reagents in Biosciences. Growth in our U.S. Diagnostics business was driven by continued strength in BD MAX, offset by a tough comparison to significant Kiestra installations in the prior year. For the full fiscal year, U.S. revenues were strong, growing 3% despite an estimated headwind of 100 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change.","Moving on to International, revenues grew 6.9% in the fourth quarter. Growth of 6% in the Medical segment was driven by performance from infusion-related disposables in the MPS unit and from both the infusion and dispensing businesses in MMS. Within our international dispensing business, strength in emerging markets and strong performance in our retail business in Europe contributed to MMS growth in the quarter.","Diabetes Care revenues reflect strength in emerging markets, partially offset by continued softness in Europe, as previously discussed. Growth in the Life Sciences segment of 8.3% was driven by performance across the Diagnostic Systems, Biosciences and PAS. Diagnostic Systems growth reflects strength in core microbiology including IDAST and Kiestra and in BD MAX. Biosciences revenues reflect strong sales of our newer research and clinical instruments. Growth in PAS was driven by strong demand for core products in emerging markets. For the full fiscal year, international revenues grew 6.2%.","On slide 11, developed markets revenues were strong, growing 2.8% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full fiscal year, despite estimated headwinds from the U.S. dispensing change of 130 basis points and 60 basis points respectively. Fourth quarter emerging markets revenue grew a strong 12.7% currency neutral, bringing our full-year growth to 10.1%, which exceeded our expectations. China growth for the fourth quarter was strong at 13.4%, bringing the total year growth to 11.6%. The fourth quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects broad strength across both segments. By geography, greater Asia, including China and EMA grew double digits and sales in Latin America were up high-single digits.","Moving on to global safety on slide 12. Fourth quarter currency-neutral sales increased 3.9% year-over-year. By geography, safety revenues in the U.S. grew 30 basis points while international sales grew 9.1% currency neutral. By segment, fourth quarter Medical safety sales grew 2.7% and Life Sciences safety sales grew 5.9%. In the U.S., growth in Preanalytical Systems and infusion disposables in MMS was offset by a tough comparison to the prior year. International performance was driven by strong growth in Pharmaceutical Systems in China and solid growth in Europe in our Medical segment and strength in China and EMA in Preanalytical Systems. Safety revenues grew 16% in emerging markets in the fourth quarter and 11.5% for the full fiscal year.","Slide 13 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As discussed, revenues grew 4.4% in the quarter on a comparable currency-neutral basis, which includes approximately 100 basis points negative impact from the U.S. dispensing change. As we move down the P&L, I would like to point out that, similar to our prior quarters, our results in the prior year period include the Respiratory Solutions business while the current period does not, as the business was divested in October 2016.","Starting with gross profit, the decline of 50 basis points year-over-year includes approximately 600 basis points of negative impact from the loss of gross profit related to Respiratory Solutions divestiture and the U.S. dispensing change. I'll provide additional details on gross profit in just a moment.","SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 24.4%. In the fourth quarter, we incurred additional selling and shipping costs related to our efforts to scale shipments in the month of September, as previously discussed. As a result for the full year, SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was slightly above our guidance range. Accounting for the impact from the Respiratory divestiture and the U.S. dispensing change, we are pleased with the leverage we have achieved on an underlying basis, with SSG&A dollars growing slower than revenues. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 7%. The decline in R&D dollars spent year-over-year is due to the divestiture of the Respiratory Solutions business as well as the comparison to the prior year where we increased R&D spend in the fourth quarter as a result of the medical device tax suspension.","Our tax rate declined to 14.6% in the quarter, resulting in a full year effective tax rate below our guidance range of 15.2%. As you are aware, we expected a lower tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as an offset to the impact of U.S. dispensing change. Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, as you will see when I take you through our adjusted EPS guidance, we expect an increase in our effective tax rate. This is largely the result of discrete items in fiscal 2017 that are not expected to recur.","In the quarter, operating income grew 6.3% and adjusted earnings per share grew 13.2% compared to the prior year. Both operating income and EPS include approximately 700 basis points of negative impact from the Respiratory Solutions divestiture and the U.S. dispensing change.","Turning to slide 14 and our gross profit and operating margins for the fourth quarter, as you can see, currency did not have an impact on gross profit margin or operating margin in the quarter. On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by 100 basis points as continuous improvement initiatives, cost synergies and favorable mix which includes the positive impact of divestitures were partially offset by slight headwinds from pension and raw materials.","As expected, operating margin improved significantly in the fourth quarter, increasing 180 basis points. This was largely driven by the comparison to the high level of R&D spend in the prior year. For the full year, we are extremely pleased to have delivered approximately 180 basis points of underlying margin expansion. As Vince said earlier, over a three-year period we achieved approximately 500 basis points of margin expansion.","Moving to slide 15, I'd like to highlight our EPS growth which was in line with our expectations for the total year. Starting with fiscal 2016 EPS of $8.59, we are extremely pleased that we were able to deliver currency neutral EPS growth of 13.2% while overcoming notable headwinds. The strength of our performance as well as the tax benefit from stock comp accounting and other discrete items drove our ability to offset significant headwinds from the Respiratory Solutions divestiture, the U.S. dispensing change, pension and unfavorable currency. All in, we delivered earnings growth of 10.4%.","Moving on to slide 17 and our full fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance for stand-alone BD, at a high-level, we expect revenue growth of 4% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis which represents strong underlying growth of 4.5% to 5.5% excluding the impact of the U.S. dispensing change. On a reported basis, revenue growth is expected to be between 5% and 6%, reflecting a currency tailwind of approximately 100 basis points. This assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.18.","From a phasing perspective, as a reminder, in the first quarter we have a very tough comparison to 6.1% revenue growth in the prior year in addition to the impact from the U.S. dispensing change.","Moving on to the segments, we expect BD Medical to grow between 4% and 5%, and we also expect our Life Sciences segment to grow between 4% and 5%. Revenue growth contemplates a small amount of pricing pressure. We expect revenue growth to continue to be driven by recent product launches across both segments and continued strength in both developed and emerging markets.","We expect high single digit growth in emerging markets driven by a diversified base, with China growing low-double digits and continued strength in Latin America. And in terms of developed markets, we believe the stability we have seen in the market over the past 18 to 24 months will continue, yielding a growth rate of around 4% in fiscal 2018.","Now moving on to slide 18 and our full fiscal year 2018 EPS guidance for stand-alone BD, in fiscal year 2018, we expect another year of very strong earnings with 15% to 16% growth on an underlying basis. This includes additional CareFusion cost synergies and aggressive continuous improvement initiatives which will help offset notable headwinds from the U.S. dispensing change and the expected increase in our effective tax rate, resulting in currency neutral earnings growth of approximately 10%.","Assuming current spot rates, we expect currency will provide a tailwind in fiscal 2018, the first time in seven years, resulting in expected EPS growth of approximately 12%.","Now from a phasing perspective, beyond the tough compare for revenues in the first fiscal quarter and the impact of the U.S. dispensing change, there are a few additional items to consider. The additional cost base initiatives are not expected to ramp until the second fiscal quarter and the tailwind from foreign currency is not expected to be ratable across the year, but rather disproportionately larger in the second quarter.","Regarding Puerto Rico, our current fiscal 2018 revenue and EPS guidance does not contemplate any potential impact related to Hurricane Maria. We are still evaluating the impact and estimate it could be as much as $40 million to revenues, with a corresponding impact that could be as much as 1 percentage point of EPS growth. The products manufactured in our three plants in Puerto Rico represent approximately 5% to 6% of total company revenues.","All three of our plants are suffering from the destruction of the infrastructure of Puerto Rico, which, as you are aware, has interrupted the supply of power, water and raw materials. Our two plants in Cayey are currently back in production. However, we are still working to scale them to full productivity. Our third plant, which is located in Juncos, experienced more damage than the plants in Cayey and is not operational today. With that said, we expect to resume production in Juncos by the end of the first quarter.","While we feel good about our ability to return to full productivity during the fiscal year, this is dependent on several factors that are outside of our control. Before I move on, I'd like to echo Vince in thanking our associates in Puerto Rico, who over the last six weeks have demonstrated great dedication and perseverance.","Now turning to slide 19, I'd like to walk through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2018. We expect gross profit margin to be between 54% and 55%. SSG&A as a percent of sales is expected to be between 23% and 24%. We expect our R&D investment to be in line with fiscal year 2017 at 6% to 7% of revenues, as we continue to invest in new products and platforms.","As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 24% and 25% of revenues, up from 22.9% in fiscal year 2017. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve 100 basis points to 150 basis points, bringing our cumulative margin improvement over four years to 600 basis points to 650 basis points.","We expect our tax rate to be between 17% and 19%. This is higher than our fiscal 2017 tax rate, which included a number of discrete items. For fiscal year 2018, we anticipate our adjusted average fully-diluted share count to be approximately 219 million shares. Cash flow is expected to remain strong with operating cash flow of about $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2018. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $800 million and $850 million.","With respect to our anticipated acquisition of Bard, things are progressing well. The financial parameters we described when we announced the deal have not changed. We will provide guidance for BD plus Bard after the transaction closes.","In summary, we have good momentum exiting fiscal 2017, and I'm confident that the fiscal year 2018 will be another strong year of performance. We look forward to the closing of the Bard acquisition. We believe that the combination of BD and Bard will create an even more powerful healthcare company, enhancing value for our customers, patients and shareholders globally.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who'll provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Chris. Moving on to slide 21, I will walk you through our updates on new product innovation and strategic and business initiatives. Starting with the new product innovations within our Medical segment, we're pleased that we will soon be able to provide sodium chloride saline to our customers through our partnership with Fresenius. As saline remains limited in supply, the addition of sodium chloride to our Medication Management portfolio will benefit our customers and, of course, their patients.","Within our Diabetes Care business, as you are aware, we temporarily paused shipments of our insulin infusion sets. This was due to a moderately-higher-than-anticipated rate of complaints associated with insertion that occurred during the pilot launch. We have conducted a clinical trial to gather further insights and to ensure that patients ultimately realize the full benefits of BD FlowSmart technology. We are continuing to work closely with Medtronic toward full commercialization.","In Life Sciences, while we continue to receive very positive feedback from customers on the overall benefits of our Barricor blood collection tubes, a few customers have reported issues unrelated to test results. As a result, we have voluntarily recalled Barricor in the U.S. and are actively working with the FDA to get back on the market. We anticipate relaunching in fiscal year 2018. Importantly, there is no change in the value proposition of the product.","While there are delays in these two products, we're quite pleased that numerous new products that we talked with you about at our Analyst Day last November are on track and are doing quite well. These include our UltraTouch push-button blood collection set, Veritor Plus, new BD MAX assays and the new research in Clinical Instruments within Life Sciences that we talked about as well as Pyxis ES and Neopak in our Medical business, just to name a few.","Within our Genomics business, we recently expanded our portfolio through the launch of BD Rhapsody, a new single cell platform for RNA expression analysis. Previously in limited release as BD Resolve, the BD Rhapsody is a complete segment of reagents, instruments and software for targeted gene expression analysis of tens of thousands of individual cells.","Also in our Life Sciences business within strategic and business initiatives, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition of a leading provider of informatics software that enables BD to offer full sample to discovery flow cytometry and single cell genomics solutions.","We also recently announced that Tim Ring and David Melcher will join the BD Board of Directors upon the closing of the Bard acquisition. We look forward to the experience and guidance they will bring to the new combined company.","And lastly, I would like to congratulate our MMS team on the one-millionth installation of the Alaris Pump module. The Alaris Pump is helping health care providers to safely administer medication to their patients, reduce medication errors and improve patient safety.","Moving on to our operational efficiency update on slide 22, we continue to make progress with our CareFusion cost synergy capture. Through the end of fiscal year 2017, we've achieved $250 million in annualized synergies. We expect approximately $350 million in total cost synergies related to the CareFusion acquisition as we exit fiscal year 2018.","Turning to operating margin expansion, as you can see, we continue to drive significant operating margin expansion over a multiyear period. The consistent performance of our businesses combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. Over the three-year period through fiscal year 2017, we delivered approximately 500 basis points of cumulative margin expansion.","Moving on to slide 23, I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, our core remains strong across both segments. We're pleased with our fiscal 2017 performance and our ability to offset notable headwinds from the Respiratory divestiture, the U.S. dispensing change, and foreign currency headwinds.","Second, we're extremely pleased with the excellent progress we continue to make with our CareFusion synergies and our ability to drive continued margin expansion. Third, we continue to make excellent progress executing against our integration plan and towards closing the Bard transaction.","And finally, we look to fiscal year 2018 and beyond with confidence as we continue to pursue our mission to address some of the world's most pressing health care needs and advance the world of health.","So thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Vince and Chris, I'll give you kind of a two-part question, all really focused on top line growth fiscal 2018. So Vince, the 4.5% to 5.5% underlying growth for 2018 is obviously better than most investors anticipated. It's actually much more consistent with the outlook you provided in November at the November 16 Analyst Day where you talked about 2018 acceleration above that 5%. So I know you talked about some of the drivers. Bf you just think about the pipeline, Vince, that you talked about in November of 2016 versus where you sit now heading into 2018, I wonder if you could bridge that gap and provide people the sense of why you're so confident that 5%-plus number is achievable.","And then, Chris, just to avoid some of the communication dynamics across quarters for this year, obviously first quarter's going to be the weakest. As we move forward to quarters two through four, should we think about stable underlying growth in two, three and four? Or is the back half going to be more polarized than the first half excluding that first quarter? Just wanted to get a sense of after that first quarter how people should think about the modeling. Thanks so much.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. So, David, at a very high level I think what we've seen is strong growth in developed markets, driven by new products and then improving growth in the emerging markets. Especially if I go back a year, it's really China has changed. And if you look at the last four quarters, it improved every single quarter. The biggest change there of course was the rebound on the Life Sciences side, but you also started to see some of the synergies that we were getting from CareFusion as Rowa (39:27) has started to take off and some of the disposable growth has been quite good.","The other thing that has happened from an environmental standpoint is our sales growth in EMA has rebounded. And so that started to help us. You especially saw that in this quarter, and we expect that to continue. So from a geography standpoint, we are well balanced. From a new product standpoint, first, I would point out what's happened in Biosciences and the really nice turnaround that you have seen there, driven by all the new product launches that I listed: the FACSVia, the FACSMelody, the FACSymphony, those products that we were showing you. In addition, the launch of FACSRhapsody, we're excited about that too. That was based on the cellular research. So I think Alberto and his team have done a really nice job of improving the performance of that business and getting those new products out.","One thing I think people are missing is PAS is doing quite well. And while we talked about Barricor, UltraTouch is doing quite well. That was the second new product we showed back there in November. That's going well. And we still are very bullish on Barricor. Not a big impact in this year. But I think as we get into 2019, that's going to do quite well. And then of course, you saw the strong performance in DS. And Tom can comment even more on the Medical side, but we are making good progress. I think we feel very good about what we did with the dispensing change.","I think it has been really well received and we're starting to now go beyond just the change in leasing and there's some new products in terms of predictive analytics that are coming out. So that strategy is really on track. We continue to do well with the infusion pumps, so all of that is going quite nicely, SAIS is going well. So yes, we're a little behind on the FlowSmart, but we're on track pretty much with the other major launches that we're talking about. Not big impact in 2018 but really getting set up for 2019. So that's the way I see all of that. All in all, we're on track with what we said.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So to the second part of that question on the phasing as we look into 2018. As we said, the toughest compare is in the first quarter, as you know. Second quarter stabilizes a little bit. You still got the overhang from the 100 basis points of dispensing and that stabilizes a little bit. And then you make up for the first quarter for the most part in the second half of the year. Remember, the third quarter will be a bit of an easier compare because we had a low growth quarter this year in the third quarter. And then fourth quarter is pretty much an average compare. So think about it as a tough compare first quarter, which drives a lower than average first half, made up for in the second half.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with J.P. Morgan.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Mike.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. I'm going to try and sneak in three questions if I can, so here we go, here. (43:00). Number one, I know you're not updating on Bard today, but have your thoughts on year one accretion from Bard changed at all since the time of the deal announcement? Number two, I was interested in just kind of the update you were running through there on some of the pipeline. One product you didn't touch on was the type 2 basal-bolus pump. Can you update us on the status of the development and launch plans there?","And then third and last, I promise, is China. And as you're aware, China is moving towards national reimbursement for some devices and really started, what I would call, at the high end of the medical-technology curve. Can you just give us your thoughts on where China is headed and as you think about your exposure or lack of exposure to your business as well as Bard's business, because obviously China has been a big growth driver for you and for Bard over the last several years?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Since they were such good questions, we'll allow you to do three, okay?","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Much appreciated.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And I'll take the first one on the year one accretion. So as we said in our prepared remarks, we feel good about the Bard transaction and the financial parameters are in line with what we had articulated at the time of the deal announcement. Specifically, related to year one accretion, we had said low-single-digit accretion and that still stands. Bear in mind that was for a full year, we'll probably get nine months, but we still see low-single digit per share accretion.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. On the pump, Tom, you want to comment on that?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hi, Mike. This is Tom. Yes. The type 2 patch pump continues to progress very well in our funnel. One thing is you do see if you look in the appendix that we had said before we were expecting to launch that at the very end of FY 2018. Based on some learnings actually from other product launches, we did add in an additional patient clinical trial there, and so we now expect that to launch in 2019. So we don't see revenue in our guidance within the Diabetes Care business for 2018, but the project's progressing very well from a development perspective. We actually just finished final acceptance testing on the manufacturing line this week and are installing that in our plant in Ireland this month.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. And I'll take China. For us, Mike, the issue that you mentioned is not really all that relevant. What we've been working on has been the two invoice evolution in China in two provinces. And we've successfully implemented a program within those two provinces, and net-net it's neutral to positive for us, the way that we have done this. And so we think we're in very good shape if that moves ahead. They have slowed it down, and so we don't see a big impact in this year. Over time, I think they will come back to it. So that piece of it is fine, and we think we'll be able to apply it on the Bard side as well as we move forward.","In terms of the pricing, we've been very effective in getting the right pricing in the Green Book. And so as I look out over the next couple of years, I don't see a big issue, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate it. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, Brian.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","You guys talked about getting some benefit from the end-to-end solutions in MMS. I was hoping you guys could expand on that a little bit and talk about how customers are receiving kind of the entire solution at this point and talk specifically, if you could, about some share gains that you are expecting within the various segments there.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Tom will take that.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hey, Brian. This is Tom. So I think if you look at obviously MMS's performance in the quarter, which was 6.7%, and that includes a 600 basis points of headwind just from the accounting change, so if you take that into account, it's north of 10%. That's driven, as you mentioned, by very strong growth on both the dispensing and the infusion side.","We do expect our infusion category share to have gone up between 1% and 2% this year, in line with prior year, so we are continuing very good progress there. As you heard from Vince earlier, we've actually just installed our one-millionth Alaris Pump this past quarter, which was a major milestone for us.","And on the dispensing side, several years ago we were talking about the stabilization of Pyxis ES. At this point, Pyxis ES is really humming. We've got over 1,700 sites live now across the U.S., and we feel very good. We actually had a record level of new business closes on Pyxis ES since the platform has been in the marketplace and certainly a record level for Pyxis in the last five or six years. So we're feeling good about that.","The other thing is one of the metrics that we look at is pull-through of other products, so how often are customers choosing to buy Pyxis plus Alaris plus our software solutions, products like Cato and Pharmogistics? And as we look at those metrics, we see ratable quarter-on-quarter improvement in the value of people buying that end-to-end offering.","And so all of that gives us confidence as we go into FY 2018 that that solution is working. We'll be unveiling some new particularly informatics solutions at the ASHP coming up in December that are just going to further the offering that we have in that space.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So hopefully we'll see you there, Brian.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Next question, please.","Operator","Yes, sir. And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First, just to clarify the low-single digit accretion in 2018, should we prorate that for nine months? And then two product related questions. Tom, earlier this year you talked about an interim analysis for the Lutonix (49:34) trial. Should we still expect that before the end of 2017? And are you still confident in that indication? And then second, the flu season is expected to be severe this year. Can you talk about your exposure to the flu and how a severe flu season could impact BD? Thanks.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So on the year one accretion, as I said, the most important thing is all the financial parameters on this deal are consistent with what we had said. We did give guidance for the full year, to your point, but the interesting thing is it's low-single digits. It's low-single digits whether you do it over a year or nine months, and so you have the nine months.","We also have the divestiture of what we have to do on the needle biopsy, but we'll give more precise information on that along with multiple other parameters and inputs related to the transaction when we give the full guidance for the transaction in February. But it's consistent low-single digits.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So from a flu perspective, we budget kind of an average flu season, and so if it ends up in North America being stronger, which is where most of the market is, then it would drive us more towards our upper end of our range. That would be one of the positive factors.","There has been some strong flu in other parts of the world, so we'll see how that plays out. Our expectation is that you budget that in the second quarter of the year not the first quarter. Last year, it was a very unusual year and came in in the first quarter. So that's how we're thinking about it. We'll see.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And Larry, this is Tom. On your question on Lutonix, no change from obviously what Bard management guidance was prior on the timing of that. I'd say we continue to be optimistic around the ability to get that claim over the longer term, though. So no change versus what they had shared previously.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Right. Okay. Thanks very much. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thank you. I had a question on the Diagnostics part of the business, in particular the outlook here as we digest the PAMA legislation. I know it's early, but it does seem like the custom Medicare reimbursement are going to have a pretty protracted impact on a variety of labs that you guys serve. So I'm curious how you're game planning the way in which they spend, how that's going to change, and how you guys can make sure that you continue to get your share of the business?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Hi. This is Alberto. The PAMA proposals on CMS \u2013 first of all, I want to mention that they're in the comment period. They're not definitive. And we have commented in the direction of supporting the AdvaMed rationale, which is that probably they took a relatively small sample of labs, mostly bigger labs, and we are proposing that we take a little bit of a timeout and extend that polling of pricing to more smaller, independent labs.","But just to put it into context, obviously there's \u2013 most of our business is private insurance. This only affects the lab schedule. So we think that the direct impact potential in our businesses of this PAMA legislation is at worst, if you like, it's in the single digits that we're talking about. Single digit millions of dollars, and probably mostly on the low end because the amount of our business affected by this is relatively small and it's also capped by the proposal any one year in terms of how much the impact is.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. So not a big impact for us.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","No.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","But thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Bill. Are you there, Bill?","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yes. Hello. Can you hear me?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. We can hear you now.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning. Sorry about that. User error, I guess, on this end. So first off, Vince or Tom, can you talk a little bit about the ongoing adoption of new guidelines around handling certain oncology drugs and maybe how that might flow through to the domestic Medical business? And then I have a follow-up as well.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. This is Tom, Bill. So obviously, we have been part of helping to shape those legislations around closed system transfer devices and the adoption of those. We obviously have our product PhaSeal, which is growing very nicely, at or near double digits, and we expect that trend to continue as that legislation continues to expand to new states. In both the U.S. but also ex-U.S., we see very, very strong growth around the world for that platform. So I'd say no fundamental inflection difference that we expect in 2018 or 2019 but continuing to grow very strongly as it has been in recent years.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, Chris, just a housekeeping question. The fourth quarter adjusted earnings number, are you backing out the Bard debt interest expense as well as the cash interest income? It just wasn't clear when we were looking through the adjustment.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes, and that's consistent with what we did last quarter as well.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Just a couple of quick ones. One, and the impact to Bard from Puerto Rico and just some of their operations, just an update if there's going to be any read-through on that one. And then I just wanted to follow up on \u2013 just going back to your Analyst Day last year, just wanted to know if there's an update on your next-gen molecular system that you have in the works.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So on the first piece, we really can't say much about Bard at this point. But what we would say is they were fairly straightforward in the impact from Puerto Rico on their side. They did have an impact in their last quarter, and they anticipate having an impact in the next quarter. But they're back up operating, much like our Cayey plants and are subject to the same power issues that we are. But they don't have the same level of issue that we have at our Juncos plant. They're more like our Cayey plants, which are further along.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Which are scaling up. Okay. And then Alberto will brief you on next gen. Thank you.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. On the next gen molecular, we are \u2013 the program progresses, is continuing. We are very focused on a very reliable instrument and ultimately that's going to be guiding our launch cadence. But the program is ongoing and tracking as expected. One thing that's worth mentioning as well is that we have filed for HPV with the FDA a few months ago, and we expect approval of that towards the end of this calendar year. So December, January type.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. So making good progress.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good progress, yes.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","End of the day. Okay. Thanks very much. Next question?","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","I think just a couple quick questions for Chris. It doesn't appear 2018 stand-alone free cash flow guidance assumes much of a year-over-year increase. Could you just walk us through why that is? And then second question for Chris. You noted you incurred additional selling and shipping cost in Q4. I'm just wondering if you'd quantify that, so we could get to what margins would've been excluding those? And, kind of along the same lines, you stepped up R&D in a big way sequentially, Q3 to Q4. Just wondered if you'd comment on what drove that. Thank you.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So on cash, we actually do have a nice step-up and we've seen that step-up over the last couple years. We're going from $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. Most of that is the flow-through of net income. There is a payment of nearly $100 million related to pension payments, that kind of thing, that will have been made. You'll see that in the 10-K when we file, but a nice drop-through from net income. SSG&A, you're right. We did have some additional costs to drive the logistic issues, and we thought that was the right thing to do to drive the revenue and keep our customers happy, and so there was a step-up there. All in, with that, there were about $20 million or so of cost. And the R&D question that you asked was?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Just sequentially, what drove it up quarter-on-quarter?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well, you have the fact that we're scaling, and it's more of the growth is relating to the spending in the prior year, which was lumpy, which had to do with the repeal of the medical device tax.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Device tax. Yes. So it wasn't starting any new major programs or anything. We're really focused on delivering what we talked to you about at Analyst Day. And, of course, the other thing I would mention coming back to the cost question in the fourth quarter was we overcame $5 million of incremental costs in Puerto Rico, and you saw that on that line, too. So that's things like write-offs...","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","... of inventory and the like that occurred.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Exactly.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So we did overcome that as well.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Okay?","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Vince Forlenza for closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much, operator. So just a couple of thoughts. First, we delivered on our commitments this year with really strong performance demonstrating the consistent and I'd call it reliable nature of our business despite various headwinds throughout the year, which we detailed on the call. Our core business remains strong, and we're confident in our outlook for next year. And, lastly, of course, we look forward to the upcoming close of the Bard transaction and the opportunity to create meaningful, long-term value and continue to improve healthcare globally. So thank you very much for your participation today.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Administration; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, Group President; and Linda Tharby, Group President.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vince Forlenza","Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to extend congratulations on behalf of all of us here at BD to Monique Dolecki, our Vice President of Investor Relations, and her husband on the birth of their daughter. We understand that everyone is healthy and we wish them all the best.","With that, let's get started on Slide 4. As we stated in our press release, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We experienced growth across all three of our segments with particularly strong growth in Medical and continued improvement in Biosciences. Growth was also driven by continued emerging market expansion and sales of safety-engineered products. Our first quarter results were also aided by a number of timing factors, which Chris will speak to in more details shortly.","We've been talking to you for a few years about our long-term strategy for investing and innovating for growth. Back in 2011 and 2012, we embarked on a strategy to reinvigorate our portfolio with new products and complete solutions to better meet our customers' needs. We've been working to enhance our core businesses across our portfolio and expanding the categories in which we compete by moving into near adjacencies. Last year was the inflection point where we started to see the benefits of that strategy in our financial results and new products. In fiscal year 2014, we expect to continue ramping up our many recent new products and delivering on our strategy.","Additionally, we announced a small acquisition in our Diagnostics segment, Alverix. They have been a technology partner of ours since 2008 on the Veritor platform. Our strong revenue and earnings growth in the first quarter along with our revised full year outlook gives us the confidence to raise the bottom end of our previous revenue and earnings guidance ranges for the full fiscal year.","Moving on to Slide 5, we've outlined our first quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company revenues were strong at 6.7%. This includes about 80 basis points from acquisitions and about 120 basis point contribution of timing items including an early flu season. Fully diluted EPS grew 8.1% over the prior year to $1.37. Excluding the impact of the medical device excise tax, adjusted EPS was $1.42 or 11.9% growth.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris for a more detailed review of our first quarter financial performance and updated guidance.","Chris Reidy","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by discussing the key financial highlights for the first quarter, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. As Vince just stated, results were ahead of our expectations and we experienced growth across all three of our segments.","Our strong growth of 6.7% includes about 200 basis points from acquisitions and timing. Acquisitions contributed 80 basis points of growth in the first quarter, as anticipated. This was driven primarily by our Safety Syringes acquisition, which continues to perform well. We also benefited by about 100 basis points from timing in our Medical segment in both our Pharmaceutical Systems and Medical Surgical units.","Additionally, we received the benefit of 20 basis points from an early flu season coupled with competitive gains in the Point of Care category. Positive pricing in the quarter of about 40 basis points was slightly ahead of our expectations. This was partially due to continued effective price management. I would like to note that based on the number of tenders anticipated in the back half of the year, pricing remains on our radar for the full year.","This quarter, we experienced negative gross margin impacts from currency, raw materials, and startup costs, as anticipated. EPS in the quarter of $1.37 reflects 8.1% growth versus the prior year or about 11.9% excluding the medical device tax. EPS was ahead of our expectations this quarter largely due to our increased revenues. We repurchased about $190 million of our anticipated $450 million full-year 2014 share repurchase program.","Our first quarter results and revised full year outlook give us the confidence to raise the bottom end of our revenue and EPS guidance ranges. We now expect revenues between 4.5% and 5% with adjusted EPS now expected between 9.5% and 10% excluding the medical device tax. I'll talk more specifically about guidance in a moment.","Now let's move on to Slide 8 where I'll review the revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. As I just mentioned, revenue growth was 6.7% for the total company. BD Medical first quarter revenues increased 8.6%. Our results in this segment were driven by strong double-digit international growth across all business units and continued growth of safety-engineered products.","Within the Medical segment, Diabetes Care growth of 10.1% reflects continued strong sales of our Nano Pen Needle products. Medical Surgical's growth was 9.1% this quarter, aided in part by a timing of orders, as I previously mentioned. Pharmaceutical Systems' growth of 5.5% reflects the strong contribution from our Safety Syringes acquisition and a benefit from timing of orders.","BD Diagnostics' first quarter revenues increased 4.2%. The segment's growth was primarily driven by continued international expansion in both the Preanalytical and Diagnostic Systems units.","BD Biosciences' revenue growth was slightly ahead of expectations at 5.7%. This was due to double-digit emerging market growth and clinical reagent sales. We also saw solid instrument placements in both the US and Western Europe, aided by improved stability and research market funding. We continue to see signs of stabilization in the Biosciences market.","Moving on to Slide 9, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter. Overall, we saw stability in the US markets and an improvement in European end-markets. Particularly strong growth in Western Europe was driven by safety sales, Bioscience growth, the benefit of timing in Pharmaceutical Systems, and a favorable comparison to the prior year.","BD's reported US revenues increased 2.3% versus the prior year. US growth in our Medical segment was 3.8%. Strong growth in our US Diabetes Care unit of 8.4% continues to be driven by our BD Nano Pen Needle products. Medical Surgical growth partially benefited from some one-time items. Pharmaceutical Systems' growth benefited from the SSI acquisition, which was more than offset by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year and the variability in our customers' geographic ordering patterns.","US Diagnostics segment growth was about flat in the quarter due to the impact of the lost customer contract that we discussed on our last earnings call. We also saw continued declines in Women's Health, as we have been communicating with you for some time. This was partially offset by steady sales in microbiology, which includes Kiestra and the Point of Care categories.","US Biosciences growth was 3.3%, driven by strong instrument placements, clinical reagents, and continued stability in the marketplace.","International revenues grew 10% with double-digit emerging market growth and strong performance across the segments, particularly our Medical and Diagnostics segments. On a currency-neutral basis, the Medical segment grew 12.2%, Diagnostics grew 8.1%, and Biosciences grew 6.8%.","Medical growth was driven by strong Safety sales and the benefit of timing of orders in Pharmaceuticals Systems that I mentioned previously. Diagnostics growth was solid across both the Preanalytical and Diagnostic Systems units. BD Biosciences growth benefited from solid instrument placements in Western Europe.","Moving on to Slide 10, we continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, which accounted for approximately 25% of our total revenues in the first quarter. Emerging markets revenues grew 13.4% currency-neutral over the prior year.","We have been making strategic investments in emerging markets over the last few years, which has helped deliver robust emerging market growth. We saw a double-digit growth in a number of our key markets, with China growing over 25% currency-neutral. Emerging markets continue to deliver significant safety growth with an increase this quarter of about 15%.","Moving on to Slide 11, we have outlined our global safety revenues for the quarter. Currency-neutral safety sales increased 9.8% and grew to $557 million in the quarter. Revenues in the US increased by 8.1% and include the contribution from our SSI acquisition. International sales grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis with Western Europe and emerging markets both growing double-digits.","Medical safety sales grew 14% and Diagnostics growth was 5.7%, driven by a range of safety-engineered products. Medical safety benefited from our SSI acquisition and strong growth in our Medical Surgical unit international safety portfolio. At the conclusion of this first quarter, our SSI acquisition has annualized and would be included in our base.","Moving to solid 12 on gross margin, as expected and outlined to you on our last call, we experienced negative currency translation driven by the timing of the inventory movements. On a foreign currency neutral basis, benefits from our (inaudible) programs, favorable pricing and pension were more than offset by increased costs associated with raw materials, sought up items and acquisitions. Our gross profit guidance remains on track for the full year.","Slide 13 recaps the first quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results. Since I just discussed revenue and gross profit, I'll move to SSG&A, which grew 7.9%. Excluding the medical device tax, SSG&A grew about 5%, reflecting continued investments in areas such as emerging markets and new products.","R&D increased just over 6%, which is in line with our expectations. Our operating income increased 3.2%. But excluding the medical device tax, operating income growth of 6.9% was slightly higher than the rate of sales this quarter.","Our tax rate improved 170 basis points over the prior year. As we noted in last year's first quarter results, our tax rate was higher at that time due to some one-time items. In addition, there was a delay in the enactment of the R&D tax credit in the first quarter of last year. Both of those items contributed to a favorable comparison this quarter over the prior year.","These items resulted in earnings per share of $1.37, which is an 8.1% increase versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of the medical device tax, earnings per share of $1.42 represent an 11.9% growth rate.","Now turning to Slide 14, I'd like to review our updated guidance in more detail, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Our first quarter results, along with our revised full year outlook, give us the confidence to raise the bottom end of our fiscal year 2015 revenue guidance 50 basis points to 4.5% to 5% growth. This assumes a stable macroeconomic environment. As we discussed last quarter, we had reserved the bottom-end of our revenue guidance range for possible weakening in global macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable pricing impacts and\/or other deteriorating factors and we're not seeing that. We have seen continued signs of stabilization in both the US and Western Europe. We are estimating a full year euro exchange rate of $1.36.","Our full year outlook on pricing has improved slightly. As we noted, pricing remains a concern for the back half of the year. Given the current pricing environment, we are updating our pricing outlook to about 20 basis points of pressure for the year from our previous range of 20 basis point to 40 basis point.","Within the segments, we are increasing our guidance for the Medical and Bioscience segments. And I expect the Medical segment to grow 5% to 5.5% and the Bioscience segment to grow about 4% for the year. Diagnostics segment growth expectation remained between 3.5% and 4.5% for the year.","We remain on track to meet our goal of about 70 basis points to 80 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year excluding the impact of foreign currency and the medical device tax. About half of that benefit is expected from favorable pension assumptions along with 30 basis points to 40 basis points of underlying margin expansion.","In addition to revenues, we are raising the bottom end of our full fiscal year adjusted EPS guidance range by 50 basis points to between 9% and 9.5%. Excluding the medical device tax, we expect EPS to grow 9.5% to 10%. As a reminder, with the conclusion of our first quarter, the medical device excise tax has annualized and will be included in our base. Reported fully diluted EPS for the full year is now expected between $6.19 and $6.22. All other guidance components remain unchanged from what we provided on our year-end call in November.","The revenue and earnings profile that we outlined for you on our last call remain intact. Revenue growth is still expected to be stronger in the first half of the year, accentuated by our accelerated first quarter results. Earnings growth is still anticipated to be weighted in the back half of the year, although that effect is slightly muted by our first quarter timing benefit. Looking forward, a good way to think about the balance of the year is that a number of the timing benefits that we experienced this quarter, will reverse during the second and third quarters.","I would like to turn the call back over to Vince who will provide you with an update on our product portfolio.","Vince Forlenza","Thank you, Chris. Now moving on to Slide 16, we see the program and product launches in our Medical and Biosciences segments. In fiscal years 2012 and 2013, we launched about 30 new products. As we've been communicating with you, our percentage of revenue from new products is coming from about 8% of our overall revenues in 2011 to an expected 15% or 16% by the end of this fiscal year.","This year, we will focus on the successful scale-up of our recent years' new products and solutions, while continuing to add products who complement these offerings. In the Medical segment, we continue to look forward to the continued rollout of our new BD Simplist line of prefilled generic injectables. We currently have four drugs approved by the FDA, including our recent morphine approval, which we expect to launch in the coming months. We have five or four additional drug approvals with the FDA and we will update you as they complete the approval process.","As we've been sharing with you, this is still a very new initiative and it will take some time for these products to gain traction in the marketplace. Our Simplist initiative is a good example of our strategy of building on our expertise to move into adjacent spaces.","In our Biosciences segment, we are looking forward to the launch of our BD FACSPresto CD4 analyzer in addition to additional product offerings in our Sirigen dye portfolio. On Slide 17, you will see the various product launches in Diagnostics. We recently received FDA approval on our Staph SR and MRSA XT Assays on our BD MAX platform. We continue to focus on menu expansion and expect another four assays to be approved this fiscal year, including our Enteric Bacteria assay.","We placed over 40 instruments in the first quarter, bringing our total number of placements currently in excess of 300. We remain very pleased with our BD Veritor Point of Care device. We've placed over 10,000 units to date, driving competitive gains for us in this growing market. Our BD Totalys front-end automation launched in Europe recently and our early customer feedback has been very positive. We anticipate the US rollout of this instrument in 2015.","Also, our new BD Viper LT platform and BD Onclarity HPV assay are now CE marked and launched in Europe. Viper LT will provide fully integrated automated molecular test capability running both PCR and STA amplification menu. These include CT\/GC and high-risk HPV. Our BD Onclarity HPV assay is the first DNA-based HPV assay that reports broad genotyping results for each patient with no additional processes.","These products support our women's health and cancer business and are fully compatible with our shortpass liquid based cytology cancer screening test. We are particularly excited about our ability to provide broader HPV genotyping results as we see more clinical evidence that specific genotypes indicate a higher risk of developing cervical disease. Of course, we will continue to update you as we make progress on our pipeline initiatives.","On Slide 18, before we open the call to questions, I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our discussion today. First, we are pleased with our strong start to fiscal year 2014 with solid underlying growth. Growth across all of our segments contributed to this quarter's results with particular growth in Medical and continued improvement in Biosciences.","Second, our long-term strategy of investing in innovating for growth continues to deliver positive results. Key revenue opportunities will be driven by new products, tuck-in acquisitions, continued geographic expansion and sales of safety-engineered products. We are continuing to build on our leading global position and enhance our already robust core across all six worldwide businesses.","Third, we are focusing on developing complete solutions to meet our customers' needs and improve clinical outcomes. We expect to expand the categories in which we currently compete by continuing to move into near adjacencies. We are raising the bottom end of our previous guidance ranges for revenue and EPS and have continuing confidence that we have built a solid foundation for future growth.","Finally, we remain committed to delivering continued value to our customer and shareholders. Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","I wanted to see if you could go into a little bit more detail just on emerging markets overall as well as some of the tenders that you referenced in your prepared remarks, and I guess more specifically on emerging markets and not to sort of be negative on a 13% growth rate, but China is growing 25%, maybe you could just give some perspective on what's happening elsewhere, and obviously recently there've been a number of concerns as it relates to the macro environment in EM and healthcare spending? And then, I guess, lastly if you could just touch on the tenders you referenced in a little more detail.","Vince Forlenza","Yes, we did have strong growth in emerging markets. China was up 25%. The only place where we had actually some negative timing is just a matter of when tenders come in is the Middle East. So we did well in Latin America. We did well in Asia-Pacific, but it was really some softness in the timing of tenders in EMA for us, that was the difference.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","It's Robyn for Kristen, so I just wanted to touch on price. You guys obviously had a pretty good quarter, up 40 bps, and now you have taken your expectations up a little bit for the year. Can you just touch on what you're seeing more broadly in terms of pricing developed in the emerging markets?","Bill Kozy","We had good solid price contribution, particularly from our Medical segment in the quarter, and that driven in part by Diabetes Care price improvement, and favorable mix and price from the Pharm Systems side. And those two units were significant price contributors to the company's overall price impact.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Kimberly Gailun - JPMorgan","It's Kim in for Mike. Just a follow-up on the price question as it pertains to diabetes, so you saw some really nice strength in the US Diabetes business, it sounds like it is driven primarily by Nano. And just maybe talk about why we're seeing the pickup now, what kind of account conversion and partnership you're seeing on the Nano side? And maybe, if you can, tie it in a little bit of your longer-term strategy on the Diabetes side?","Vince Forlenza","First question was around how is Nano doing and where are we in the conversion of this, and then does this set the stage for a broader play in Diabetes Care, and we're still early on in the conversion to Nano. Yes, we're doing well in the U.S., but we're also doing well in other geographies with Nano. We do price Nano at a price premium. And so, you are seeing that in both the Medical segment's results, and Bill was referring to that, and in the company's results.","And as part of a broader strategy in Diabetes Care, we are continuing to refresh the core, but we're also working on some new product areas that we touched on before, and Bill maybe you want to comment on some of the adjacencies that we're looking at in terms of moving into it.","Bill Kozy","We're looking to explore other insulin delivery opportunities that we have in particular. We have referenced before a project we have on insulin infusion, and we're also actively looking at a longer-term program related to patch-pen types of insulin delivery. Those would be at the top of our project list for adjacency moves over the next two to four years.","Vince Forlenza","And of course, we have the CGM, which is still really in technology development. So a significantly broader play in the longer term in Diabetes Care.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair","Was the Quest impact fully reflected in the first quarter results or is there an incremental step-down coming? Can you also just comment broadly about some of the trends you're seeing in the US diagnostics markets as there continue just to be a little bit lower than, I guess, what we thought even in light of some of the secular stuff going on? Thanks.","Vince Forlenza","So in terms of that account loss, it was in the first quarter. It's slightly weighted more towards the second half of the year, but it's not a major step change would be the way to think about it. It was significant in the first quarter for the Diagnostics business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Swann.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann","Just a broader macro question. We\u2019ve heard from some other players that there could be some pull-through in strength, and seasonality in the calendar year fourth quarter or year-end deductibles, etc.. Could you comment on anything that you may or may not be seeing on this front and any commentary there on what this might portend for the quarter ahead and maybe the rest of the year?","Vince Forlenza","So, we did talk about 120 basis points of timing within the quarter, but that was not seasonal timing. I'm going to ask Tom Polen to just comment on some of the timing that occurred on the Medical segment or just a major piece of it for us.","Tom Polen","As Vince said, there were two businesses that we saw timing impact us in the quarter and in the segment were in Med Surg, specifically around clearing a backorder in the US as well as in the Pharm Systems, which tends to have some lumpiness associated with large customer purchases. So if you exclude that, as commented earlier, underlying growth was lower than reported, and those we view as one-time activities that were just in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor with Barclays.","Dan Sollof - Barclays","It's actually Dan in for Matt. And I had a question on the visibility you have in Biosciences. We've seen improvements there and you guys picked up your expectation for the year. But just into account conditions and the pressures that you've talked about in the US restructuring market, just wondering if you can address picking your expectation, is that really a function of both the US and OUS or just OUS?","Linda Tharby","As you know that we're continuing to see in the US market with the recently released NIH funding continued stability in that market. But ex-US, we also saw some turnaround in Western Europe, which was positive for us. And also, we continued to see strength in emerging markets. So US stabilization and growth in Western Europe would have been the biggest turnaround.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray","First off, obviously European safety has been a nice growth driver here following the adoption of the safety directive last spring. Are you still going to suggest that there's a pretty significant proportion of hospitals that are not yet compliant with the directive? And so, Vince, help us think a little bit about how you frame the ongoing opportunity and then just help us think about the duration of the tail-wind.","Vince Forlenza","Yes, we did see an uptick in European safety this quarter. And what was significant was we saw some uptick in Southern Europe for the first time. And so some of the first significant orders to matched geography. So there is a lot of runway here. There's still runway in Northern Europe as well. So we think the story has a few years to go in terms of ramping up. We would continue to think that this is not a step change kind of gain, that it's more of a hospital-by-hospital convert as these countries come online. So not US step-change situation, but kind of a steady movement in terms of conversion. Tom, is there anything else you'd like to add to that?","Tom Polen","The only other thing to mention is you know the US is quite mature in the 90s, just to put it in perspective. We see EU overall at about 60% converted for catheters, about 15% converted for injection systems and I think about 45% for blood collection systems. So I think that just reinforces, as Vince mentioned, there's still some room and several years of conversion to go there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America","Was there any change to tax rate guidance for 2014, just to remind us on that? And I guess do you expect any impact from the weather in the US in the second quarter?","Vince Forlenza","The tax rate guidance stays the same, 23.5% to 23.7%. So there is no change in that. The tax rate in the first quarter was as anticipated. In terms of the weather, very difficult to say whether we'll see any impact from the weather or not. And I guess there's probably not, but who knows what's going to happen in February and the rest of the quarter. But no so far.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Vince, with the Simplist morphine product shipping in the second or third quarter, could you quantify the addressable market size for that specific product? And do you think you have enough approvals under your belt at this point to broadly go to market and capture market share or do you feel like you still need a few more approvals to make a broader push there?","Vince Forlenza","We haven't broken it drug-by-drug, but it is one of the bigger ones now. And so it's a step-up for us in terms of addressable market. We said the market is about $1.2 billion in the US and we're targeting about 60% of that, so over $700 million. But Tom can comment on the kind of the competitive dynamics and the menu in terms of where we are and how we seize that? Tom?","Tom Polen","I think we think about it in two ways. One is just regarding morphine and its relevance, we have three drugs on the market today if you think about the value of a prefilled drug delivery system and its ability to help reduce errors in the delivery process. The drugs that we on the markets today, some of them are sizeable in terms of market size, but are not necessarily high on the ranking of drugs associated with medication. Morphine really represents the first drug which is in the top 10 list of drugs associated with serious medications. So we see that the value proposition for morphine is really a key catalyst for us in that category.","Are we still looking to broaden out our menu within the prefilled space? Absolutely. And I think as was mentioned earlier from Chris, we do have four additional drug approvals pending with the FDA and under varying stages of review. And so overall, as we discussed previously, this is a very new initiative and it is going to take some time for these products to gain traction in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Frelick with Canaccord.","Jeff Frelick - Canaccord","Vince, could you share some ways for acquiring the Alverix business? I assume you want to do more of the product menu. And do you have plans for the mini product that Alverix has?","Vince Forlenza","We bought Alverix. They were a supplier, I think, as most people know of the Veritor system. And we were going to be co-developing a next-generation system with them. It made sense from a financial standpoint to bring that in-house and get complete control of it. We are in the process of continuing to ramp up that menu. We're still waiting for RSE approval in terms of the CLIA waiver, but the product is now intended to have some placements. So it just made a lot of sense as we expand the menu and continue to move into the POC space that we brought that technology in-house.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with ISI Group.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","One, in China, the 25% was really strong. I think it came in well above what some of your peers are reporting. Can you tell us what's driving the strength and the sustainability of the strong double-digit? And the second one was in the MAX. Are you seeing any pickup in system placements or give any color on installed base?","Vince Forlenza","China, we continue to do well across the board with our entire portfolio. So it's balanced with Medical seeing the biggest part of that business and a very strong performance in our infusion business. So strong across the board, Medical being the largest. And I think we're seeing the benefits of our ability now to move into tier-2 to expand the distribution in China. And all of that is going quite well.","In terms of BD MAX, I think Bill Kozy will comment on that.","Bill Kozy","We placed just north of 40 new MAXes particularly in the US and Europe and that would put our total placements to date just a little bit beyond 300. Of course, when we get the menu for the Enteric and some of the other menu that Vince mentioned, that will continue to help us. But we're comfortable with our placements for the quarter and our outlook for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Just like some of the competitors in the US microbiology market have been pretty well over the past few quarters, can you just provide an update on competitive dynamics, end-market trends and core, I would say, US microbiology market? And then in light of MALDI-TOF and Kiestra, have they increased the catheter equipment mix in microbiology, had any effect on your visibility there?","Vince Forlenza","The fact that we're selling more catheter because of Kiestra and what not, we have a very good view on that pipeline and we're doing well in core microbiology in the US and globally. And, Bill, anything else you'd like to add to that?","Bill Kozy","No, just to echo Vince's comment, we didn't have any Kiestra placements yet in the US. So all of our growth in the US on that side was driven by very, very solid BACTEC and PHOENIX activity, as well as the Point of Care reference. So that total grouping of products that we tend to call Infection Prevention and Management and you got microbiology in there and Point of Care and Kiestra, if you just looked at the US, we got nice mid-single-digit growth in the quarter, which we were pleased with.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","Vince, on the emerging markets, if you strip down, about half of your growth is still coming from emerging markets. And I guess as a manager, given all the noise that we hear about, what are you looking at, what are the data points you're looking at to kind of track or what you're focusing on to see whether or not some of the growth slows down from these very high rates? Obviously there's a long runway there. Just curious given some of the challenges, what you're looking for?","Vince Forlenza","The teams in the emerging markets will tend to have scorecards and they're looking at what's happening with various GDP statistics, then they're looking at healthcare spending and how healthcare spending is moving year-on-year, whether it's catheter or whether it's starting to move from bricks and mortar supplying those hospitals. So there's a number of different measures that they're looking at. And then I don't think they're more tender-driven. They're looking at the follow-up tenders in terms of what's in the queue to be brought.","Bill Kozy","Well, I think I'd say that there's government health needs and their priority. Our focus on collaborating around the significant governmental agenda for their health programs for the coming years and almost all governments around the world have got that is a key point of engagement. If you link that to all the factors that Vince mentioned, we kind of get a constant rolling view of what we want to be doing in that particular targeted market.","Vince Forlenza","And then lastly, we'll be in contact with the NGOs in those regions in terms of what they're looking to do and the programs that they have, so that we can stay on top of those. So those are kind of broadly what we look at.","Operator","That was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for any additional or closing remarks.","Vince Forlenza","So thank you to all of you for participating in our call today. We said we were pleased with the strong start to the year.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through May 8, 2014 on the Investors page of the bd.com Web site or by phone at (800) 585-8367 for domestic calls and area code (404) 537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 24652897. (Operator Instructions)","Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, VP of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Kristy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our second fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules is posted on the bd.com website.","Leading the call this morning is Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Vince is not able to join you today. He is recovering nicely from orthopedic procedure, and will be back to work next week. Also joining us today are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Administration; Tom Polen, Group President; Linda Tharby, Group President and Alberto Mas, President of Diagnostic Systems.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Kozy","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As we stated in our press release, we are pleased with our performance in the second quarter. Our results this quarter highlight our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio. We delivered solid revenue and EPS growth where were in line with our expectations.","Revenue growth in the second quarter was driven by our Medical and Biosciences segments. Diagnostics' international growth was partially offset by continued challenges in the U.S., which we will provide some color on later in the call. We saw continued strong international safety and emerging market sales and they remain as the key growth drivers for the company.","Based on our solid results for the second quarter and the first half of the year, we are reaffirming our previously communicated currency-neutral revenue guidance and we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance for the full fiscal year 2014.","On Slide 5 we have outlined our second quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company revenues were solid, increasing by 5.1%. Fully diluted EPS came in at $1.45 growing at 10.1% over the prior year. On an adjusted basis EPS of $1.53 grew 15.8%.","Now I would like to turn things over to Chris to give you more detailed discussion of our second quarter financial performance.","Chris Reidy","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by discussing the key financial highlights for the second quarter. As Bill just mentioned, we delivered solid performance.","Revenue growth in the second quarter was in line with our expectations. We experienced strong growth in our Medical and Biosciences segments which were aided in part by timing of orders. As Bill just mentioned, there were some challenges in the Diagnostic segment, particularly in the U.S. I'll speak to that in just a moment.","In the second quarter, performance improvements in our gross profit margin were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. On a currency-neutral basis we improved gross profit by 60 basis points.","Our tax rate improved substantially due to geographic mix and some discreet one-time items. This benefited earnings by about $0.03. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.53 and grew 15.8% in the second quarter. Also during the second quarter we completed an additional 24 million of our approximate $450 million share repurchase plan for 2014. This brings our total share repurchases year-to-date to 213 million.","As Bill just mentioned we are reaffirming our currency-neutral revenue growth guidance and raising adjusted EPS guidance for the total year.","On Slide 8, I will review our revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. Organic revenue growth was 5.1% for the total company. The impact of price erosion was about flat in the quarter. And as a remainder the SSI acquisition is now included in our base.","BD Medical second quarter revenues increased 6.3%. Growth in this segment was driven by a range of new products, emerging market strength and some timing benefits. Growth in Diabetes Care was 10.4%. This reflects continued strong sales of pen needles, which includes our Nano and AutoShield Duo products.","Medical Surgical Systems growth was 4.4% led by emerging markets and international safety sales. Pharmaceutical System growth was 6.6%. As we expected and as we typically see in this business, this reflects a favorable impact from a timing of orders. Timing of orders in the quarter positively impacted growth by about 350 basis points within the Pharmaceutical Systems unit.","BD Diagnostic second quarter revenues increased 1%. Solid sales in the Preanalytical Systems unit and the BD MAX GeneOhm platform were partially offset by a decline in our Women's Health and Cancer business. This was due to extended cervical cancer screening intervals and U.S. share losses.","BD Biosciences revenue growth was 10.2% versus the prior year period due to solid clinical and research instrument placements and reagents along with strong emerging market growth. Growth in this segment also benefited from the timing of a government order in Latin America, a large tender order in Africa and more normalized stimulus spending in Japan. These items benefited growth by about 350 basis points. Growth in the second half of this year will decelerate due to these timing items.","Moving to Slide 9, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the second quarter. As we expected softer growth in the U.S. was supplemented by continued strong international growth. BD's reported U.S. revenues increased 0.2% versus the prior year. We view the environment in the U.S. as constrained, but stable.","Revenue on our U.S. Medical segment increased by 5.2%, which was largely driven by timing of orders in our Pharmaceutical Systems business and strong growth in Diabetes Care.","U.S. Growth and Diagnostic segment declined by 6.4%. This was due to the challenges I just mentioned a moment ago coupled with the mild flu season. Growth in the U.S. this quarter was largely impacted by challenges in this segment. We are seeing some stabilization in our U.S. Biosciences business which experienced growth of 1.4%.","Moving on to international, we continue to see strong growth. Revenues grew 8.5% currency-neutral with growth coming from all three segments. Medical segment grew 7.0% and Diagnostics grew 8.1%. This reflects strong growth in emerging markets and international safety sales.","Biosciences grew 14.3% and benefited from the timing items I just mentioned. Our Biosciences segment also experienced strong growth in emerging market.","On Slide 10, we continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, which accounted for approximately 24.5% of our total revenues. Emerging market revenues grew 13.9% currency-neutral over the prior year. This was driven by strong performance across all segments in those geographic regions. Slightly slower growth in China of 17% reflects a tough comparison to the prior year period. We continue to expect low double-digit growth in emerging markets, and growth in China is expected to be in the 20% range for the balance of this fiscal year.","Moving to global safety on Slide 11, currency-neutral sales increased 4.9% and grew to 531 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S. were about flat. Our international sales grew 11.2% currency-neutral with emerging markets growing about 20%.","Medical Safety sales grew 4.4% driven by a range of safety engineered products. Diagnostic safety growth was 5.5% in the quarter.","As I mentioned earlier, the benefits of our SSI acquisition have annualized and are now included in the base. This impacted our U.S. safety and medical safety growth rates in the quarter.","Moving on to gross profit on Slide 12, positive performance in the quarter reflects benefits from ReLoCo and other continuous improvement initiatives and pension savings. These items will more than offset by an unfavorable currency and higher raw material and startup costs. Our gross profit guidance remains on track for the year.","Slide 13 recaps the second quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency-neutral results on an adjusted basis. As we discussed, revenue and gross profit were in line with our expectations. SSG&A increased about 1.4% which reflects the benefit of the one-time item in Europe. R&D increased 3.8%. This remains in line with our expectations at 6.1% of revenue as we continue to invest in new product development and innovation.","Operating income grew 13.5% in the quarter reflecting our ongoing focus on earnings quality at the corporate and business unit level. Our tax rate declined by 170 basis points, which benefited from geographic mix and some discreet one-time items. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $1.53 which is a 15.8% increase versus the prior year.","On Slide 14, we will review our revised outlook for the total year. As we mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming guidance for currency-neutral revenue growth and raising guidance for adjusted earnings per share. On a reported basis, our guidance assumes a Euro exchange rate of $1.37. Reported revenue growth is being negatively impacted by other currencies. As such, we are lowering our reported revenue guidance by 50 basis points.","In our Medical and Biosciences segments, we have increased our revenue growth expectations. Our revised guidance in Medical of 5.5% to 6% reflects solid core growth and a benefit from new product launches. The Biosciences segment is now expected to grow 4% to 5% reflecting continued international growth.","We now expect the Diagnostic segment to grow about 3% to 3.5% due to some of the U.S. challenges we mentioned earlier in addition to a lighter flu season than anticipated.","Adjusted earnings per share of $6.22 to $6.25 reflect the benefit of an improved tax rate for the total year, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency. Our expected tax rate is 23% to 23.5% contemplates a more favorable geographic mix.","Moving on to Slide 15, I'd like to review the revenue guidance in further detail, one with the facing for the second half of the year as it is compared with a particularly strong back half of 2013. I'll speak to this slide in a currency-neutral basis.","As you can see we delivered strong growth in the first half of the year, where the total company revenues grew 5.9%. Strong growth in the Medical segment of 7.4% benefited from timing in our Medical Surgical Systems and Pharmaceutical Systems business, and the acquisition contribution from SSI. You will see that the growth rate is expected to return to about 4% to 4.5% in the back half of the year as to normalizing for those items. We are also contemplating less favorable pricing. For the total year, we expect the Medical segment to grow between 5.5% to 6%.","Diagnostic growth in the first half of the year was 2.6%, a benefit from share gains and point of care flu sales were offset by the U.S. challenges we mentioned earlier in Women's Health and Cancer. In the second half of the year we expect revenue growth to rebound a bit. Our revised guidance of 3.5% to 4.5% for the second half contemplates strong KIESTRA placement.","For the total year we expect the Diagnostic segment to grow 3% to 3.5%. Despite the challenges we are facing in the U.S. Diagnostic Systems business we are still seeing success in our international businesses and are making good progress with various new product launches. We are confident we can continue to deliver solid growth in this segment.","Our Biosciences segment grew 8% in the first half of the year. The strong growth was driven by the timing of orders I mentioned earlier. We expect growth in this segment to be between flat to 2% in the back half. It will be weighted more heavily in the third quarter. As you may recall the fourth quarter of last year was particularly strong as a result of the stimulus spending in Japan, which presents a difficult comparison. For the total year we expect the Biosciences segment to grow about 4% to 5%.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill, who will provide a more detailed update on our progress around our key initiatives.","Bill Kozy","Thank you, Chris. Moving on to slide 17, I'd like to review the program and product launches in our Medical and Biosciences segment. In the Medical segment we continued to rollout our new BD Simplist line of prefilled generic injectables. We currently have four drugs approved by the FDA, and have applied for four additional drug approvals.","As expected, we recently launched the morphine product. As we have been sharing with you, this is still a very new initiative, and it will take some time for these products to gain their traction in the marketplace. In our Biosciences segment, we recently launched our BD FACSPresto, CD4 and Hemoglobin Analyzer.","The BD FACSPresto expands the ability to stage and monitor HIV\/AIDS patients close to their homes. It is an easy-to-use system that meets the need of resource limited setting. The FACSPresto can be easily transported and operates off a rechargeable battery enabling patients even in remote settings to receive critical CD4 testing. Early customer feedback has been very positive. Also this year we have launched three dyes and plan to add several additional dyes to the surgeon portfolio.","Turning to Slide 18 you will see the various product launches and diagnostics. On our BD Veritor platform, we launched our Strep A Test in the U.S. this past quarter. We also received clear waivers on both our Strep A and RSV tests, making these tests more accessible to clinicians in the U.S. To-date we have made over 12,000 Veritor replacements.","On our BD MAX molecular platform, we look forward to the U.S. launch of our Enteric Bacterial Panel and CE marking of our Enteric Parasite Panel later this year. These tests which traditionally take three to five days to achieve results, it can be completed in minutes, which also reduces the need for unnecessary antibiotics in the meantime. We are excited about the unique assays in our pipeline which combine our deep microbiology know-how with our molecular capabilities.","Our BD Onclarity HPV Assay was launched recently in Europe. This assay runs our new Viper LT automated platform, which is capable of both SDA and real-time PCR molecular amplification formats.","During the second quarter there were numerous installations across Europe and Asia. We will add our CT\/GC assay for the Viper LT as soon as we receive CE marking which is expected in the next quarter. We are also expecting U.S. FDA 510(k) clearings of CT\/GC on the Viper LT in the third quarter. Of course we will continue to update you as we do make progress on these pipeline initiatives.","On Slide 19, before we open the call to questions, I would like to reiterate the key messages from the presentation today. First, we are pleased with our consistent solid performance in the second quarter and our results here today. Second, we continue to execute on our strategy and deliver top and bottom line growth and margin expansion. Third, we saw solid growth in our medical and biosciences segments and continue to be pleased with the progress we have made on the key growth drivers across our various businesses and regions.","Despite challenges we are facing the U.S. diagnostics systems business, we are confident we can continue to deliver solid growth in the diagnostic segment. Finally, we are positive about our outlook for fiscal year '14. We are committed to delivering current neutral revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% and 11% to 11.5% adjusted EPS growth. Our diverse product and geographic portfolio and the operational effectiveness programs we have in place provide BD with a strong foundation. We believe we are well positioned for continued success in fiscal year '14 and beyond.","Thank you. We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks. Good morning.","Chris Reidy","Good morning.","Bill Kozy","Good morning.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","I didn't catch if Alberto is there or not, but if so, could you elaborate on the U.S. Diagnostic Systems business in the second quarter slowed materially even though Quest has already been in the run rate? And then the guidance implies an acceleration in the back half, could you quantify the effect of the KIESTRA placements in that acceleration?","Bill Kozy","Sure. This is Bill. I'll take a first shot, and Alberto is here and I'll ask him to comment also. One thing I will do is let me just give you our view on Diagnostics, including the U.S. piece. Our international growth is up about 6% in the second quarter, and year-to-date it's at about 7%. We're continuing to see good solid growth in the core part of our microbiology business and particularly our BACTEC business and our IDAST business are solid at round 4% or 5%. Also in the second quarter we had a very strong degree of placements with the BACTEC FX. That's one of the best quarters we've had in quite some time. That's a big part of some of our second half projection here that we will talk about.","Additionally, the emerging markets continue to be pretty strong, both China and Latin America growing at strong double-digits contributing to an overall emerging market growth rate around 10%. Now, the equation of KIESTRA, we do have very strong demand, and as Chris indicated in his comments, we've got expectations for a strong placements in the second half of the year. I'll give that part to Alberto here in a second.","Additionally, our POC, our Point of Care category share gain, which was somewhat dampened by weak flu season still should promise, gives us some encouragement on the second half of the year as does the MAX GeneOhm growth that we experienced in the quarter. To get at the challenge part, its Women's Health and Cancer, and it's in the United States. You might recall last year we described to you a major account loss. That of course is still playing out in fiscal year '14.","Chris already mentioned the interval testing and the impact on cervical cancer, which is ongoing, particularly on our SurePath reagent business. And we've had some sales erosion on our ProbeTec platform, again concentrated in the U.S. We're hoping that we get Viper LT launched in the third quarter with CT\/GC, which I mentioned in my remarks. That's key to defending that business and slowing down some of that sales erosion.","Let me just slip in. Alberto, any color you would like to add particularly around the KIESTRA placements in the second half?","Alberto Mas","Yes. If I focus on why we think the second half is going to be stronger, it's some of the underlying positive trends that we are seeing in the business are highlighted in the second half. And again, the KIESTRA obviously are going to be beginning to be placed in the market more strongly in the second half and into next year. We actually feel very positive about the demand patterns that we are seeing going forward.","One of the things that is driving that is our expected launch of ReadA Compact, which was one of the components of the Lab Automation KIESTRA that we will expect in the next month and a half. We have it in four sites right now and with very positive feedback. We are expecting a global launch of that platform in the next couple of months. So that should be certainly an accelerated growth for the second half and in the future.","MAX, again we are expecting -- we had a good quarter. We expect even stronger quarters in quoting the next couple of quarters and going forward. So this is an accelerating product line for us. And we are pretty much where we expected to be in overall revenues. As Bill said, BACTEC placements should begin to generate reagent revenue in the second half and going forward. And again, lots of the Viper LT will enable us to begin to -- it's a good tool for us to begin to defend our CT\/GC business going forward as well.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could -- I know you mentioned a couple of times the different timing orders and the impact within the individual businesses. What's the impact in aggregate I guess for the quarter, the 5.1 currency-neutral, what would that have been in your estimate excluding some of these one-time factors or timing factors?","Chris Reidy","Great. This is Chris. The way to think about that is really on a first half\/second half, because there is some timing even between the first and the second quarter. So if you look at the first half that's 5.9% that we had year-to-date, about 40 basis points of that was the lift from the SSI acquisition. And then there was about 50 basis points of timing of orders, and so that's from systems the BDB orders that we talked about and some Med\/Surg timing of orders.","On top of that you have a little bit of favorable pricing in there, and you had the Japan stimulus which is accelerated this year year-over-year, as we said, it all came in the fourth quarter. So if you normalize all of that, we get in the 4.5% to 5% range for the first half of the year.","Then if you look at the second half, the 3.5 to 4 that we showed, the timing of orders brings you back to 4 to 4.5. The Japan stimulus and the unfavorable pricing flip get you in that 4.5 to 5 range. So that's the way to think about first half\/second half.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning.","Chris Reidy","Good morning.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Bill, just thinking about your commentary on China and specifically the Biosciences slowed down in the back half of the year; can you give us a sense of how you expect your accounting to trend in the back half of the year relative to Biosciences? Some of your peers have talked about delays at the Ministry of Health is specifically affecting capital. I am wondering what impact, if any, that could have on your flow business. Thank you.","Bill Kozy","Hi, David. Linda is obviously here with us and she is closest to that. Let me just pass that question over to her and ask for her comments. You are specifically interested in China, David, in second half impact on government influence.","Linda Tharby","Good morning, David. It's Linda here. So we continue to see in our Biosciences business very strong growth in China, and we are seeing that come not only from the clinical market and expansion in lab presence and flow cytometry there, but also really strong presence from Accuri, which is our personal flow. So we continue to see our growth in the very high double-digits in China in the back half. And at this point we are not projecting anything with respect to a slowdown in that market due to a good balanced portfolio between both our research and clinical settings.","Chris Reidy","I would like to take the opportunity to just emphasize as I mentioned in prepared remarks the 17% that we had in this quarter was driven more by the -- they are difficult compared to the second quarter of last year. So we see the rest of this year being in the 20% plus range.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","Matt McDonough - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. This is actually Matt McDonough in for David. Continuing with emerging markets, I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail just on some of the moving parts, the different dynamics; you're now talking extensively about the China slowdown being driven more by the comp than actual slowing, but could you perhaps talk about trends you are seeing in other markets?","Bill Kozy","Sure, I can -- let me make a couple of comments here. First of all, as we look at the scale of our emerging markets, China and Latin America are very, very critical drivers both in terms of scale and growth. Chris has already commented that we really see sustainability in China around that 20% number for the remainder of that year. We are seeing similar types of numbers coming out of Latin America. It's across -- I hate to generalize to your question, but it's pretty much strength across all of our businesses, medical, diagnostics and biosciences all reflecting very, very strong double-digit growth in each of those markets. That's supplemented a little bit at a lesser scale by Middle East and Africa. But think about China and Latin America as real drivers of our emerging market growth particularly at this window and time in fiscal year '14.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JP Morgan.","Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan","Thank you, good morning. So just a couple of questions, number one, just one income statement question, in the SG&A lines you called out some benefit from Europe. I hope you could just clarify what that was?","Bill Kozy","","I think we are not hearing you. Operator, can you help us repeat that question? We didn't catch it.","Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan","Is it a bad connection?","Chris Reidy","Yeah.","Bill Kozy","No, I think we got a bad connection. I am sorry, we just can't hear you. I apologize. We can't catch it.","Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan","No worries. I will try again.","Bill Kozy","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Newitter ofLeerink.","Richard Newitter - Leerink","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I notice that price -- I think you said it was flat this quarter, it was up about 40 bips last quarter, can you maybe just comment on what you are seeing there in the environment and expectations for the rest of the year?","Chris Reidy","Yes. So, this is Chris. I'll take a shot at that. The second quarter pricing was just about where we expect it to be. It was flat to slightly down a couple of basis points, right where we expected as we said pricing in the first quarter was a little bit better than we expected. So we had adjusted the pricing guidance for the year to about 20 basis points down. As we have been saying it's all about the second half of the year and particularly the fourth quarter. So we are still looking at it being down about 20 basis points for the year based on fourth quarter tenders that we are looking at and the pressures we see there, really no change since last quarter on that, kind of in line with where we were.","Richard Newitter - Leerink","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Douglas Schenkel of Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is it appears you terminated European diagnostic distribution agreement in the quarter. Was there any revenue impact in the quarter, and do you expect any hangover associated with that? And I guess the second question somewhat related is SG&A was quite a bit lower than we expected in the quarter and dropped quite a bit sequentially. It's unclear if your guidance implies that this going to continue. Could you just talk us through how we should think about SG&A over the balance of the year? Thank you.","Chris Reidy","Sure. The SG&A was 1.4%. As we mentioned, there was a one-time item in Europe that benefited us. It was collection of receivables that had been written off that we collected. That does flow through to the year. We increased the earnings per share by $0.03, but offsetting that was the impact of foreign exchange. As you saw that we adjusted our reported revenue guidance for foreign exchange that actually flows down through the EPS as well. So that was a couple of cents. So that foreign exchange pressure offset the benefit of the one-time item and then the [3%] (ph) rise that we had in EPS was essentially attributable to tax rate declines. So SG&A for the rest of the year absent that one-item will be still in the range basically that we had guided to.","Bill Kozy","This is Bill. We did discontinue a distribution arrangement in Spain related to a couple of our businesses primarily with a Preanalytical systems relationship that does not carry any revenue impact for us on a go-forward basis. It's just a realignment of how we are going to go to market in that particular country.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Mike Weinstein of JP Morgan.","Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan","Hi. (Indiscernible). So just a follow-up on that, the SG&A, the receivable benefit this quarter was about $0.03, is that what you said?","Chris Reidy","It was actually more like $0.02. It is just slightly more than $0.02 and it was exactly offset by the FX pressure which is slightly more than $0.02.","Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan","Perfect. Okay. And then just want to focus on the Biosciences business. It's hard to separate out the one-time positives in the first half in terms of versus the second half. Can you just talk a little bit more about the underlying business and maybe try and give us a better picture to how that second half would look actually the orders that pull them to the first half?","Linda Tharby","Hi, Mike.","Chris Reidy","Let me start by just saying, the best way to think about that is for the guidance for the full year. So there is lots of puts and takes quarter-to-quarter and as you remember the big impact in the fourth quarter. At the end of the third quarter last year, I think our Biosciences growth rate was 0.9%. I don't think we are close to 12% in the fourth quarter. So, lots of puts and takes. But when you boil it down or running about what we are for the year with our guidances for the year in Biosciences. And that's probably the way to think about the underlying business.","Bill Kozy","This is Bill. I think the big factor to remember in that fourth quarter was the movement in fiscal year '13 of the Japan stimulus spend into the fourth quarter of '13. So our fourth quarter of '14 is up against a very unusual comp, a very strong Japan stimulus driven comp from FY'13. That's really the single biggest factor on that second half Bioscience growth.","Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan","Okay. And then just to comment about less favorable pricing in the second half, what does that tie to?","Bill Kozy","I think I didn't catch that whole thing. I heard -- less favorable pricing in the second half of the year, Chris.","Chris Reidy","That's consistent with what we have been saying. I mean as we looked at vendors particularly in Europe, they come primarily in the fourth quarter. So I don't think you are going to see any much in the third quarter evidence either. We will be sitting here next quarter still kind of guessing what it's going to be for the year. But our best guess is kind of be down 20 basis points at this point.","Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeff Frelick of Canaccord.","Jeff Frelick \u2013 Canaccord","Hi, good morning, folks. I just wanted to follow up on the strong Veritor placements on where you are to-date. Can you share kind of the mix, U.S. versus OUS on the 12,000 placements? Thanks.","Bill Kozy","Sure. Let me just get back. This is Bill. I am going to give it to Alberto. He is here. Would you comment please?","Alberto Mas","The big majority is in the U.S. There is also a component in Japan and the rest is a lot less. So those are the biggest components driving it. In the U.S. the season was milder as you probably already know in Japan it was slightly stronger than usual, but it's mainly U.S-driven.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Matt Taylor of Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys, good morning. This is actually Elliot filling in for Matt. I just wanted to touch on diabetes for a second, another nice quarter there; can you touch on any of the underlying fundamentals in that market? And maybe any other areas within that segment that maybe of interest to you guys going forward, whether it would be sensors or pumps or any other sort of product lines within that segment? That's been growing nicely for you guys that maybe of interest?","Bill Kozy","This is Bill. We did have a solid quarter in diabetes. Interestingly enough we had double-digit growth both U.S. and international, both at right around 10% give or take a few basis points. The U.S. favorability is a continuing story. It's really around pen needle growth, and it's particularly been driven by our ongoing penetration with the Nano product. We had growth in the quarter in the U.S. on Nano that was well north of 50%.","So we are really driving our penetration rates with Nano. We are wide now. We are actually north of 25% on Nano penetration. So that continues to be very, very key to the Diabetes Care business.","International was also strong, and you had -- emerging market growth is the driving contributor there. Think about that being right around 17%, 18% for the quarter, similar comments to what I made before about emerging market, Latin America and Greater China being the real critical drivers there.","In terms of what's next for us in Diabetes, we have referenced the fact that we continue to do product development in the area of insulin infusion. And at this point in time that is the high priority kind of product development activity in the company in the Diabetes Care business.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Kumar of ISI Group.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of specific questions on the Diagnostic piece, and one was Women's Health. In the past given this market conversion on related to end forecasting. I think you said core to 60% number. Where do you think we are?","And second on BD MAX, your comments were up pretty positive. How many systems did you place in the queue, and what kind of acceleration can we expect going forward? Thanks.","Bill Kozy","Okay. This is bill. Your question, Vijay, really on the interval testing, we got it somewhere right now, somewhere -- we think that about 60% to 65% of the physicians have adapted. It's a hard number to grab on to, but the takeaway is that we still think there is some room to go before you can see that there has been a significant 90% or higher adoption of a new interval testing.","On BD MAX in terms of our placements to-date, we are right around 340 placements worldwide at this point in time. Alberto, double-check my numbers, is that \u2026 ","Alberto Mas","That's correct. It's 340 is around that number, but we are seeing encouragingly a lot of reagent throughput that is coming to our machine. So from a reagent perspective we are very really encouraged by what we are seeing and hopefully with the new launches of Enterix and other assays, we should see that increasing a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jon Groberg of Macquarie.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And Vince if you're listening, I hope you feel better soon. So, Bill, you guys obviously had another very strong quarter, 5% growth which is great. So I think you guys deserve some congratulations. Obviously if you break it down to one blemish is diagnostics and if I look at your second half guidance for the year, that's the one that you expect to improve in the second half. So I know you've been answering some questions on it, but maybe I can just -- if I think about the U.S. specifically, I think Women's Health at this point on your Diagnostic Systems is only like 10% to 13%, somewhere in there in terms of the revenue. So it seem like it's fairly small. Can you maybe talk about all the different pieces of the business within the U.S., and then whether or not you expect the U.S. business specifically to improve in the second half to drive that increase to 3.5 to 4.5 for the second half of the year? Thanks.","Bill Kozy","Sure. This is Bill. I'll take a shot here. There are four key factors on that second half guidance that we provided. 1) For sure, if we have got this KIESTRA demand and we are expecting positive impacts from placements of KIESTRA, and particularly in the fourth quarter, more in the fourth quarter than in the third. 2) I mentioned the ongoing revenue performance of international. We expect that to continue, and again sustainably in that 6% or 7% range. 3) We are counting on BD MAX; we just commented on placements. Alberto mentioned our reagent pull-through running a little bit ahead of our expectation. That's a factor. And then there is a minor one, it's less important, but we don't have any point of care drag in the second half, and we took a little bit of a parachute drag on point of care in the first half. That goes away in the second half. So I'd say those four things are our key factors in upscaling that second half guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Weinstein of William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair","Hi, thanks for taking the question. You guys have talked a lot about some of the discreet benefits in the first half of the year, but what about any discreet headwinds? Can you quantify anything on seasonality, the impacts from flu, maybe calendar impacts that your peers have been consistently highlighting as calendar first quarter headwinds that should abate in the remaining quarters of the year? Thanks.","Bill Kozy","This is Bill. We steered down a couple of other -- the things that we are paying attention to. We have to say that we didn't quantify any headwinds related to weather. It was nominal if we had anything. We did not quantify any headwinds related to U.S. utilization. I think Chris commented it's constrained but stable. And so we couldn't quantify anything there. I mean our commentary around -- our challenges, if you would, was all in that Diagnostic Systems area, and it was all concentrated in the U.S.","So we could not, if you would assign any of our shortfalls to any other external factors, and I think that our ongoing international presence in emerging growth is kind of a foundation which shields us a little bit. Some of my comments about the diversity of the regional and product portfolio; that really helps us to get through these sporadic regional or country-based activities that you can experience during the course of the year.","Chris Reidy","The thing I'd add is we did talk a little bit about the flu season being less severe. The good news for us is we actually took share with the Veritor product, and that helped make it essentially flat year-over-year, so much less severe, but upside on the market share. But having said that flat year-over-year is not what we're shooting for, so it's a little bit of a drag. But that would be the only one that I would add.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America","Hi, good morning.","Chris Reidy","Good morning.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America","So a little bit on the Bioscience, on the flow cytometry market, particularly on the high-end, I know we are starting to see some interest from researchers using some technologies like Mass Cytometry, sort of like with the deal that Fluidigm did with the DVS business. I'm just wondering how do you see the high-end Mass -- the high-end flow cytometry market, can you quantify how much of your business is bad versus some of the more clinical aspects, just a little bit more color on your businesses there.","Bill Kozy","This is Bill. I'm going to turn this over to Linda. I'm not sure she -- a few comments you have that kind of a detail here today or \u2026 ","Linda Tharby","Yeah. What I can comment on is we certainly see very nice growth in our high-end research market. We had several launches in that market in the last several years. And with respect to the Fluidigm acquisition of DVS, we feel very comfortable relative to our ability to compete in that area in terms of our ease-of-use that we have with our instrument versus CyTOF placements.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James.","Larry Keusch - Raymond James","Hi, good morning. Two questions; on Simplist and the morphine launch specifically, obviously I know that's an important one for you guys, and you'd made some brief comments, but I'm wondering if there is anything that you can sort of add to that just relative to how that seems to be playing out?","And then secondly, just on the capital allocation side, you're targeting $450 million of share repurchase for the year, but again if you can remind us how you're thinking about deployment of cash and also how much of your cash currently is sitting overseas?","Bill Kozy","This is Bill. I'm going to turn the Simplist question over to Tom, and then he'll pass it on to Chris for the second question, if that's okay, huh?","Tom Polen","Hi, Larry, good morning. This is Tom. So, on Simplist, just as a remainder, as Bill mentioned we've got four drugs now launched in the Simplist format. Morphine is as we have always said is actually our most significant launch to-date. It is the first drug that's both in the prefilled device, but it's also a high risk drug, the strongest value proposition of all the products today, and we view as a lead within our portfolio.","We are getting very positive customer response on that early on. And as we've said before, this is a very new initiative and we still do expect that it's going to take some time for us to start seeing that ramp come through in our numbers, but positive overall feedback on morphine.","Chris Reidy","Good, and to part two, really no change from what we've said in terms of capital deployment. We are still on track to do the 450 million of share buybacks. As you see the dividend has grown over time. We kind of like where the payout ratio is right now, so really no change from that standpoint.","And from the outside the U.S. cash, the way to think about that is as we look at it between the cash on hand, it's right now in the U.S. at the end of this quarter is probably about 400 million, out of the 2.6 global. So a lot of it is outside the U.S. But between the U.S. cash on hand, the cash flow and our legal entity and dividend structure we know issues over the planning horizon and having cash to support the dividend and the share repurchase.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to get your thoughts on M&A, if we should expect any additional activity here in the coming quarters?","Chris Reidy","Really no change from what we had said in the past. And we've done more M&A over the last three years. I guess we've done seven deals now in the last three years or so. We are always looking for tuck-in acquisition. As usual, M&A is lumpy. So you don't do it just to do it. You do it when you got the right prospect at the right price. So no real difference in our M&A strategy from where we've been over the last two years.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions. I'll now turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for closing remarks.","Bill Kozy","This is Bill sitting in for Vince. Thank you all for your attendance today and participation. We appreciate your engagement and questions. And we remain committed to finishing our fiscal year '14 for the discussion we had earlier. Thanks very much.","Chris Reidy","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through February 10, 2016 on the Investors page of the BD.com website or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 20775429. I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment.","Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique N. Dolecki - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining to us to review our first fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at BD.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations.","Factors that could cause such differences appear in our first fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the BD.com website.","As a reminder, until we annualize the acquisition of CareFusion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we will speak to our revenue results on a comparable currency-neutral basis, which includes BD and CareFusion in the current and prior year periods. We believe this provides additional visibility into the new BD. The comparable current period revenues are adjusted to exclude a small impact related to a purchase accounting adjustment to record CareFusion's deferred revenues at fair value as of the acquisition date.","In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedule in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical Segment; and Linda Tharby, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences Segment. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As we stated in our press release, we are pleased with our solid start to fiscal year 2016. Performance from both the Medical and Life Science segments contributed to revenue growth that was in line with our expectations. Strong underlying margin expansion was driven by the achievement of operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, coupled with the positive impact of synergies.","As we move through the first quarter, we continue to make progress with the strategic review of our portfolio. Many of you already know, we recently announced that Fresenius Kabi has acquired the BD Simplist portfolio. We believe Fresenius is a better owner of the BD Rx business, as it complements their existing products and capabilities in the injectable pharmaceutical industry.","In addition, we're excited that we're initiating a long-term collaboration for Fresenius to supply us with a portfolio of competitive IV solutions in the U.S. This transaction is intended to enable BD to be responsive to our customers' needs and is complementary to our end-to-end medication management solutions for our customers and their patients.","Since we provided guidance in November, there've been a number of new dynamics that will affect our results this year. As most of you already know, several weeks ago there was a bipartisan agreement to suspend the medical device tax. This critical relief is extremely important to BD, as well as the patients, providers and research communities we serve. While some of the specifics are still being analyzed, we plan to reinvest this tax back into the business, which further supports our innovation strategy.","In summary, we're confident in our outlook and are maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance. We're also maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance, despite significant currency headwinds and are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for the full fiscal year.","Moving on to slide five, I will review our first quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company revenues grew 1.8%, which is in line with our prior guidance of 1% to 2% growth that we had anticipated and communicated on our last earnings call. Adjusting for tough comparisons for the prior year, this reflects solid underlying growth in both segments. Adjusted EPS was $1.96, driven by the solid underlying performance of the segments. Earnings were ahead of our expectations, as the quarter also benefited from product mix that was incremental to already strong gross margin performance, and some timing of expenses and below-the-line items.","Now, I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, performance in both segments contributed to a solid start to fiscal 2016. Total first quarter revenues of approximately $3 billion grew 1.8% on a comparable basis, which is in line with our previously disclosed guidance. Our growth rate this quarter reflects a tough comparison to strong prior year results of 6.7% organic growth, which includes CareFusion's final quarter as a standalone company, growing at 10% organically.","As a reminder, our results last year were driven by robust performance in the legacy CareFusion businesses, the impact of timing of orders in Pharmaceutical Systems, a very strong flu season, timing of tenders and strong emerging market performance. As a result, these items negatively impacted our first quarter growth rate by over 240 basis points. On an underlying basis, we are pleased with the solid performance of our segments and the momentum in our businesses.","BD Medical first quarter revenues increased 1.9%, reflecting the aforementioned items. Medication and Procedural Solutions, or MPS, growth was 2.0%, which reflects strength in pharmacy solutions, infusion therapy and safety-engineered products. Very strong results in the prior year negatively impacted the MPS growth rate by approximately 250 basis points. Despite extremely strong results in the prior year in Medication Management Solutions, revenues grew 4.3%, driven by both strong infusion and dispensing capital installations.","Respiratory Solutions revenues declined 6.8%, reflecting the tough comparisons to prior year results due to the strong final quarter as part of legacy CareFusion. Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.9%, driven by solid growth in pen needles. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 2.6% reflects strong growth in SAIS, partially offset by the impact of timing of orders, which we expect to occur later this fiscal year.","BD Life Sciences first quarter revenues increased 1.7%, primarily driven by growth in Preanalytical Systems and Biosciences. Preanalytical Systems growth of 4.4% was driven by safety-engineered products in both the U.S. and Europe, and also reflects strong growth in emerging markets. BD Biosciences growth of 1.2% reflects clinical tendered delays in emerging markets and a difficult comparison to the prior year when sequestration ended. This was offset by strong sales that were driven by an increased demand of high-end instruments and growth in research reagents.","The Diagnostic Systems decline of 0.8% reflects a mild flu season, which impacted growth by approximately 400 basis points. Growth was also negatively impacted by a slowdown of capital spending in China. Solid microbiology growth as well as growth in molecular, led by BD MAX and international growth in women's health, partially offset the impact from the flu.","Moving to slide eight, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. growth of 1.5% reflects the aforementioned prior year comparisons and timing impacts, with BD Medical growing 1.9% and BD Life Sciences growing 0.3%. BD Medical's performance reflects strength in pharmacy solutions, infusion therapy pumps and related consumables and strength in Diabetes Care. This was partially offset by Respiratory Solutions.","BD Life Sciences growth reflects the impact of a light flu season this year, and a difficult comparison to the prior year due to a strong flu season and the ending of sequestration. Offsetting these impacts was strong performance in the Biosciences business, driven by research reagent sales, solid performance in our Preanalytical Systems unit, growth in microbiology, and growth from BD MAX.","Moving on to international, revenues grew 2.2%. This is below our normal growth rate, which reflects timing of tenders and capital installations. International revenues also reflect the moderation of growth in China in the quarter, and I'll provide more color on China in just a moment.","The Medical segment grew 1.9%. This reflects solid performance in Pharmaceutical Systems and Medication Management Solutions, partially offset by a tough comparison due to large tenders in Brazil and EMA in the prior year, as well as timing of capital installations in the dispensing business.","The Life Sciences segment grew 2.7%, which reflects strong growth in Diagnostic Systems driven by core microbiology, women's health, and an expanded BD MAX menu in Europe. We also saw strong growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit. This was partially offset by a decline in the Biosciences business due to tender delays in emerging markets.","On slide nine, emerging market revenues grew 2.4% currency-neutral, with developed markets growing 1.7%. The first quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects a very difficult comparison to the prior year period for both the BD and CareFusion legacy businesses and a moderation of growth in China. China growth for the first quarter was 4.5%, compared with growth of over 23% in the first quarter of last year. This difficult comparison was in line with our expectations.","Beyond the difficult comparison, we also experienced the continued slowdown of capital spending in diagnostic systems, which resulted in inventory adjustments. Inventory adjustments negatively impacted growth in the quarter by approximately 350 basis points. While there are pockets of pressure, millions of patients are entering the healthcare system and overall, emerging markets continue to be an important growth driver. For the total year, we expect China to grow in the low double-digit range and total emerging markets to grow 9% to 10%.","Moving to global safety on slide 10, currency-neutral sales increased 4.9% and grew to $737 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 3.8%, while international sales grew 6.5% currency-neutral, with continued strength in Europe as compliance with safety legislation continues. Safety revenues grew 10.9% in emerging markets. Medical safety sales grew 5.4% primarily driven by safety catheters and a range of products in Pharmaceutical Systems. Life Science safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4.1% in the quarter.","Slide 11 recaps the first quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 1.8% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Pricing was about flat in the quarter. Moving down the P&L, I will focus on the comparable basis figures, which includes CareFusion results in the prior year in order to give a better indication of our performance. Gross profit improved by 3.6%. I'll provide more color on gross profit on the next slide when we look at underlying performance and the impact of currency. SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.9%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture.","R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.3% as we continue to invest in new products and innovation. Operating income grew 12%, reflecting strong P&L leverage, which I'll also address in more detail on the next slide. Our tax rate increased slightly. However, it continues to improve versus our initial deal model expectations. As discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $1.96, which is a 45.8% increase versus the prior year. This reflects solid underlying performance from the segments, positive product mix that was incremental to our already strong gross margin performance, some timing of expenses, and below-the-line items.","Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the first quarter presented on a comparable basis. Strong gross profit margin performance of 130 basis points was primarily driven by continuous improvement initiatives and product mix, and to a lesser extent, favorable raw material prices. Building off the strong momentum in fiscal year 2015 of 100 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion, operating margins grew 220 basis points year-over-year, driven by gross margin expansion, combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies, continuous improvement, and the positive impact of cost synergies. Currency had a negative impact on both gross profit margin and operating margins.","Moving on to slide 14, since we provided guidance in November, there have been a number of new dynamics that we anticipate will affect our results. Some of these items include the sale of BD Rx, the suspension of the medical device tax, the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, lower oil prices, a milder flu season, and additional FX pressure. As a result of these new dynamics, in combination with our first quarter results, we are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance by 4 percentage points from $8.73 to $8.80 to a range of $9.01 to $9.08. The increased currency-neutral guidance is offset by incremental FX pressures of approximately $0.28 due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Therefore, we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance of $8.37 to $8.44. We're extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments.","Turning to slide 15, I'd like to walk you through additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. In summary, we continue to expect comparable revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 20% and 20.5%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 450 basis points.","The U.S. dollar has strengthened further against most currencies since we last provided guidance in November. Our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.09. We expect this unfavorable impact to be acute again in the second quarter with a revenue headwind of over 400 basis points on a comparable basis. We expect our currency-neutral revenue growth to be back in line with our guidance range of 4.5% to 5%.","In the second half of the year, we expect the currency impact on revenue to moderate. We continue to expect growth in BD Medical of 4.5% to 5%. In our Life Sciences segment, we are revising our guidance to 4% to 4.5% to reflect the mild flu season in combination with lower sales in China. Based on the current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be about flat for the year.","We continue to expect gross profit margin to be between 52% and 52.5%, as the benefit from operating efficiencies, the sale of BD Rx and lower resin prices are expected to be partially offset by increased currency pressure. SSG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 24% and 24.5%. This is slightly better than our previous forecast as a result of the suspension of the medical device tax, which was recorded within SSG&A. As we reinvest the medical device tax, we now expect R&D investment of about 6% to 6.5% of revenues. The reinvestment will help us to accelerate the strategies in both of our segments.","Operating margin is expected to be between 21% and 22% of revenues as a result of the items I just reviewed. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, we are raising our underlying operating margin guidance to 170 basis points to 190 basis points. Once again, we're very pleased with our performance in driving margin expansion. We are broadening our tax rate to be between 21% and 22%. Our full year guidance ranges for operating cash flow, capital expenditures, interest\/other, and share count remain unchanged from our November guidance.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Chris. Moving on to slide 17, we are presenting a new slide that includes updates on our new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives, and partnerships and collaborations. With this new format, we will provide business updates each quarter. The product update slides that you are accustomed to seeing will remain in the appendix of the presentation for reference.","Starting with new product innovation within our Life Sciences business, we're very pleased with the early access customer response to BD FACSSymphony, a novel cell analyzer enabling the simultaneous measurement of up to 50 different characteristics of a single cell. BD FACSSymphony offers high speed analysis that is 20 times faster than other non-flow platforms. When combined with our BD Horizon Brilliant or the Sirigen reagent portfolio, these capabilities will allow researchers improved identification and analysis of rare cell types and events.","In early December, we successfully launched our FACSCelesta instrument, a mid-level cell analyzer with a very positive market reception. The new FACSCelesta system offers simultaneous measurement of up to 14 different single cell characteristics. The FACSCelesta system is also designed to leverage our broad BD Horizon Brilliant reagent portfolio. In our Diagnostic Systems business, we continue to focus on menu expansion and anticipate launching new assays on the BD MAX platform in fiscal year 2016, including CT\/GC and vaginitis.","Within our strategic and business initiatives, as we discussed earlier, we have divested the BD Rx business and are excited to be adding IV solutions to our Medication Management portfolio. We continue to make progress with our portfolio strategic review process and we'll provide you with updates as we move forward. In January, we launched our new BD brand that captures the new BD and our rearticulated purpose, Advancing the World of Health, which is more relevant than ever in a dynamic and ever-changing industry.","And in the equally important area of partnerships and collaborations, we remain on track with our collaboration with Medtronic. The insulin infusion sets in our Diabetes Care business have an expected product launch in the middle of the fiscal year 2016, so this year. We believe this product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery by significantly reducing silent occlusions, simplify the user's experience, and increase a patient's overall satisfaction with insulin pumping.","We continue to see strong growth and opportunities in our ID\/AST business, where we have built a comprehensive solution offering, which includes the BD Bruker MALDI Biotyper. This is a result of the collaboration with Bruker Corporation. We've seen success over the past several years with the BD Bruker MBT instrument, due to its ability to provide rapid and accurate microbial identification and its adoption in new geographic markets. As you can see, we continue to have strong opportunities that drive growth and innovation, and we look forward to updating you as we make progress throughout the year.","Moving on to our business update on slide 18. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in first quarter and we made progress with our back office functions and with harmonizing our IT infrastructure. We remain on track to achieve our FY 2016 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2018.","Contributing to our operational efficiencies is the benefit of sustained lower oil prices on raw material costs, as we discussed earlier. The consistent solid performance of our business, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture, is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in fiscal year 2015, we expect another 170 basis points to 190 basis points of expansion this fiscal year.","Now, I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid start to fiscal year 2016. Both segments performed well and we delivered very strong earnings growth. Second, our margin profile has improved significantly. We're driving operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, in addition to delivering on our synergy commitments. This is manifesting in our financial results, with 200 basis points of operating margin expansion this quarter and increased guidance for the total year. Third, we continue to evaluate and optimize our portfolio and focus on the appropriate strategic initiatives. In doing so, we are positioning ourselves in higher growth areas which are aligned with our core capabilities. By taking these actions, we are delivering the most value to our customers.","Finally, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance. We are also maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance despite significant currency headwinds and are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. We believe we're well positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to our customers and shareholders, and I look to the future with enthusiasm.","Thank you.

Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","We'll have to come back to Kristen.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Are you on mute, Kristen?","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Apparently.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, are you there?","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, this is Mike. Can you hear me okay?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Now we can, but you sound a little gravelly.","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Sounds like you got a cold.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Exactly. Well, I'm trying to make up for the flu season. So let me ask you a couple of items. So number one, you guys in the last call had guided to 1% to 2% constant currency growth for this quarter with a tougher comp. The Street heard you, but didn't do a good job of reflecting that in the numbers, but you're maintaining your FX-neutral guidance for the year, which effectively implies that over the balance of the year, the next three quarters, you grow the top line 5.5% to 6% FX neutral. So, A, is that correct? And then B, can you just walk us through your confidence in the top line outlook for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Sure, thanks, Mike. Yeah. So we did have results that were right in line in first quarter with what we guided, the 1% to 2%, it came in at 1.8%, which does imply greater growth for the rest of the year. Just to remind everyone that there was very difficult comps, a strong flu season last year. We had CareFusion's last final quarter, and we talked in our prepared remarks about the 6.7% growth that we were jumping over, including the CareFusion 10% growth. And then we had a number of items like in pharmacy solutions where we have the typical timing compares.","All of that goes away; in fact it reverses in the second half. So if you remember, the CareFusion businesses actually grew minus 2% in the third quarter. So actually, we expect the second quarter to be back in basically the range that we normally have, the 4.5% to 5%, and you'll start picking up more in the back half of the year against that CareFusion compare. Don't forget we had the AVEA recall in respiratory. So that becomes an easier compare. Emerging markets actually start comparing to more normalized results. You saw China this year \u2013 the first quarter of last year was 23% growth we had to jump over. So all of that starts reversing, and so we are confident in our full year guidance.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Good morning, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. Vince or Chris, I wanted to talk about emerging markets for a second here. How congested did you see the updated EM guidance? And I guess, just drilling down here, is the pressure largely capital in select businesses? Are you seeing any type of weakness in Tier 1 hospitals in China? And where are inventory levels now for you in some of these broader emerging markets?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So taking China first, the weakness was really on the capital side. It was in Life Science, and it does not appear to be driven so much by the financial situation as it was driven more by this issue that we brought up last quarter, which is the auditing of large capital purchases. So we're seeing that in China and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year.","On the disposable side, we did fine. And these are products that sustain the healthcare system, and so we expect stability in China on that side. That's really the difference as we look around the emerging markets. That's the biggest difference. If I talk about Latin America, Latin America is basically \u2013 Brazil is where we said it was and then with stronger performance in the other countries.","So in terms of inventory, as you heard, we made inventory adjustments on the medical side last time and coming back to the diagnostic piece, we actually thought that it was more of a timing issue, this audit issue. We're now saying that's not going away. So we came back and we did make the inventory adjustment on the diagnostics side because of the change in the situation. Chris, anything else you would like to add?","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","No, that about nails it. Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I wanted just to follow up on the CareFusion integration. Clearly, the cost synergy side of the equation is progressing at a rate faster than you had initially provided. But can you give us a little bit more clarity on how some of the cross-selling initiatives may be materializing and when you think we could start to see that drive a revenue uptick, particularly in the context of \u2013 the 4.5% to 5% is pretty much where the business has been growing the past couple of years and what it takes to sort of accelerate that number?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, overall, I would stick with what we said. You're really going to see the revenue synergies starting in 2017. That doesn't mean that we haven't done some work already in terms of aligning our organizations. And Tom can comment on that.","Thomas Polen - President-Medical Segment & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure. Hi, David. This is Tom. So I think, as Vince said, we've always commented that it would take us some time to get products registered for particularly the ex-U.S. markets, to put through our channels. Those registrations are well underway. We have several dozen products actively under regulatory review that we've already submitted. We have taken a few products that were already approved and put those through our channels and markets like China and we're seeing some early positive signs, but we've always said it would take some time to ramp and that we would see that more in FY 2017. And we're right on track to that.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Rick Wise at Stifel.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Vince. Good morning, everybody.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Let me start off with the margin expansion. Maybe, Chris, if I looked at the slide correctly, your bridging commentary, you had 22% cost synergies last quarter. This quarter you updated it by adding 4%. So we're really talking about 26% cost synergies now with CareFusion. Am I understanding that correctly? And maybe just in general, how much more is there to go? I mean, has it accelerated?","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Well, you're on the right point, Rick. If you look at chart 14, it really lays that out. The one thing that I would say is that 4% additional is things like the sale of BD Rx. Oil prices continue to give us a lift, as the price per barrel went from $50 to $30, and so whether you call those synergies or \u2013 it's all good. What I would point to on that chart is that that $9.01 to $9.08 represents a 37% to 38% increase over where we would've been on a BDX legacy guidance basis.","And so how you characterize that, whether it's just accretion or synergies, that's somewhat semantics. We were growing over the expectation that we would have grown 9% to 10% anyway. So we've stayed pure on that. But the tax rate improvements, are those synergies? Yeah, they're synergies as well. It's just not what we had originally contemplated in the deal.","So we try to keep a very clear and transparent view of what is synergies and what's accretion and that 4%, as I said, I wouldn't call those synergies. We're not raising our synergy guidance as we did last quarter because these are just kind of other things that are benefiting our cost structure and bottom line that hadn't been contemplated in November.","So for what we control, we're really executing extremely well, very pleased with it. But obviously, the FX drag is worse in that regard. Since November, the euro has stabilized at $1.09. Of that 4% drag additional in FX, 1% comes from the euro remaining at that $1.09 and then another percent from other major currencies, like Canada for example, it's down 8% or 7% since November. Mexico is down 8%. China is down 3%. So that's another percent of that 4%. The other two is every other currency in the world is weak against the U.S. dollar, compared to where it was in November, and so that's another 2% so additional 4% drag.","So we don't really have a lot of control over that. We do everything we can to mitigate that. So what we control, we're really feeling good about, but we are going against significant FX headwinds. But we really feel good about the fact that we were able to still meet our commitment of $8.37 to $8.44, despite those significant FX headwinds.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Larry Keusch of Raymond James.","Larry S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, good morning. So just two things here. Number one, it sounded like from the prepared comments that the CareFusion large volume infusion pump business did quite well. I was wondering if you could provide a little color on that and some of the dynamics. I think you said capital sales were up and I'm asking in reference to some strong results from a competitor yesterday.","And then just on China, I think you also said low double-digit growth for the year. You are obviously starting much lower than that. So you've touched on this, but how do you really accelerate through the course of the year to get to that low double-digit China growth?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So Tom will start with the infusion.","Thomas Polen - President-Medical Segment & Executive Vice President","Sure. Hi, this is Tom. So we did have another solid quarter for the overall MMS business and certainly in our infusion business and particularly \u2013 and maybe I'll just comment on the U.S., which is by far the largest market. We did have high single digit growth in our infusion business in the U.S., which in a market that's growing low single digits, we certainly see that as reflecting continued strengthening of our position in our Alaris business. So we're very pleased with our results and the momentum that we continue in that business.","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Yeah, I think, Tom, we grew last year in MMS was, what, 40 something percent in the first quarter? So the 4% growth was on top of that, right?","Thomas Polen - President-Medical Segment & Executive Vice President","Exactly.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Chris, do you want to take China?","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Yeah, so for China, if you look at the first quarter growth, we talked about the difficult compare against the 23% and we talked about the inventory adjustments in Diagnostics. If you normalize for both of those, you'd be in double digits in China in the first quarter. As I said on the overall BD revenue growth to come, the comparison to prior year eases in the second half of the year significantly.","We have, for example, respiratory wasn't even shipping in China towards the second half of last year, so that makes it an easier compare as well. So that's where we get the low double digits. We are getting a little bit of a lift. We talked about most of the CareFusion synergies coming next year, but there's a little bit in connectors and things like that that help us \u2013 actually an easy compare against CareFusion's China performance last year, that gives us a little bit of a lift as well.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks and good morning, everybody. I guess first question is just on safety, and I guess specifically around Europe. I guess it's been a couple of quarters since you gave us an update here in terms of kind of how far through that opportunity we are penetrated and how much more does this have to go? Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I think Tom can talk to that. It's mostly on the medical side. As you may recall that it's fairly highly converted in the PAS business, and they're really moving to second generation products, but there's more opportunity on the medical side and Tom will talk about that.","Thomas Polen - President-Medical Segment & Executive Vice President","Hey, Bill. This is Tom. So safety does continue to perform well internationally overall and certainly in Europe, as compliance with the regulation continues to support our safety growth. Maybe just to break it into two categories, from a medical perspective as we think about infusion, I'd say we're probably in the fifth inning, let's say, there as that's typically the first area that people convert to.","And then in the injection business, which is generally a low \u2013 can proceed as a lower risk procedure, we're in even much earlier innings on that side of the business. So overall, we still have a ways to go, certainly several years to go when it comes to the European safety conversion.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Matt Taylor of Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to just get a sense of your views about flu, and you haven't updated us on your footprint there in a while. Could you speak to that? And interestingly, Abbott bought Alere this week. So does that change your view on point-of-care testing? Sorry for the multi-part question, but I had a few things to get in there.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's okay. I don't think Abbott's buying Alere changes our view on point-of-care testing, but Linda will be happy to update you on the flu and what's going on out there.","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President & President-Life Sciences Segment","Sure. So as we have seen on the flu, we had a tough jump over versus a strong flu season last year. And not seeing anything that would indicate we're going to get any sort of a flu season this year.","As for our position in point of care, on our Veritor platform, we feel very good about our position, both in terms of accuracy, turnaround time and throughput. This is being reflected in our share position, now over 19,000 instruments placed globally, and we're very excited about the new wireless connectivity we'll introduce this quarter.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Linda.","Operator","Your next question is from the Brian Weinstein of William Blair.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First one is on new products. Vince, you used to talk about percentage of revenue that new products were driving. Can you kind of update us where the new products are and what your thoughts are going forward for new products, especially in light of putting more money into R&D from the medical device tax reinvestment? Where are you putting that specifically? What types of projects should we be thinking about?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure, Brian. We moved from about 8% to up to the 14%, 15% range last year. And that included Nano kind of starting to come out of that calculation. We're trying to get our arms around how we're going to do this calculation going forward with the CareFusion product line coming in, and we're not quite there yet. But if I look at the portfolio and the number of new products, I would say we're in a strong position. And it's across both of the segments, and it's over the next three-year period. And so both portfolios on the Medical side and the Life Science side appear good.","As I mentioned on the call, we feel very excited about the launch of the infusion set, the FlowSmart set. We haven't talked much about it lately, but SAIS is making progress with their Microinfusor, and we have signed up a number of customers there. And so we're starting to see some nice momentum in SAIS. I'm not going to try to walk through all of the new products across MPS and MMS, but there is a nice portfolio, and Tom would tell you in addition that the backlog for Pyxis remains very robust and then, Tom, I think it continues to actually get a little larger, right?","Thomas Polen - President-Medical Segment & Executive Vice President","Correct. It continues. Obviously, Pyxis ES is a major contributor to that percentage of new products sales and certainly continues to keep that number up very high for the company.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it would increase the number. And then on Linda's side of the business, I went through those new flow products but also the BD MAX menu expanding. You're seeing the impact of that in Europe already and, Linda, we should be getting those other assays out soon in terms of Chlamydia and vaginitis. What's your expectation there?","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President & President-Life Sciences Segment","Yes. So both products are in process right now at FDA, so we would expect both of those products to be on the market in the U.S. in Q3 or Q4. We're very encouraged by the growth that we're seeing in Europe with the expanded menu.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And then, of course, Barricor, which we mentioned on our last call.","Now, coming back to the investment on the medical device tax, I think it's an opportunity for us to really accelerate the strategies that we've articulated to you, both in Medication Management and on the Life Science side. I would say, they're both the core business, as we continue to elaborate things like Kiestra and drive that into the marketplace, and drive the genomics stuff that we just started. I think we're in a situation where a lot of these things haven't launched yet, but they launch over the next couple of years. So thanks, Brian, for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Jon Groberg of UBS.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a million and congratulations. Can I just maybe \u2013 one kind of clarification and then a quick question. So I'll just put them to you here. But one on China, I guess maybe, Vince or Linda, can you maybe talk a little bit more on the Life Sciences weakness on the auditing of large capital purchases? It seems like about 12 months later than what most Life Science companies have been seeing. Most of them saw it a year ago and reported pretty good results in China this year. So I'm just curious why you think you're seeing those delays more significantly than others in the Life Sciences space.","And then I just wondered on the new products on Totalys, I think in your presentation you have that's still launching in the U.S. in 2016, and just curious what you're seeing with that in Europe and whether that's still on track for 2016. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So, Linda, do you want to take that?","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President & President-Life Sciences Segment","Yeah. So maybe on your first question on why the delay in China. If you'll recall, we mentioned last year that we signed an exclusive partnership with Bruker on the ID side in China specifically. So as we were putting those instruments into the market, really starting in our first quarter fiscal year 2015, we had expectations on those that, clearly, in the first quarter, we saw that the overall number of tenders being issued were not at the level that we were expecting. So that would explain the delay because of the Bruker exclusivity. We are seeing, though, very good progress, competitively, in that space with now a more expanded solution to offer.","And then, as you note, we are seeing great performance ex-U.S. now with the more expanded platform that includes our Totalys and FocalPoint System for a full liquid cytology solution. So we saw this quarter high double-digit growth ex-U.S. on those platforms, and the anticipated launch date for us in the U.S. is in FY 2016. I don't have the exact quarter sitting in front of me but...","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Later in the year, anyway.","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President & President-Life Sciences Segment","Yeah, Q3 would be a safe bet for us.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe going back on the guidance, I wanted to make sure sort of we have the math right. So it looks like the reported revenues came down by 300 basis points, but the implicit assumption on the recreation of EPS and I guess the op margins are going to come up at the high end of the guidance range. I wanted to make sure I got that right. And when you look at below the line, I think other income, you had some hedging gains. Why would those sort of gains reverse in the back half? Thank you.","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Okay. So I think I got you right. Yes, operating margins have been increased in the back half of the year. When we look at the Q1 compared to expectations, I think what we're seeing is, as you pointed out, favorable gross margin performance in the first quarter, favorable timing of expenses as well, and then below the line, there's a little bit in tax rate. So the 21.5% is a little bit better than expectations, and we see that flowing through to the total year. We were slightly better in interest income and slightly less in interest expense. You put all those things in, and that flows through to the full year. Of course, it's overwhelmed by the items that I talked about with the oil prices being down will benefit the second half of the year, as well as the sale of BD Rx. So you put all that together and we get to the $9.01 to $9.08 and the $8.37 to $8.44 all-in with FX.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners.","Rich S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask, actually, two quick ones. One, is the full med tech tax reversal benefit getting reinvested, so it's just a swap between SG&A? Are you allowing some flow-through?","And then the second question is what would you expect the kind of adjusted China growth rate to be if you kind of looked at it the way you had \u2013 you said low teens, I think, in the past two quarters, if you back out the inventory?","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Okay. So on medical device tax, just to put it in perspective, last year we had about \u2013 or in our budget, we had about $60 million for the full year. Don't forget, we only pick up three-quarters of that this year. So that's about $45 million. Right now, we have about a third of that being executed against. The other two-thirds, we're still getting the projects in place, and we do fully expect to spend that this year. There might be a little bit of timing issue. Obviously, in the month of January, we're getting the benefit, and we're only executing on the one-third. So we'll probably just naturally pick up a little bit in timing but not a lot. And that's already in the guidance. But we fully expect to reinvest and we want to reinvest, and we're going through that process now.","And then the second question was China. I think that I'd bring you back to \u2013 if you adjust for the difficult compare in the first quarter and you adjust for the inventory adjustments that we took in Life Sciences, it brings you back up to a double-digit number in China.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we said low double digits for the year.","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Yeah, the full year is low double digits. And we get the benefit of a little bit of easier compare.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Easier compares and a little bit of momentum out of some CareFusion products.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","So the U.S. Bioscience revenue growth moderated sequentially from I think around 15% year-over-year last quarter to around 6% year-over-year this quarter. Recognizing that comparison was a bit more difficult relative to the prior quarter, the moderation seems to be a bit more material than we would've expected, just given what we've seen from Life Science tools peers. Others have talked about academic\/government starting to pick up. It sounds like biopharma continues to be strong.","So with all that said, two questions. One, can you describe what you saw in the quarter in terms of demand from biopharma and academic\/government in the U.S.? And two, what's embedded into your guidance for contributions from new products and the potential benefit associated with a more robust NIH budget? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President & President-Life Sciences Segment","Okay, so that was a multi-part question. Let me see if I can get at this. So, first, let me just comment on the performance of the U.S. business. The U.S. Biosciences business continues to do very well. We did mention that in first quarter 2015, we had a tough jump over. We had high double-digit growth, primarily in our research instrument base. So we still managed to grow off that base, but it was a difficult compare.","So for this quarter, we did see very good growth in our biopharma side, particularly in our advanced bioprocessing business, a business we do not talk about a lot, but is doing very, very well for us. So that was a tremendous area of growth. And then, as we've been talking about for the past several quarters, led by the U.S., our total research solutions platform now, we feel very good about the prospects for that business. Of course, this past quarter launching both FACSSymphony and FACSCelesta, we think across the range of low-, mid- and high-end analyzers now, combined with our Sirigen platform, so really, now, starting to work out that full solution between our instrument base and our solutions base. We see the U.S. research market as being an area that has, if you look at our last quarter report \u2013 was very strong for us, and an area moving forward that is in our guidance.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","How do you feel about new products, Linda? I know you can't exactly quantify it but...","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President & President-Life Sciences Segment","Yeah, so new products overall, starting with Biosciences, the research solutions piece, feel very strong about the genomics side, of course, coming with our full launches on both the GenCell side and Cellular Research coming this quarter so excited about that. And then, of course, PAS with their new products and DS with the expansion of the MAX menu, we're really starting to see these kick in.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So we should start to see some traction in the back half of the year, basically. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","Christopher R. Reidy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Derik.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So could you talk a little bit about sort of looking at the overall portfolio? I mean you've trimmed Simplist and there's been some talk about respiratory earlier on in the process of maybe doing something with that. Has that business rebounded to the point now where you feel comfortable with it that it's \u2013 you feel it was part of the portfolio and it's not potentially a divestiture candidate?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So what I would tell you about respiratory is we're running it like \u2013 we own this business so we run it to optimize the business, like we do with all of our businesses. Having said that, we are proceeding with our strategic analysis of that business. I would tell you we are making some progress on that, but we're not to the finish line yet. There are a couple of other small pieces that we're continuing to work on also, in terms of that strategic review process and you'll hear more from us as we move forward.","Operator","Thank you. Today's final question is coming from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","They let you back in, Kristen.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Sorry to miss you there before. Technical glitch. I was just wondering if you could expand a little bit more upon the relationship with Fresenius over the solutions and also if there's any additional updates on the CME relationship with the pumps, and anything about bringing that in-house to BD and the timing of launch that that could go into emerging markets?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, Tom.","Thomas Polen - President-Medical Segment & Executive Vice President","Hey, Kristen. This is Tom. Let me start off with the Fresenius one then I'll address the CME. So we're very pleased, obviously, with the long-term collaboration that we've entered into with Fresenius for a broad line of IV solutions in the U.S. marketplace. We certainly see that this opportunity is aligned with our customers' feedback to have additional options available to them and how they buy IV solutions. And we expect to begin launching that line in the very back half of FY 2016. So I think that's probably the most to say about that there, but we see it very much in line in supporting and helping to advance our overall Medication Management strategy. And we've gotten very positive feedback from customers after that announcement.","Related to CME, we do sell CME products in certain markets today, primarily in Europe. No new news to update in terms of an acquisition or integration of CME into BD. As you know, we already own 40% of CME and we've talked about options of that going forward. No new news to share there. We continue to promote and grow their products though in the markets, particularly in Europe, that we have had since the beginning of the year.","Operator","Your final question is from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in. Just one more for Linda. Any chance you could give us an update on where BD MAX stands in terms of its global installed base and remind us of the number of tests available on the menu and to what extent is the LDT capability contributing to growth?","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President & President-Life Sciences Segment","Okay. So on the overall MAX platform, in terms of overall numbers of placements, I'm not going to go into the overall number for the quarter, but safe to say that our total overall global systems now are close to 1,000 placements overall on a global basis.","In terms of the menu, of course, the expansions that we saw on the menu in both enterics and CT\/GC, what we're seeing now in Europe is very strong double-digit growth and very positive feedback from our U.S. customer base, again starting to see very good growth and placements on our MAX System. And of course, when we get the CT\/GC and vaginitis, we're anticipating stronger growth there.","On the LDT side, in terms of what we see in terms of opportunity for us moving forward, are you speaking about the...","Vincent A.

So for us, we see that in Europe being a great advantage. European customers are really adapting that as a strong advantage. And in the U.S., again, it's seen as an area for us versus our competition that really differentiates MAX. So great opportunity for us. I would say that the big opportunity that we see is with the differentiated menu that we're already seeing on the enterics and we look forward to on the CT\/GC and vaginitis.","Vincent A.

It will be available for replay through November 13, 2018 on the Investors page of bd.com, or by phone using 800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 3197559. I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment.","Beginning today's call is Monique Dolecki, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin the conference.","Monique N. Dolecki - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our fourth fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","In the fourth quarter, the company recorded $58 million in non-cash charges to write down the carrying value of assets primarily within our Diabetes Care business. Following a limited launch of our insulin infusion sets in fiscal 2017, and a product redesign in early FY 2018, the product did not deliver the differentiation we were seeking. As a result, we made the decision to discontinue the sets and focus on accelerating other key innovations.","During the quarter, we also wrote off other investments related to a production facility in our Diabetes Care business. These items, along with the details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures, in the financial schedules, in our press release, or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","As a reminder, to provide additional revenue visibility into the new BD, inclusive of Bard, we will speak to our fiscal 2018 revenue results and fiscal 2019 revenue guidance on a comparable currency-neutral basis. The comparable basis includes BD and Bard in the current and prior-year periods and excludes the revenues associated with divestitures as detailed in the financial schedules in our press release. Our fiscal 2019 guidance also includes an estimate of the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as of October 1, 2018.","Before I turn the call over to Vince, we would like to comment on the leadership change that we just announced last month. We are very pleased to have promoted Tom Polen effective October 1 to Chief Operating Officer of BD. As President and COO, Tom's responsibility has been expanded to include global operations and supply chain in addition to his current oversight of BD's three global operating segments: Innovation and R&D.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also joining us are: Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, Executive Vice President and President of the Interventional segment; and Patrick Kaltenbach, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss the company's performance, I would like to comment briefly on the organizational change Monique just mentioned. Tom's promotion to COO reflects the leadership role he has played developing and implementing BD's strategy and vision over the past 18 months. Since Tom was named President in April 2017, BD has made great progress on the Bard integration, named three strong leaders to the segment President roles, and appointed a dedicated Chief Technology Officer. These key leadership appointments position the company well and increase Tom's capacity to focus on driving our strategy, advancing our culture, and accelerating BD's growth and impact. I look forward to continuing to partner closely with Tom, as we take BD to the next level and fulfill our potential as the partner of choice for the global healthcare industry.","Now, turning to slide 4, the combination of BD and Bard has significantly accelerated our strategy and has already delivered measurable results, which we will speak to throughout the presentation. Turning to slide 5, I'd like to highlight some of our key achievements in fiscal year 2018. As I look back on last year, I feel incredibly proud of what our organization was able to accomplish. As you already know, earlier this year, we brought C. R. Bard into the BD family. As we exit 2018 and enter fiscal year 2019, it's evident to me that we are truly better together.","As expected, we finished the year with a very strong performance and momentum across our businesses. We saw this in both our core legacy BD and Bard portfolios. For the full year, we grew revenues 5.8%, we also drove approximately 210 basis points of margin expansion, and delivered double digit EPS growth. And we achieved all of this while overcoming significant headwinds and making strategic business investments.","Our organization has demonstrated just how agile we can be, concurrently executing on both the CareFusion and Bard acquisitions while continuing to drive our strategy forward and simultaneously delivering strong performance. Fiscal 2018 marked the third year of the CareFusion deal, and as we previously announced, we achieved our targeted $350 million in annualized CareFusion cost synergies. At the same time, we are delivering on our Bard commitments. The integration and synergy capture are on track, and we are well on our way to reducing our leverage to below 3 times in three years.","Also, our new product innovation is continuing to fuel growth, from the new Alaris Pump and Pyxis ES in our Medical segment, to BD MAX, BD FACSLyric and continued expansion of our BD Horizon Brilliant dyes in Life Sciences, and Lutonix AV and Covera in the Interventional segment, just to name a few.","There are also a number of things in the pipeline that we are equally as excited about, and I'll touch on those later in the presentation. And as we have shared with you previously, we successfully completed the transformation of the U.S. Dispensing business model, delivering more value to our customers as evidenced by our share gains.","In fiscal 2018, we continued to strategically focus our portfolio, and we divested several assets, including our remaining interest in the Vyaire Medical joint venture, and select product lines related to the regulatory approval of the Bard transaction. We also announced the divestiture of our Advanced Bioprocessing Business, which closed late last month.","On the acquisition front, we were very excited to announce the acquisition of TVA Medical. This is a great example of our continued strategy to pursue tuck-in acquisitions to advance our category leadership and enter into additional high-growth segments. All-in, we feel really good about our business performance and strong execution.","Moving to slide 6, you will see our initial guidance for fiscal year 2019, which reflects continued momentum across our businesses and strong revenue growth of 5% to 6% in line with the Bard deal model. On the bottom line, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS between $12.05 and $12.15. We expect to drive strong underlying currency-neutral earnings in excess of our deal model of 16% to 17%, which will partially mitigate the macro headwinds that can continue from fiscal 2018. All-in, we expect to drive earnings growth of about 10%.","Our outlook is based on our current view of the environment. As is normally the case, there are a number of items that could bring us to the top or bottom end of our guidance range, including: a stronger or a weaker flu season than expected; the performance of new product launches; emerging market growth and pricing; as well as an improving or worsening situation around tariffs.","We are also pleased to share with you that we anticipate achieving approximately $250 million in Bard revenue synergies by fiscal 2022. I'll provide some more color on where we expect to achieve those synergies later in my remarks.","I will now turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year along with additional details about fiscal year 2019 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'm also extremely proud of what our organization achieved in 2018 and the strong momentum we carry into 2019. On slide 8, I will review our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results, as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year.","Fourth quarter revenues grew 8.4% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven by broad-based strength across all three segments. As we communicated to you last quarter, our confidence in achieving our increased full year fiscal 2018 revenue outlook was based on continued momentum in the fourth quarter with particular strength in our MMS and Pharmaceutical Systems units, and some re-acceleration in Surgery, all of which we achieved. I'll provide more color on revenue growth in the quarter in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and geography.","Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $2.93, growing 22.1% over the prior year, or 24.6% on a currency-neutral basis. For the total year, revenues grew 5.8% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. As a reminder, our full-year results include the impact in the first half of the year from the U.S. Dispensing change, as well as the impact from the hurricane in our first fiscal quarter, which lowered total company revenue growth approximately 60 basis points. Excluding these impacts, we drove full-year revenue growth of approximately 6.5%. This includes approximately 1% of growth related to acquisitions, flu revenues, and timing that benefited the fourth quarter.","We also significantly expanded our margins in fiscal 2018. As we previously disclosed, we achieved our targeted $350 million in cumulative annualized CareFusion cost synergies. In addition, we realized approximately $75 million in Bard cost synergies in fiscal 2018.","Full year adjusted EPS of $11.01 grew 16.1% or 12.3% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was driven by strong performance from both legacy BD and Bard businesses, which helped to offset notable headwinds in fiscal 2018. I'll provide more color on fiscal 2018 EPS growth later in my remarks.","We also continued to delever during the fourth quarter, paying down approximately $700 million of debt. For the full fiscal year, we paid down a total of $1.2 billion, slightly ahead of our initial expectations. As a result, our gross leverage ratio declined to 3.9 times as of September 30. We continue to be on target to achieve our commitment to deleverage to below 3 times over three years. Additionally, we are also very pleased to have continued our long-standing record of delivering an increasing dividend. Fiscal 2018 marked our 46th year of consecutive dividend increases.","Moving on to slide 9, I'll review our Medical segment revenue growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis. BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased 10.1%. For the full fiscal year, Medical revenues grew 5.6%, which includes an estimated 80 basis point headwind from the U.S. Dispensing change. Revenues in Medication Delivery Solutions, or MDS, grew 5.9% in the fourth quarter, driven by strength in vascular access and infusion disposables. For the full fiscal year, MDS revenues grew 5.6%.","Revenues in Medication Management Solutions, or MMS, grew 21.3% in the fourth quarter. Growth in MMS was driven by strong capital placements in both infusion and dispensing, as expected. Additionally, growth in the quarter was aided by placements that occurred earlier than originally anticipated. For the full fiscal year, MMS revenues grew 6.6% including a headwind of approximately 280 basis points from the U.S. Dispensing change. Fiscal 2018 was another year of strong performance in MMS, driven by new product launches and continued share gains in both dispensing and infusion.","Diabetes Care revenues grew 1.7% in the fourth quarter. Strength in pen needles in the U.S. was partially offset by a tough comparison to the prior year. For the full fiscal year, Diabetes Care revenues grew 2.9%.","Revenues in Pharmaceutical Systems grew 9.4% in the fourth quarter, as expected, driven by strong demand for core products and continued growth in SAIS. For the full fiscal year, Pharmaceutical Systems revenues grew 6.4%. As we move forward, we are well positioned to take advantage of market trends towards biologics and prefilled vaccines.","Now, turning to slide 10 and the BD Life Sciences segment, fourth quarter revenues increased 6.9%, with strong performance across the segment. For the full fiscal year, BD Life Sciences revenues grew 6.8%, including approximately 90 basis points of growth related to flu revenues. Revenue in Diagnostic Systems grew 8.2% in the quarter. Performance was driven by our instrumented microbiology platforms, including blood culture, TB, and IDAST, strong Kiestra installations and our BD MAX molecular platform. For the full fiscal year, Diagnostic Systems grew 9.6%, which includes approximately 270 basis points of growth related to flu.","Preanalytical Systems revenues grew 6.1% in the quarter, driven by push button collection sets, where recent capacity additions have eased constraints on supply. For the full fiscal year, PAS grew 4.1%. Biosciences revenues grew 6.4% in the quarter. Growth was driven by research reagents as well as growth in new instruments, such as the FACSymphony and FACSLyric. For the full fiscal year, Biosciences grew 6.8%.","Turning to slide 11, I'll review our Interventional segment revenues growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenues increased 6%. For the full fiscal year, revenues grew 5.2%, which includes an estimated 90 basis point headwind from the impact of the hurricane in Puerto Rico in our first fiscal quarter.","Revenues in Peripheral Intervention, or PI, grew 7.6% in the quarter. Performance reflects strong growth in oncology products, particularly in emerging markets and China, as well as continued strength in ESRD. For the full fiscal year, revenues in PI grew 9.3%, reflecting our cadence in new products and geographic expansion.","Fourth quarter growth of 3.3% in Surgery reflects an acceleration from last quarter's growth rate, as the business continues to regain share following the hurricane. For the full fiscal year, Surgery grew 1.3%, which includes an impact of 240 basis points from the hurricane, and 120 basis points from the hold on Progel. Excluding these items, we estimate Surgery would have grown approximately 5% for the full year. We relaunched Progel last month and are pleased with our early results.","Urology and Critical Care, or UCC, revenues grew 7.4% in the quarter, driven by new products and strong performance across the Acute Urology portfolio. For the full fiscal year, UCC revenues grew 5.3%.","Moving to slide 12, I'll walk you through the geographic revenues for the fourth quarter on a comparable currency-neutral basis. U.S. revenues grew 8.7% in the fourth quarter. This was above our normal growth rate, and primarily reflects very strong growth in the MMS and Pharmaceutical Systems units within the BD Medical segment, as previously discussed. For the full fiscal year, U.S. revenues grew a strong 5%, which includes an estimated 100 basis point headwind from the U.S. Dispensing change and the hurricane.","Moving on to International, revenues grew 7.9% in the fourth quarter. Growth was driven by strong performance in all three business segments, particularly in Asia Pac, Latin America and EMA. For the full fiscal year, International revenues grew 7%.","Developed Market revenues grew 7.7% in the fourth quarter. Growth in Developed Markets was driven by strong performance in the U.S. For the full fiscal year, revenues in Developed Markets grew 4.8%, which includes an estimated 70 basis point headwind from the U.S. Dispensing change and the hurricane.","Fourth quarter Emerging Markets revenues grew 11.8% currency-neutral, bringing our full year growth to 11.6%. Growth in China was a strong 13.6% in the fourth quarter, bringing the total year growth rate to 13.2%. This was driven by double-digit growth across all three segments.","Turning to slide 13, which recaps the fourth quarter income statement, as discussed, revenues were strong, growing 8.4% in the quarter on a comparable basis. Moving down the P&L, gross profit improved during the quarter, increasing 47.6% year-over-year, and gross profit margin was a strong 56.5%.","SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 25%, which reflects Bard's higher SSG&A spend profile, partially offset by the achievement of synergies. In addition, strong revenue growth resulted in additional selling commission expenses in the fourth quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.2%, which reflects our continued commitment to invest in innovation.","Operating margins increased 350 basis points or 380 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. We continue to deliver significant operating margin expansion, which reflects strong P&L leverage as the new BD. Our tax rate was 15.3% in the quarter, bringing our full year tax rate to 16.7%, which is just below our guidance range. As expected, we paid preferred dividends of $38 million in the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, the preferred shares are not included in the shares outstanding calculation.","In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.93, which is a 22.1% increase versus the prior year, or 24.6% on a currency-neutral basis. Very strong revenues were partially offset by the headwind by currency, increased raw material costs, and increased selling commission expenses.","Turning to slide 14 and our gross profit and operating margins for the fourth quarter, gross profit margin was a strong 56.5% in the fourth quarter. On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved 360 basis points. This reflects the inclusion of Bard's more robust gross margin profile, as well as our continuous improvement initiatives and cost synergies. These items were partially offset by headwinds from raw materials. Currency had a negative impact of 30 basis points on gross profit margin.","Operating margin grew 350 basis points in the quarter, or 380 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Margin expansion was driven primarily by gross margin improvement, combined with synergy capture. For the full fiscal year, we delivered significant margin expansion of 210 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. We're very pleased to have delivered approximately 700 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion over the past four fiscal years, which highlights our strong execution and also demonstrates that our strategy is sound.","Moving to slide 15, I'd like to walk you through our fiscal 2018 EPS growth. All-in, we delivered EPS growth of 16.1%, 12.3% on a currency-neutral basis. This reflects EPS growth which was in line with the deal model. EPS also benefited from stronger revenue performance, was partially offset by a number of macroeconomic headwinds and business investments. Currency had a positive impact on fiscal year 2018.","Now, moving on to slide 17 and our full year fiscal 2019 revenue guidance, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth of 5% to 6% on a comparable basis. This is in line with the expectations we have been communicating since the deal announcement. From a phasing perspective, we expect fiscal year 2019 to align with fiscal year 2018 with revenue and EPS growth weighted towards the back half of the year. In addition, the headwind from FX will be most pronounced in the first quarter.","By segment, we expect BD Medical revenues to grow between 5% and 6%, we expect BD Life Sciences revenues to grow between 4% and 5% which includes a headwind of approximately 90 basis points related to the flu, and we expect the BD Interventional revenues to grow between 6% and 7%. Similar to fiscal 2018, we expect revenue growth to be driven by recent product launches across all three segments and strength in both Developed and Emerging Markets.","We anticipate Developed Market growth of around 4% to 5% in fiscal 2019. In Emerging Markets, we expect growth of about 10%, driven by a diversified base with low-double digit growth in China and strength in EMA and Latin America.","Now moving on to slide 18 and our full fiscal 2019 EPS guidance, as there are a number of moving parts that impact earnings per share in fiscal 2019, I would like to provide more color on our EPS guidance. Starting on the left-side of the chart with our fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS of $11.01, we expect strong underlying growth of approximately 16% to 17% on a currency-neutral basis. This is in excess of our deal model and is driven by revenue growth and robust operating performance.","Moving to the right on the slide, we expect a lower effective tax rate to contribute approximately 3% to EPS growth, bringing our total underlying EPS growth to approximately 20%. We expect an effective tax rate of 14% to 16% in fiscal 2019.","Continuing to the right on the slide, you will see, we are facing a number of headwinds in fiscal 2019. On the macro front, raw material pressures increased throughout 2018 and accelerated into fiscal 2019, primarily due to additional resin price increases driven by a supply-constrained market. In addition, the round of tariffs that was enacted in late September will result in an incremental headwind to the round one impact we previously discussed with you. We are actively working with our partners to minimize the unfavorable impact to the company going forward.","Our guidance also assumes a normal flu season in contrast to the severe flu in fiscal 2018, which results in a headwind in fiscal 2019. We also have a headwind related to the sale of Advanced Bioprocessing that closed last month and the annualization of the divestitures to Merit Medical.","On a currency-neutral basis, our strong underlying performance is expected to drive adjusted EPS growth of 13% to 14% despite these headwinds and divestitures. While currency was a benefit for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, it became a headwind in the fourth quarter. And based on current rates will be a sizable headwind of about 3.5% in fiscal 2019. This assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.16.","All-in, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $12.05 to $12.15, which represents reported growth of approximately 10%. From a phasing perspective, we expect to achieve approximately $100 million in cost synergies in fiscal year 2019. We are committed to fully realizing $300 million in annualized cost synergies over the three-year deal period.","Now turning to slide 19, I'd like to walk you through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2019. On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 8.5% and 9.5%. This reflects a currency headwind of approximately 200 basis points. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 56.5% to 57.5%. This is an increase of up to 100 basis points from fiscal 2018, and is due to strong underlying performance, partially offset by higher resin costs and the impact of tariffs.","Adjusted SSG&A is expected to be 24.5% to 25.5% of sales. This is about flat when compared to fiscal 2018, and is primarily due to cost synergy achievements, partially offset by Bard's higher SSG&A profile. We expect our R&D investments to be in line with fiscal year 2018 at about 6% of revenues, and reflects our continued commitment to invest in new products and platforms.","As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 25.5% and 26.5% of revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, operating margins are expected to grow 100 basis points to 150 basis points. This represents strong underlying margin expansion, partially offset by the impact of the fiscal 2019 headwinds we just discussed on the previously slide. As we also just discussed, we expect our tax rate to be 14% to 16%.","For fiscal 2019, we anticipate our adjusted average fully diluted share count to be approximately 275 million shares. For modeling purposes, I would like to remind you that net income reflects the deduction of approximately $152 million of preferred dividends. The preferred shares are excluded from the adjusted diluted shares outstanding. Cash flow is expected to be strong, with operating cash flow of about $4.2 billion in fiscal year 2019. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $900 million.","In summary, I'm excited about the strong momentum we have across our businesses, and I'm confident that we'll deliver our commitments in fiscal year 2019 and beyond.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our Bard revenue synergies and product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Chris. Moving on to slide 21 and Bard revenue synergies, as we have been discussing with you since the deal announcement, we expect measurable revenue synergies from Bard starting in fiscal 2019. Our investment toward achieving these revenue synergies began in fiscal 2018, and we are pleased to announce that over the five-year deal period, we expect to drive total revenue synergies of approximately $250 million. As we expected, this is significantly larger than our CareFusion revenue synergy target of $150 million to $175 million, given the hundreds of products already in the registration process.","There continue to be three key areas where we expect to achieve synergies: First, as a combined company, we have the broadest and deepest portfolio of vascular access devices in the world. The combination of BD and Bard enables us to become a partner of choice for our customers' vascular access management needs. As part of our initial investment in revenue synergies, this summer we cross-trained the sales force in MDS, where we brought together the BD and Bard vascular access portfolios. Our team is focused on helping our customers optimize their catheter selection and drive adoption of best practices around the world. This will reduce catheter complications and improve patient satisfaction, safety and outcomes, while enhancing procedure efficiency and reducing cost.","Second, with our new combined surgical portfolio, we have been able to further leverage our combined footprint to better serve patients and providers across our hernia, biosurgery and infection prevention portfolios. In addition, we have made revenue synergy investments to expand our direct sales presence in Europe for our biosurgery and ChloraPrep platforms, where we have now trained and activated new surgical sales hires. With a broad surgical portfolio and a dedicated sales team, we now have the opportunity to expand our surgical sales channel in international markets.","And third is geographic expansion. Bard did a great job investing outside the U.S., particularly in China. However, they had a limited presence in Latin America, EMA and the rest of Asia. We see opportunities where Bard started registering products, but had just begun investing in the channel where BD has substantial scale in those markets today.","Turning to slide 22 and our planned product launches by segment, as you can see on this slide, we have a rich pipeline of planned product launches in fiscal year 2019 across our segments. There are a number of things we're excited about. I'll touch on just a few of those here. Starting with the Medical segment, in fiscal year 2018, we continued to gain share in both our infusion and dispensing medication management platforms, and we also launched our new BD HealthSight platform for connected medication management. In fiscal year 2019, we look forward to continuing our cadence of innovation and developing our platform to deliver even more value to customers. We expect to release a new version of Pyxis ES, which delivers new enhancements and applications. We're excited about the innovation pipeline in our infusion platform which includes higher patient safety features and functionality as we build upon our leading interoperability position.","Additionally, in 2019, we are looking forward to adding to the HealthSight platform with the launch of BD HealthSight Data Manager which simplifies the management of multiple BD device formularies. As we mentioned earlier in the call, a strategic decision was made to discontinue our insulin infusion sets with FlowSmart technology in our Diabetes Care business. Following our assessment of strategic options, a decision was made to discontinue the infusion set product and focus on supporting other key inventions, such as our Type 2 Patch Pump. Regarding the Type 2 Patch Pump, we're on track to submit our regulatory approvals for the U.S. and the EU in the coming months, and we anticipate our initial limited launch will occur in late calendar 2019. We continue to be excited about bringing this differentiated solution to the market for people living with Type 2 diabetes.","In the Life Sciences segment, we recently launched our BD MAX multidrug resistant TB panel in Europe. Each year, close to 2 million people die from TB, making it the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. MDR-TB remains a critical hurdle in the fight to eradicate TB. We continue to focus on improving the diagnosis of TB so that we can provide clinicians with the best tools for identifying effective treatments for their patients. This new test is a big step forward for clinical practice, as antimicrobial resistance has made this identification more complex. With the BD MAX MDR-TB panel and the BD BACTEC MGIT products, BD is able to offer laboratories a suite of tools for effective and accurate patient diagnosis and management. We remain committed to continuing to expand our BD MAX menu of assays, including the launch of the Enteric Viral Panel in the U.S. in fiscal 2019.","In addition, Kiestra has been growing very well in the U.S. and we continue to drive the platform towards being a total solution for management of the clinical microbiology lab. The launch of BD Kiestra IdentifA planned for the second half of 2019, will extend the capabilities of the BD Kiestra system to include the automation of sample preparation and sample identification.","In the Interventional segment, we are excited to announce clinical trial data for our Lutonix 014 Drug Coated Balloon with a below-the-knee indication, will be presented as a late-breaking presentation tomorrow at the 2018 Vascular Intervention Access Advances (sic) [Vascular InterVentional Advances] Conference in Las Vegas. We also recently submitted the PMA for BTK.","We're also pleased to announce that WavelinQ, our new solution that provides a minimally invasive non-surgical option for creating critical AV fistulas for hemodialysis procedures, received reimbursement late last week. We were given a c-code and assigned (37:55) to clinical APC 5193. Reimbursement was in line with our expectations, and will support our plans to drive adoption of this new technology. As we discussed with you last quarter, we have already begun training our sales reps and clinical teams in preparation for a Q1 fiscal 2019 launch in the U.S.","We're also looking forward to launching our Venovo venous stent and OptiFix AT articulating mesh fixation products later this year. The launch of these products will also enhance growth in the Interventional segment. As you can see, we have a very rich pipeline of new products across our businesses, and we look forward to sharing additional updates with you along the way.","Before I move on, I would like to remind you that we have again included a slide in the appendix of today's presentation that provides an update on our sustainability initiatives. We hope you find the information useful in understanding BD's commitment to this important topic.","Moving on to slide 23, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. I'm extremely proud of what our organization accomplished in fiscal year 2018 as the new BD + Bard. First, we finished the year with very strong performance and momentum across our businesses.","Second, we overcame significant headwinds and continued to drive strong operating performance while concurrently executing on both the CareFusion and Bard acquisitions.","Third, our Bard integration and synergy capture are on track. We are well on our way to reducing our leverage to below 3 times in three years, and we are confident in our ability to achieve approximately $250 million in Bard revenue synergies as we exit fiscal 2022. Fourth, our new product innovation is continuing to fuel growth, and there are a number of things in the pipeline that we are excited about as we look ahead to fiscal 2019 and beyond.","Lastly, looking forward, I have increasing confidence in our outlook as we successfully execute on our strategy as the new BD. We will continue to deliver even more comprehensive solutions for our customers and value to our shareholders around the world.","Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just two quick ones for me. I'll start with Chris or Vince. So, guys, the headwinds are consistent with our model, but clearly the magnitude of each is a little greater. So I think from our emails this morning, the questions that I think investors want to get answered is does fiscal 2019 earnings reflect any change in the underlying fundamentals of the business with a rate of progression of the Bard deal model? Or is this just a perfect storm of macro headwinds? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, David. And this is Chris. Thanks for the question. I think you look at the momentum that we had in fiscal year 2018, we were driving 6.5% revenue growth and 16% earnings per share growth, and that momentum actually accelerated in the fourth quarter with 8.4% revenue growth, 25% increase in EPS, and 350 basis points of gross margin improvement.","So clearly the fundamentals of the business are very strong, and we carry that forward into 2019. If you refer to the waterfall chart that we went through, you can see that we're driving 16% to 17% underlying into 2019. And then on top of that, we're adding another 3% from tax synergies that we had talked about potentially developing, and we now see our way clear to get those from tax synergies and some geographical mix. So the combination of those two are driving underlying improvements of around 20%.","Now, when you issued your note a couple of weeks ago, you had rightfully called out some significant headwinds of around 800 basis points. It turns out that it's closer to 1,000 basis points, so the magnitude, as you mentioned, is stronger. And the new news there is all around macro items, and I'd start with resins. In the fourth quarter, we saw a double-digit growth in the price of resins. And we had talked about resin prices going up last year, and the impact was about $35 million in 2018 or about 1% of EPS. That doubles to over $60 million of impact based on that double-digit growth in the fourth quarter of the price increases, primarily driven by supply constraints. Typically, it's impacted by oil prices, but it's mostly supply constraints at this point.","In addition, after your conference, I think it was a day after your conference, the second round of tariffs hit. And the impact of that, we had said it was about $15 million in round one. In total now, we're looking at about $45 million of impact from round one and round two. We can offset about $10 million of that in-year through working with our suppliers and other things, so the impact we expect to be about 1% or about $35 million.","Between those two items, resins and tariffs, we have just about $100 million of pressure. Then on top of that, we have FX going the wrong way, and basically reversing what you saw in the benefit that we got from FX this year. And so we expect it to be about 350 basis points of pressure. I would note that most of those pressures are one-time in nature. We wouldn't expect resins to continue at that same pace in terms of headwinds.","Tariffs, we're going to be working with our suppliers to resource the base. Now, that takes a while. We wouldn't expect to see much more impact in 2018, but that would help mitigate the impact in 2019 and, perhaps, whatever we can mitigate actually becomes a tailwind for us. Flu is the flu, divestitures go away, and FX could flip next year, just like this year flipped from last year, so more one-time in nature.","So, all-in all-in, we're offsetting about half of these significant pressures, and I would point out that we're still going up on an FXN basis from 12% in 2018 to 13% to 14% in 2019. So that's still an increase, despite the headwinds we laid out. So the fundamentals are really strong, to your point, and we feel extremely good about the underlying business and the momentum. And if anything, the deal model, we're exceeding the deal model.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","The only thing I would add, David, is, from a geographic perspective, we had strong performance across all regions. And as you know, looking back a couple of years, that wasn't always the case. But this year, we've seen it across all geographies and all businesses. So we feel really good about it.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","David, you said you had a two-part question, so we'll go back to you.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Oh, sorry. That was very, very detailed. So, I'll make this one quick. Vince, people expected 7% this quarter. You did closer to 8%. So momentum in the business, we saw several hundred basis points of acceleration. So the question is, look, it would not have been prudent to guide anything different than 5% to 6%, and that's what investors expected. Can you just talk about how good you're feeling about the 5% to 6% number for 2019? And I'll jump back in queue. Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, I'm feeling very good about the 5% to 6% number. And yes, we had a very strong fourth quarter. You saw real strong performance out of Pharm Systems. And if you look back across the year, Pharm Systems, it's not just a one-quarter issue for them (46:57). We've seen some fundamental changes in that marketplace on the vaccine side and more of a longer-term shift to prefills. That's something we've been working out for years. It's going well.","I think while in MMS, you saw tremendous performance, and, yes, some, as Chris mentioned, was customers requiring installation a little earlier than we expected, but fundamentally, we're gaining share in both the pump side and on the Pyxis side. And I talked about some of the new products that are going there. So I think we're going to see good, strong, continued performance across the entire BD portfolio. I walked you through all of the new products. I won't repeat all of that.","And then from a geography standpoint, as I was saying, we feel good about the geographies. Feel good about what's going on in Asia. I mentioned a slight moderation in China, and that's just the continued cost controls. But we expect to have good performance across all of our business segments in China, so feel good about that. Where we've seen some improvement in 2018, certainly with India, much, much better performance than historically, but strong across the board. What we're going to have to jump over, quite frankly, is the flu. And we'll just have to take what happens in flu up and down. So I feel good about the 5% to 6% guidance range that we gave you.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Just a follow-up on David's question there, obviously, a very strong year-end with the 8.4% growth, but maybe, Tom, can you talk about the sustainability of the trends that you're seeing, and specifically the drivers. Vince, you mentioned a little bit in Medical, but specifically maybe the Interventional and Life Sciences side as we head into 2019?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, I'll let Tom do that. I kind of overviewed that in the remarks, but Tom, maybe you can get into a little more detail.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Hey, Brian, this is Tom. So, I think, as you heard from Vince, what we were most pleased about is, is that there was strong growth across all three segments, and it was both in the core across all three segments as well as what you saw where new products starting to fire in each of the three segments. And so as we think about Medical, again, we've got core strong underlying businesses with Pyxis ES as a new product really gaining traction and share this year. We saw the new Alaris Pump M2 (49:44) really be widely positively received in the marketplace. We expect about 2 points of share gain in FY 2018 on the pump side, and that continuing into 2019.","And then the momentum in Pharm Systems, as you heard Vince mention, driven by both the trend in vial to prefill, but also around biologic and self-injection and some of the portfolio investments we've made over the last couple of years really positioning us well as a strategic partner of choice with top pharma. There is a trend that we expect to continue the growth going forward, and we're adding capacity very actively actually in that space to make sure that we're in a position to continue to capitalize on that.","Same thing in Life Sciences, right? So, we look at core businesses are strong. DS, we see \u2013 BD MAX continuing to grow north of 20% for the year. Kiestra really taking off now in the U.S. It's been strong internationally over the past few years. I'd say, we're seeing a really nice trajectory uptake in the U.S. and that trend is just starting. And, of course, Veritor had a great year. And one thing I'd point out is that while we expect we're modeled a lighter flu season, we did pick up share in the Veritor space and for flu, and so we've got a larger footprint of instruments. Regardless of what flu season happens, we'll be able to capitalize on it further given the penetration that happened in 2018.","And then in PAS, we've got new capacity coming online. For Push Button, which is a bit of the driver of the uplift you saw there, that's only going to benefit us as we go into 2019. And Bioscience, a lot of growth driven by new high-end instruments and reagents. And then finally, just on Interventional, you had every business there grew north of 6%, obviously led by the Peripheral Intervention business, but \u2013 I'm sorry, the segment grew at 6% with two of the three businesses growing north of 6%. Obviously, WavelinQ, we're positive about and are very positive on the reimbursement, which will be a momentum as we go into 2019.","Clearly the BTK data will come out tomorrow, I think just overall reflecting the depth of the portfolio there. And Progel is another thing that we really saw limited impact of in 2018. But as we've gone even just this month \u2013 last month in October and as we go into November, customers are ordering Progel. We're seeing sales start to ramp up. And we're seeing good momentum very much in line with our expectations. So, overall across the businesses, we're feeling well about both the core business as well as the value of the portfolio starting to really take off.","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","One piece of information I might add, we get asked this question a lot, and we probably won't do this going forward anymore. But going back to legacy Bard, legacy BD, legacy Bard we see grew in 2018 by about 7% and legacy BD grew over 6%.","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay, thanks, Brian.","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So, just a question on a couple of key pipeline items, maybe on the Medical side. Vince, you mentioned a little bit about status on the T2 Patch Pump. Can you give us a little bit more detail as to the initial strategy for rollout at the end of 2019? And then secondly, for Patrick on the Life Sciences business, BD MAX has been doing pretty well for a while now. Can you give us a sense of where we are in the life cycle for that product? I think competition in molecular is getting a little bit thicker, so I'd be interested in where you go from here.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Alberto will take the first one and then Patrick will do the second.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Well, on the Type 2 Patch Pump, we are \u2013 continue to be very excited about the potential of the product. We are making good progress on the program. We are learning through our clinical trials and the interactions with our customers. And we expect to be preparing for a submission in the next few months both in U.S. and Europe. Our production lines are getting up to speed, and we are working our evidence generation programs as well. So the program is progressing well, and we're expecting \u2013 depending obviously on the FDA approval process and timing we expect towards the end of the calendar year to be able to launch in the U.S., so good news to report there.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And Patrick?","Patrick Kaltenbach - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Hi, Isaac. This is Patrick. Well, let me first report a little bit on BD MAX, and as you've heard, we've really had very strong growth in the year, we grew about 35% worldwide with BD MAX, and a lot of that is driven, of course, by the new panels we rolled out. We will continue to roll out new panels next year like the Enteric Viral Panel here in the U.S., so that will give us continued momentum. So I'm very, very positive on BD MAX as a molecular solution moving forward.","That said, on the slide for new products we had BD COR for next year, which is a higher throughput molecular platform as we go through an early access launch towards the end of next year, and moving forward, I think that will accelerate our growth in molecular as well. So, overall, very positive on the growth opportunities in this space.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And just a follow up with Chris on the CapEx, I think in the past you guys had talked about doing about $3 billion over the 2016 to 2019 period. If I look at the guide for next year, it looks like you're going to come in a little bit above that number, if not much, but I'm curious kind of in the capital budgeting, what's going on there? Are there items that maybe roll off if we look over the next few years that could release a little more free cash flow growth? Thank you.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, Isaac. It really is more about capacity which comes from the stronger revenue growth in reality. So that's what's driving the CapEx up.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Chris, just to follow up on the capital allocation question there, you've hit your payback targets. You're now less than 4 times as of September.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Right.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In a year where there are a number of headwinds, how do you balance maybe using some of the money allocated for debt paydown to help cover some of the macro headwinds? And in that, are there any other rooms, levers or ways that you can offset some of those macro headwinds that maybe isn't built into guidance here?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, I don't see it being a cash-driven issue in terms of offsetting the headwinds. I think we're investing significant cash in the business in a number of ways, as we just talked about, CapEx for capacity purposes. And so, we feel good about that, and we're generating a lot of cash, as you see.","So we think we can do both. We think we can invest in the business to continue to grow the business, as you would expect, and to still make our commitments on the debt paydown. And so we've got about 1 point left or 1 times left, and I would expect that to be ratable over the next two years. So another 0.5 point this year and another 0.5 point next year, and we'll be down below 3 times. So we think we can do both of those items.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And maybe to stay in that vein, I don't want to jump the gun, but you've now had a fairly successful CareFusion integration. Bard looks to be going ahead of plan. How do you think about now with the very broad hospital platform that you have, how do you think about continued M&A? And are there any areas that stand out to you that you think need the most adding to, or could be bulked up here?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, thanks for the question. And we're really focused on integrating what we have right now. We're just finishing up. As we said, pretty much just finished CareFusion. We're focused on the Bard integration. And we know from a strategic standpoint that we have an excellent portfolio. We're going to continue to do small plug-ins. It's the nature of the business. You saw it with TVA. So you should expect that our focus is going to be debt paydown and continuing to enhance the portfolio in ways that really build up what we'll call category management.","We think we've positioned ourselves to be one of the strategic partners of choice within the industry. That doesn't require us to get much, much bigger and broader. It's about playing out what we have and becoming the partner of choice as we drive \u2013 as we're driving these synergies, you should think about this as also driving the customer experience. We're going after simplification, making BD easier to do business with, that's the phase we're in right now.","In the long run, we know we'll have the capability if we ever desired to make another larger move, but it's great to have strategic flexibility. But as Tom and Chris and I are always discussing, that's not what you want to base your strategy on. It's great to have capability. We're going to drive our innovation system, do our plug-in acquisitions. That's what we're focused on \u2013 and process simplification \u2013 getting our synergies. And thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the link of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thank you, and good morning. Just two quick questions. First, just to clarify on resin costs, can you just talk a little bit more about the supply constraints and when do those ease, and when they ease, do the cost come down? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So the issue is the supply constraint on propylene which is actually a byproduct of ethylene, and ethylene production has significantly reduced. So it's a byproduct of that. And we saw that happening just from a supply standpoint. We are seeing a little bit of capacity coming in from outside the U.S. You may recall, there was a supplier that went bankrupt in the propylene area. We had some hurricane issues over the last year or so. So the combination of all those factors are what's driving the capacity constraints.","There is some positives of capacity coming in from international sources, but at the same time you have oil price impacts as well. So we think that the impact that we're seeing in the fourth quarter of that double-digit increase will kind of hold for this year. But we don't see that continuing to go up in the future. We think it will be fairly stable over the course of the year.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then the follow up, I just wanted to ask a question on MMS because that's obviously very exceptional growth in that business this particular quarter. So maybe if you could just kind of quantify where you are in terms of pump market share, how much share you think you're gaining. And then I'd just be curious as to \u2013 if you could explain a little bit more about your comment that you're seeing placements earlier than expected. What are the dynamics around that? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Alberto will take that.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Well, obviously, great performance in the quarter. We saw 20%-plus growth rate in both sides of the business, both dispensing and infusion. A lot of these dynamics \u2013 well, in terms of the actual timing, it's timing of infusion pump placements and installations. But also on the Pyxis side, on the dispensing side, the variability especially after trades comes more \u2013 (01:02:00) there's a component of our business that continues to be capital purchases, cash purchases, if you like. This is affected by timing. And in terms of the timing, it's a combination of customer expectations and when they're ready and readiness, as well as our own preparedness, availability of service and installation, and resources at the same time. So that combination drives some of the timing.","What I would emphasize is more of the underlying growth rate of the business overall, which we \u2013 we expect the momentum to continue. The market share is \u2013 we estimate around 2 percentage point share gain on the infusion side, and 1% on the dispensing. A lot of that \u2013 and then Tom mentioned some of the investments in the core, or our anchor products like the M2 (01:02:53), like Pyxis ES and so on. But what really is driving a lot of these conversions and momentum in the business is our integrated and connected strategy through our interoperability capabilities. We now have over 350 sites that are now live there as well as our HealthSight platform, analytics that really enables that integration and capability that is unique from our perspective.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Very helpful. Thank you.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Oh, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Larry.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","One on the fiscal 2019 revenue guidance and one on Lutonix, and I'll start with the revenue guidance. So you exited the year growing 8.4%, and as someone mentioned earlier, it's prudent I think to guide to 5% to 6%. But my question is, Chris, you talked about it being more back-end loaded. So just trying to understand why that would be the case. Q1 is the easiest comp I think in the year. That's my first question, and then I had a follow-up.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, so there's two things. The flu grow over (64:12) is in the first half of the year, and then as we talked about MMS, that 23% growth in MMS in the fourth quarter with these earlier placements that \u2013 some of that's going to come out of the first quarter, and that's on the revenue side. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, FX will hit us on the bottom line in the first quarter. So that's the reason for the comments on phasing.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. And then on Lutonix, assuming a positive outcome tomorrow, I think Bard estimated that the BTK opportunity was about $250 million. So my question is, assuming a positive outcome tomorrow, do you agree with that? And is reimbursement in place and sufficient to kind of drive that opportunity? Thanks for taking the questions.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Simon?","Simon Campion - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. So nothing has materially changed from the Bard projections with respect to the market opportunity for BTK, and it's going to \u2013 the expectation is it will be continued to be reimbursed as any traditional DCB.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, very much in line with what we expected. Okay, thanks for the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart - Barclays Investment Bank","Hi. I have two questions. The first one, I know you touched a little bit on this, but I was wondering if you could just go in a little bit more in terms of the opportunity relative to the Patch Pump. I know you discontinued the sets. How did you frame that opportunity relative to the Patch Pump? And then I have a second question for Chris.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Tom?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hey, Kristen. This is Tom.","Kristen Stewart - Barclays Investment Bank","Hey, Tom.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, first off, just to speak to FlowSmart a little bit more, certainly the type 1 insulin pump market, it's continued to evolve over the last few years. And as was mentioned earlier on the call, the latest product redesign for FlowSmart didn't deliver the level of differentiation that we were seeking. And so, look, we could have continued to invest in FlowSmart. If you would ask us that, yes, we could have continued to invest in that. But given the economics of that as more of an OEM product and the number of more attractive investment opportunities we now have in our R&D pipeline, as part of our portfolio process we made a decision to stop that product and redirect the investments into more attractive opportunities both within DC and outside of DC.","And certainly within DC, the number one product there that we're investing behind and put some further funding behind is Swatch (66:37). And as you heard from Alberto, we continue to be \u2013 very positive outlook on that product. It's gone through and continues to go through clinical trials. We continue to get additional patient and physician feedback on it which is all at or above our expectations. And so, we're doubling-down on the final stage of bringing this to market this year.","Kristen Stewart - Barclays Investment Bank","Perfect. And then not to jump too, too far ahead, but it looks like the Gore royalty has been running a lot higher than where it was trending with Bard. And I was just wondering if you could kind of just give us your perspective on ability to grow through that. I know that's not really a big impact for fiscal 2019, just given the timing of when the royalty ends, but how should we just think about longer term? Clearly, this year, you had mentioned it sounds like you're running a little bit ahead of the deal model. Does that give you increased confidence to offset some of those headwinds, or just how should we think about kind of Gore? I know that's a little bit out, but...","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, yeah, Kristen, this is Chris. And you're right that the Gore royalty is running a little bit hotter. But fundamentally, it's no change from what we talked about when we announced the deal, that the biggest impacts in reducing that is the paydown of the debt and the corresponding decrease in interest expense, coupled with now we talk about revenue synergies, and they start in 2019 and ramp-up a little bit more in 2020. So, that helps. The cost synergies again mitigate that, and then the conversion of the preferred dividend helps a little bit as well. So, fundamentally, it's the same offsets, and so that's what we would expect to see.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks for the questions, Kristen.","Kristen Stewart - Barclays Investment Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Vijay.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking the questions. Morning, Chris. Just maybe back on that margin question, so if you look at the deal model, Chris, that we had, 200 basis points of annual margin expansion right through 2020. I'm just looking at the guidance here. What would cause this to get to low end of the operating margin guidance for the year? Because I can understand some of the headwinds getting to the high end of the margin guidance, maybe even at the midpoint, but the low end, I'm having a tough time. So, can you just walk us through versus the deal model...?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So, you're talking about 2019?","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Yes.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. So, on an underlying basis, the operating margin expansion would be over 200 basis points, which is right in line with what we expected. You get about a 80 basis point, somewhere in there, 50 to 100 basis point drag from the raw materials, resins, tariffs and the divestitures. So, all-in all-in, we've got about 100 to 150 basis points of margin expansion, which is right in line with what we had originally announced.","And just as a reminder, I mean, we say this. We're really proud of the fact that we've driven 700 basis points through to-date from FY 2015. And then with 100 to 150 next year and more than likely the same kind of amount in 2020, over a five-year period, we'll have driven about 1,000 basis points of margin expansion. So, we really feel good about margin expansion, including next year.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Got you. And then one on tax rate, so it's down year-on-year. Is this now sustainable, Chris, or were there any one-off assumptions for the tax guide for 2019?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, so it's not one-off. It's really driven by the normal geographical mix and the synergies of bringing BD and Bard together and the tax structures we talked about. And we said that would take the better part of a year to sort through, and the 14% to 16% is a reflection of that.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thank you, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Vince, my first one, just on the $250 million Bard revenue synergies by 2022, I might have missed it, but can you just talk through how to think about the cadence there over that time period, and if you can talk to the different buckets, which ones materialize at which times?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. So, I'll start and then Tom can add a little bit more color to it. But first thing to think about is the vascular access portfolio. We've put the sales forces together in the U.S. We've got that as one business in MDS. And that we're able to go in and starting right now sell an optimized portfolio of products, including the PICCs. And so we think that when you look at 2019, we're talking about tens of basis points for fiscal year 2019 and then things ramping up from there.","The other thing that's contributing to that in the short run is, we've hired the sales force in Europe, and on the Surgery side, and that's around biosurgery and ChloraPrep. And so we've brought them on. We're activating those sells reps. So those are two good things that are going on. And the third piece is the geographic expansion piece. China, they already have the organization in place. We're continuing doing that. But in places like Latin America and Asia, they come on stream and then they accelerate the growth once you get past 2019.","Tom, you want to add anything else to that?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","That was a great summary. The only maybe two things to mention from the other third pillar, so Vince talked about vascular access, the channel expansion in Europe, as you know, Bard had really invested heavily in China, and we're also continuing to invest now in areas where they hadn't got to invest yet, like Latin America, EMA, and the rest of Asia.","From a timing and phasing over the five-year window that we've talked about, we think about obviously very limited synergies this last year; 2019, it does step up. And then 2020, it kind of doubles off of where we were in 2019 and then it stays relatively at that level, maybe modest increases of those additional gains for the next two years after that. So, certainly, 2019 is a step-up, but then 2020 continues to step up more ratably.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you very much. And then if I could just ask, I think I heard a comment earlier on in the call that China growth moderated, and maybe I'm just looking at the wrong numbers. But it looked like 13% growth constant currency for China this quarter, last quarter, roughly the same. What was that comment about specifically?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","That was me. Yeah, I actually said it grew 13% in the quarter. But looking forward, I said we expected it to be low-double digits next year. And all I mentioned was that we had very strong performance across the board. We expected that to continue, that the whole industry had seen a little bit of cost control that was put in place. This is no new news. We had exceptional performance in our Life Sciences side of the business. So we expect basically the same performance, maybe a tick lower, that's all.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, I would say, most of that tick lower was related to math because we're growing about the same amount of revenue dollars off a bigger base. And so it steps down a point or two from that alone.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. But thanks for the chance to clarify that.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Unknown Speaker","Hey. Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","This is Chris (74:49) on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my questions. As a follow up to your previous question, could you just provide a breakdown of the key drivers to margin expansion in 2019? Now, how do cost synergies, core execution and the inclusion of Bard contribute to the 100 to 150 bps of target expansion?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Hold on one second.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. So, the base plan initiatives are up about 150 basis points. The synergies add about 50 and then the Bard portfolio is about another 10 or 20 basis points. That gets you up to about 200 basis points. And then, as I mentioned, the resins, tariffs, flus and the divestiture pressures are in the 80 to 100 kind of range, which brings you to total of about 100 to 150 basis points.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you. Then maybe just a unrelated follow-up. You ended 2018 with about 7% growth in Life Sciences business, guidance for next year is 4% to 5%. I think you called out flu as being 90 basis points headwind, so guidance for next year still implies a moderation in growth beyond just difficult flu comparisons. I mean, with that in mind, what else is impacting Life Sciences' growth next year? And can you just comment on the underlying sustainable revenue growth rate for that business? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, Patrick will take that.","Patrick Kaltenbach - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. I'm happy to take that. First and foremost, if you look at this year's growth rate, of course, we had also a tailwind from the flu. So if you take flu out, we had been growing between 5% and 6% as well this year, so that's my first point. And forward-looking, I think what we are looking at is an underlying market growth somewhere between 4% to 5% in overall Life Sciences. If you take the flu headwind this year out and say we will grow between 5% and 6%, we will actually achieve that goal to grow at the high end, if not above the market with our product portfolio.","I'm very confident that with the product portfolio we will roll out next year and what we did this year, we have a strong momentum in the Life Sciences market. We see a lot of opportunity in the immunology space, diagnostics base, and new solutions we have in the Preanalytical portfolio as well. So, again, the fundamentals are strong and I think we are positioned well. The 4% to 5% are really based on the fact that we account for the 90 basis points in flu.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Yeah, the only other thing I'd point out is we had the FlowJo acquisition in the current year, and that was worth probably 40 basis points.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, so that kind of tricks up the comparison a little bit.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. Thank for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Two questions, I guess, first, Vince, just following up on Rich's question about the pacing of revenue synergies, can you speak to the pacing for CareFusion kind of \u2013 or maybe, Tom, in the next couple of years? And then, secondly, for Patrick, regarding the changes to Medicare reimbursement around the respiratory and GI panels, it strikes us that BD is in a pretty good position here given how you've set your panels up, so I would just love a comment on that changing dynamic and I suppose the potential for commercial payers to follow Medicare? Thanks, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","All right. So, Tom is going to talk to the CareFusion.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Hey, Bill. This is Tom. So, on CareFusion, we continue to be very much on track to realize the $175 million in cumulative CareFusion synergies by FY 2019. And so we're coming to the tail end of that process of course now. As we've talked about before, we've seen the tens of bps impact, and I think you're seeing that across the Medical segment, which is where that's all focused, and it's specifically within the MDS International business and MMS, which I think you've seen really the acceleration from what \u2013 remember when we started the journey there, was an underlying CareFusion growth rate of 3% to 3.5% growth that obviously based on what you saw in 2018 we're exiting and going into 2019 at a number well north of 5%. And so, we see that clearly contributed to the revenue synergy impact that we've seen and look forward to bringing that home in a strong way in 2019.","Maybe a comment from Alberto as well.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. I also want to emphasize that our international product registration efforts has really continued and we registered a total of 300 product registrations in new markets as we expected. And just to give a little bit more color on the Medical segment, a lot of it's driven by CME, infusion pumps and Rowa dispensing solutions, ChloraPrep and the Pyxis IV Prep are some of the items that are driving some of these revenue synergies.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Maybe Patrick on MAX?","Patrick Kaltenbach - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. I can answer that. I mean, referring to Tom on (79:54) Medicare changes, I think we do not really expect it to have a big impact on our portfolio overall. As you know, we have some exposure, but most of our tests are not paid according to CFLS (80:07) because they fall outside of the Medicare population. So, we don't really expect a big impact there.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","It hasn't been a big impact. We don't expect it to.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Citigroup.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Oh, hey. Good morning. Thanks. Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Let me ask my first one on the Bard synergies on the cost side. Just wondering, now we're kind of nearing almost a year since the close, what's your visibility now versus the year ago as to whether your cost synergy target has room to improve over the original guide?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Amit. I think one thing I would point to is the tax synergies, which were not included in the initial amount. We typically don't show them, but did come to fruition. We did about $75 million in 2018 and those were the types of synergies that you get from the duplication of public company costs and some procurement. So the visibility to those typically is very high.","The next bucket that you would think of the next $100 million is the integration of systems and processes and functions. And we are in the execution stage of that. I feel really good about it, but you want to see that. And then, the third bucket is distribution centers and plants, et cetera, and that takes a while. So, we're just coming into the phase where we'll see the execution of those two buckets, which are really the ones that are the more difficult to get and takes a lot of execution. So, nothing that we see at this point would enable us to call an increase to that $300 million beyond the tax, but that's something that we're right in the middle of execution on, so a while longer before we can predict it for 2020.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And just last one, then on Interventional business and Surgery and actually hernia in particular, even if I exclude Progel and the hurricane, it seems to be trending slower than what Bard was doing pre the acquisition. Obviously, a big part of Bard's success in recent years was coming from share gains in hernia, so I'm just wondering if you can give us some color on growth trends in your hernia platform and what you expect there in the coming year.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Simon will do that for you.","Simon Campion - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, I think, as you said, we've just come off the hurricane and Progel and we're in the process of regaining some of the share that we've lost. You saw a reacceleration in Q4 for us. We do expect that to continue, but clearly there remains work to be done. So that's what we're looking at moving forward. And then, as Vince said earlier on, we are looking at geographic expansion here now as well, and we expect to \u2013 for that to be able to accelerate our momentum moving forward too. So, we're pretty happy with where we sit right now, and we're looking forward to executing on the synergies that we've rolled up.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. All in all, the overall Interventional segment is doing very, very well. And the recovery program from the hurricane was not just getting the production back in place, but of course, there was a lot of competitive inventory in the channel that we had to go and deal with. The team has done a fantastic job on that in getting that back. And we expect that to continue in 2019, but the overall business is doing well. So, we expect that recovery to continue in 2019, but thanks for the question.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, thank you very much for your participation and your questions. Let me just finish with some final thoughts. We had a very strong finish to the year, and I feel incredibly proud of our performance and what this team has done. The combination of BD and Bard continues to deliver exceptional value to our customers and our shareholders. And lastly, we have good momentum going into fiscal year 2019, and we look forward to updating you next time. Thank you very much.","Christopher R.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through February 13, 2018, on the Investors page of the BD.com website or by phone at 1-800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 4282726.","I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question and answer segment. Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin the conference.","Monique N. Dolecki - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at BD.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our first fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance.","A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release including the financial schedules is posted on the BD.com website. The details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures, in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","As a reminder, our first quarter results are on a standalone basis and represent only BD. We will report the combined BD plus Bard P&L results beginning with the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. In preparation for the newly combined company or newco reporting, we have also provided slides in the appendix of the earnings presentation which illustrate our new reportable segments and the way we will report our geographies going forward.","To align the new segment structure to our go to market strategy, approximately $700 million in annual revenues related to several products such as ChloraPrep and V. Mueller have moved from the legacy BD Medical Segment to the new Interventional Segment. Also, approximately $800 million in annual revenues related to several products such as PICCs and midlines have moved from Bard into the BD Medical Segment.","Details of the key product families and brands and our new segment structure can be found in the appendix of today's slide presentation.","We would also like to note that as the Gore royalty income stream is set to end in August of 2019, BD has concluded the income stream is non-recurring in nature and not central to the ongoing operations of the company. Therefore, the historical amounts recorded by Bard as revenue have been reclassified to other income to reflect BD's future reporting classification.","We've provided pro forma historical revenue information consistent with our new reporting structure which can be found in the schedules posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at BD.com which have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Furthermore, I would also point out that while BD and Bard operated on different fiscal years, the information you will see in our guidance slides is presented on the basis of BD's fiscal year which ends on September 30. Our comparable basis revenue guidance includes Bard's results for the full fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 periods.","For the purposes of today's call, we will provide revenue guidance for BD and Bard as standalone companies, in addition to the combined BD plus Bard outlook. Going forward, all guidance will be on a combined BD and Bard basis.","Lastly, our combined company P&L guidance includes the reclassification of certain Bard items to be consistent with BD's legacy reporting structure. Bard's shipping costs have been reclassified from cost of goods sold to SSG&A and quality and regulatory costs have been reclassified from R&D to cost of goods sold. In addition, our P&L guidance also reflects the reporting of the Gore royalty as other income.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administration (sic) [Administrative] Officer; Tom Polen, President; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences Segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Monique and good morning to everyone. As most of you are already aware, we are delighted to have closed the acquisition of C.R. Bard on December 29th of 2017. The combination of BD and Bard further accelerates our strategy of providing solutions for our customers. We are committed to providing our customers with products and value-added services all the way through full solutions to enable better, safer care at a lower cost. Together with Bard, the new BD is uniquely positioned to improve both the treatment of disease for patients and the process of care for healthcare providers.","Turning to slide 5 and our first quarter highlights. As we stated in our press release, we are proud of our final quarter as the legacy BD. Our results this quarter highlight the continued strength in our core and our reliable, consistent results. We delivered strong underlying revenue growth in both the Medical and Life Science Segments ahead of our initial expectations. And we continue to remain on track with our CareFusion cost and revenue synergy commitments.","We are also off to a terrific start with our Bard integration activities which are progressing as planned. In early January, we celebrated Day 1 activities around the globe to welcome Bard and their 16,000 associates. The energy of our associates globally around what we can do as a combined organization to advance the world of health is really incredible. As we come together as the new BD, we have strong momentum across both legacy companies. I'm pleased to report that the Bard's performance in their final standalone quarter was in line with our expectations. Chris will share some high-level details of Bard's results during his commentary this morning.","Moving on to slide 6, we are pleased to share our financial outlook today on a combined basis. We anticipate strong revenue and EPS growth consistent with the expectations we communicated upon announcement of the Bard transaction. On a comparable basis, we expect underlying currency-neutral revenue growth of 5% to 6% and mid-teens growth in adjusted earnings per share.","I will now turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter financial performance and our fiscal year 2018 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to slide 8, I'll review our first quarter revenue and EPS results, as well as the key financial highlights.","Total first quarter revenues of approximately $3.1 billion grew 3.7% on a currency-neutral basis. As Vince mentioned, our underlying performance is strong. Our first quarter results include the impact from the U.S. dispensing change, which lowered total company revenue growth by approximately 110 basis points. Excluding this impact, we drove revenue growth of approximately 4.8%. Pricing declined about 20 basis points in the first quarter.","In addition, as we communicated to you last quarter, we faced the tough comparison this quarter to strong 6.1% growth in the prior year. I'll provide more color on revenue growth in the quarter in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and geography.","Adjusted EPS of $2.48 grew 6.4%, or 3.9% on a currency-neutral basis. This reflects the tough comparison to the prior year and the U.S. dispensing change as expected. Adjusting for the U.S. dispensing change, EPS growth was in the high single-digits.","At the end of December, upon closing of the Bard transaction, our gross debt leverage was 4.7 times. We expect to begin to delever in the latter half of fiscal 2018. This timing is in line with what we have previously communicated and our commitment to deleverage below 3 times leverage over three years.","Moving on to slide 9, I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. BD Medical first quarter revenues increased 1.9%, which includes a headwind of approximately 170 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change. In addition, the Medical Segment in particular faced the tough comparison to the strong revenue growth in the first quarter of the prior year. Adjusting for the combined estimated impact of 340 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change and the tough comparison, the BD Medical Segment grew over 5% on an underlying basis.","Medication and Procedural Solutions or MPS revenues grew 5% in the first quarter. Growth was driven by continued strength in our pre-filled flush devices, infection prevention and surgical products.","Revenues in Medication Management Solutions or MMS declined 3.4%. Revenue growth was impacted by a headwind of approximately 540 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change. In addition, the timing of capital installations in both dispensing and infusion in the prior year resulted in tough comparison to the prior year where MMS revenues grew 11%. Adjusting for the combined estimated impact of 950 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change and the tough comparison, MMS grew approximately 6%.","Diabetes Care revenues grew 2.2%, driven by growth in pen needles. This reflects a tough comparison to the prior year where growth in the U.S. of 7.2% was aided by the timing of customer orders.","In Pharmaceutical Systems, revenues grew 3.7% in the first quarter despite a tough comparison in the prior year where growth of 15.5% was aided by the timing of customer orders.","Now, turning to slide 10 and the BD Life Sciences Segment. First quarter revenues increased 7.3%. Strength across the segment was aided by an early flu season in comparison to last year, which contributed an estimated 90 basis points to Life Sciences growth. As you're aware, the timing and severity of the flu season can impact our year-over-year comparisons.","Revenues in Diagnostic Systems grew 12.5% in the quarter. Performance was driven by strength in core microbiology and continued strong growth in our BD MAX molecular platform as well as timing of Kiestra installations in the U.S., EMA, and Europe. In addition, the earlier flu season contributed an estimated 260 basis points to Diagnostic Systems growth in the quarter.","Preanalytical Systems growth of 4% was driven by strength in core products.","Biosciences revenues grew 5.3% in the quarter. The strong momentum from the second half of 2017 continued as expected. This reflects growth in our newer research instruments such as the FACSMelody and FACSymphony as well as continued strength in research reagents.","Now, moving to slide 11, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. revenues grew 1.6% in the first quarter, which includes an estimated headwind of 200 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change. The previously mentioned tough comparisons to the prior year in MMS and Diabetes Care also impacted revenue growth in the U.S.","Growth in the U.S. was driven by strong performance in the MPS unit in the Medical Segment and the Diagnostic Systems and Preanalytical Systems units in the Life Sciences Segment. Growth in MPS reflects strength in infusion-related disposables and infection prevention. Growth in Diagnostic Systems in the U.S. was driven by the earlier flu season in comparison to the prior year as well as continued growth in BD MAX driven by our newer women's health assays. Preanalytical Systems growth was driven by strength across core products.","Now, moving on to international, revenues grew 6.3% in the first quarter. Growth was driven by Kiestra installations and strength in core microbiology within Diagnostic Systems and strong sales of our newer research and clinical instruments within our Biosciences unit. Strength in pre-filled flush devices in MPS and strong growth in Pharmaceutical Systems, which was aided by geographic ordering patterns, also contributed to international growth.","Developed markets revenues grew 2.5% in the first quarter, including an estimated headwind from the U.S. dispensing change of 130 basis points. Growth in developed markets was driven by strong performance in Europe in Pharmaceutical Systems and Diagnostic Systems.","First quarter emerging markets revenues grew 10%, driven by growth of China of 9% and double-digit growth in EMA that was aided by the timing of tenders.","Now, turning to slide 12 which recaps the first quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As discussed, revenues grew 3.7% in the quarter, which includes approximately 110 basis points negative impact from the U.S. dispensing change.","Moving down the P&L, starting with gross profit, despite the loss of gross profit related to the U.S. dispensing change, gross profit margin was a very strong 54.9%, which is an increase of 4.2% year-over-year. I'll provide additional details on gross profit in just a moment.","SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 25.1%. As expected, in the first quarter. we incurred additional shipping costs related to our efforts to scale shipments in late September, as we discussed on our last earnings call. Our results also include the impact of the U.S. dispensing change as well as a tough comparison of the prior year. On an underlying basis, we're very pleased with the leverage we're getting in SSG&A.","R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.2%, which reflects a 5% increase in R&D dollars year-over-year and our continued commitment to invest in innovation.","Our tax rate declined to 16.4% in the quarter.","Operating income grew 1.2%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 3.9% compared to the prior year. Both operating income and EPS include approximately 500 basis points of negative impact from the U.S. dispensing change.","Now, turning to slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the first quarter. As I mentioned, gross profit margin was a very strong 54.9% in the first quarter. On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by 30 basis points, as continuous improvement initiatives, cost synergies and favorable mix were partially offset by a headwind of 80 basis points from raw materials, pricing, and the U.S. dispensing change. Currency had a positive impact of 30 basis points on gross profit margin.","Operating margin declined 30 basis points in the quarter. This was driven by the increase in SSG&A as previously discussed, partially offset by a positive impact of 30 basis points from currency. I'll take you through the combined company guidance inclusive of Bard over the next several slides, but while we're discussing margins, I'd like to point out that for the full year, we expect to deliver significant underlying margin expansion of 200 basis points to 250 basis points. This reflects the inclusion of Bard beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and is an increase of approximately 100 basis points from our prior guidance of 100 to 150 basis points of margin expansion for legacy BD. Over the four-year period through fiscal year 2018, we expect to deliver approximately 700 basis points of margin expansion.","Moving on to slide 15 in our full fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance. Prior to closing the Bard acquisition, on our November earnings call, we provided standalone revenue guidance for BD of 4% to 5% growth on a currency-neutral basis, which represented strong underlying growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, excluding an estimated 50-basis-point impact from the U.S. dispensing change.","Now, on a standalone basis, Bard's revenues are expected to grow 5% to 6%. This represents strong growth of 6% to 7% on an underlying basis, which excludes an estimated 100-basis-point adverse impact from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico on Bard's results in the quarter that ended December 31 of 2017. Going forward, we do not expect an impact to Bard's revenues related to the hurricane.","On the BD side, as you'll recall, the fiscal year 2018 revenue and EPS guidance we provided on our November earnings call did not reflect any potential adverse impact related to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. However, at that time, we had estimated the impact could be up to $40 million in revenues with a corresponding impact of up to 1-percent-point of EPS growth.","Subsequent to our November call, thanks to the heroic efforts of many of our associates, we were able to get our plans back online quicker than previously anticipated. As a result, the impact to revenues and EPS has been minimized and our current guidance for fiscal year 2018 now includes a non-material impact related to the hurricane.","For the new BD plus Bard, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth of 4.5% to 5.5% on a comparable basis that includes BD and Bard in both the current and prior year periods as if the acquisition had been completed at the beginning of our fiscal 2017 year. This represents strong underlying growth of 5% to 6% and is in line with the expectations we have been communicating since the deal announcement.","Turning to slide 16 in our segment revenue guidance, you'll see guidance for our three segments. As a reminder, certain legacy BD Medical and Bard products have been realigned with our go to market strategy. This has resulted in the movement of revenues between the BD Medical and BD Interventional Segments, and as a result, the new BD Interventional Segment is not analogous with legacy Bard.","We expect BD Medical to grow between 4% and 5%. We expect our Life Sciences Segment to grow between 4.5% and 5.5%, which is an increase from our prior guidance. And we expect the new BD Interventional Segment to grow between 5.5% and 6.5% excluding the impact from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in the quarter that ended December 31, 2017.","We expect revenue growth to be driven by recent product launches across all three segments and strength in both developed and emerging markets. The combination of BD and Bard accelerates our growth profile in both developed and emerging markets and as a result, we now anticipate developed market growth of around 4% in fiscal 2018 or around 4.5% excluding the estimated 50-basis-point impact from the U.S. dispensing change and the hurricane in Puerto Rico. In emerging markets, we now expect low double-digit growth driven by a diversified base with mid-teens growth in China and strength in EMA and Latin America.","For transparency, we'd like to take a moment to provide some color on Bard's results for the quarter that ended December 31, which represented the fourth quarter of their fiscal 2017 year. While we do not plan to discuss the results at length, we wanted to share some of the key insights into the business performance in the quarter.","Bard's revenues and earnings performance in the December quarter were in line with our expectations and prior Bard guidance. Bard's revenue growth was 3.7% on a currency-neutral basis, which included an adverse impact of approximately 330 basis points from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. Adjusting for the hurricane, Bard's fourth quarter revenues grew 7%, in line with company's prior guidance. Revenue growth was driven by continued strength in China and Latin America and more broadly across emerging markets. In addition, strong high single-digit growth in Peripheral Vascular in the U.S. was aided by the launch of Lutonix AV.","As a reminder, these businesses will be reported in BD's new reporting structure going forward.","And moving on to slide 17 and our full fiscal year 2018 EPS guidance. There are a number of moving parts that impact earnings per share in fiscal 2018. For modeling purposes and to ensure consistency, I'd like to provide more color on EPS guidance.","Starting on the left side of the chart, with the guidance we provided on our November earnings call for legacy BD, we expected adjusted EPS of $10.55 to $10.65. This reflected currency-neutral growth of approximately 10%, driven by strong growth in operating income, partially offset by headwinds of 2% to 3% from the U.S. dispensing change and approximately 3% from an expected increase in our effective tax rate. Assuming foreign currency rates in place at the time, we expected currency would provide a 2% tailwind in fiscal 2018 resulting in expected EPS growth of approximately 12%.","Now, continuing to the right in the chart, we expect underlying accretion from the Bard acquisition of 3% to 4%. This is expected to be offset by approximately 2% from a combination of the divestitures of our soft tissue core needle biopsy product line and Bard's Aspira product line of tunneled, home drainage catheters and accessories, as well as the timing of close of the Bard acquisition. The net result is low single-digit accretion, which is in line with what we've been communicating.","As you'll see when I take you through our detailed P&L guidance on the next slide, we expect an effective tax rate of 17% to 19% in fiscal 2018. This is a decrease of approximately 1% from the combined effective tax rate of 18% to 20% that we had previously communicated and is driven primarily by U.S. tax reform and results in an increase of approximately 1% to our EPS guidance.","From an investment standpoint, consistent with our initial thoughts, we plan to invest approximately $15 million toward Bard revenue synergies and this is dilutive to earnings by approximately 50 basis points. In addition, while our guidance does anticipate an increase related to the flu, we're also seeing increased pressure related to resin pricing that is offsetting the expected flu benefit.","The net of these items results in approximately 12% currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2018 or 14% to 15% on an underlying basis adjusted for the impact from the U.S. dispensing change. This is in line with the mid-teens growth profile we've been communicating to you since the deal announcement.","Lastly, we anticipate an incremental currency tailwind of about 150 basis points based on current rates. This assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.22. All-in, this results in strong newco earnings of $10.85 to $11, which represents 15% to 16% growth.","Another important element to note that is while we expect to deliver low single-digit accretion in fiscal year 2018, we are reaffirming our guidance of high single-digit accretion in fiscal year 2019. From a phasing perspective, we expect to achieve $70 million to $80 million in cost synergies in fiscal year 2018, with the balance being fairly ratable over fiscal years 2019 and 2020. We're committed to fully realizing $300 million in annualized cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2020.","Turning to slide 18, I'd like to walk you through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2018 for the new BD including Bard. This guidance includes the results of Bard as of January 1, 2018, which is the beginning of our second fiscal quarter. We expect reported revenue growth for newco of 30% to 31%, which includes a currency tailwind of approximately 200 basis points.","Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 56% to 57%. This is an increase of approximately 200 basis points from our prior standalone BD guidance and is due to the inclusion of Bard's robust gross margin profile.","Adjusted SSG&A is expected to be 24.5% to 25.5% of sales. This is an increase compared to our November guidance for standalone BD and is primarily due to Bard's higher SSG&A spend profile which is driven by the direct sales approach, partially offset by anticipated G&A related cost synergies.","We expect our R&D investments to be in line with fiscal year 2017 at 6% to 7% of revenues. As a new company, we will continue to invest in new products and platforms.","As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 25% and 26% of revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve by 200 basis points to 250 basis points for the total fiscal year.","As we discussed, we expect our tax rate to be between 17% and 19%. For fiscal year 2018, we anticipate our adjusted average fully diluted share count to be approximately 261 million shares. Cash flow is expected to be strong with operating cash flow of about $3.5 billion in fiscal year 2018. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $850 million and $900 million.","So in summary, I'm excited about the strong momentum we have across the BD and Bard businesses and I'm confident that we'll be able to deliver on our commitments in fiscal year 2018, which are consistent with what we've been communicating to you since the announcement of the transaction.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince who'll provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Chris. And moving on to slide 20. As we have been discussing with you, our integration of CareFusion is largely complete and we are on track to achieve our cost and revenue synergy commitments. At the same time, we're making excellent progress with the integration of Bard.","As I discussed in my opening remarks, we have hosted very successful Day 1 activities globally. We are entering 2018 with great momentum across both companies. Our integration plans are well underway and as Chris discussed earlier, we are committed to fully realizing $300 million in annualized cost synergies, as we exit fiscal year 2020. In addition, as Chris mentioned, we've begun our initial investment in revenue synergies. We're continuing to build out our revenue synergy plans at a very detailed level and we look forward to sharing updates with you along the way.","Turning to slide 21 and our planned product launches by segment. As we've been discussing with you, we have a very robust product pipeline across the company. I will not review all of the items on slide 21 in detail, but we will share some comments on a few items. Within our Medical Segment, we have recently begun shipping IV solutions to our customers through our partnership with Fresenius.","As saline remains limited in supply, the addition of sodium chloride to our Medication Management portfolio will benefit our customers and their patients. Beyond sodium chloride and 5% dextrose, we expect to add additional compounds to our offering this fiscal year, but contingent on our partner's FDA approval.","Before we move on to our Life Sciences Segment, I would like to provide an update on a program we've been working on in our Diabetes Care business relating to enabling dose capture for insulin pens. We've made a decision to stop this program due to the reassessment of the near-term commercial opportunity. We've redeployed these resources into our smart Type 2 patch pump and are funding additional clinical trials in anticipation of launch. Including our first in human insulin infusion trial running now, we're very excited about our progress on this transformative initiative, and we'll come back to the pen program later on.","Moving on to our Life Sciences Segment, we recently obtained the CE Mark for the BD MAX Check-Points CPO assay. This next generation molecular screening test for antibiotic resistant CPOs provides detection of the five most common carbapenemase genes in less than 2.5 hours as compared to traditional methods that can take up to 24 hours.","Together with our plated media and the BD Phoenix CPO detect panels, BD provides comprehensive solutions for screening and infection management to support clinical microbiology laboratories in their AMR programs.","We also expect to continue targeted expansion of our BD MAX menu this fiscal year with the launch of our Enteric viral panel and our TB assay. In addition, we anticipate approval of our BD Onclarity HPV assay, which will further differentiate our women's health offering.","Moving on to the Interventional Segment, to help bridge the time from Bard's last public update in January 2017 to date, we have provided a list of Bard's product launches for fiscal 2017 in the appendix to today's slide presentation.","Focusing now on the list on slide 21, I will highlight a few of the fiscal 2018 items in the Interventional Segment. The AV access drug coated balloon, which launched at the beginning of BD's first quarter, is changing the treatment pathway for the hemodialysis patients suffering from a stenotic fistula. This launch makes a significant new treatment option for the highly vulnerable patient population and is the only DCB approved for this indication in the U.S.","Also related to DCB, as most of you are aware, in January, we announced the completed enrollment in our Lutonix below-the-knee trial, which is a significant milestone. This study has enrolled over 450 patients over four-and-a-half years \u2013 four-plus years I should say, and it is more important to note that there have been 14 safety monitoring reviews over this time with no safety issues. This speaks highly to the safety of the product. The Lutonix BTK trial is the only ongoing DCB trial for BTK arteries in the U.S. and we anticipate completing six-month follow-up and submission of the PMA to the FDA by the end of calendar year 2018. We look forward to being the first company to have the below-the-knee indication in the U.S.","Moving on to some fiscal 2018 anticipated launches, with the Interventional Segment. Our new low profile 5French ProSeries LifeStent platform launched in the EU mid-year 2017 and just received PMA approval. We are building inventory and anticipate launching the product in the U.S. over the next few months. This new stent family built on the LifeStent platform will provide the lowest profile, longest lengths and broadest indications of any peripheral arterial stent. This new launch also expands our 5French ProSeries of chronic total occlusion, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and drug coated balloon products to a full suite of peripheral arterial disease tools that are 5French compatible.","We're also anticipating PMA approval and preparing for the launch of our Covera family of next generation AV access circuit stent grafts. We completed enrollment in IDE studies for both the treatment of AV fistulas and AV access grafts in 2017. Our graft study enrolled a little faster with follow-up completed last fall and PMA submission in December.","We currently anticipate a U.S. launch of Covera with the AV access graft indication towards the end of fiscal year 2018, with PMA submission for the fistula indication anticipated about the same time. As you can see, we have a very rich pipeline of new products across our businesses and we look forward to sharing updates with you along the way.","Before I move on, I would like to point out that we have included a new slide in the appendix of today's presentation that provides an update on our sustainability initiatives. While we have always been focused on ESG in creating shared value, we have received feedback from the investor community about its increasing relevance to investment decisions. We hope you find the information useful in understanding BD's commitment to this important topic.","Moving on to slide 21 (sic) [22], I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. We delivered strong underlying revenue growth in both the Medical and Life Sciences Segments in our final quarter as legacy BD. Our performance highlights the continued strength in our core and our reliable, consistent results. Looking ahead, we are confident in our fiscal 2018 outlook which is consistent with the expectations we communicated upon the announcement of the Bard transaction.","I would like to thank all of the BD and Bard associates for their dedication and hard work that made this combination possible. We have great momentum across both companies as we welcome C.R. Bard to BD, and we are excited about the opportunity we have as a combined company to advance the world of health for our customers and their patients around the world.","Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for your questions. . Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I appreciate it.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. So the first question I have is just really a clarification on the guidance and some of the information you provided yesterday. So for the 2018 pro forma guide of 5% to 6%, is ex-dispensing changes and the hurricanes, what number is that compared to for 2017? I saw that 5.2% yesterday, but is that also ex-dispensing changes and hurricanes?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","No. I think the way to think about it is 5.6% ex-dispensing.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's for 2017?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So that compares to the 5% to 6% free (39:21)?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","That's right. That's right.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for that clarification.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then, just one other thing I wanted to ask about is just you mentioned resin cost going up, could you just quantify that for 2018?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, so we're looking at an incremental $15 million or so. Now \u2013 you have more clarity around that in the upcoming quarter, it gets a little bit murkier in the second half of the year. But our best guess right now based on what we're seeing in that market, oil prices certainly have an impact, but the market itself is a difficult market in terms of supply and demand. And so, we're estimating right now about $15 million impact. What we are saying, we're also assuming a benefit from the flu upside, and the two of those basically offset one another as we see it today.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Bob, thanks for your questions.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. A couple quick ones for me. One, strategically for \u2013 and then, one, actually more financially oriented. So Vince, just on the Gore royalty, this is sort of your first time having to pro forma Bard. Bard had talked about their strategic plans for how they were going to offset the Gore royalty. You've obviously moved that to other income which is the appropriate treatment. But how are you thinking about the opportunity to offset the Gore royalty, either through M&A, SG&A cuts or balance sheet deployment? And I have a quick follow-up for Chris.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well, first off, in terms of the Gore royalty, as we've been talking about, we expect to be delevering aggressively. And so, we're going to see a decrease in interest expense. So that's number one on the list and the timing kind of works out very nicely from that standpoint, David.","The second thing is, yes, you will also see the rollout of the cost synergies. And third, as we get to that timeframe, we're going to expect the benefit of revenue synergies starting to impact. So when you put that all together, I think we're in good shape.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. The only thing I would add then as well is you've got the conversion of the mandatory preferred at that timeframe, which helps to offset a little bit as well...","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","(41:27)","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","...the factors. Yes. The interest goes down.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So generally, you think you can offset the Gore royalty through a lot of operating and non-op dynamics without deploying material balance sheet.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. We think we're in good shape with that, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very clear. And then, Chris, just a few dynamics of earnings here. Thinking about the earnings guidance. To us, currency, based on your euro\/dollar assumptions, looks a little conservative. Are there any currency headwinds that we're not thinking about in terms of different pieces there? And your tax rate, another piece there where that number seems conservative based on this quarter's rate going forward. So does that reflect your full appreciation of all the tax dynamics, or does that also look a little conservative here as we start the beginning of the year? So your currency and tax and do those look conservative...","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","...are the things we're missing? (42:18) Thanks so much.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Great. Well, as you know, we do the 30-day moving average on FX, and the quote we have today is at $1.22 to the euro. So there's no other basket of currency impact or whatever. They're all moving consistent with the euro. And obviously, we're at $1.235 I think today, so there is a little bit of upside there. We'll see how that goes. We remain consistent with the 30-day average just to smooth out the bumps and the benefits along the way. But if we do see some currency upside, that will flow through in the future.","We would also look, though, to see if there is more investments. We're making the initial investment of the $15 million to drive Bard synergies, and if there's significant amount of FX upside going forward, we might invest some of that. But that's to come.","And then, on the tax rate, there's an awful lot of complexity around the tax rate. As you might imagine, they institute the tax reform at the end of December, and it's right on top of a very large transaction with BD and Bard. So there's a lot of things going into that. As we had previously mentioned, we see the benefit of tax reform to our tax rate as being a slight benefit. There's a lot of things that go into that. But that's what's manifested in the impact down from the 18% to 20% that we had announced upon the deal announcement, down about a full percentage point down to the 17% to 19%.","There are some impacts in 2019 that would be headwinds, as some pieces of the tax reform act go into effect in 2019 that don't affect us in 2018. But we think that some of the combination with Bard and those kinds of things, we should be able to offset that going forward. So we feel good about the 17% to 19% rate as we get that benefit from tax reform.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. My questions are primarily around the guidance as well. So if I think about Bard, that kind of net 1% to 2%, call it, year one accretion, that's before the benefit of \u2013 the dollar's moved since you announced the transaction and before the benefit of tax, you're separating those and putting them in the other other (44:57) columns? Is that right?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes, that's the right way to think about it, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So if we really thought about Bard just as a standalone, Bard would be year one much more accretive than that 1% to 2%, because again, the movement of dollar since the time you announced the transaction and the benefit of tax reform?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Absolutely.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. The $0.07 (45:19) beat this quarter relatively Street expectations, you didn't let that flow through. Could you maybe just comment on why? And then, I don't think you've given us what the incremental tax liability is going to be from reform and is that in your 4.7 times gross debt number?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So let me take that last piece first. That's important in terms of the tax. We will, as part of the press release, I think in the attachments you'll see, that we lay out the impact of the unremitted earnings. So we took a charge on the BD side of $561 million related to that toll charge. And then, that was offset, though, by a $290 million benefit that relates to the write-down of the net deferred tax liability. But the right one to focus on from a cash standpoint is the $561 million.","Now, on the Bard side, in their opening balance sheet, they recorded a charge of $220 million related to the toll charge. So in total, it's $781 million. Now, the good news is that we don't start paying that until next fiscal year, and the way it's allocated, it's back-end loaded, so it's really only 8% a year in the first five years. The reason that's important is it really doesn't have a big impact on our three-year period where we're paying down the debt to the 3 times leverage, so really no material impact on that.","And then, as we look forward, you see that our cash this year, we're generating $3.5 billion, that's with only three quarters of Bard included, so that will go up next year and the year after. So we generate a lot of cash. So while I'm not thrilled about paying this $781 million over the next eight years, we have more than enough cash generation going forward to cover that. So those are the details around that.","And then, in terms of the first question, we beat the revenue that drove Q1 EPS earnings, and that's still within our 5% to 6% overall revenue guidance that will flow down. So the range I think we've captured within our range the benefit in the first quarter. And frankly, it's still early, so we'll see how it goes going forward.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Isaac.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Good morning, guys. Thanks. Hi. How are you?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Question for you on the Diagnostics business. There's some changes in reimbursement going through in the U.S. marketplace. Curious what you're seeing so far. You said that labs are facing low reimbursement for some of the more commodity categories that you serve.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So I'll turn it over to Alberto. Alberto, do you want to get that?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Hello. Good morning. It's too early to see any impact at this point. We've always seen this as a relatively limited impact to us directly. There will be some overall pressure on pricing we anticipate, but it's not significant. We're told it's U.S. only. Secondly, it's capped every year 10% maximum decrease. It's only for CMS and a lot of our customers are obviously private. And it only impacts the last schedule (48:59) versus the hospital and the DRG. So we're not anticipating this to be a significant impact on us.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","And then, maybe...","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, go ahead, Isaac.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. So Chris, maybe second item on just the expense side, if I think about the long-term with regard to the Bard integration, could you maybe outline some of the longer-term projects that come into play, as you think about back-end operational stuff, because you've done a couple of larger deals for the last two years? I'm curious you said to us (49:32) there are some longer-term projects in the works?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes, absolutely. So what I've said is that there's really you think about this in three buckets. So the $300 million, the first year, you're really talking about public company costs as well as procurement kind of savings. So that's what you would expect the first third to be. In the third year, you would expect the more long-term projects that you're referring to which is looking at manufacturing facilities and distribution centers. And obviously, that takes a lot of planning. You want to get that right. And that's what you would see showing up in year three.","In year two, you would be looking at some of the functional systems and transformations, putting the two companies on the same kind of systems integrations, going to Workday, for example, those kinds of things and that shows up in year two.","So the only other thing I'd say is because it's not a perfect year, we're looking at about $70 million to $80 million of impact in the three quarters this year, and then, pretty much ratable over the next two years.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Thanks, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Kristen.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was just wondering with, I guess, now having the acquisition closed for I guess a little over a month now with operating and just seeing the revenue synergies with having the ability now to spend, what sort of spending, where are you targeting it? Is it more for U.S. spend, international spend? Can you maybe just give a little bit of detail what gives you the confidence to spend on revenues and what sort of synergies are you looking at? And I've one follow-up.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. I'll ask Tom to talk to that. But it's very much in line with our original thinking on the deals. Tom, do you want to just take that?","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Hi, Kristen. This is Tom. So from a regional perspective, actually, the U.S. and Europe are the two areas that we're most heavily investing in and about a little less than a third would be in emerging markets, so two-thirds in U.S. and Europe and a little less than a third in emerging markets.","From a business unit perspective, those investments are also heavily concentrated within our MDS business unit and the surgery area. And that, as you can imagine, is expected. That's where we see synergies of portfolios coming together. So the PICCs coming in, MDS from Bard in with our catheter and other drug delivery technology, so that's an epicenter of synergies we see.","And then, in surgery, where we're moving our ChloraPrep business and V. Mueller business, Interventional Specialties from BD into that area, obviously, ChloraPrep now having channel access, for example, in Europe via the biosurgery team and opportunities for us to further accelerate growth, for example, even in biosurgery channel expansion ex-U.S. So those are the two businesses and two major regions that we're investing in. Thanks for the question.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And what do you think in terms of the payback on these investments? Do you think that you'll get those back in 2020? And then, just a follow-up on the patch pump. Could you just remind us on the timeline to market then and do you think that taking the resources away from the insulin pen can help accelerate that? Thanks.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. So Kristen, we see, from a payback period, actually, this first tranche of investments have a relatively short payback period. And so, we won't see \u2013 the revenue will start to ramp in the very \u2013 really see it come through in 2019, not necessarily notable where it will be visible across the new $16 billion company. But we expect the pay back relatively to break even within a year on the first $15 million of investment. And then, there's other tranches of investments that we'll be making in the future as was alluded to earlier on the call.","When it comes to the patch pump, again, it continues to go very well and our targeted launch is at the very end of FY 2019. And I wouldn't say we see an acceleration from the investments that we're making in a faster way there. It's more of we're adding in clinical trials and that's some learnings that we've had, particularly in the diabetes space where we want to do more patient testing prelaunch, and so, we've added in a number of patient trials. You heard Vince mentioned actually an active patient trial that's underway right now. It's actually our first use of Swatch in patients with insulin underway, and all of that's been funded incrementally versus some of our original thinking and plans.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Just get more customer data earlier on.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Absolutely.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Kristen, thanks for the questions.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Moving away from Bard for a second, have you guys seen any improvements in business operations from the business model change in dispensing? And related to that, we keep getting questions on market share between you and your competitor there. So can you talk a little bit about what you see for growth in dispensing on a normalized accounting basis versus the market? And then, I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes, we can do that. We have some good data on that that Tom can walk you through. We're feeling very good about that business.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hi, Brian. This is Tom. So we actually continue to see fantastic customer feedback to the new model. We see our Net Promoter Score actually approximately doubling. Since we've made that change, the feedback from customers has been very positive, particularly along with some of the investments that we've made in clinical consultants who are supporting wider use of the features of Pyxis ES. We've always said that folks only were using about a third of the power of the platform, and now, with some of the consultants that we've been able to fund through this new approach, we're really seeing customers being able to adopt and get more value out of the platform.","If you look actually at last year, the U.S. dispensing, excluding trace, was about 10% growth for the year, so very, very strong underlying performance. And while we certainly don't make statements about peers or competition, specifically, I would say that we continue to gain momentum in our customer base. As you know, we have a very significant market leadership position, and we continue to expand that position through integration of our Med Management continuum including our IV compounding platform, what we're now calling Pyxis IV Prep, our inventory management system, which we now call Pyxis Logistics, and the new BD Health site platform that we launched at ASHP this year. So overall, really positive feedback from customers and we're seeing very good momentum going forward.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And then, a quick follow-up on flu. I would have thought the impact potentially could be bigger in Q2. Did I hear you right that you thought that that would potentially just be about $15 million? And are you still producing flu kits for Veritor? There were some rumor that you may have stopped production after you hit some target volumes for the year. Thanks.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I think what you have to remember, Brian, is that last year, the flu was fairly strong in the second quarter. So although we had a nice benefit in the first quarter compared to last year, it's not absolute that it will be higher for the year. But in January, we really did see and it clearly is a strong flu season. That's why as we look out \u2013 you don't know what's going to happen, it could drop off, so we'll see. But based on January, we're thinking that there is more flu upside in the remainder of the year. And roughly, it's offset by that $15 million increase in resin prices. So that's the way we currently see it.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And, Alberto, from production standpoint?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well, not only have we not stopped it, we have increased it. We are at full capacity, adding shifts, anything that we can do to try to increase production, as we see the demand being very, very high. And as of today, we haven't seen any unusual (57:22) back order, although it is continuing be a very, very high level, so we are a little bit of hand to mouth. But we're doing everything possible to crank up production.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks, Brian. Great to hear from you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Two product-related questions for me. I'll ask them both upfront. First, Vince, you highlighted IV solutions. That was the first product you highlighted in the initiatives for fiscal 2018. Could you help quantify the benefit to BD in fiscal 2018 and beyond?","And then second, Lutonix is obviously an important product for Bard, but there are a lot of moving parts or changes in that market from a reimbursement and competition standpoint. But you, obviously, have new indications of geography. So can you talk about your high level expectations for Lutonix over the next few years? Thanks for taking the questions.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, sure. So I'm going to turn those over to Tom. In the quarter, the IV solutions was not meaningful. But we do expect to ramp up in the second part of the year. And how far that goes is also going to depend on how much capacity our partner has and do we get new FDA approvals. But Tom, do you want to add anything else to that and then just jump on the drug coated balloons?","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hi, Larry. I would just say for IV solutions, think about it in tens of basis points for the MDS business specifically, and then, obviously, that dilutes out further when you take it to the BDX level.","Specifically, on Lutonix, I would just say, obviously, the change in reimbursement that you referenced, it's not something that we like, but it's also something that we expect will have only minimal impact on our growth trajectory this year and going forward. We didn't see fundamentally a change year-on-year in growth, think about 2018 growth for Lutonix and DCBs overall being very much in line with growth that was seen in prior years and we expect that to go forward and that's really driven by the very robust pipeline that the business has.","Obviously, we've got the new AV indication, we have BTK coming that's going to help that whole category grow for us, and we expect drug coated balloons are going to continue to grow in line with prior year in 2018 and in the years ahead.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Just two quick ones for Chris. Can you tell us what you're penciling in for ASPs for fiscal 2018? And then, for newco, can you remind us how big resins are as a percent of COGS?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I'm sorry. Can you ask the question again? There was some static there (01:00:11) Brandon ASPs.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. What you're penciling in for ASPs for the year, and then, secondly, what resins are as a percent of COGS for newco?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. On the ASPs, what we have said is that we expect pricing across the business to be slightly down. So I think tens of basis points across the business. And then, the percentage of resin, resin across BD is about $250 million. I think that's just the BD side. So that gives you something to work with.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Partly yes, (01:00:46) it'll be a little bit more...","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, it'll be a little bit more with Bard.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","With Bard, I guess, $300 million or so.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Super. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Great. Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Bill.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning, everybody. So recognizing it's a little more difficult to pull up, any way to help us think about the impact of the flu season on some of the ancillary medical products just given the higher rate of hospitalization? And so, I guess what I'm asking about is kind of ex the actual direct flu products themselves.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes, so there is a correlation, of course, with folks ending up in the hospital and having other conditions. Now, how to quantify that, that's extremely difficult. But historically, if we look back, we do see a little bit of a positive impact across multiple product lines. We see it on the Diagnostic side with blood culture and you may see, of course, in catheters and those sorts of things. And there is an increase in cardiac events. As I said, it's not big enough that we can measure it, but it is certainly there.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Got it. Thanks, Vince. And then, Tom, just a quick update on the O.U.S. CareFusion revenue synergies from new product launches and how should we think about that going forward. Thank you.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Hi, Bill. So we're now over 250 active or in-process registrations when it comes to focusing on revenue synergies, so we're continuing to make very good progress there. And while we don't quantify those revenue synergies each quarter, we continue to expect to see growth contributions in the range of tens of basis points as we've shared in the past. We also expect to see those most visible in the international MDS and MMS businesses. And if you'll notice, you'll see those, if you look at the last couple of quarters, those continuing to go very, very strongly, MDS and MMS international.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company. LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company. LLC","First, starting on the product realignments, what has been the initial feedback from your sales force and customers? Could you help quantify how this might accelerate the revenue growth outlook for the impacted segments? And should we be contemplating any initial dissynergies related to the realignments?","And then, I guess the second thing I just wanted to quickly talk about is Bard's M&A history. As you guys know, strategic tuck-ins have helped boost Bard core growth over time. This was arguably a pretty important part of their strategy. Could you just provide us an update on how much capacity you have to keep that going given where the gross leverage ratio is today? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Okay. So I'll start on the M&A side. And there's always part of our modeling that we would leave room for strategic M&A. And of course, the way we think about that is more must do. And the conversation we're having with the Interventional Segment is, give us your pipeline so that we can plan that in. And as you said, that's tuck-in M&A, and we take that as kind of the base of what we have to do.","The second thing is going on in the other two segments, so we're creating that list right now. And as we have to do it, we will do it. But we think we've got enough capacity planned that we can do that plus get down to the 3 times leverage that we're talking about. So we're in pretty good shape with that.","Tom, do you want to pick up the other piece?","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Hi, Bill. So on the realignment, the feedback from both the sales team and our customers have been very positive. Obviously, our customers really were excited by the opportunity, particularly on the vascular access side where they saw the power of those two portfolios really helping to meet their needs from one partner, right, the ability to provide short and long-term vascular access, be it peripheral catheters, midlines or PICCs.","And so, putting those in one business, we have a program what we call optimal vascular access where we help and we're developing more tools and we'll be working on evidence generation around the power of our portfolio to help prevent bloodstream infections, to help optimize length of stay for the patient and for the caregivers that are inserting that and managing that. It can be quite costly. From a side effect, obviously, bloodstream infections, but also just the longer you can keep that site active and dwelling is very important, particularly in some of the longer care patients like those undergoing cancer treatment.","Same thing holds true on the surgery side. Our teams are very excited about that realignment. Of course, we had a surgery group come in from CareFusion who was put in our Med Management business, and so, they felt a little bit out of home. They actually feel very much at home now moving into a group that wakes up and thinks surgery every day of the week.","And so, there's efficiencies and effectiveness opportunities from that combination. A good example of it would be the ChloraPrep team who primarily goes into ORs and calls on surgeons now in the surgery group, great opportunity ex-U.S. where Bard has had teams calling on surgeons in Europe. BD never had that in the past. They're now \u2013 as part of one of the first areas of revenue synergies that we're investing in is getting those products into more surgery reps in Europe now and starting to expand the use of those products to prevent surgical site infections as an example.","So overall, we're hearing very positive feedback. But we're also being very staged in the way that we do that integration, right? We're not looking to just suddenly push the portfolios together through one common sales team everywhere. We're being very staged in the way that we plan and think that through so that we prevent any dissynergies.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Two questions. First for Chris, and then, a bigger picture one for you, Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Chris, I just want to make sure that I'm not missing anything on gross margin or I'm understanding the guidance. On gross margin, just a couple aspects (01:06:58). You talked about the 80 bps of drag in the guidance from currency. A couple things, included in that was dispensing, how much was the dispensing?","And then, just looking at it, I'm sure I'm not thinking about it correctly. I know there are a lot of moving pieces, but if I just over-simplistically take the Bard gross margin and the BD gross margin and weight them, annualized basis, that looks like 58%, 59% kind of gross margin range. You're guiding to 56%, 57%. Okay, you only have nine months, that's not a full year. But that feels extra conservative. Am I thinking about this correctly? Is it the Gore royalty? Just a little more color if you would on the right way to think about it.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So your point there was that Gore royalty does have an impact. The impact of dispensing is about 40 basis points. The Gore royalty hits you by about 30 basis points on top of that. And don't forget you only have Bard only for the three quarters, so that doesn't give you the full benefit. So we won't get that.","Initially, what we were saying is that Bard would impact us by 300 basis points or so for a full year. So you have to discount that back to three quarters. So when you have all those ins and outs, that's what you come up to with the guidance that we gave you.","As we talk about that flowing down, that flows down to operating margin as well, and we're looking at 200 to 250 basis points in FY 2018 and that will basically give us about 700 basis points over the last several years. And then, going back to our initial guidance, we talked about 200 basis points a year in the next two years, so another 400 basis points through 2020. So when you add all that up, it's about 1,100 basis points from the period beginning back in, I guess, 2015 through 2020, so in five years, 1,100 basis points. So we feel good about that.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And Vince, I hate to ask you already where the upside drivers might come from. I mean I think you've given us realistic even perhaps conservative guidance, but do the upside drivers as you work hard to make all this happen over the next year or three come from faster debt paydown, more cost cutting, pipeline upside? I know you're excited about the Bard pipeline, the benefits of the now even larger portfolio as you meet with customers. How are you thinking about it? Thank you so much.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes, and thanks, Rick. I'm going to start back with both cores on both businesses look strong. We came into this year with a good pipeline, and we're making good progress on that pipeline on the BD side. And I just walk you through the Bard side. So I feel very good about that. As Tom walked through the revenue synergies, I think we've got a good plan there.","The second piece in terms of taking this into more geographies, I think, could be a further upside for us. That's not where we're starting \u2013 that's not our primary focus, but there are geographies, Latin America and other parts of Asia where we think it'll take a little longer to get it going, but we see nice upside there.","And then, we're looking to come back to some of those product launches that we have talked about such as Barricor and whatnot, where we're actually starting to learn. We've got the product out in Europe. So I think there are some upsides there. So those are the kind of things I'm comfortable with. The cost synergy piece, I think, is really well planned at this point in time. So I don't think it comes from more rapid deleveraging. I think it comes from operational effectiveness and implementing what we're talking about here.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hey, Larry.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hey, Larry.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Vince, could you just give some thoughts on sort of how you're thinking about the backdrop for the U.S. market now that you've been through the end of the year in 2017 and looking into 2018?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, Larry. So I think it's a really interesting question that you're asking. We started last year talking about this, and we basically said that we see this as a stable marketplace, number one. Number two that maybe there's a little bit of cyclicality now built into the marketplace because of high deductible plans. I think that's going on. But in addition, of course, we had the flu.","But when I look at the U.S. market, I don't see any big negative impacts from the changes that have been made in terms of healthcare reform and whatnot, the Affordable Care Act, impacting a very small piece of the population. We'll have to see what they're doing in terms of going forward. But on the capital side, we're seeing continued focus on spending the capital that has actually got a real return for them in terms of improving productivity in the hospitals, which is what we're doing.","So at the end of the day, I would say U.S., stable, and for us, strong from a capital standpoint. We don't see any real issues there. We've seen Europe come back and bounce back nicely, especially on the Life Sciences side of the business in the Diagnostic area. The focus on funding in automation and those sorts of things has been good.","The two places that I would comment on, China was strong this quarter and we expect it to continue to be strong and, of course, that's both sides of the business. The one big change from last year is EMA. Where EMA has come back, it's a little stronger than we normally would expect just from the timing of tenders this year, but it is once again growing for us. So all-in-all, good from a market standpoint; Latin America, pretty stable like it was last year.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Terrific. And then, perhaps just for Tom, I just wanted to come back to IV solutions and really the two parts of the question are, is Fresenius continuing to expand its manufacturing capacity for IV solutions that can be imported into the U.S.? And then, I guess the second part of the question is if you have to sort of look at what capacity they have today and ability to supply you, is that sort of in line with where we were at the start of the fiscal year? Better? Worse? Just trying to calibrate that a little bit.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, thanks, Larry. So we obviously don't comment on Fresenius' specific capacity nor their capacity plans. But I would say that we're very pleased with the relationship. The capacity that \u2013 and our supply as part of our partnership is very much in line with our expectations, and we continue to work with them very collaboratively on the long-term capacity planning to serve the U.S. market.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Terrific. Thanks, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hey, Vijay.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thanks for squeezing me in. So maybe one on pipeline and one clarification. So the pipeline question, I think I heard you say the pen program on the Diabetes side was stopped and you're investing on the patch pump side. So maybe could you talk about sort of how the decision was made or why stopping the pen? And I thought on the BTK side, the DCB, below-the-knee trial, we were supposed to have an interim look. Did we have that interim look or any thoughts on that would be helpful?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So Tom will take both of those.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Right.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I think we've got some pretty good rationale on the pen side of things.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Hi, Vijay, this is Tom. So on the pen side, as you know, we've been working on that program, and as we just routinely look at all of our projects in our portfolio, we made a decision that due to the nearer term commercial opportunity for that first generation product that we wanted to redeploy those resources to really double down on the smart Swatch. And by the way, when we had originally shown Swatch, it was not necessarily smart at launch, we can also accelerate (01:15:41) work, so the product that we're launching is smart and will have well over 10,000 patient days now of Swatch worn by patients delivering insulin by the time of launch. So that's a significant acceleration in terms of real world data that we'll have versus some of the original plans.","When it comes to BTK, so of course, it is a blinded study, so we personally, of course, do not look at that data until the study is completed. I would say that just to give a little bit more insight there, so we stopped the enrollment in the trial, but there still will be six-month follow-up as part of the trial that's planned. So think about by the end of August, the last patients would be completed for their follow-up. And then, we would end up preparing for submission at the very end of the calendar year. But because of it is a blinded, we do not \u2013 management does not see the data.","As you think about when we might be able to present some interim data, obviously, because it's blinded, we're not going to see the data until the follow-up is completed. But we do anticipate the results will be presented after the PMA submission, but at this time, the study remains ongoing and in follow-up.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","That's helpful, Tom. And Chris, maybe one quick one on the divestitures. Can you quantify what the magnitude was?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Divestitures.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","In the divestitures?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Yes.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","The two are about $50 million in total.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thank you, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","In revenue.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","In revenues.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Yes. Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Thanks, Vijay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to China and in the context of your revenue synergy discussion, you're guiding to I think you said 15% growth which is above the 11% that you did for Becton standalone in the fiscal first quarter.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Is that just the combination of the two companies and the strong momentum and, obviously, Bard, a little bit faster? Or is there any early revenue synergy baked into that?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","No, that's pretty much straight forward.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. That's straight math. No revenue synergies on top of that to get to the mid-teens.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then, the second question that I had was on the AV access market opportunity. I think Bard had talked about a $250 million kind of market opportunity there. Is that how you see it now that you have a little bit of time with the launch commercial?","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","We still see it as that same view from Bard. Actually, the uptake in the first few quarters post-launch has been very much in line with expectations. It's off to a great start and no change in that perspective in terms of the long-term opportunity.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, Matt.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I was hoping to follow up on that kind of same line of thinking. With the combination of Bard, in the past, you had talked about the potential for a lot of those revenue synergies to come from geographic expansion in the future. So I guess the core of my question is I want to understand what you think the sustainability of that kind of emerging market growth is in the kind of the three-year plan of the Bard-Becton combo.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. We feel very good about it is what I would say. I think what you heard us talk about is there is some immediate things that we can go after with fast payback. So we're starting there. And then, Tom mentioned as he went through this some more money going into other geographies. And so, we still see it that way. In China, of course, it's \u2013 Bard has been focused on, I'll call it, the leading hospitals, the top tier. We see the opportunity to accelerate driving into Tier 2. We think we've got more work to do to plan that out, but we haven't changed our opinion on that. And so, that would be one of the highest priorities, then, the rest of Asia, and then, Latin America. That's the way we're thinking about it. So the answer to that question is absolutely yes.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then, I wanted to ask about CareFusion versus Bard. It struck me that...","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...CareFusion deal has worked out really well for you guys and...","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...now, you're guiding to $350 million in synergies.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","It's a similar size to Bard in terms of revenue, but can you compare and contrast kind of the synergy opportunities between the two, and then, what we've learned from CareFusion that could apply to Bard?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. I think in many ways, they are similar synergy opportunities as I talked about before. The public company costs and the procurement initiatives are very similar. And you could say that the manufacturing and the distribution would be the same kind of effort.","What I would say, though, is we have the benefit of having the infrastructure in place that just is coming to the conclusion of integrating CareFusion. Know how to do this. We hit the ground running. So it's \u2013 we're not trying to build the team to go after it. It's already been done. And that second bucket that I talked about is based upon a lot of the infrastructure we put in as part of CareFusion and took the opportunity to do that. So that's helpful as well.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just on the guidance, last quarter, I think you had mentioned that there could be a potential impact from Puerto Rico that could hit later in the year. I was just wondering if you were still anticipating any sort of impact from Puerto Rico from a cost perspective.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Sure, Kristen. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we did \u2013 just to remind everybody, last time, we didn't include it in our guidance, but we said it could be as much as $40 million of revenue and flow down to as much as 1% on EPS. If you remember the timing of when we did that, we were still running on generators. The plants weren't backed up yet.","So because of the efforts of a lot of folks, particularly our associates in Puerto Rico and as well as a number of other associates around the world, we got those plants back up and running. They're off generator, although intermittent still, but we don't see the impact. Although on the BD side, we will see some impact. It's smaller and included in our guidance as just one of the many puts and takes, so nowhere near the amounts that we had quantified.","And then, on the Bard side, a little bit different. They felt the impact immediately, and they felt it in their fourth quarter. It was right in line with what they had guided to, which was about $30 million of revenue impact, and it came in just a tad higher than that, but right in line with what they had expected, and now, that's behind us. So as we combine as the new company, there is no impact from Puerto Rico in the Bard side going forward.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, they were also having some supply disruptions within their biosurgery business. Is that still ongoing or is that expected to be resolved in I think their latest guidance (01:23:16)?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through August 9, 2012, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at (800) 585-8367 for domestic calls and (404) 537-3406 for international calls, using conference ID 96886040.","[Operator Instructions] Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are David Elkins, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President; and Tom Polen, President of Diagnostics Systems.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As we stated in our press release, we were pleased with our third quarter results, which were in line with our expectations.","Growth was driven by our BD Medical and BD Diagnostics segments, and we continue to experience strong growth in international safety and emerging markets. We believe that our revenue and earnings growth this quarter demonstrate that our strategy implementation is on track. We're seeing improved performance in the back half of the fiscal year, as we expected and outlined for you earlier this year.","We continue to face challenges in our Biosciences business in the U.S., which was in line with our expectations. The Biosciences business continues to be impacted by an uncertain research spending environment and lack of overall demand for instruments and research re-agents. In other areas of our business, we see utilization in the U.S. as stable but constrained, with some uncertainty in Europe due to continued macroeconomic challenges.","Overall, we believe that our results this quarter continue to highlight the benefits of our diversified portfolio, with softness in 1 segment being offset by strength in our other 2 segments. We also continue to see a positive impact from our new product launches in addition to growth from the Accuri, Carmel and KIESTRA acquisitions.","We recently announced our plans to acquire Safety Syringes, Inc., SSI, a privately held company that specializes in the development of passive anti-needlestick devices for prefillable syringes. This transaction is subject to regulatory review and is expected to close by the end of the fiscal year. This acquisition will nicely complement our Pharmaceutical Systems unit and our safety-engineered products, and it is well aligned with BD's strategy of applying technology in clinical knowledge to make healthcare more effective, efficient and safe. We believe that BD's expertise, in conjunction with Safety Syringes' portfolio, will enable innovative safety technology development and will bring forth the next generation of safety-engineered prefillable syringes.","SSI's latest annual sales were about $30 million, with a compound annual growth rate of about 10% over the past 3 years. Once the acquisition is complete, revenues will be accounted for under our Pharmaceutical Systems unit.","Based on our results year-to-date, we are now guiding currency-neutral revenue growth to be about 4%, the higher end of our previously communicated range. We are reaffirming our currency-neutral EPS growth of 4% to 5% even as we continue to invest in new products and absorb costs from our recent acquisitions.","On Slide 5, we've outlined our third quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. The results of our Discovery Labware business, excluding Advanced Bioprocessing, have been reclassified to discontinued operations. David will go through this later in his remarks.","Total company revenues were solid, increasing by 4.9%. Fully diluted EPS came in at $1.52, [indiscernible] and 9.7% over the [indiscernible]. For the 9 months year-to-date results, revenue growth was 4.1%; EPS of $3.95 increased by 1%.","Now I'd like to turn things over to David for a more detailed discussion of our third quarter financial performance.","David V. Elkins","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by discussing the key financial highlights for the third quarter. As Vince stated, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations. We continue to proceed with the sale of our Discovery Labware unit. Its results have been reclassified as discontinued operations. I will provide some more detail around this on the next slide.","As we outlined for you on our last earnings call, we saw sequential improvements in our gross profit and operating margins as we move past the difficult comparisons we faced in the first half of the year. As Vince mentioned, we are raising the bottom end of the total year currency-neutral revenue growth guidance to about 4%. We are reaffirming our currency-neutral EPS growth guidance of 4% to 5% even as we increase investments in new products and absorbed the costs from our recent acquisitions.","On a reported basis, we expect EPS to be in the -- between $5.33 and $5.38 for the total year. This reflects the reclassification of Discovery Labware unit and the anticipated effects of unfavorable currency translation. Our updated guidance range assumes a euro exchange rate of $1.23 in the fourth quarter, as well as further strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Brazilian real and Indian rupee.","Additionally, during the third quarter, we completed about $250 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've completed approximately $1.25 billion of our estimated $1.5 billion share repurchase program.","On Slide 8, I'll walk you through our third quarter revenue and EPS results that highlight the impact of the pending Discovery Labware divestiture. Including Discovery Labware, revenues increased 4.8%, and fully diluted EPS came in at $1.59 per share. This was an increase of 9.3% over the prior period. Revenue growth from continuing operations, excluding Discovery Labware, was 4.9% for the third quarter. EPS of $1.52 increased by 9.7%. Excluding the results of Discovery Labware, our revenue and EPS growth improved during the quarter.","Now let's move to Slide 9, where we review our revenue growth by segment, which I'll speak to on a currency-neutral basis. As I just mentioned, revenue growth was 4.9% for the total company on a continuing operations basis. Pricing erosion in the quarter was about 70 basis points. This is in line with our expectations as we move past the difficult comparisons in the first half of the year.","BD Medical third quarter revenues increased 6.4%. This segment's growths was driven by positive results across all 3 units. Diabetes Care growth of 9% was driven by continued strong sales of pen needles and a favorable comparison over the prior year. The favorable comparison in this unit contributed about 2 percentage points of growth. We had a solid quarter in our Medical Surgical Systems unit, with strong performance coming from our BD PhaSeal product and international sales of safety-engineered products. Pharmaceutical Systems growth was 8.9%, aided by some favorable timing of orders. The favorable timing of orders contributed about 4 percentage points of growth. The aforementioned items contributed about 1.4 percentage points to BD's Medical revenue growth. For the 9-month year-to-date results, the Medical segment grew 4.8%.","BD Diagnostics third quarter revenues increased 4.7%. Growth in this segment was driven by Preanalytical Systems, which benefited from solid sales in safety-engineered products and continued strength in our Women's Health and Cancer. For the first 9 months, BD Diagnostics grew 4.3%.","BD Biosciences revenue came in at 0.2%, with solid international growth being offset by declines in our U.S. business. For the 9-month year-to-date results, our Biosciences segment grew 1.3%.","Moving to Slide 10. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the third quarter. As Vince stated, we see the environment in the U.S. as stable but constrained. Overall, BD's reported U.S. revenues were up 1.1% versus prior year.","Growth in our Medical segment was about 3%. This was driven by strong growth in our Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care and partially offset by difficult pricing comparisons in our Medical Surgical Systems unit. This is in line with our expectations and similar to the results that we discussed last quarter.","Growth in our Diagnostics segment was 0.8%, driven by solid sales of Preanalytical Systems, which grew about 2%. Diagnostics Systems unit declined about 0.5%, partially due to a tough environment in our Microbiology business and softness in our GeneOhm HAI platform. Our new HAI platform, BD MAX, is approved for MRSA by the FDA in early July, and we expect our sales trajectory to improve as we continue to build out the platform on this menu.","Biosciences sales in the U.S. for the third fiscal quarter declined 6.4%. We continue to see weakness in the U.S. research market, as well as a tougher competitive environment in research re-agent sales. We believe there will continue to be uncertainty in the U.S. research market until after the elections in November.","Also, we continue to experience lower demand for high-end instruments in Cell Analysis due to continued funding constraints in the pharmaceutical and biotech research area, as well as the academic markets.","International revenue grew 7.8% currency-neutral in the quarter, with growth coming from all 3 segments. The Medical and Diagnostics segments both grew 8.5%. Revenue growth in these segments was primarily driven by strong sales of safety products and continued growth in the emerging markets. Biosciences grew at 3.8% in the quarter. Growth in this segment was negatively impacted by a tough comparison to the prior year period, as customers were pushed for the second quarter -- customers' orders were pushed from the second quarter to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 due to Japan's tsunami. This difficult comparison negatively impacted Biosciences' growth by about 2.4%. We continue to see positive results in the Biosciences segment outside the United States.","For the 9-month year-to-date results, reported U.S. revenues grew about 1%, the Medical segment increasing 3%, Diagnostics growing about 1%, and Biosciences declining 9%. Total international revenue growth was a strong 6% currency-neutral, with Medical growing 5.8%, Diagnostics about 7%, and Biosciences growing 6.6%.","Moving to total safety on Slide 11, which includes the PhaSeal acquisition. Currency-neutral sales increased 7.4% to about $500 million in the quarter. International sales were up 15.7% on a currency-neutral basis, with Western Europe and emerging markets both growing double digits. Medical Safety sales grew almost 10%, driven by Infusion Therapy products and a PhaSeal product. Diagnostics Safety sales increased about 5%, driven by a range of safety-engineered products. For the 9-month year-to-date results, Safety growth was almost 9% on a currency-neutral basis. This was due to a combination of strong international growth of 16.7% and a growth rate of 3.6% in the U.S.","On Slide 12, we review our revenue growth in the third quarter. Our reported growth rate was 1.5%. Performance contributed 4.9% to growth, off by 3.4% of unfavorable currency translation. Acquisitions contributed about 80 basis points of growth in the quarter.","Moving on to Slide 13 and looking at our gross margin, we experienced about a 50-basis-point decline, which was in line with our expectations. Operating performance was impacted by the negative effects of pricing, software amortization in our Biosciences business and product mix. Favorable currency translation contributed about 20 basis points. From the beginning of the fiscal year, gross profit has improved 130 basis points.","Slide 14 recaps the third quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. As discussed earlier, third quarter revenue grew about 5%. Our gross margin of 52.2% improved sequentially as we move past the difficult comparisons that impacted our results in the first half of the year.","Moving down the income statement line, SSG&A increased 3.2%, primarily due to increased investments in emerging markets, our EVEREST SAP implementation and expenses related to our Carmel, KIESTRA and Accuri acquisitions. Excluding the costs from these incremental investments, our year-over-year SG&A costs would have declined. This highlights our continued cost discipline management. R&D increased about 2%, which is in line with our expectations, due to continued investment in our new product portfolio. Our operating income increased 4% as we start experiencing positive sequential improvements in our gross profit and more normalized levels of SSG&A spend. Since the first quarter of the fiscal year, our operating income margin has improved 430 basis points.","Now I'd like to turn to Slide 15, which review our changes in guidance from May, which includes the Discovery Labware unit, and our updated outlook, which excludes the Discovery Labware unit. As you can see, we've increased our revenue guidance to about 4%, which is at the higher end of our previously communicated range. We now expect EPS to be between $5.33 and $5.38. This reduction reflects about $0.29 from the pending sale of Discovery Labware, and about [indiscernible] from unfavorable currency translation.","On a [indiscernible] we are reaffirming our previous guidance of 4% to 5% despite the increased costs from our recent acquisitions. Gross profit margin remains in line with our previously communicated range of 51.3% to 51.5%.","Our SSG&A expenses increased about 40 basis points. This is due to the divestment of our Discovery Labware, and some allocated overhead costs remain in continuing operations. For the total year, we expect SSG&A growth to be about 7%, in line with our original expectations.","R&D spending remains in line at about 6% of sales. Our operating income range of 20.4% to 20.6% now reflects about 50 basis points from divestment of Discovery Labware, as the aforementioned SSG&A overhead costs remain within continuing operations. We expect tax rate improvement due to the Discovery Labware divestiture. This was predominately a U.S.-based business. We now expect our tax rate to be between 24.8% and 25%.","Our cash flow remains strong, and we expect about $1.6 billion in operating cash flow for the fiscal year. This reflects the divestment of Discovery Labware and the operating cash associated with that unit. Including Discovery Labware, our cash projection is in line with our original guidance of $1.7 billion. As a reminder, about 80% of our cash balance is outside the U.S. at the end of the fiscal quarter.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will walk you through our results in emerging markets and also provide you with an update on the product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thanks, David. Moving on to Slide 17, I would like to highlight our emerging market results. We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, which accounted for approximately 22.8% of our total revenues in the third quarter. Emerging market revenues grew at 10.6%. We continue to see double-digit growth in a number of key markets, with China growing at 19.7% in the quarter, which is in line with our expectations.","We are very pleased with Safety revenue growth in emerging markets, which was up about 18% over the prior year. We are encouraged by the positive results in Europe, as the market continues to convert to safety-engineered products.","We have many exciting opportunities in our pipeline. I'd like to review our key products that have launched year-to-date.","In our Medical segment, we launched the BD PentaPoint 5-bevel pen needle. This is the first and only pen needle with a patented 5-bevel needle tip, which is clinically demonstrated to improve injection comfort in patients when compared with the current 3-bevel pen needles.","In our Diagnostics segment, we launched the BD MAX MRSA assay in the U.S. in early June. The MRSA assay is an easy-to-use cost-effective method to identify patients with this deadly superbug, and we believe it will support better outcomes for patients and a safer hospital environment. This is the second test cleared this year by the FDA on the BD MAX System. This milestone represents further confirmation of BD's commitment to rapidly expand our menu, enabling laboratories to offer a broad range of molecular tests that meet both their current and future clinical needs.","In our Biosciences segment, we launched the 6-color BD FACSJazz Cell Sorting System, which incorporates customer input from a 2011 global early access program. As a result, we made refinements to enhance the usability and ease of use. This system has many innovative features that simplify sorting, such as digital controls and factory-optimized settings for the precise isolation of cells.","Moving on to Slide 19. In the Diagnostics segment, the U.S. launch of C. difficile on BD MAX remains on track for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. Our BD Viper molecular platforms remains positioned to a best-in-class lab efficiency and performance for high-volume screening assays.","In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we plan to launch the Trichomonas assay on this platform in the EU. The Trichomonas launch in the U.S. is expected in the back half of fiscal year 2013. Our launch of the bench-top BD Viper LT and GC\/CT assay remains on track for fiscal year 2013 globally, followed by the launch of our HPV genotyping assay on Viper LT x U.S.","Along with the launch of the Viper LT, our front-end automation system for Women's Health is expected in the beginning of fiscal year 2013 in the EU and later in the year in the U.S., which will be marketed globally under the brand name Totalys. This launch is delayed by 1 quarter.","I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our SurePath Plus R&D program, which we have decided to stop. We recently completed the analysis of the midpoint clinical trial data, which included samples for more than 3,500 patients. The data showed that SurePath Plus delivered a significant increase in sensitivity as compared to traditional liquid-based cytology test. However, we also saw a slight decrease in specificity, which was not within our expectations. Based on a thorough review of our portfolio strategy and analysis of the midpoint clinical trial data, we have subsequently made the decision to stop the SurePath Plus R&D program.","Our overall Women's Health cervical cancer strategy remains very much intact, and we do not see the decision regarding SurePath Plus changing the strategic direction of that business. Our SurePath cytology platforms continue to be recognized as a leading product for cervical cancer detection. When combined with our FocalPoint automated imaging system, we can provide customers with the advantage of over 20% higher cancer detection as compared to manually read cytology slides and the only automated imaging system capable of testing conventional and liquid-based cytology samples.","Over the next year, we plan to launch a series of new products, which leverage our expertise in cytology and molecular diagnostics. This includes the 2013 launch of our previously mentioned Totalys automation system, which will automate sample processing from our SurePath sample vials and manage chain of custody across our suite of molecular and cytology systems. This will complement our upcoming launch of the Viper LT and our fully automated HPV genotyping assay.","Now moving on to Biosciences. As we have mentioned in previous earnings calls, we have 2 new CD4 analyzers launching in the near term. In fiscal year 2014, we plan to launch a CD4 analyzer that is designed for mid- and smaller-volume laboratories in both emerging markets and the developing world. This is delayed from our original launch expectations. The other CD4 analyzer is a more portable point-of-care instrument targeted towards rural clinics in the developing world. We expect to launch it in fiscal year 2014.","Now we'll continue to provide you with updates on our products and programs as we continue to make progress on them.","Moving to Slide 20. Before we open the call to questions, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our discussion today. We're pleased with our third quarter results and year-to-date results. We saw solid growth on the top line despite the headwinds we faced in our Biosciences business in the U.S. and the challenging macroeconomic climate. We continue to see good organic growth in addition to growth coming from our recent acquisitions.","As we expected and outlined for you earlier in the year, we have now moved past the tough comparisons that occurred in fiscal year 2011, which impacted our results in the first half of the year. As we move past those tough comparisons, we saw a nice improvement in our profitability as we continue to execute against our efficiency programs. And we continue to be encouraged by our performance in emerging markets and international safety sales.","Our pipeline remains largely intact with our expectations. And while we are disappointed by the discontinuation of the SurePath Plus R&D program, we believe that our Women's Health and Cancer strategy remains very much intact. We believe our results year-to-date highlight the benefits of a diversified portfolio given the challenging macro economic backdrop.","We are committed to delivering on our current neutral -- currency-neutral guidance of about 4% on the top line and 4% to 5% on the bottom line. Lastly, we will continue to execute against our strategy of investing and innovating for growth, and we continue to develop value to our shareholders and customers globally.","Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A question for David just initially. Can you give us an update on your thoughts on the cash from Discovery Labware and how you plan to redeploy it? And can you also give us some initial thoughts on the fiscal '13 outlook, specifically underlying revenue growth and margin expansion, given some of the headwinds such as the device tax?","David V. Elkins","Yes, just a couple of things. One, on Discovery Labware, as we've been guiding, next year we're going to do share repurchases between $400 million and $600 million, and that contemplates the sale of Discovery Labware. As we said previously, the net proceeds of that are about $500 million. As you start thinking about fiscal year '13, Amit, it's just a couple of things. One is if you think about some of the headwinds that we'll have, we have the device tax that comes in next year. We said that's about $55 million. Currency, we're anticipating the headwind from where we are this year. This year, we'll probably average, versus the euro, about $1.30, and we have strengthening costs; other currencies as well, as you know, Indian rupee, as well as the Brazilian real, so we anticipate that, that will continue as we go into next year. And then next year, we have the implementation of our SAP EVEREST in North America, which next year is going to be at peak. As far as the tailwinds, and we'll update you on this in November when we provide guidance, but our recent acquisitions are going to become neutral to EPS as we get into next year, and that should be accretive on an EPS basis overall. Also, if you recall our ReLoCo program, we got about $50 million to $60 million next year coming through on that. In ReLoCo II, we'll start to see some benefits on that as we get into fiscal year '13. And we'll also see the benefits of some of these new product launches. We expect the launch of about 10 new products by the end of fiscal year '12. So we've got some good tailwinds. I don't know if there's anything else Vince wants to add.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, just to clarify on the acquisition, since David said they're becoming neutral to EPS. But on a cash basis, they're accretive to EPS in 2013.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up on the Diagnostics business. I was hoping Tom Polen could just elaborate on STD, GeneOhm and TriPath's performance in the quarter.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure.","Tom Polen","This is Tom Polen. Just [indiscernible] that question. So to start with TriPath. TriPath in the quarter, we grew just over 8%, and that's consistent with the trends that we've seen in the past, where the U.S. is relatively flat, driven by flat Pap volumes overall. And x U.S., we continue to see solid double-digit growth as we're upgrading customers from conventional Pap to our liquid-based cytology and as developing countries continue to expand access to the cervical cancer screening. We switch over to GenOhm and STD. GenOhm, we saw a 0.9% decline in the quarter, driven, as David mentioned earlier, by continued MRSA competitiveness and pricing pressure. C. diff, we are continuing to see strong double-digit growth but off of a smaller base than MRSA for now. Of course, we have recently received FDA approval of MRSA on MAX, and we are focused on driving new MAX placements to accelerate our growth in that HAI space. And we expect that's going to take a few quarters for you to see that ramp. But we're getting very, very positive customer feedback as we're launching that at this time. On the high-volume STD-screening business, we saw flat performance this quarter, primarily impacted by a difficult comparison to last year, which is when we launched our new XTR chemistry on the Viper platform, and we had most of our very large customers pull in stock last quarter as part of converting up to that XTR chemistry. If you look at a full year basis on our STD business, it's up about 3.5% year-to-date through Q3. With a few points higher than 3.4% volume, that's being partially offset from pricing pressures that I think we see across the board in that high-volume screening market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Wood with Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So Vince, would love to hear, after you guys have ramped up this corporate development group under Bill Rhodes for a couple of quarters, where is that program in terms of putting in place a more standardized process for evaluating and executing deals? And I'd love to hear where you view the current pipeline in terms of number of opportunities, size of opportunities, as we kind of move into fiscal '13.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. I think actually we're making very good progress on standardizing our evaluation process. We always had a pretty good standardized evaluation process. But also, now the -- as we do these deals, the due diligence process and the integration process, I think that's probably the area we're making most progress on. And as David mentioned in his remarks, we're starting to see some good progress on those recent acquisitions that we've done. In terms of the size of the deal, we're still focused on plug-in acquisitions, so we really don't have any change going on there. But working with the businesses, it's not that we've added a large number of people to corporate development. It's a couple of piece -- people that are working on these standardized processes and working directly with the businesses and it's all business units to identify the acquisitions. The other thing that we've done is just extended that capability internationally. And as you've seen in the last couple of deals that we've done and have international deals. So that's kind of the overview of where we're at, and we have -- and we continue to have a good pipeline to evaluate.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. My follow-up for David. Is it possible at this point to call out the ERP impact kind of incrementally in '13 versus '12? You probably have some expenses going away and depreciation coming in, so I'd love to hear if you've got kind of a rolled-up view on that ERP impact next year.","David V. Elkins","What we have said is we're spending about $100 million this year on the ERP system, and that's been increasing about 20% a year. So as we look at '13, it will be our peak year with our North American implementation. But again, we'll give you those exact numbers once we do our guidance for fiscal year '13.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","David, I wonder if you talked about a dynamic in the next year. It sounds like, based on Vince's comments, the business development activity is more incremental over the next 2 years and sort of a radical change. And it sounds like you've dialed back the buy back next year sort of over $1 billion to something like $400 million to $600 million. So I guess, I wonder why not get more aggressive on the buyback, and is it too early, given some of the headwinds and tailwinds, to start talking about a dividend acceleration in BD.","David V. Elkins","Just A couple of things on that, David. Good question. First is the buyback that we did over the past 2 years was driven by the bond offerings that we've done. If you take a look at where our cash is generated, the majority of our cash continues to be generated outside the United States. And as I said earlier, about 80% of our cash balance at the end of the quarter is outside the U.S. So the cash that we generate within the U.S. pretty much covers the dividend. And if you think about the share repurchases next year, that's pretty much being funded by the sale of the Discovery Labware business. So as we move forward, that's something for you to consider.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, Vince, just talking about the SSI acquisition, I guess, certainly, it was a adjunctive to the business. I guess it wasn't entirely clear to us was. Was the driver of the transaction more the Med\/Surg technology or really was the Pharm Systems technology? And it still wasn't clear if it was Pharm Systems-driven. What specifically does that transaction give you in Pharm Systems that you did not have before?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, Bill Kozy can talk to that, but it definitely was the Pharm Systems segment that was really driving this acquisition, and Bill can talk to -- because it moves us into a new space we weren't in before.","William A. Kozy","David, it's Bill Kozy. Just to add, let's go down the technology side for just a second. We wanted a short-term capability for passive needlestick safety on our Pharm Systems platform. So their technology gives us that chance to move into that right away. And we see, over time, an accelerating customer interest in that type of technology which we did not have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify, David, your comments because the line cut out, or at least mine did. When you were referring to the change in guidance from an EPS perspective over the 2 components between what was Discovery Labware versus FX?","David V. Elkins","Okay, Discovery Labware was $0.29, and FX was $0.04.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And Discovery Labware seems to be a little bit more than what you have been saying. I'm just surprised it's a little higher, as well as the fact that, I guess, you're still absorbing some of the costs within the operating side.","David V. Elkins","Sorry, Kristen. Just coming back to your previous question, were you referring to the quarter or were you referring to the full year?","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","No, the full year guidance, I'm sorry.","David V. Elkins","Okay, I was referring to the full year.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, that's what I was referring to [ph].","David V. Elkins","Okay, you got it. Okay.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm just looking at the $0.29. I think in the past you had kind of quantified it closer to $0.25 that it would contribute to the full year, and I'm just surprised that it's $0.29 versus the $0.25, especially I think you had mentioned within SSG&A you were still absorbing some costs that weren't allocated into that business. Is that how I should think about it?","David V. Elkins","Yes, 2 things. One is better performance than we anticipated was one of the drivers. If you remember, we originally guided about $0.25, as you had said. The better performance in the business is one of the things. As we strip that out, it wound up doing better in the second half of the year than we originally anticipated, as most of our businesses have. Also, I think the second thing is we go through and refined all of the allocated overhead costs. That was the second thing, that some of the costs that are remaining with the business are a little higher than we had originally estimated. And as we move into next year and once this deal becomes finalized, we'll be able to go after those stranded costs and look to remove those costs next year. Obviously, we're not going to do that until the deal is finalized.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry if I missed this, but did you quantify what the stranded costs were within SG&A?","David V. Elkins","Yes, the stranded cost for the quarter was about $0.03 to EPS or about $8 million. For the full year, it's around $0.10.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so presumably, as we go into 2013, those get worked down but don't necessarily go away immediately?","David V. Elkins","Again, we'll update you in November when we give guidance for the full fiscal year.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then, I guess, also just kind of going back to some of the comments you had made on 2013. I guess, should we think about just the med tech tax as something that is likely just to get passed through and have just a full impact on your earnings side? Or would you be looking to try to offset that through restructuring, cost savings initiatives, price increases?","David V. Elkins","Yes, really, on that one, it remains as we previously talked about. We're going to look to offset some of that as we can, but that's going to be incorporated into our overall guidance as we look into -- as we provide guidance in November on fiscal year '13. I don't know if Vince has anything to add.","Vincent A. Forlenza","As David said, we'll look to do what we can, but we're also going to fund our strategic initiatives. So it's going to be a balancing act that we're going to be doing. We're looking at all elements of our cost structure for next year in trying to drive our efficiency programs. But that, as we know, provides significant headwind.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The pension expense may also be a headwind, is that fair to say?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Of course. Yes.","David V. Elkins","Yes, that's fair to say.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Just 2 quick questions for me. The first is a bigger picture. Vince, I think you've had an initiative going on there at BD on the talent and culture side for a couple of years now. I'm just thinking now you're getting closer to about 1 year in your role as CEO and just -- can you maybe just give us an update of how that's going and kind of what -- maybe what has changed or how you expect that to impact the business?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, you're right, we have. And the first thing I would say is that we're driving more -- the more global nature of the culture. And we've made some changes so that, as we look to the future, that we give a more full voice, I would say, in terms of the regions and especially the emerging markets. And so that's #1 on our list. And it's not just a cultural change piece, but it's also a capability piece that we're building around the globe. And that is more entrepreneurship, building marketing capability, building government affairs around the globe and, ultimately, R&D. And I've added 2 senior people to my direct reports to get further focus on international. And of course, we see a lot of growth coming from international over the next couple of years. Secondly, we're driving an innovation agenda for the company, and Bill Kozy has been heading this up for me, working with others in the organization. And we see a tremendous excitement around that agenda for the company. And so that's the second piece. And that's married with one other piece I would like to put on the table, which is customer-centricity. We hired a Chief Marketing Officer for the company, and there's a much more intense focus on the customers here. And so what we're doing is we're marrying up this innovation focus with this customer focus, and that dovetails with the global piece of this, the global view of the customers and where we're going. Do I think we're making progress? Absolutely. I think we're making progress. I also think that this is a long journey that you take step by step in terms of building real capability. But we're excited about it.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","That's very helpful. And then if I can just quickly switch to the -- other than the AECC, and there was actually a lot excitement around BD MAX and kind of what its capabilities were going to be. Can you maybe just talk about what your expectations are for that product or business now that it's launched with kind of a more complete test and some of the menu you expect? And maybe also in that environment as well, just on the Diagnostics side, there was a big combination of the competitive front there with Hologic and Gen-Probe. Can you maybe just talk about how you see that changing the competitive environment for you?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. So Tom will do that. I would say, before he makes a remark, that I think we're really taking an innovative approach to menu here, and that's starting to take hold, and Tom can update you on that. So Tom, why don't you start with BD MAX, and then we can talk about Hologic. Thanks.","Tom Polen","Yes, this is Tom Polen. So obviously, right now, with the launch of really the first major assay in a major market, U.S. being by far and away the largest market for Molecular Diagnostics, MRSA is our first. We had GBS approved last quarter, a relatively small assay. MRSA represents the first large assay we have in MAX in our major markets. So right now, because that just happened a few weeks ago, our focus is on launch of MRSA and MAX. And again, we're seeing some good early traction there that we expect over the next couple of quarters because of the sales cycle there. We'll start seeing that reflected in the performance of that business. We do have, as we've shared in the past multiple times, an aggressive menu for MAX. We've got over 15 assays in the pipeline for MAX. The next assay, as Vince mentioned earlier, to launch will be C. diff, and we are on track to submit that to the FDA later this quarter. We have finished the clinical trial and are preparing the submission now, and that will go in later this quarter. We also are very pleased with the progress on our partner assays. We've put out announcements over the last year regarding 12 assays that are being developed through our partners. And we expect the first of those to begin launching in the EU before the end of this calendar year, and so we'll be making further announcements as those launch dates approach. But we're rapidly seeing menu expansion, particularly outside the U.S., where just because of the CE marking process, we can get to market earlier. So I would ask that probably look at EU as the first sign of where you'll see our significant menu ramps starting to come to the marketplace. So I think hopefully that answers your question.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Hologic.","Tom Polen","Oh, I'm sorry, on Hologic, I know we've commented that on the last quarter as well. No change essentially on the response from last quarter's call. Of course, Gen-Probe has been very publicly in play over the last year, and so the acquisition didn't come as a surprise. We've made our integrated molecular cytology strategy in Women's Health, very clear for some time now, through Totalys and the Viper LT platforms that Vince spoke about earlier. And so we see the move. Hologic makes it clear they see value on a similar approach. We're continuing full speed ahead with our strategy and don't see any specific change to our approach at this point in time.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So David, can you just clarify what the guidance is for the fourth quarter because I think there's some confusion? Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts here with Discovery Labware coming out of it. So what exactly is the 4Q EPS guidance?","David V. Elkins","We didn't guide specifically the fourth quarter as we normally don't, which is provided it for the full year.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, but you've given full year guidance. You have 3 quarters to date, including -- right, including what you just reported in you're divesting Discovery Labware. So the map that we were getting was somewhere in the $1.38 to $1.43 range. Is that right? We also were getting a couple of cents lower than that.","David V. Elkins","Yes, again, we're not providing specific guidance on the quarter. But if you take the full year results, we're at the $5.33 to $5.38, you're going to get into that range.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And is 3 -- I'm sorry, got a few questions, is $3.95 the right number for the 3 quarters to date?","David V. Elkins","Yes, that's the right number.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That is the right apples-to-apples number then?","David V. Elkins","Yes, that's right.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. Can you help me out in a couple of items of the -- How should we think about the FX move and the drop-through to the bottom line? I know you've talked before about 20% to 25% drop-through. Is that the math that you're using to get to the EPS delta for the fourth quarter, just so we can think forward?","David V. Elkins","Yes, it fluctuates from quarter to quarter based upon the individual currency. Some currencies drop through more than others. And as I said earlier on the call, 2 other currencies that really weakened against the dollar was the Indian rupee, as well as the Brazilian real. I think in this last quarter, it was around 30%, but again, that fluctuates quarter to quarter. But if you're in that 25% range, Michael, it's a pretty good number to use from a currency perspective.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I have 2 left clean-ups here. The change in the tax rate for the year, is that because of Discovery Labware? Is it primarily -- how do we think about that? Just trying to get all the pieces right.","David V. Elkins","Yes, it's primarily Discovery Labware. The majority of that business is in the U.S. So it has a high tax rate, over 35%. But also we are continuing to see good movement on our effective tax rate. Two things that drive that: one is the tax planning that we're doing; but two, it's just our mix of business. More of our business comes from outside the United States that helps affect our tax rate.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then last question. With the SurePath Plus decision, do you need to write down any assets from the TriPath acquisition?","David V. Elkins","No.","Vincent A. Forlenza","No, we don't.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A question, Tom, just to follow-up on the BD MAX. Can you talk a little bit about where you're targeting for early customer success with the MAX? Are you looking at new accounts without molecular programs today? Are you looking at kind of where you guys have systems today? Are you going after competitive wins? What's the strategy there?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So I don't know that we want to get too detailed on exactly where we're going, but we think we have obviously, some issues in terms if we want to upgrade our current base, but we think it's attractive to the entire marketplace. We're not going to get real detailed about our tactics on the call.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then you mentioned pricing pressure, particularly I think you said on high-volume STD testing. Can you quantify that? And is that a response to -- so something that you're seeing for home competitors? Are you driving it -- is it U.S. or o U.S. [ph] on that?","Tom Polen","This is Tom Polen. Wouldn't quantify that. I think that's a -- it's been a well-recognized and, I know, a well quoted trend across the industry that STD pricing pressure in the U.S. and Europe are certainly not something that we're necessarily proactively driving ourselves. Leave it at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I guess just a couple of follow-ups on those last couple of questions. As has been well documented since the beginning of the year, there's been the approval of what I think could be characterized as some formidable competitive platforms for molecular, chlamydia, gonorrhea testing and other assays, including PANTHER in the U.S. and the new cobas 4800. Could you just talk about how the introduction of these products, I guess beyond pricing, may impact your ability to get customer switches, just given that it is fairly normal for folks to lock into multiyear re-agent rental contracts? And then I guess my second question, somewhat related, is in our channel checks, the feedback recently has been quite positive on BD MAX. It does seem like there is a lot of excitement around the new MRSA test. Could you just talk about how important that is from a price stabilization standpoint? And if you would, would you characterize how big the opportunity, as you view it, is to convert other competitive open real-time PCR systems, basically to convert others from some of the existing open PCR systems that exist on the market?","Tom Polen","Okay, so this is Tom Polen again. Let's start with MAX, and then I'll circle back on regarding the high throughput side. So I mean, as you said, we are also getting very positive feedback from customers. I don't think we don't want to quantify the size of the opportunity at this point in time. Obviously, that expands in proportion to our menu and as customers continue to get traction on developing their own assays on the system. We are seeing, as you said, customers, particularly starting in Europe, developing a wide range of assays on MAX. We have customers running everything from neuro virus to cystic fibrosis to TB assays that they've developed themselves converted over to homebrew; from homebrew to other open platforms to the MAX. So as we think about positioning of the MAX platform versus the Viper, and as you mentioned, those incoming competitors, so we certainly recognize that MAX is in a unique space versus some of the platforms that you mentioned earlier. MAX is designed for some of the midpoint assays like MRSA C.Diff. But we also have mentioned we have assays like GC\/CT Trich coming to MAX x U.S. later in FY '13 and the U.S. at a later point in time. So we see [indiscernible] has a very unique position [ph]. We have our assays coming on, and we'll have our partner assays coming on board, and it will have customers' assays being ported over from their other open systems, right. And none of the other platforms that you mentioned, I won't repeat them, have that ability to bring that type of portfolio to a single fully automated platform. As we think about our Viper franchise and the competitive dynamics happening there, we certainly recognize that there are new entrants coming into that space. We have a very, very solid platform with our Viper XTR platform, which is fully automated, integrated platform on the market today. We have our next-generation platform, which is our Viper LT, launching in the U.S. and in Europe next year, and that is also a bench-top version. So if you think about the PANTHER, not a bench-top version but -- similar volume throughput of Viper LT but an actual bench top. And then we'll have SDA and PCR on it. And of course, our first PCR assay based on that platform will be the HPV genotyping assay, which we are launching about this time, slightly earlier, next year x U.S. And then we'll be announcing the U.S. launch afterwards. So there we see our future instrument platforms, as well as assay menu expansion, as being key factors in continuing our strong position in that.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So this is Vince just adding on. So if you think about the Viper, because Tom is indicating there are 2 very different business segments here. In the STD space, the Chlamydia and HPV markets are available to us and also the genotyping space there. Now we're seeing on the HAI side, it's going to be the core area for MAX. With MRSA and the C. diff. markets all available to us, that tends to be not the same kind of high-volume as the STD marketplace, the HPV and Chlamydia. And then we're going to expand from there, which is all of the other assays that Tom is talking about in terms of transplant assays and other things, and then this kind of porting on these tests that the labs are doing themselves. So there's a substantial opportunity for us over time.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","All right. That is very helpful. And I guess, if I could sneak in one quick one on -- one more quick one. On the flow cytometry side, clearly, some of the issues there are just funding related and the environment. But beyond that, from a competitive standpoint, are there any -- is there any light at the end of the tunnel? It sounds like part of the issue is just aggressive pricing from competitors. I guess at what point should investors think that, that dynamic becomes less of a headwind for you?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Bill Kozy can talk to that, but from a market standpoint, the U.S. market is going to be constrained till sometime after the elections, and there's an agreement on what the budget is going to be. And I've been down to Capitol Hill talking to Congress about this, but this whole threat of sequestration and our customers not knowing what their funding is going to be. We know we have at least another, probably, at least 9 months of uncertainty because Congress is talking about, well, it'll take 6 months now with the new Congress coming in to figure this all out. So that's a U.S. issue. We're seeing good growth internationally. So in terms of competition, I think, Bill, you feel pretty good about the product line that we have and where we're going with it.","William A. Kozy","Yes, this is Bill Kozy. I think that Vince captured the essence. We're probably paying more attention to the environment and the U.S. government direction at this point in time. That's our biggest gate. Our array of both high-end instruments, the addition of Accuri and the recent launch of FACSJazz and FACSVerse have got us very well positioned in each of those key flow segments. So we feel good about our products. We'll just look to see that environment improve in the time ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Palmer with CLSA.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","David, just want to follow up on the FX question. If we look at emerging markets, you guys had about 23% of revenues from there. Can you maybe just give us a range of how big maybe the big 3: China, India Brazil, are of that 23%?","David V. Elkins","A good way rule of thumb is if you think about the euro, we have about $2 billion in euro sales, which makes up the bulk. It ranges in that 60% to 70% of our foreign currency exposure. Brazilian real is probably the next largest, which is around 15% of our currency exposure. And then the Indian rupee is less than 10%. But that should give you a pretty good idea of the key ones that are driving that currency exposure. And as we saw in the quarter and one of the things we are doing with our guidance is contemplating that the dollar continues to strengthen, get to the bottom end of our range that contemplates that the dollar would continue to strengthen in August and in September.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then one quick follow-up. I guess in terms of China, do you conduct business there in RMB or is it a dollar market?","David V. Elkins","No, in local currency.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And you see that strengthening?","David V. Elkins","Well, China is a bit of a unique situation, so -- since that's really controlled, and that's more of anyone's guess as where that's going to go.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First off, David, just clarify an earlier comment you made on the future buybacks. You did, I think, mention that the cash flow, U.S. cash flow generation, essentially covers the dividend but kind of implied that it doesn't cover the buyback. So how should we read into that as we think about future years, fiscal '14, '15, et cetera.","David V. Elkins","Yes, there's a couple things to keep in mind as we move forward. One is, obviously, any type of tax planning that goes on, as Vince has talked about in previous calls, we have to see what happens with any kind of repatriation of overseas cash. We're not alone in this. This affects a lot of companies. So that's number one. Number two, there's things that we can do continuously. We repatriate funds and pay tax on that year-over-year. So that's an option that we have as we move forward. So those are the 2 main things that really impact the level of cash that we have in the U.S.: tax policy and our ability to repatriate, pay the tax from cash that's overseas.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then just a quick follow-up maybe for Bill or Vince. Can you talk a little bit about what the Pharm Systems pipeline looks like? I guess I'm trying to think of that in context with we got a couple of pretty light flu seasons and just trying to think about what the forward implications of that might be.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So in terms of the revenue, if that's what you're asking and the fact that the business is lumpy, continues to be lumpy, so that's going to happen quarter-to-quarter. In terms of it, if you were asking from a product pipeline, then we're excited about this move into both SAIS, which is self-administration products, and we're starting to see some traction there. And Bill can talk to you about what those products are. And then of course, just move into an additional segment we have not participated in, which is the passive safety segment. So Bill, maybe you want to talk to that a little bit, where we're going with SAIS.","William A. Kozy","This is Bill Kozy. We are starting to get traction, to echo Vince's comment on the autoinjector. And we have a couple generations -- to your portfolio question, we've got a couple of generations of autoinjectors that we expect to launch in the years ahead. This tends to be a little bit more of a mass customization business, where we provide a major pharmaceutical customer with an injector that best matches up with both their patient population, as well as the drug that needs to be delivered. And we actually saw a revenue impact the first time, very, very modest, this last quarter on that area. Now in the core area, to your comment about what's in the pipeline, all of our attention in terms of R&D investment has been 2 categories: it's on biotech and vaccines. And it's a little early to be saying exactly what we intend to do there over the next couple of years, but we'll keep you informed on those product launches as they start to emerge in the 18 to 24 months ahead. Those are the 2 focus areas if you look at our large customer base.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Frelick with Canaccord.","Jeffrey Frelick - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Tom, just a follow-up to your BD MAX menu comment. When would you expect to see the test menu of 15 assays on the platform?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Plain timing. Yes, Tom.","Tom Polen","Over the next 3 years. Sooner than that in Europe, of that time frame in the U.S.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Eric Criscuolo with Mizuho Securities.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","What were the reasons for the sequential decline in interest income and other income?","Vincent A. Forlenza","David can handle that for you.","David V. Elkins","Yes, there's 2 things. One is the interest rate in Brazil. We hold some cash there, and obviously, interest rate has to come down. Also, just to remind everyone, deferred compensation, there's an offset versus our SG&A line, and that's the other big one that's there.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","That was in the other income?","David V. Elkins","That's right. In other income, there's an offset versus our SG&A for deferred compensation. Whenever there's movement in our deferred compensation from a share price perspective on the overall stock market, you have higher costs in SG&A, which is offset in other income.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Okay, well, thank you very much for joining us today. That wraps up our call. We look forward to talking about and wrapping up the year with you on our next call and, of course, giving you the guidance for 2013, which you've been asking about for a long time now. And so we look forward to giving you that clarity. Just to finish up, we had solid revenue growth, underlying of about 4%. We can see good progress on our profitability improvement programs and our product portfolio, and expansion in emerging markets is on track. So thank you very much, and look forward to talking to you again.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

Also, joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administration Officer; Tom Polen, President; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 4; as many of you know \u2013 already know, last week was a very exciting time for us and a pivotal moment in BD's history as we announced the acquisition of C. R. Bard. The combination of BD and Bard represents another major milestone in the strategic transformation of our company.","As a combined company, we believe we will further accelerate and broaden our strategy, create new growth opportunities for both companies, and deliver meaningful long-term value for shareholders. Together we will be uniquely positioned to deliver innovative healthcare solutions that improve both the process of care and the treatment of disease.","We continue to expect the transaction to close in the fall of 2017 and we look forward to updating you along the way as we prepare to welcome Bard's team of talented associates to BD. Last week, we had the opportunity to meet with many of the Bard associates at some of their major locations and we were impressed by the collaborative spirit of Bard's leadership team, who is already generating ideas for what we could accomplish as a combined company.","Turning to slide 5 and the second quarter highlights; we entered the Bard transaction with very strong momentum. Performance from both the Medical and Life Science segments contributed to strong revenue growth over the first half of fiscal year 2017. Our results continued to demonstrate the benefit of our diverse product and geographic portfolio and our ability to drive strong underlying margin expansion through the achievement of synergies, operational efficiencies, and continuous improvement.","In addition, we achieved our commitment of 3 times gross leverage within two years of close, exactly as we planned and originally stated. We continue to make excellent progress and remain on track to achieve our CareFusion cost and revenue synergies. The integration of CareFusion has laid the foundation for the integration of Bard, providing a road map for the creation of a detailed execution plan. As I just mentioned, we expect this transaction to close in the fall of 2017, subject to regulatory and Bard shareholder approvals.","Later in the presentation, Chris will update you on some changes we are making to our dispensing business, as we reinvent the Medication Management process. We will transform the dispensing business model from capital placements to a value-based software and solutions model, and we believe this further demonstrates our ability to execute on our vision to create a more robust and customer-focused business.","As we look to the total year, we are very confident in our outlook. The strength of our year-to-date performance allows us to reaffirm our fiscal year 2017 revenue and adjusted earnings guidance, which includes the impact of the accounting change from this new business model. Of course, with this accounting change, there is minimal change to cash flow.","I will now turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our second quarter financial performance and our fiscal year 2017 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Like Vince, I'm also very excited about the combination of BD and Bard and the value created for our customers, patients, and shareholders globally. We are very pleased with our performance in the first half of fiscal 2017, with revenues growing 5.6% and EPS growing 16.2%. You can see, we are entering the Bard transaction with strong momentum.","Moving on to slide 7, I'll review our second quarter revenue and EPS results, which I'll speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total second quarter revenues of approximately $3 billion grew 5.2% on a comparable basis, which was ahead of our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $2.30 also exceeded our expectations, growing at 12.8% over the prior year.","We're also pleased that we continued to de-lever and reduce the debt associated with the acquisition of CareFusion. We paid down approximately $3.5 billion in debt in the two years since the acquisition, including approximately $700 million in the second quarter of this fiscal year. We are very pleased that we achieved our commitment of 3 times gross leverage by the end of this past March, as we had anticipated.","Moving on to slide 8, I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Performance from both segments drove second quarter revenue growth of 5.2%. Growth was ahead of our expectations, driven by strength in Medication Management Solutions, Diagnostic Systems, including a stronger than expected flu season, and Preanalytical Systems. In the quarter, pricing declined slightly.","Moving on to revenues growth by segment, BD Medical's second quarter revenues increased 4.8%. Medication and Procedural Solutions, or MPS, growth was 5.6%, which reflects strength in infusion disposables. Revenue growth in Medication Management Solutions, or MMS, up 7%, was driven by strong capital installations in dispensing in the U.S. and Europe. Growth was positively impacted by increased installation efficiency and the timing of placements that occurred in the second fiscal quarter earlier than originally anticipated.","Diabetes Care revenues were about flat. Revenue growth was impacted by the timing of customer orders in the U.S. which occurred in the first quarter, earlier than initially anticipated, as well as the timing of tenders in emerging markets that we now expect to occur later in the fiscal year. Pharmaceutical Systems revenues grew 2.6%. Results were impacted by the timing of customer orders in Europe that occurred in the first quarter, earlier than originally anticipated, in addition to a tough comparison to the prior year in the U.S. due to the geography of customer ordering patterns.","BD Life Sciences' second quarter revenues increased 5.8%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Preanalytical Systems and Diagnostic Systems. Revenues in Diagnostic Systems grew 10.5%. This reflects a strong quarter for flu-related sales, as well as the continued strength of core microbiology, including blood culture and Kiestra. In addition, we saw solid growth in BD MAX, driven by the recent introductions of new enterics and other assays.","Preanalytical Systems growth of 7.5% was driven by safety-engineered products in both the U.S. and emerging markets. Biosciences revenues declined slightly due to the timing of instrument installations, as well as the impact of temporary fulfillment delays related to certain research reagents as a result of damaged inventory. In addition, we recorded a charge primarily related to the write-off of the inventory, which you will see in a few moments when I take you through the second quarter income statement.","Moving on to slide 9, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the second quarter on a comparable currency-neutral basis. U.S. growth was strong at 4.0%. This was comprised of BD Medical growing at 3.2% and BD Life Sciences growing at 6%. Performance in BD Medical reflects strong growth in capital placements in our dispensing business and MMS and a wide range of infusion disposal products in our MPS business.BD Medical growth in the U.S. was impacted by the aforementioned customer ordering patterns in our Diabetes Care business and a tough comparison to the prior year in our Pharmaceutical Systems business, as previously mentioned.","BD Life Sciences growth reflects strong performance in Diagnostic Systems and Preanalytical Systems. Growth in our U.S. Diagnostics business was driven by a strong flu season, continued strength in blood culture, Kiestra, and BD MAX. Revenues in Preanalytical Systems were driven by safety-engineered products across all platforms. Revenues in our Biosciences business in the U.S. were about flat, as strength in our Advanced Bioprocessing business was offset by the impact of the aforementioned research reagent fulfillment delays.","Moving on to internationals; international revenues grew 6.5%. The Medical segment grew 7.1%. Growth was driven by performance from infusion disposables and the MPS business and strong capital instillations in our dispensing business and MMS. Pharmaceutical Systems revenue growth reflects the timing of customer orders, as previously mentioned. Growth in Diabetes Care reflects the timing of tenders in emerging markets, as previously mentioned. The growth in Life Science segment was 5.6%, driven by sales of safety-engineered products in emerging markets and strong sales in our Core Microbiology and BD MAX in Diagnostic Systems.","Within Core Microbiology, we saw continued strength in blood culture as well as growth in ID\/AST that was driven in part by the recent introduction of the Phoenix M50. Biosciences revenues declined due to timing of instrument sales in certain geographies that are now expected to occur later this fiscal year.","On slide 10, developed market revenues grew a strong 4.5%, and emerging markets revenues markets grew 8.7%. The second quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflect strength in sales of safety-engineered products as well as core products in Diagnostic Systems in EMA and Latin America; and strength in MPS, particularly in China. China growth for the second quarter was ahead of our expectations at 11.9%. Revenue growth was driven by continued strong demand for consumables in both segments. For the total year, we continue to expect China to grow in the low double-digit range. We continue to anticipate emerging markets growth of high-single digits.","Now, moving on to global safety on slide 11, currency-neutral sales increased 6.3%. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 3.7%. International sales grew 10.3% currency-neutral, driven by strength across emerging markets, which grew 13.4%. Medical safety sales grew 4.7%, driven by a range of infusion disposables. Life Sciences safety sales, which are driven by Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 9% in the quarter, with strong growth across emerging markets as well as in the U.S.","Slide 12 recaps the second quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As discussed, revenues grew a strong 5.2% in the quarter on a comparable currency-neutral basis.","As we move down the P&L, I'd like to point out, similar to last quarter, that our results in the prior-year period include the Respiratory Solutions business, while the current period does not as the business was divested in October 2016. BD's ownership interest in the Vyaire joint venture is recorded within other income in our second fiscal quarter results.","Starting with gross profit, the decline of 0.8% year-over-year reflects the loss of gross profit related to the Respiratory Solutions business and the impact of the aforementioned damaged research reagent inventory. On a comparable currency-neutral basis that adjusts for these items, gross profit would have grown in excess of revenue growth. I'll provide additional details on gross profit in just a moment.","SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.3%. We're very pleased with the continued leverage we are getting as SSG&A continues to grow at a slower pace than revenues when adjusting for Respiratory Solutions in the prior year.","R&D as a percentage of revenue was 6.3% as we continue to invest in innovation to drive future growth. As you'll recall, with the suspension in the medical device tax last year, our ability to ramp R&D spending did not occur until after the second fiscal quarter. With a more normalized level of R&D spend than the prior year and also adjusting for Respiratory Solutions, R&D would have grown in line with revenue growth in the second quarter.","Operating income grew 0.9%. As I just mentioned, there are a few one-time puts and takes this quarter. On an underlying basis, P&L leverage remains strong with estimated double-digit growth in operating income.","Our tax rate declined to 12.5% in the quarter, which is below our full-year expectations of 17% to 19%. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was lower than expectations, largely due to an incremental benefit from the stock compensation accounting rule change and other discrete items.","In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.30. This represents a 12.8% increase versus the prior year, which reflects our solid growth profile, strong underlying margin expansion, and a lower tax rate that offset approximately $0.06 of the pressure in the quarter related to the inventory write-off in Biosciences.","Now, turning to slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the second quarter; on a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by 90 basis points. Gross margin includes the impact related to the damaged reagent inventory and a slight decline in pricing, offset by growth that was driven by continuous improvement initiatives, cost synergies, and favorable mix, which includes the positive impact of divestitures. On an operating margin basis, we are pleased to have delivered 80 basis points of margin expansion.","We continue to drive cost synergies, which were partially offset by the timing of the R&D spend in comparison to prior year. Year-to-date, we have achieved approximately 180 basis points of underlying margin expansion and remain confident in our ability to drive 200 basis points to 225 basis points of margin expansion for fiscal year 2017.","Now, moving on to slide 15, I'd like to take a few minutes to provide an update on our progress in transforming our U.S. dispensing business. As you may recall, discussions regarding this change have been ongoing since prior to BD's acquisition of CareFusion, and we have been actively working on this for the past two years. Over that same time horizon, we have been successful in stabilizing and improving the installation process of the Pyxis ES system. We believe our success is evident by the continued robust growth we have seen in the U.S. dispensing business.","As we better align with customer goals, we see a strategic opportunity to change the way we engage with our customers. The business is evolving from one-time hardware installations towards providing lifetime solutions, software, and ultimately, value. With Pyxis ES, the business is shifting towards smart, connected dispensing devices with incremental software enhancements over time. This results in reducing medication errors and drug waste while improving drug availability and hospital cash flow. This also enables customers to benchmark their Medication Management performance versus other hospitals across the country.","From a financial perspective, this requires us to match our accounting with the new business model by moving from capital leases to operating leases, which results in recording revenues ratably over the contract term versus recognizing the entire contract value upfront. The impact of the change will be determined by customer acceptance and finalized by the end of this month. We anticipate a headwind of approximately $50 million to $60 million to revenues and $0.20 to $0.25 to EPS in this fiscal year. This accounting change results in a difficult comparison, which will be limited to the second half of this fiscal year and the first half of fiscal year 2018, but it creates a more predictable recurring revenue stream going forward.","Now, due to the strong momentum we have seen across the company and the over-performance we have delivered year-to-date, we are pleased that we're able to offset this accounting change and maintain our previously communicated revenue and earnings guidance. This business model change creates substantial value for our customers and we will keep you updated as we make progress with this transformation.","Moving on to slide 16 and our full fiscal year 2017 guidance; with strong performance year-to-date, we are reaffirming our full fiscal year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of $9.70 to $9.80, or 13% to 14% growth on a currency-neutral basis. Foreign exchange rates have not moved meaningfully since we last provided guidance in February, and as such, we continue to expect achieving earnings of $9.35 to $9.45, including the impact of currency, which represents growth of 9% to 10%. Our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.07, and as a reminder, includes dilution of approximately 1.5% from the Respiratory divestiture.","Turning to slide 17, I'd like to walk through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year. We continue to expect total company revenue growth to 4.5% to 5% on a comparable currency-neutral basis with growth of 4.5% to 5% in BD Medical and 4% to 5% in Life Sciences. Based on our current view of the environment, we continue to expect a small amount of pricing pressure for the year. We now expect our tax rate to be between 16% and 18%. All other P&L guidance from February remains unchanged.","Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I thank you, Chris. Moving on to slide 19, I will walk you through our updates on new product innovation and strategic and business initiatives. Starting with new product innovations, within our Medical business, we recently launched BD Enterprise Pharmogistics 1.0, which is a pharmacy inventory management software that integrates with the Pyxis ES platform to provide enhanced medication availability and patient safety across even the largest multifacility healthcare networks.","Within our Life Science business, we received 510(k) clearance for the new BD FACSVia flow cytometry system, which provides blood banks and clinical laboratories with an easy-to-use cell analysis solution to help determine and quantify the presence of residual white blood cells in their blood products. The addition of the BD FACSVia system follows our larger strategy of making flow cytometry easier to use with improved efficiency, simplified sample analysis, and higher quality diagnostic results.","Within strategic and business initiatives, we recently completed the acquisition of CME, a manufacturer of ambulatory infusion pumps. The acquisition of CME further strengthens our strategy and portfolio of Medication Management Solutions across the healthcare continuum and enables an even broader impact on patient outcomes.","Moving on to our business update on slide 20, we continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture through our G&A functional transformation. We continue to remain focused on ongoing supply chain optimization in our distribution network. In addition, our manufacturing-related synergies remain on track and we continue to expect the majority of these to be achieved over the remainder of the deal horizon through fiscal year 2018. We continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies related to the CareFusion acquisition as we exit fiscal year 2018.","Turning to operating margin, as you can see here, we are continuing to drive significant operating margin expansion over a multi-year period. The consistent performance of our businesses combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage, and cost synergy capture is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. We move forward with strong momentum and continue to expect to deliver over 500 basis points of cumulative margin expansion over the three-year period through fiscal year 2017.","Moving on to slide 21, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, we are very excited about the powerful combination of BD and Bard and our ability to deliver innovative solutions that position us to improve both the process of care and the treatment of disease.","Second, both segments continue to perform ahead of our expectations and our results highlight the benefit of our diverse portfolio, both from a product and geographic standpoint. We continue to execute on our strategy and the progress we are making in transforming Medication Management is a good example of this.","Third, operating efficiencies, cost leverage, and cost synergy capture continue to generate significant operating margin improvement. And finally, we are moving forward with strong momentum, are confident in our outlook for the full fiscal year, and in our ability to drive revenue and earnings growth. We are very optimistic about BD's prospects for the future and our ability to continue to drive shareholder return.","Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. In order to allow for broad participation, please limit your question to one. Thank you. Your first question is coming from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just a couple questions this morning, if I could; just first for Chris then maybe a follow-up for Vince. So, Chris, this accounting change for Pyxis transitioning from capital to operating type leases, we've talked about this for years. Maybe just kind of walk through, we know it's neutral to cash flow, but in terms of why do this now, the advantages it poses to the business, and the magnitude of a revenue or EPS hit for 2018 relative to 2017. And then I have a quick one for Vince. Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, Vince will start it out, David. Thanks a lot for the question. As you mentioned, this is something we've been working on for two years. And the first phase was improving the base software, the Pyxis ES, the installation process. And you can see in our results we've made great progress there. We're now moving into a different phase where we're adding new capability to Pyxis. And as we do that, we have to make sure that we're organized in the field to support this new business model.","The last thing we want to be doing is putting new capability into a system and not bringing the customer along with us. This is a matter of customer satisfaction. And so, while there's more complexity, there's a tremendous ability to optimize Medication Management. Tom will give you a little more details on that, but this is really about a tremendous advantage for the customer base and utilizing the capability.","Tom will mention that he has to change kind of how we support in the field and what people are doing there. So, Tom, maybe you want to make a few comments, then we'll come back to the financial aspect.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, Vince, and good morning, David. I think, as Vince mentioned, obviously, you have been asking us about this change from pretty much I think the first week of the CareFusion acquisition and when we came together, and we've basically saw the same opportunity that you had described and have been working on this for the past two years, and then all of that preparation has led to this point where we're ready to transform the business model.","I think, as Vince described, Pyxis ES is really the catalyst, because it's now this smart, connected dispensing system where we're shifting from a onetime installation event and then really the touch point with the customer was five years later, when there was another capital requirement, to where there needs to be a much more ongoing consultative related relationship with the customer where the focus is all on delivering outcomes for improving Medication Management, right, every month, every quarter, every year.","And so, this change in the \u2013 what is a accounting or business model change, right, really shifts us more to be able to deliver that business model, which I just described. As part of and in tandem with this accounting change, we are concurrently increasing, actually, the number of resources in the field that are working as consultants with our customers to maximize their use of Pyxis ES and to drive benefits from all of the features, particularly, really around how to use data to improve outcomes.","As Vince mentioned, we've been concurrently investing in the new software modules which can help our customers do things like optimize inventory, reduce med errors or drug waste, benchmark themselves versus peers. And this change also tees us up to be able to not only better deliver and engage customers in those solutions, but also allows us flexibility going forward to be able to capture value from innovations delivered via software. And so, we see all of these things coming together.","We recognize, obviously, the timing never necessarily a good timing at all, but we thought now is the right time from the business perspective as well as it's the right time for our customers. And all the feedback that we've gotten from customers as we've begun discussing this with them has been extremely, extremely positive.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, this is Chris. And so, for all the reasons that Tom and Vince mentioned, this makes all the sense in the world from a customer standpoint and really positions us well going forward. But as you know, the trick when companies \u2013 other companies have done this, is how do you keep it from being death by a thousand cuts, because other companies did this in a way that you waited for the contract to come due and that could take three years for it to be a headwind. We've been able to do this in one fell swoop across substantially all of our customer contracts, and that limits the impact to a year, a one-year impact.","The other positive is we're \u2013 because of the business momentum that we currently have, we're going to cover the impact of that, both on the top and the bottom line, which really mutes the impact of this. And the fact that we're able to do it six months in really helps to compare year-over-year that you were talking to from a fiscal year 2018 versus 2017, because we'll have six months this year and six months next year.","So, the timing actually feels really good and we're able to accomplish this, get it behind us. As you mentioned, it has no impact on cash flow because now the revenue will be recognized as the cash is received. So, the timing seems to work out for a lot of reasons, particularly because we can cover it. And so, that felt like the right timing to us.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then \u2013 that's very, very clear, guys. Thanks for the color. And then, Vince, just for you; there's a lot of moving parts in the quarter, but based on your guidance versus consensus, it seems like underlying growth coming up about 50 basis points and maybe earnings coming up something close to $0.12. So, just real quickly, where is the underlying strength coming from you this year so far in, kind of, a broad perspective? And given the strength in the business and where the equity capital markets sit, how should we think about the equity-linked capital raise for Bard consideration? I'm assuming we should think about that as coming very, very soon. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in queue.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Sure. Thanks, David. We're seeing strength in both segments and we've seen the stabilization in emerging markets as well, and stabilization in developed markets. So, where geography was an issue last year, it's not an issue this year; strong performance you saw in China, good performance in Latin America, and then stabilization in Saudi and that sort of thing. So, we're feeling very good about emerging markets now. We continue to guide in the high single-digits. So, that is looking good and China is looking at double-digits.","Both Medical and Life Sciences are performing well. I think you saw MMS doing extremely well; MPS doing well. Pharm Systems had a good first half. There's just some timing for the first half. And Diabetes Care we expect to be more robust in the second. So, Medical is doing well; Diagnostics is knocking it out of the park, quite frankly, with what they're doing with Kiestra, the launch of the Falcon 50 this quarter. That's going extremely well. And, of course, flu was a positive. And so, the only piece that has been a little soft has been Biosciences. They're doing well in the high end of the marketplace. They had this inventory situation this quarter and we expect to get that behind us quickly.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And to the second part of that question around the equity offering, as we said last week, we intend to move quickly on that. The process would be filing our Q, which should happen today. Then we have to file pro forma financial statements. You can expect us to move on that quickly. Once those are filed, we can really address the timing. But as we said last week, we expect to move very quickly on that, so don't blink or you'll miss it.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Kind of clarify a couple financial items related to the accounting change. So, the $50 million to $60 million in revenues tied to the $0.20 to $0.25 in EPS, $50 million to $60 million of lost revenues isn't $0.20 to $0.25. So, is there some additional costs to doing this that we should understand? And then, second, if I just focus on slide 17, which is the fiscal 2017 guidance change. The only item that's changing is the tax rate moving down 100 basis points. Is there an offset that we're missing that EPS doesn't move up for the year with the tax rate moving down 100 bps? Thanks.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So, just a little bit of color on what creates the revenue drag. It's really, over the next six months, we're going to be recognizing just this year's amount of revenue, whereas in prior years, we would have done a full five years of revenue as you book the contract. The impact of that is about $50 million to $60 million. That goes entirely down to the bottom line. There's no margin impact, or whatever. It flows directly through. So, the $50 million to $60 million is $0.20 to $0.25 on the bottom line that we're covering.","Then, as you think about the change in the tax rate, as one of the slides showed, I think it's slide 16, that change down is one of the ways that will offset some of that $0.25. I think that's like an $0.08 to $0.09 benefit by moving down to the 16% to 18% kind of range. So, we're overcoming the remainder of that $0.20 to $0.25 operationally. So, we just want to be clear that we're jumping over the accounting change in 2018 as well, partly because of the six months this year versus the six months next year. So, we set the base and go from there.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And so, what is it you have to go to your customers for existing installed systems and do? So, if you have an installed system, you've already recognized the revenue. What is it you're going to those existing customers and doing?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, Tom will tell you.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, again, (36:38) this is Tom. We literally just communicate via a letter and they have the opportunity to opt out or automatically are opted in. There's nothing specifically that has to happen at the customer's site. And then, of course, as I described before, concurrently we are deploying, as part of our business model transformation, all the other parts of that transformation including additional resources in the field to provide consultative services to help optimize the use of the software with the platform and generate outcomes. And so those things are happening concurrently. But there's nothing hardware change or from a service implementation that has to occur.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And those letters went out earlier this year.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Correct.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And what about, Tom, the compensation for the reps. Reps were getting paid on the installs before. How does their compensation change?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","No changes this fiscal year, and obviously, we'll be evaluating how to best continue to align our sales force compensation with creating customer value as we go into FY 2018.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Perfect. Can I ask one? Yeah, Vince, I want to ask one last, just a Bard question.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","One of the kind of questions that came up a lot last week from people was just the difference in the pace of product iteration at Bard versus other companies, include Becton, Dickinson. And as much as it and people asking, how do you maintain that model at Bard with this kind of very accelerated rate of what I would call modest iteration at Bard over the last several years that they've gotten this model down correct and that's been successful for them? How do you keep that \u2013 as you pull the company into Becton, Dickinson, how do you maintain that model and that culture?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, Mike. Sure. I think that as we traveled around, we got a strong sense of that. And by setting this up as a separate segment, number one, and number two, keeping that system in place, and we've made that very clear. In fact, we're interested in taking that system to other BD businesses where it could apply. We were excited because, as we got together with their teams, as I mentioned in my remarks, they were already talking about things that we could do together. And so, we're going to resource it. We're not going after any synergies in terms of R&D and that \u2013 so, we'll maintain that system, is basically what I'm going to tell you","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks, Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, I just want to circle back and make sure I'm understanding some of the mechanics here on the change here in the dispensing strategy.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, maybe, Tom, if you could just touch on this. So, if you're an existing customer, as you indicated, you get a letter suggesting that you're moving to this new business model. They've already paid upfront for their installation and they've got some modest back-end stuff that I think comes through. So, it sounds like they don't have to do anything. So, again, is this really in terms of the accounting associated with the new installations?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Larry, this is Chris. Just to be clear, the way the contracts currently work is they have not paid. They pay \u2013 let's say, you're doing a five-year contract, 60 months. They're going to pay a little bit every month for 60 months. The accounting was that we recognized revenue upfront for the entire five years under capital lease accounting. Now, what we'll do is we'll just match the revenue growth \u2013 the revenue that we book to the actual collection of the cash. So, it matches the cash.","It's actually a very positive way of accounting from a recurring revenue standpoint because once you book \u2013 once you get the contracts that now you've got 60 months of revenue that's just basically contractual as opposed to the lumpiness of the capital lease model where everything would have been booked upfront.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, no change to the customer in terms of how they're paying.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","That's right.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. That's very clear. And then just, I was hoping to just get a quick update on two of the sort of newer products. Any thoughts around the infusion set, the diabetes infusion sets and some of those kinking issues that were going on? And then separately, any update on the progress for the insulin patch pump?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Sure. Tom can take both of those questions.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, hi. So, we are continuing \u2013 we do have, as you mentioned, the temporary pause on shipments of the new infusion set and we're working on bringing that product back to market in collaboration with our partner, Medtronic. As you mentioned, and as we've discussed, we've had feedback on the set that was overall extremely strong.","We had some complaints during launch and we're \u2013 the heavy focus is now working on optimizing the on-boarding process for patients, so that they properly learn how to use the set and can do so safely and optimally. So, we're in the process of actually running a \u2013 starting a trial to confirm that that training will help make sure that we get the right outcomes and then move forward in relaunching that. And so, that's progressing as planned.","On the pump, nothing to comment other than it remains on track with the date for the second half of FY 2018 that we had shared at the Analyst Day meeting, but we're seeing very good progress on that price development initiative.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Terrific. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. So, can you talk a little more about the Bioscience issues with the reagents this quarter? Just a little bit more clarity on that. And also, how do you think about sort of like the implications for the stock-based accounting tax changes for the rest of the year? I mean, is there any good \u2013 I know it's going to be variable from quarter-to-quarter, even a full-year basis, but is there any way to sort of help figure that out, (42:48) a little better?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I can take the last part of that first and then we'll move to damaged inventory.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, in calculating this at the beginning of the year, we got a little more benefit in this quarter than we had anticipated. That really shouldn't affect the rest of the year. Now clearly, stock-based compensation is kind of a mark-to-market kind of thing going forward, depending on the stock price. So, it adds a little volatility for every company, but I think we're very comfortable with the guidance that we have for the rest of the year, and that 16% to 18%, which takes into consideration the favorability that we saw in the second quarter. Okay, and Alberto?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And in terms of the \u2013 we did have some damage to inventory. The damage was caused when we relocated Resurge reagents to new a warehouse as part of a network optimization. And we conducted a full investigation and determined that we needed to initiate a field action and write-off the affected inventory.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, it was exposed to some conditions that were outside of what normally it should be exposed to. Anyway, you'll be back...","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And we'll be back \u2013 we expect to restore supply \u2013 complete supply by...","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","This quarter.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","...during the quarter; in Q3.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And did I catch that you that that was a $0.06 hit, you said, on the quarter?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","$0.06.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. It's a $0.06 impact to the quarter.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just curious if you could quantify the flu impact in the quarter, and as well on the Biosciences side, the impact to revenues from that inventory disruption.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, the first is about 30 bps of...","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I'm sorry, 30 bps of revenue growth in the quarter from the flu. And do we have a revenue impact or we have to do some work? Do you have that?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. The revenue impact from the reagents is $6 million in revenue for the quarter.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Alberto.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Actually, just quick follow-ups on that last question. Was that 30 bps for flu across the entire business? And what does that $6 million impact translate into in terms of gross margin impact across the business?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, the first is right, that's 30 bps across the business in the quarter, so at the BD level. And at the second, it's about 40 bps or so of gross margin headwind from that impact on the damaged inventory.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And it's more than just the $6 million, it's the write-off as well.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. And then, I guess, a broader follow-up on Biosciences. Recognizing the impact of the fulfillment delay that we've talked about a bit here, it did still look like Biosciences came up a little bit light of expectations. I'm just wondering if you saw anything that surprised you during the quarter more broadly, either in the pharmaceutical end market or in the academic end market. The latter I mentioned because of NIH funding uncertainty in the U.S. and because some of your peers have commented that European academic was a bit weaker relative to expectations. And, you've also had some tender challenges within Biosciences, I think, related to CD4 in Africa. Was that still an issue in the quarter and any insight on when that will headwind will subside? Thank you.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","No, we don't see any underlying change in the market or basic change in the market. It's actually pretty much as we expected and no major changes. We don't see any changing behaviors from our customers because of the NIH budgeting. In fact, obviously, as has happened during the weekend, if anything, the NIH budget was increased by $2 billion. So, that was actually good news.","And in terms of the CD4, that has stabilized. We're seeing about half the impact that we saw last year and that's beginning to stabilize. We'll see some erosion of that over time, but at a much more paced approach. The impact on the quarter, if anything, was mostly a timing of instrumentation in Asia and Europe but we expect \u2013 we have visibility and we expect that to be regained in the second half.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. If you had normalized for that timing issue and a little bit of the impact of the fulfillment delay, it should be in the 4% range of growth.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Super helpful, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And maybe, Chris, a couple of ones for you and I had one follow-up for Vince. So, just maybe on the gross margins, right, so I think you mentioned 40 bps on the reagent impact. It looks like margins missed consensus by about 100 basis points. So, I'm wondering, one, did the accounting rule adoption have any impact in the quarter, or did Alaris pump, I know you had some charges for the center recall, did that have any impact in the Q?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, no, not at all. There's no impact from the accounting change until next quarter. But what you're seeing is the impact of FX. So, most analysts, I think, modeled the impact of FX to gross margins ratably over the year. Half of the impact of the FX hits you in the second quarter or hits us in the second quarter. And so, that was the difference that flowed through to the gross margin.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","That was helpful, Chris. And then, on the EPS side, it's interesting. So, the accounting rule, was a $0.20, $0.25 hit on the EPS, but we maintain the EPS guidance, right. And the math I'm doing here, you get about $0.12 to $0.13 benefit from the lower tax rate, and revenues coming in better as maybe another $0.05 to $0.06. It implies an underlying benefit of $0.05 to $0.06. Where is that coming from? Is that better margin pull-through in the back half?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Thanks. So, you did the math pretty correctly. I think the tax impact is probably a little lighter than what you said in terms of coming down. But it really is just the performance of the business in the first half of the year that we see continuing. I think when you look at 5.6% revenue growth year-to-date and the kind of EPS growth that we see year-to-date, as well, up 16% or thereabouts, that is flowing through and will flow through to the second half of the year, enabling us to offset between that and the tax rate coming down that $0.20 to $0.25. So, we feel really good about that.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Got you. And then one quick one for Vince or maybe Tom. A lot of questions here on Bard acquisition and maybe potential revenue synergies. I guess, maybe can you walk us through on the kind of due diligence you guys did on Bard and why you felt so comfortable that that is the right asset? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, Tom can walk you through that. And, as you know from our previous conversation, we started way back in June on some really deep diligence across the entire product portfolio. But, Tom, why don't you give them some color on that?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Hi, Vijay. Good morning, this is Tom. I think as we discussed, obviously, our diligence, like with the CareFusion acquisition, included not only deep dives into each of the markets but also that includes primary research with end users and customers as well as those who are innovating in the space.","And so, we performed that diligence across actually several hundred end user customers to understand the opportunity, not only of the base business momentum, but also the opportunity for new innovations and the dynamics of those innovations versus competition and the likelihood of \u2013 and the trajectory of those being successful. And obviously, as a result of that analysis, we became very comfortable. Obviously, some of those areas we knew very well already because they're close to home, like the vascular access space, PICCs and midlines, urology also not that distant, and then other areas like DCBs, which are newer to us. You can imagine, we even took additional time and did even more thorough end-user research and evaluations to get comfortable with.","And, of course, then we also had exposure to other information during the diligence process. So, yeah, we're excited and see opportunities certainly on revenue synergies as we move forward and I think as we've noted, as Chris and Vince have identified, we think that they'll be sooner than what we saw with CareFusion, just given the very strong momentum of Bard in registering products internationally over the last couple of years.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. So, as we did our own due diligence, and we were seeing 500 registrations and a really strong pipeline. So, at the end of the day, we were even more comfortable when we finished up. But thanks for your question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So, I guess, last question, a little segue way from there on the CareFusion, product registration o-U.S....","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","...can you give us an update there? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Happy to do that. Tom will do that.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hey, Bill. This is Tom. Good morning. So, we're seeing great progress across our product registration efforts and we're continuing to see actually revenue synergies this year. I think you can see that in both our MMS and MPS performance year-to-date. We're on track with about 190 active or in-process product registrations in new markets. And that's towards an ultimate target of a little over 200 registrations. So, we're making really good progress there and we're starting to see the impacts of that come through on the revenue side.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to follow-up on the capital operating lease situation. I'm just wondering, does this allow you to innovate and then to change the model through which you, kind of, bring additional software updates to Pyxis and to sell that to the customer? Is there any change there, and should we expect any, kind of, more iterative kind of innovation on that front?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, the answer to that is yes. This is foundational that allows us to do that over time. Absolutely.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, good morning. Question for you on Microbiology. Can you talk about what was the Core Microbiology growth in the quarter? And also, bioM\u00e9rieux put up some very strong core micro growth as well. What's going on in the underlying microbiology markets that we're seeing nice acceleration from both companies lately? Thanks.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, we're carrying a lot of momentum on Core Microbiology, primarily on our vac tech (54:44) business where we think we have a very strong value proposition in terms of recovery rates and time to detection. Kiestra continues to be a growth \u2013 a significant growth factor for us, which also allows us to provide complete solutions to customers. And outside the Core Microbiology, we talked about the M50 from an ID\/AST perspective. The launch was very successful, very well received, especially in emerging markets where it's the ideal throughput and size for that. And finally, BD MAX is really doing well for us, especially as we see the momentum for enterics gaining ground.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is coming from Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is Ian Mahmud on for Matt. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Yes, we can. Good morning.","Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Great. Good morning. So, on the acquisition of Bard, you haven't \u2013 or you didn't include tax synergies in your synergy estimates, but Bard does have a meaningfully higher tax rate. How quickly do you think you could bring that down?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, we \u2013 just to give you kind of a background on that, their tax rate is about 21.5% to 22% and ours is now the 16% to 18%. On a combined basis, we said 18% to 20%. That takes into account both those tax rates as well as some of the shield \u2013 the tax shield from the additional debt that we're offering, plus some other puts and takes. So, there's a bunch of things that go in there that kind of net out so that it's their rate plus our rate. Having said that, we did say that we do see the potential for tax synergies going forward beyond that.","Obviously, we've got to get the two companies together, but \u2013 and really, there's a lot of blocking and tackling that goes on in looking at legal entities in their structure and our structure. But based on the due diligence that we did, we're very comfortable that some of the structures that we have in place for a long time we'll be able to take advantage of, as well as some of the things that they have in place we should be able to leverage as well.","So, on a combined basis, we think we will be seeing tax synergies above and beyond what we've put in the model. And we probably need \u2013 the rest of this year, we'll start to have some conversations, but really, once we close, which is very similar to what happened on the CareFusion transaction, once we close, we can really get our arms around that and get all of our tax advisors looking at the various puts and takes and then more to come. So, I would say sometime right after we close, which would be the fall of this year, so about a few months after that we'll have a better understanding of that. And you can look to us to start quantifying that at that point.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for any closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, operator, and thank you, all, for participating on the call this morning. We look forward to updating you on the rest of the year. We feel really good about the momentum as we go into the second half of the year, and we look forward to updating you on the progress with C. R. Bard. And together, as we put this together, we do believe we're uniquely positioned to deliver innovative healthcare solutions that improve both the process of care and the treatment of disease and that's going to be unique in this industry.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through August 10th, 2017, on the Investor's page of the bd.com website or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic, and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 50820826.","Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique N. Dolecki - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","The third quarter comparable revenue growth rates and fiscal year 2017 comparable revenue guidance provided today excludes the revenues of divestitures, most notably, the Respiratory Solutions business that was divested in October of 2016, just after our 2016 fiscal year-end. The details of purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments, and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of the investor relations slides. As a result of previously communicated changes related to the transformation of our U.S. dispensing business model, we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $495 million net of tax during the third fiscal quarter of 2017. We continue to expect the impact of the change to be a headwind of approximately $50 million to $60 million to revenues, and 2% to 3% to EPS in fiscal year 2017. The impact to revenues and EPS is ratable across the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2017. As a reminder, this change results in a difficult comparison which is limited to the second half of this fiscal year and the first half of fiscal year 2018, but it creates a more predictable revenue stream going forward. More complete details can be found in our 10Q, which will be filed later today.","Please note that all fiscal year 2017 guidance provided is on a BD stand-alone basis. Regarding the Bard transaction, all strategic and financial parameters remain unchanged from the deal announcement. After closing, we will provide more explicit guidance for the combined company.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administration Officer; Tom Polen, President; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As you read in this morning's press release, we are pleased with our performance this quarter. Our core remains strong and we continued to deliver consistent solid results.","As we take you through the results, there are a number of puts and takes within the year, but the sum of it is that our performance is strong. Year-to-date, adjusting for the Respiratory Solutions divestiture, we are growing 4.5% on the top line, with high-single digit operating income growth and strong mid-teens EPS growth as we are overcoming the impact of the U.S. dispensing change with strong underlying performance.","In the quarter, China and the broader emerging markets posted strong double-digit growth reflecting our momentum in these important markets. Total revenue growth was slightly lower than expected, which Chris will touch upon in just a few moments. We continue to make excellent progress and are on track to achieve our CareFusion cost and revenue synergies.","Our fiscal 2017 revenue synergies are being driven by international registrations of consumable products in MPS, along with dispensing in MMS. We now have 225 approved or in-process product registrations in new markets, with an ultimate target of over 250 registrations.","The strategic transformation of the U.S. dispensing business model that we communicated last quarter has been successfully implemented, and customer reception has been overwhelmingly positive.","As we look to the total year, we are very confident in our outlook. The strength of our year-to-date performance allows us to reaffirm our currency-neutral revenue and earnings guidance. Also, as a result of favorable foreign currency movement, we are raising our adjusted earnings guidance.","Turning to slide 5, our pending acquisition of C.R. Bard remains on track, with an expected closing date in the fourth calendar quarter of 2017, subject to regulatory and Bard shareholder approvals. Upon announcement, we communicated a fall 2017 closing timeframe. That remains unchanged, and our continued expectation is that we will close in the November to December 2017 timeframe.","Overall, things are progressing quite nicely. We are also pleased that Bard's business performance to date is strong and in-line with our expectations, as evidenced by their recently-recorded quarterly earnings. From an integration standpoint, we should receive regulatory approval sooner \u2013 if we receive regulatory approval sooner, we'll be ready.","We have been able to leverage our experience from the CareFusion acquisition to lay the plans for another successful integration, and we have made excellent progress to date. We've created a detailed execution plan that builds upon our CareFusion experience, and are very pleased that we are well ahead of where we were at this time with CareFusion.","In terms of talent, we have retained key Bard leadership, including John Groetelaars, who will serve as President of the new Interventional segment; John DeFord, who has been named SVP Research and Development for the Interventional segment; and Betty Larson, who has been named SVP, Human Resources for the new segment.","In addition, John Groetelaars' full leadership team has been established, with all regional and business presidents in place. We're thrilled with the number of exceptional Bard leaders dedicated to making the combined company a success as we move forward together. We will share more information about the new company structure as we progress towards the closing.","As you are aware, shortly after announcing the Bard acquisition, we went to market and successfully issued approximately $5 billion dollars in common and preferred shares. We also launched nearly $10 billion dollars in senior notes. All offerings were over-subscribed by a multiple of over three times.","As a combined company, we believe we will further accelerate and broaden our strategy, create new growth opportunities for both companies, and deliver meaningful long-term value for shareholders. Together, we will be uniquely positioned to deliver innovative healthcare solutions that improve both the process of care and the treatment of disease.","So now I'll turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our third quarter financial performance and our fiscal year 2017 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Vince, and good morning everyone. Like Vince, I'm also pleased by the progress we are making with our integration planning for the Bard acquisition, and the value the combination will create for our customers, patients, and shareholders globally.","Moving on to slide 7, I'll review our third quarter revenue and EPS results, which I'll speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total third quarter revenues of approximately $3 billion dollars grew 2.4% on a comparable basis, which was slightly below our expectations. We estimate that the U.S. dispensing change lowered total company revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points, in line with our previously-communicated expectations.","As Vince mentioned, our underlying performance is strong. Accounting for the dispensing change and the timing of items within the year, our third quarter results would have been in the low end of our full-year guidance range of 4.5% to 5%. I'll provide more color on revenue growth in the quarter in a moment, when I take you through the results by segment and geography.","Adjusted EPS of $2.46 grew 7.7%. As expected, EPS was impacted by the divestiture of the Respiratory Solutions business, as well as the U.S. Dispensing business model change, which resulted in a combined headwind of approximately 600 basis points to EPS growth.","We're very pleased with our performance year-to-date. Revenue growth is strong at 4.5%. Accounting for the approximate 40-basis-point impact from the U.S. dispensing change, we estimate that the revenue growth year-to-date would have been near the high end of our 4.5%-to-5% guidance range. Year-to-date EPS growth of 13.1% reflects our ability to grow over the dilution from the Respiratory divestiture and the U.S. dispensing change.","Moving on to slide 8, I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a comparable currency-neutral basis. In the quarter, pricing declined about 20 basis points. BD Medical third quarter revenues increased 1.3%. Revenues in the Medical segment was slightly below our expectations in the quarter. Year-to-date, Medical revenues grew a strong 4.5%, which includes an estimated 50-basis-point headwind from the U.S. Dispensing change.","Medication and Procedural Solutions, or MPS, growth was 3.7%, which reflects strength in infusion-related disposables and infection prevention. Growth in MPS in the U.S. was below our expectations, due to the normalization of inventory levels across several major distributors.","Revenues in Medication Management Solutions, or MMS, declined 4.2%. We estimate that the U.S. dispensing change lowered MMS revenue growth by approximately 550 basis points. MMS revenue growth was also impacted by strong capital insulations in dispensing in the first half of the fiscal year, as previously communicated.","In addition, within our International Infusion business, certain customer orders planned for the third quarter are now expected to occur in the fourth fiscal quarter. On an underlying basis that accounts for these items, we estimate that MMS would have grown in the mid-single digits. We continue to be pleased as we gain momentum in the market in our MMS business.","Diabetes Care revenue growth of 2.7% was driven by 4.2% growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth in emerging markets. International growth was impacted by some softness in Europe, primarily in the U.K., where we are seeing increasing pressure from government payers as part of austerity measures. Pharmaceutical Systems revenues grew 3.9%. Results were impacted by the timing of customer orders that benefited growth in the first quarter. Year-to-date, Pharmaceutical Systems grew 6.1%.","BD Life Sciences third quarter revenues grew \u2013 increased 4.8%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Biosciences and solid growth in Diagnostic Systems and Preanalytical Systems. Revenues in Diagnostics Systems grew 3.8%. Strength in Core Microbiology was driven by blood culture and IDAST partially offset by the timing of BD Kiestra installations which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter. In addition, we saw strong accelerated growth in our BD MAX molecular platform driven by the recent introduction of new enteric's and women's health assays.","Preanalytical Systems growth of 3.9% was driven by strength in wing sets, including the recently-introduced BD UltraTouch. Biosciences revenues grew a strong 7.1%. This reflects continued strength in research reagents driven by our Sirigen dyes and growth from new recently-launched research instruments such as the FACSMelody.","Moving on to slide nine I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the third quarter on a comparable currency-neutral basis. U.S. growth was about flat with BD Life Sciences growing at 5.2% and BD Medical declining 1.3%. We estimate the U.S. dispensing change lowered BD Medical U.S. revenue growth by approximately 270 basis points and total company U.S. growth by approximately 200 basis points. Performance in BD Medical in the U.S. reflects growth in the MPS and Diabetes Care units. This growth was offset by the timing and geography of orders in Pharmaceutical Systems and the U.S. dispensing change.","Performance in the Medication Management Solution unit also reflects the timing of capital placements that occurred earlier in the fiscal year, revenues in MPS were driven by strength across a wide range of infusion disposables and infection prevention, partially offset by the normalization of inventory levels. BD Life Sciences growth reflects strong performance in Biosciences and Preanalytical Systems.","Growth in our U.S. Diagnostics business was driven by strong core Microbiology and BD MAX partially offset by the timing of revenues in some platforms. Revenues in Preanalytical Systems were driven by growth in wing sets and also reflect strong performance across all product platforms. Revenues in our Biosciences business in the U.S. were driven by strength in research reagents and growth from research instruments such as the FACSMelody and the FACSymphony.","Moving on to International, revenues grew 4.7%. The Medical segment grew 4.9%. Growth was driven by customer ordering patterns in Pharmaceutical Systems and by performance from infusion-related disposables in the MPS business. Diabetes care revenues reflect strength in emerging markets partially offset by softness in Europe, as previously discussed. Performance in MMS reflects the impact of strong capital insulations in the first half of the fiscal year as well as certain customer orders planned for the third quarter within our infusion business that are now expected to occur in the fourth fiscal quarter.","Growth in the Life Sciences segment of 4.4% was driven by performance in Diagnostic Systems and Biosciences. The Diagnostic Systems growth reflects strong sales in Core Microbiology including IDAST where we continue to see demand from the recently-launched Phoenix M50 and strength in BD MAX. Biosciences revenues reflect strong research instrument sales that partially benefited from an easy comparison due to the prior-year funding delays in certain geographies.","On slide 10, developed markets revenues grew 0.9% and emerging markets revenues grew 10.9%. We estimate the U.S. dispensing change lowered developed markets revenue growth by approximately 130 basis points. The third quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects double-digit growth across the Medical segment and also in Diagnostic Systems.","By geography, China, greater Asia and EMA grew double-digits and sales in Eastern Europe and Latin America were up high-single digits. China growth for the third quarter was strong at 12%. Revenue growth was driven by continued strong demand for consumables in both segments as well as the Phoenix M50 and MALDI-IDAST instruments and diagnostic systems, and research instruments in Biosciences. For the total year, we continue to expect China to grow in the low double-digit range.","With year-to-date growth of 9.1%, we are confident in our high single-digit emerging market growth outlook for the full fiscal year.","Now, moving on to Global Safety on slide 11. Currency-neutral sales were flat year-over-year. Tough comparisons to the prior year in both segments and across all geographies were the primary driver of lower Safety growth across the portfolio. By geography, Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 1.5% and international sales declined 2% currency-neutral.","Emerging Market Safety revenues were about flat due to a tough comparison to the prior year in which EM Safety grew approximately 20%. By segment, Medical Safety sales declined 2.1% and Life Sciences grew 3.7%. In addition to the tough comparisons to the prior year, U.S. and Medical Safety growth this quarter was impacted by distributor inventory levels in MPS as discussed earlier. International and Medical growth were also impacted by customer orders, planned for the third quarter within our infusion business that are now expected to occur in the fourth fiscal quarter as mentioned previously.","Slide 12 recaps the third quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As discussed, revenues grew 2.4% in the quarter on a comparable currency-neutral basis, including approximately 100 basis points negative impact from the U.S. dispensing change.","As we move down the P&L, I'd like to point out that similar to prior quarters our results in the prior-year period include the Respiratory Solutions business, while the current period does not as the business was divested in October of 2016.","Starting with gross profit, the decline of 1.3% year-over-year reflects the loss of gross profit from the Respiratory Solutions business and the U.S. dispensing business model change. On a comparable basis that accounts for these items, gross profit would have grown over 100 basis points faster than revenue growth. I'll provide additional details on gross profit in just a moment.","SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 23.7%, and we are very pleased with the leverage we are getting year-to-date. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.1% as we continue to invest in innovation to drive future growth. The decline in R&D spending year-over-year is due to the divestiture of Respiratory Solutions business, as well as the comparison to prior year where we ramped R&D spend in the third quarter as a result of the medical device tax suspension. Our tax rate declined to 16.5% in the quarter, which is in line with our full-year guidance.","In the quarter, operating income was flat and adjusted earnings per share grew 7.7% compared to the prior year. Both operating income and EPS include 600 basis points of negative impact from the Respiratory Solutions divestiture and the U.S. dispensing change.","Now, turning to slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the third quarter. On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by 150 basis points as continuous improvement initiatives, cost synergies and favorable mix, which includes the positive impact of divestitures, were partially offset by a slight decline in pricing.","On an operating margin basis, we delivered 100 basis points of margin expansion. Year-to-date, we have achieved approximately 160 basis points of underlying margin expansion. We expect the fourth quarter margin performance to significantly improve, largely driven by the comparison to the high level of R&D spend in the prior year. We remain confident in our ability to drive 200 to 225 basis points of margin expansion for fiscal year 2017.","Moving on to slide 15 and our full fiscal year 2017 EPS guidance. We are particularly pleased that the strength of our performance year-to-date is driving our ability to offset headwinds from the Respiratory Solutions divestiture, the U.S. dispensing change, and FX pressure. As a result, we are reaffirming our full-year fiscal 2017 currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance of $9.70 to $9.80, which represents underlying growth of 15% to 17% and a 2% to 3% headwind from the U.S. dispensing change.","As you're aware, foreign exchange rates have moved since we last provided guidance in May, and the foreign currency headwind has moderated slightly with one quarter to go. As such, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $9.42 to $9.47. Our guidance assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.15.","Turning to slide 16, I'd like to walk through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2017. As we discussed, there are a number of puts and takes within the year, but our underlying performance is strong. Despite a headwind of approximately 50 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change, we continue to expect total company revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. This was comprised of growth of 4.5% to 5% in BD Medical and 4% to 5% in Life Sciences.","Based on our current view of the environment, we continue to expect a small amount of pricing pressure for the year. All other P&L guidance from May remains unchanged.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you Chris. Moving on to slide 18, I will walk you through our updates on new product innovation and strategic and business initiatives.","Starting with the new production innovations within our Life Science business, we continued to expand the BD MAX system menu of unique, clinically-relevant panels. We recently received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. FDA for our newly-developed molecular test for detecting harmful intestinal bacteria. The BD MAX Extended Enteric Bacterial Panel is the latest offering in the suite of BD MAX Enteric assays.","We also recently received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. FDA for the BD FACSLyric flow cytometer system. The BD FACSLyric system strengthens BD's portfolio of clinical flow cytometry solutions available in the U.S. with an easy-to-use in vitro diagnostic system for use with assays for immunological assessment of individuals and patients having or suspected of having immune deficiency.","Within strategic and business initiatives, we recently released our 2016 sustainability report. One full year after announcing our 2020 sustainability goals, we are already making notable progress across our four focus areas of innovation, access, efficiency and empowerment.","We believe that aligning our relevant environmental, social and governance factors with our capabilities will help BD continue to generate differentiated results for all of our stakeholders from shareholders to society.","Moving on to our business update on slide 19. We continued to make progress with our cost synergy capture through our G&A functional transformation. We continued to remain focused on our functional transformations as we leverage our shared service centers and continued to build out our Centers of Excellence.","In addition, our manufacturing-related synergies remain on track and we continue to expect the majority of these to be achieved in fiscal year 2018. We also continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies related to the CareFusion acquisition as we exit fiscal year 2018.","Turning to operating margin expansion. As you can see, we continue to drive significant operating margin expansion over a multi-year period. The consistent performance of our businesses, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage, and cost synergy capture, is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. We continue to expect to deliver over 500 basis points of cumulative margin expansion over the three-year period through fiscal year 2017.","Moving on to slide 20, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today.","First, while there were some timing items within the year that impacted the quarter, our core business remains strong across both segments. We're pleased with our continued solid performance year-to-date and our ability to drive performance to offset divestitures, the U.S. dispensing change, and foreign-currency headwinds year-to-date.","Second, our operating performance, cost leverage, and cost synergy capture continued to generate operating margin improvement and drive double-digit earnings growth.","Third, as we look to the total year, we're confident in our increased outlook for the full fiscal year.","Finally, we're very excited about the powerful combination of BD and Bard, and our ability to deliver innovative solutions that position us to improve both the process of care and the treatment of disease. We're very pleased with the excellent progress we are making with the Bard integration, and look forward to the future with confidence.","Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for your questions.","Our first question is coming from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, and good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Chris, could you start by maybe providing us a bit of a bridge for this quarter? It's clear from your commentary that there were a number of timing items that impacted the organic performance this quarter, some of which you called as effectively timing of tenders, more contracts falling from the third quarter to fourth quarter. Could you just call those out in the different businesses and what the impact was, and how much of that we will see recaptured in 4Q?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, Mike, be happy to do that. So, if you think about the 2.4%, the underlying growth is 4.5%, and the way to get there is about 100 basis points related to the U.S. dispensing business we had articulated on the last call. Then we had timing factors. If you think about the first half of this year, we were running 5.6% year-to-date, and so we said that wasn't indicative. There was a lot of timing in there, and what was in there, particularly was, in MMS, they had a very strong first half, and so did Pharm Systems. Pharm systems grew over 7% in the first half, and we knew that is a lumpy business.","Then on top of that, we saw some timing this quarter. In MMS International, we saw some orders that we expected to see in the third quarter that we now expect to see in the fourth quarter. And there was some Kiestra installations that moved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So when you normalize for all those items, you get to the 4.5% underlying growth. Now we did say we saw some softness in MPS related to normalization of inventory levels and a little bit of softness in Diabetes care in the U.K. But if you added those back, that would have brought us more to the 5% kind of level in the quarter. So that's where we saw a little bit of softness, going from 5% down to 4.5%.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And do you think, do you have a read on whether inventory levels are now at an appropriate level, or whether you see any bounce back in the fourth quarter? And then, can you just clarify maybe, just so we're all on the same page, what you're implying for fourth quarter organic growth?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So, since we're at 4.5% year-to-date through the third quarter, we're implying in the 4.5% kind of range for the fourth quarter, and we do think that the inventory levels was a one-time adjustment within the third quarter, so we don't expect to see any hangover from that in the fourth quarter. We do see emerging market strength across the board. If you look at what we did in emerging markets this quarter, 9% year-to-date, 11% in the quarter, that's the best quarter in two years. China grew 12%, 11% year-to-date. So we're seeing \u2013 emerging market growth is very strong, so we see that continuing.","Life Sciences, we see strength across (31:26 \u2013 31:31) quarter bounce back. Until (31:33) we see strength in the fourth quarter, we see Diabetes Care rebounding, primarily driven by the U.S., as we do think that the U.K. pressure will continue. MMS has the International Q3\/Q4 timing, so we'll get a little benefit from that. MPS will actually have a tough compare in the fourth quarter, but we already had that baked in to our guidance. So that's how we get to a good solid fourth quarter, and to the 4.5% to 5% for the year.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So then, Chris, if you take that and you add back in the dispensing, you get up really to 5%.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. So that's why, as we said at the second quarter, we felt we were at the high end of our guidance range, and the pressure from the dispensing brought us down to the lower end of our \u2013 but still within our guidance range.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And that's what we continue to see.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Let me just follow up on one more financial question. So, we thought the FX swing from $1.07, which was where your last guidance was set on the euro, to $1.15, which is where you now set guidance, would be more of an impact on the second half or full-year guidance than what you announced today. So could you shed some light on that? And then, if you have any early indication of what you think the FX impact will be on FY 2018, that would be appreciated.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Absolutely. So, as you said, when we gave guidance the last time, we were at $1.07. We use the 30-day running average, as you know, so that would be $1.15. Today, we are sitting at $1.18. So the $0.08 between the $1.07 and $1.15, if you think back to the rule of thumb that we've given in the past, 1 point of euro move is worth about $0.02. So the $0.08 move is worth about $0.16 cents for a full year, but we just have one quarter to go. And, really, where you saw the move was in the month of July, so it's truly an impact of just one quarter. So that'd be about $0.04 for the quarter.","Then when you look at all other FX currencies, we actually are still seeing pressure from the pound, the yen, and the yuan, which really haven't moved at all in the past quarter, and so we still see pressures. All other currencies, there's about $0.01 of benefit since May, and so that's the $0.01 there and $0.04, so we see about $0.05 running through, and that's how much we increased the guidance by.","In terms of your comment around next year, we use the 30-day average because the volatility in FX has been dramatic over the last year or so, and we like the direction it's going. So if it stays at $1.18, we certainly will see a benefit. The average for this year, if it holds at $1.18 for the rest of the year, the average for this year will be about $1.10. So $1.18 for full next year would be about $0.08. If you use the rule of thumb, that's about $0.16 of benefit. And then, you would expect to see a little bit of benefit from all other foreign currencies, where there was a little bit of pressure this year. So that's a way to think about next year, if things hold at $1.18, and we hope they do.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Yes. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just a quick follow up on Mike's question. Just looking at the fourth quarter, I was under the impression back half of the year was going to be sort of 4%, 4.5%, so sort of implies the fourth quarter has to be closer to the 5% or a little higher. It's also the hardest comp of the year, so I just want to make sure that just given the hardest comp of the year you're still sort of confident you can get back to that number in the fourth quarter.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. So, David, as we said, the impact of the dispensing change would bring us from the high end of our guidance range of 4.5% to 5% for the year, down to the low end. So year-to-date, we're at 4.5%. So what that really implies for the fourth quarter is 4.5%. We do have some timing within the third and the fourth quarter, as I mentioned. The MMS International orders have slipped. We got some Kiestra installations that slip into the fourth quarter. So the combination of those things give us the confidence, and we see good strength across the rest of the business. The core is strong. Emerging markets growth, as I said, is looking very good, and Life Sciences is looking solid as well. So we feel good about the fourth quarter.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Vince \u2013 maybe, Tom, a quick question for Tom and a quick question for Vince. On Pyxis, I just want to get a sense of is the transition sort of progressing as expected? Has there been any underlying business disruption based on Pyxis? One of your competitors actually had a decent quarter.","And then, Vince, for you, on Bard integration, dynamics that are kind of more encouraging as the pre-integration planning has been going on, and any additional thoughts on what business could move in or out of the Interventional segment? Thanks so much.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good. Okay. Tom, you can take that.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hey, David. This is Tom. Actually no, we see very positive feedback on the Pyxis ES business model conversion and actually positive momentum in terms of share gain in that space. So actually customers have been very satisfied with the new model. Feedback has been very positive in terms of it aligning with their needs and flexibility interests going forward, as well as being able to capitalize on the new software solutions that we're coming out with today and ongoing in the future.","I'll turn it over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, as we said, we are making some really good progress in terms of the integration planning, what the portfolio looks like. We haven't announced to the organization yet the answer to the question that you're asking, so I don't want to get ahead of that.","We're doing work, of course, in the catheter area in terms of how that will come together. We know that we have to maintain focus on both the Pyxs and, of course, the IV catheter franchise and the structure that we're contemplating will continue to do that. But we are also looking at how we create this overall benefit in terms of enabling the customer base to optimize. And we think we've got great ideas there. And then we are looking at the surgical area and the various puts and takes there. So that's where we're at, but we'll be in great shape on those issues very, very quickly.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I should just add, too, that as we preliminarily look at the work on cost synergies, we feel real good about the $300 million of cost synergies that we articulated and we also feel equally as confident in having revenue synergies that are measurable in fiscal year 2019. So we're really reaffirming everything we said at the time of the transaction that we feel good about the cost synergies, the revenue synergies and the potential for those. So we've made good headway in the last couple of months on those issues.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just two questions end-market questions for you. One on Life Sciences. If I look across some of the peers this quarter there does seem to have been a little bit of a slowdown in the drug industry kind of spending rate and there are probably a wide range of reasons for that. But I'm curious if you could comment on what you're seeing in terms of activity from drug companies? What's baked into your outlook for the rest of the year?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Hi. This is Alberto. Good morning. We haven't seen any material change in the demand from the pharma companies. Now, a lot of these are driven by negotiations and discussions with us for a long period of time where the funding is secured. So we'll monitor that, but at the moment we are not seeing any big impact.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Advanced Bioprocessing is also a very small piece of our overall business. It tends to be lumpy, orders based, as Alberto was saying, and so we wouldn't see a big impact from that.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And certainly Pharm Systems year-to-date is 6.1% growth so we feel good about that, so.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And then just a follow up on the hospital spending environment. Appreciate you guys don't necessarily have a lot of exposure to major CapEx-type debates or what not, but interested in just this purchasing behavior. We've obviously seen a little bit of uncertainty around the policy side of hospital spending in the U.S., what that might mean for them. So I'm interested in how you're thinking about the evolution of hospital spending in the current environment.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well, you know I've had multiple discussions on that point with the customer base in the U.S. And, basically, what I've heard back from the customer base is, listen, we all believe this is still going to population-based health and there are things that we have to do from a capital perspective, and those things are multiyear programs. And so we are not changing the way we are going about things. Are we being careful? Yes, we are being careful. But those commitments, most of those larger capital commitments have been made in their multi year. So we're not really seeing anything from our standpoint.","Now when you step back and look at BD, we have small exposure to that, getting smaller with the move that we just made in terms of the change in the business model in MMS. And on the diagnostic side, most of what we do is reagent rental. So not a huge issue for us, but I would say over the next couple of years, we're expecting stability unless there is some major discontinuity in terms of where Congress ultimately goes, and so far Congress hasn't gone anywhere.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Makes sense. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Vince. Hi, Chris.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Rick.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Maybe just starting with your comments on the CareFusion cost synergies. You reaffirmed the $325 million, $350 million. Just wondering, is there a lot more to go? Is the bulk of it in the fiscal \u2013 the next 12 months? Just how do we think about that? And just as part of that, recently you've seemed a lot more concretely optimistic about seeing some CareFusion sales synergies. Not to be obsessed by it, but are you more optimistic about that as we look ahead as well?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So let me take the cost synergies. As you remember, we talked about those being relatively ratable over the three-year period, and that's what's playing out. So through 2016, we had about $170 million. We run about $80 million more per year on top of that. So that's what you would expect by the end of this year, and then the balance to the $325 million to $350 million would be in 2018. So that's pretty much on track, and you can see the benefit of that as we look at the margin growth.","As we talked about in our prepared remarks, we expect this year to drive 200 basis points to 225 basis points of operating margin improvement. That brings us to over 500 basis points of margin improvement in the last three years through 2017. And then, as you think about it, we're talking about the Bard transaction driving an average of 200 basis points over the next three years. That's a lot of basis points of operating margin improvement over a five-to-six-year period. So we feel real good about that, and that's what we're seeing. The first part of that is driven by the CareFusion synergies.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So coming to the revenue synergies, Rick, I think we're feeling very good about what we talked to you about when we signed the deal. And if you remember, the way this works is we can only do so much in that planning, where we are before close. But where we are in that process is, we've had teams meeting together and we had a hypothesis in terms of where those were going to occur; which product lines, which geographies.","We feel very good about that hypothesis having worked with the Bard team in terms of these are the focus areas, this is where we're going, this is where we're going to go after and get these things. Of course, we can't do the account level detailed planning yet, that comes later. But net-net, we feel very good about what we told you.","In addition ... (44:38)","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Hi, Rick. This is Tom. Maybe just to add and update some of the commentary, the details that we've shared in the past is, we do remain on track towards actually an ultimate target of now about 250 products registered ex-U.S. from CareFusion. We actually have about 150 of those approved already and are promoting and selling those.","There's another 75 products that has been submitted to regulatory agencies that are pending approval. And then, we're working on getting the final group of submissions made. So we're making really great progress there. We are seeing what I'll call kind of tens of bps of benefit in the overall Medical segment and company numbers.","And as we've always said, those revenue synergies have always been expected ex-U.S. and specifically focused on the International MPS and MMS businesses. And if you look at International MMS and MPS, you can see we're up about 7% growth year-to-date in both of those businesses internationally, and that's reflecting those revenue synergies.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. And, Rick, I thought you were asking me about Bard, and I was answering that. And Tom, of course, answered about CareFusion, but we're a great team.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","We got lots of revenue synergies on both sides. Yes.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. And just quickly, Vince, just you highlighted a couple of things in the pipeline. Thinking back to the Analyst Day, a part of the 5%-plus growth story pre-Bard was the exciting pipeline. Any updates on some of the exciting diabetes products, Kiestra, Barricor? You talked about BD MAX. Any updates that we should be paying attention to or thinking about? Thanks so much.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Well, I'll ask Alberto to do that on the Life Science side, and then Tom can pick it up on Medical, because there's a lot of good things to talk about.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So just on the Life Sciences, I'll highlight three launches or approvals this quarter, and Chris mentioned them. The FACSLyric, which is our next-generation clinical flow cytometry. We are very excited by that. It'll be much easier to use. Clinical software standardization across the different sites really will enable our customers to do very nicely.","Second one is in Kiestra, our urine application, which uses imaging to essentially automatically discard no-growth plates, which really will lighten the workload and concentrate the limited amount of resources our customers have to a more valuable tests basically. And the third one is Lyric, one more that I'm \u2013 the extended bacterial panel that was also that was also previously highlighted. That is the third element out of four of our Enteric series of panels overall. And the last one to be approved now is the viral panel.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And I'll just add a couple of longer-term comments on the Life Science side. So remain excited about the Resolve platform from the cellular research technology that we have. That's on track. And I think you've have been doing, Alberto, some customer testing with that.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Right.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And excited about that.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And just to complete the picture, MAX, we expect the 20-plus percent growth rate \u2013 normally we have this quarter, but for the year. Kiestra in the double digits, and our Core Microbiology franchise grew over 5% year-to-date as well. So we're very confident about our Core products.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And I also mentioned in the prepared remarks the UltraTouch showed some benefit this quarter.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","It's being very well received in the market.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. So on the Life Science side, we are feeling very good about it. If there's one thing, Rick, that's been a little slow, it's been the Barricor launch, and it's just taken longer. We've got a good pipeline, but it's taking longer to convert the customer base and we've got to improve that process. But everything else we were showing you is on track. So, Tom, do you want to do the other side.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Hi, Rick. This is Tom. On the Medical side, maybe just to hit a couple highlights across the businesses. First, is we have launched in the last few quarters some new enterprise software for our Cato and Pharmogistics platforms in MMS. That's doing extremely well. We've seen really positive customer uptake as those products are letting them manage compounding, as well as their inventory for pharmaceutical products across multiple hospitals within their network.","Within MPS, we're continuing a launch of our Medication Management consumables there. We've actually just launched a new infusion set for Asia as part of our revenue synergy strategy. That's off to a good start. And at Analyst Day, we had shared we have plans to launch two new infection prevention products per year going forward, and that's very much on track for 2018, those products, and you'll hear more about those as we move ahead.","And then on Swatch, as you mentioned, in diabetes care, no changes. We remain on track for end of fiscal year FY2018 for our launch in the U.S. of Swatch. Maybe one other area that we often get questions on is IV Solutions.","As you know, there's a number of different formulations and bag sizes that customers need to run their institution. And we have our partner, Fresenius, that we've been working with to bring that broad portfolio of products to the U.S. market. To date, our partner's gotten FDA approval for the 5% dextrose, and we've begun marketing and selling that to customers. And additional formulations, including kind of the large volume saline product, we're still expecting approval in the coming months. Hopefully by the end of the calendar year.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks so much.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe I'll start one on \u2013 the first one on the revenue guidance. Chris, obviously the stock is indicating off here in the pre-market. And I (50:28) think people are nervous, investors are nervous, on the set-up heading into back half and the implied fourth-quarter guidance. I mean, if I take a step back to the picture laid out at the Analyst Day, right. So we were looking for north of 5% organic during the 17th and 19th year.","So if you look at where we are today, (51:03) organic, we are looking at a stock with a story of \u2013 accelerating organic into 4Q and a step into 4.5% and then possibly 5%, or north of 5%, for 2018. Can you talk us, one, what degree of confidence we have for the fourth quarter ramp up? And then, what's the delta between 2017 and 2018, right? Where is that incremental growth coming from?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, Vijay. So, as we mentioned before, if you really peel back the on the underlying performance for the year, year-to-date we're 4.5%, but that's in the face of significant headwinds from this U.S. dispensing change that we had of about 50 basis points. That puts you right at the 5% level, so we feel really good about that. Clearly, the headline is depressed by the dispensing model. We knew that was the risk. We tried to communicate that, that that would be a pressure in the second half of this year.","You're going to see that same kind of pressure year-over-year in the first half of next year. And that's to be expected. It's the right thing to do. It positions us extremely well competitively in that business. And it actually helps us better focus on our customers and their needs.","So, we're doing it for all the right reasons, but it clearly is going to depress the headline. We knew that. We also knew that the timing was going to be a headwind in the second half of the year, because of the fact that we were running so hot in the first half of the year, 5.6%. So that had an impact as well. So, as I said earlier, the underlying for the quarter was 4.5%. It would have been 5%, except for the little bit of pressure we saw in MPS in normalization of inventories in the diabetes piece. So that would have been a strong 5% in the quarter as well.","As we look out into the fourth quarter, we're very confident by a number of things that we see; the timing coming back to us a little bit on some of the things that moved from the third to the fourth quarter, but the strength of the core business is the most important. And look at the emerging market growth; that's the strongest it's been in a couple of years. We really feel good about that. The rest of the business is solid. So we really feel good about that as well, so it really hasn't changed from what we were talking about, in terms of the momentum of the business and the underlying business, when we talked at Analyst Day.","And then, going forward into next year, we feel that same strength continuing again, albeit with the pressure of the headwinds of the dispensing change in the first half of the year. But for the full-year, that will normalize, because it'll be six months versus six months this year.","So on the top line, we feel very good about the momentum that we have. And then, the ability to take that up to the 5%-to-6% level with the Bard transaction as that occurs. So, from a top-line basis, we're feeling like the momentum is there.","And then, we haven't really talked about the EPS line, but when you look at that chart 15, we're driving 15% to 17% underlying EPS, FX and growth, and that's overcoming the Respiratory dilution of about 1.5%. That's really strong growth. Then you got the headwinds from the dispensing change that we have, which is real. That $60 million dollars of revenue that drops to the bottom line, there's some cost related to that as well. We're overcoming that. We're overcoming the headwinds that we saw in FX this year, which, although it's abated a little bit, that's still 3.5% of headwinds from year-over-year FX pressure. Hopefully, that turns around next year.","So from a bottom line, we're feeling really good going forward as well. So, hopefully that addressed your question.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","That does, and that was very helpful. And then, maybe one for Vince. Looks like the confidence on the Bard deal closure, it just sounded \u2013 I'm trying to piece everything together, right? So you mentioned the November-to-December timeframe, the FTC's second request. And then also, I think you mentioned about integration being ahead of where we were in a comparable timeframe on the CareFusion. Can you just put all of those together? What's the incremental confidence we have that this may not slip out to January? Or what's the key gating factors in terms of deal closing? I think that would be helpful.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Sure. And so, we never thought that the U.S. was going to be the gating factor in terms of getting the deal closed. We always thought that China was the long pole in the tent, and that remains exactly the way we saw it. So, we expected a second request in the U.S. It was no surprise to us. We're dealing with the issues that they raised, and we expect to deal with them quickly. So our view in terms of the closing time really hasn't changed at all, because of those two factors.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Co.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. There's three topics I'd like to cover. First, on revenue guidance. Our math suggests that around 100 basis points of fourth quarter revenue growth is a function of revenue that moved out of Q3 into Q4. I just want to see if we're in the right neighborhood there.","Secondly, on margins. Gross margin was solid this quarter. It doesn't seem like there was anything abnormal there. How should we think about the sustainability? And moving lower in the P&L, third quarter operating margin was above the full-year guidance target. I'm just wondering if we should be contemplating a pick-up in investment in our fourth-quarter model? And on the same topic, I just want to make sure that some of the Bioscience issues in the second quarter that impacted margins are now fully resolved. And the last topic is just on the pipeline. What's the status of the diabetes infusion set rollout? Thank you.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well, let me see if I can get some of those questions. I think your timing is about right in terms of Q3 to Q4; that feels about right. And we feel good about the ability to hit the 200 basis points to 225 basis points of margin improvement, you mentioned abnormal. The only thing abnormal is that we are driving 200 basis points to 225 basis points of margin improvement this year, and 500 basis points over the last 3 years. So, we feel really good about that.","There is say a little bit of easier compare in the fourth-quarter as I think I mentioned, because R&D ramped so much in the fourth-quarter of last year as a result of the medical device tax repeal. And so that makes it a little bit easier. The operating margins this quarter are a little misleading because of the fact that Respiratory really had an impact in there. When you peel back the Respiratory piece, you see really good margin growth.","The gross profit margin in the quarter was 100 basis points faster than revenue growth. And both OIBT and EPS were very strong in the quarter when you back out the overhang from respiratory. So feel real good about that.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Bioscience is back to normal, right, Alberto?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Absolutely back to normal, minimal impact this quarter and 100% back to into stocked position.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. You saw the growth of over 7% in the quarter. So we feel good about that.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And Bill (sic) [Doug] this is Tom. On the infusion set, so we are in the process of, as I think we had shared in the past, we've gotten some complaints during the initial launch. We were in the process of running a clinical trial to confirm that some of the new training tools that we've included in the packaging optimized the patient's ability to start using this set. That clinical trial is going exactly as planned and our guidance assumes we resume the launch in FY 2018.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks for your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I guess I was just wondering if you could update us on kind of the outlook for emerging markets for Becton as you think about it organically and with Bard. You had a little bit better performance this quarter. So just curious if you could give us some insight into the moving parts there, and then how you think about the next year or two?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well, I'll kick it off and then if Chris wants to add some more detail. What you saw in the quarter was of course strong performance in emerging markets, strong performance in China. The Middle East bounced back, and the rest of Asia. So, and then good performance in Latin America.","So I would characterize it this way, Latin America has been stable through all of this, even with all the political stuff that has been going on. And they continue to prioritize health care down there in terms of spending and modernization and access. So with all of that, we see that continuing.","If I go back to Asia for you, what's changed China for us is the rebound on the capital equipment side. We had good performance through some difficult times in China on the device side of things, on the disposable side, but on the Life Sciences side has really come back. We're seeing strong performance with multiple platforms in China, and we expect them to continue to ramp there. So, we feel very good about China looking forward. The rest of Asia continues to do well and had strong performance.","India is a little bit more of a question mark from the standpoint of just things like tariffs and what not. But we think we'll be okay from a revenue growth standpoint. And then lastly, just coming back to the Middle East, what we saw was the stabilization in Saudi Arabia. And where that was a big drag, that is no longer a big drag for us. And where we had in Africa a drag from CD4 testing, that's not a significant drag anymore. And in fact, some new guidance came out just recently Alberto, I think, from the WHO on continuing using CD4.","So all of that, we are feeling good about our guidance for the year in terms of high-single digits. And continued success moving on from there.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I have nothing to add. The year-to-date is 9.1%. That is a very high-single digits, and the momentum continues. And as I mentioned earlier, it was our best performance in two years in emerging markets. So we feel good about the momentum there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter Leerink Swann \u2013 or Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the comment, I think you said that pricing got a little bit worse or the headwinds intensified a touch. Can you elaborate on that specifically, and was there a specific division? Thanks.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. So there was about 20 bps of pressure in the quarter. Year-to-date, it's about 20 bps in total after the first quarter being flat, and the second quarter, actually, was down about 30 bps, so it's actually moderated a little bit from that. That's the kind of plus and minus we have seen for a while now, is 20 bps to 30 bps, up, flat, down, somewhere in that range. We did mention that we are seeing pricing pressure in the U.K. in diabetes care from the austerity measures and the government payers. So that's continued, but pretty much in that range.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe on just your Safety business outside the U.S. Can you just talk about where you are on the conversion opportunity across the various geographies? I know that you were up against tough comps. The growth rate reflects that. But how should we think about the sustainability of kind of penetration from that ...","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Tom can walk you through that and Alberto can pick up on the diagnostic side, so.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hi, Richard. This is Tom. Yes. As you mentioned, within the quarter, we did see \u2013 there's a very tough compare because last year in the quarter, Safety revenues grew 9% overall, and that was including 20% growth in emerging markets, driven \u2013 and that was particularly concentrated in the Medical segment, that difficult compare where there was timing of tenders in Asia and EMEA in that quarter that aided that high growth rate.","As you think about the outlook though for Safety, no fundamental changes to what we had shared in prior quarters. We still see about 50% of the way through the safety conversion in Europe, and so certainly, a runway remains there for the next several years. And in emerging markets, we are still certainly sub 20% conversion as you think about markets like China, the rest of emerging markets even less than that, less than 15% or 10% conversion and so still a long runway to go there.","Obviously, the key to success in driving that is driving the legislative changes that really start mandating health-care institutions to convert to safety products. You saw that happen in Europe, and we continue to work with governments around the world, particularly, again, in emerging markets to help shape that policy and marketplace.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Anything you'd like to add, Alberto?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. For (65:22) for the quarter, we did have a very difficult compare last year, grew over 10%. So that was \u2013 and then it's mostly just timing of tenders outside the U.S. is mostly what affected it, but otherwise no big change.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And you continue to have a long runway in emerging markets?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","In emerging markets for sure. Yes.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. A lot of my questions have been asked, but just one follow up to something going on in this market. We've seen so many other suppliers of safety syringes and pre-fillables and injectable drug packaging sort of comment on generic de-stocking and sort of some issues with their customer and slowing (66:13). Any of that sort of impacting you, are you noticing any change in buying patterns or buying behaviors from those customers?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","This is Tom. No. I mean, if you look at \u2013 now, keep in perspective, most of our drug delivery devices are probably not as much used for the generic space because a large portion are in the biologics. Obviously, that's still relatively early in biosimilars. And if you look at our Pharm Systems business, I think we're up 6.7% year-to-date there, so very strong performance.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks for the question.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the conference over to Vince Forlenza.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Well, thank you very much.","Maybe to sum up here, we're really excited about Bard and the progress so far is exceeding our expectations. As we said, we're ahead of where we expected to be in the integration planning and getting more and more confident around the business model. We're confident and feel good about our outlook for the remainder of the year. And lastly, we're really pleased we're able to jump over significant headwinds that we mentioned on the call. And I think we're doing this because of really excellent execution by the folks in the businesses around the world.","So thank you very much, and I look forward to briefing you next quarter. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."],"3585":["Becton, Dickinson & Co.

It will be available for replay through May 10, 2018 on the Investors page of the BD.com website or by phone at 1-800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 2857189. I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment. Beginning today's call is Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique N. Dolecki - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to review our second fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at BD.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our second fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance.","Reconciliations to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release including the financial schedules is posted on the BD.com website. The details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures, in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","As a reminder, our second quarter P&L results reflect the new BD which includes the results of CR Bard for the full quarter. To provide additional revenue visibility into the new BD, we will speak to our revenue results and fiscal 2018 revenue guidance on a comparable currency neutral basis. The comparable basis includes BD and Bard in the current and prior year periods and excludes the revenues associated with our biopsy and Aspira drainage product lines that were divested in February.","Lastly, we have again provided slides that illustrate the new reportable segment and business unit structure of the combined company and the key brand mapping for the units within the Medical and Interventional segments. These slides can also be found in the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","Before I turn the call over to Vince, we would like to comment on some leadership changes that we announced last week. First, we are very pleased to have named Alberto Mas current segment President for Life Sciences as the new segment President for Medical effective May 29. Alberto has successfully served as segment president of Life Sciences for the past two years developing a strong team focused on driving innovation and growth. Alberto previously held president roles as the leader of three major BD business units including Bio Sciences, Diagnostic Systems and what was known as Medical Surgical Systems. With Alberto's move to the Medical segment we are excited to announce that Patrick Kaltenbach will join BD to serve as segment President for Life Sciences also beginning May 29. Patrick comes to us from Agilent Technologies where he most recently served as president of the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group, Agilent's largest business group, well known and highly regarded throughout the life sciences community, Patrick brings tremendous industry expertise to BD and deep global experience that uniquely prepare him to succeed in this critical role.","John Groetelaars, current president of the Interventional segment has decided to leave BD for the position of President and CEO of Hill-Rom. While we are disappointed that John is leaving, we are pleased that Bill Tozzi current BD Bard integration leader has stepped in as interim segment president for Interventional beginning May 1. Throughout his 40 year career with BD, Bill has held a number of key leadership positions. After serving as Company Controller, Bill was worldwide president of the Medication and Procedural Solutions business during the CareFusion integration.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, President; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and currently the President of the Life Sciences Segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Monique and good morning everyone. Before we discuss the company's performance in the quarter, I would like to comment briefly on the organizational changes, Monique just mentioned. We are happy to name Alberto Mas to the open role of segment president for Medical. Alberto has had an exemplary career with BD making significant lasting contributions in roles spanning the businesses, regions and functions over more than 25 years. We're confident Alberto is the right leader to continue to advance the Medical segment strategy and lead the segment in its next phase of growth.","We also look forward to having Patrick Kaltenbach on board as the segment president for Life Sciences to continue to advance our strategy of becoming a transformative partner from discovery to diagnosis. Attracting an industry leader of Patrick's caliber to BD highlights our commitment to the strategy we have for our Life Sciences segment, the progress we've made and the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead.","While we take time to confirm the right successor, we are also pleased to have appointed Bill Tozzi as interim segment president for Interventional. With Bill's deep integration experience and the strong segment leadership team continuing to drive the business forward, we're confident we will maintain the Interventional segment momentum.","I would also like to thank John Groetelaars for his contribution to Bard. I know that everyone at BD wishes him much success in the next chapter of his career. We are confident our new segment leadership team has the experience, capabilities and drive necessary to continue to execute on our strategy and our transformation into a bigger, better and bolder BD.","Now turning to slide 4. This quarter marks an important milestone in BD's history as it is the first time reporting our results as the new BD, which combines the BD and Bard businesses generating over $4 billion in revenues in the quarter. We are committed to providing our customers and their patients with leading medical technologies and innovative solutions that improve the treatment of disease for patients and the process of care for health care providers. We are confident we have the team in place to execute on our strategy and we remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2018 and 2019 accretion commitments.","Turning to slide 5 and our second quarter highlights. Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate our early progress as the new BD. Revenue performance exceeded our expectations and was driven by strong growth across all three segments as well as the impact of the flu season. Our results reflect continued momentum, both in BD's core and the Bard businesses. On a legacy basis, Bard revenue grew 8.5% in the second quarter.","The integration of Bard is also off to a strong start. We are executing against our detailed plans and have begun to realize our year one cost synergies as expected. In addition, at the end of the second quarter, we reached the one-year anniversary of the U.S. dispensing change. We are proud to be the only company that has been able to execute this business model change within one year and transform our customers' experience. This important initiative was received very positively by our customers and has laid the groundwork for us to execute upon our medication management strategy going forward.","In April, we divested our remaining interest in the Vyaire Medical joint venture. As we shared with you at the time of creating the joint venture, the respiratory business was not core to BD's strategy. Our year-to-date performance along with our current outlook gives us confidence to raise our fiscal 2018 revenue guidance to the high-end of our prior range.","On the bottom line, we are increasing our fiscal 2018 EPS guidance as a result of more favorable foreign currency. We are maintaining our currency neutral EPS growth expectations, as slight headwinds in the second half of the year from the Vyaire divestiture, some anticipated incremental clinical trial expenses in our pre-analytical systems business and increased material costs are expected to offset our increased revenue outlook. Chris will provide more details on this later in the presentation.","In summary, we're very pleased with our performance and are confident in our outlook as we move forward as the new BD.","I will now turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our second quarter fiscal performance and our fiscal year 2018 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to slide 7, I'll review our second quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights. As Vince mentioned, our performance as the new BD is strong. Second quarter revenue growth was ahead of our expectations and was driven by strong growth across all three segments, a stronger than expected flu season and favorable foreign currency.","On a comparable basis, revenues grew 5.7%, driven by strength across all three segments. Our second quarter results included the adverse impact from the U.S. dispensing change, which lowered revenue growth by approximately 80 basis points. As Vince mentioned, we have annualized this change, and accordingly, the second quarter was the final quarter with the year-over-year comparison issue related to the U.S. dispensing change.","Offsetting the headwinds in the quarter from the dispensing change were flu revenues that contributed approximately 80 basis points to total company revenue growth. Excluding both of these items, underlying revenues also grew 5.7%.","Pricing declined about 50 basis points in the second quarter, in line with our expectations. I will provide more color on revenue growth in the quarter in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and geography.","Adjusted EPS of $2.65 grew 15.2% or 7.8% on a currency neutral basis. This includes the adverse impact of approximately 500 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change as expected. Adjusting for this, currency neutral EPS growth was in the low teens. Growth was driven by strong performance of both the legacy BD and Bard businesses. In addition, FX was a tailwind this quarter due to the year-over-year weakening of the U.S. dollar.","As Vince mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our first quarter as a combined entity. Our current outlook reflects our second quarter revenue outperformance and continued momentum over the second half of the year. As a result, we are raising our revenue guidance to the high end of our previous range. We are also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to reflect a more favorable benefit from foreign currency.","We are maintaining our currency-neutral EPS guidance, as we anticipate some incremental expenses in the second half of the year. I'll provide more detailed guidance commentary later in my remarks.","Before we move on, I also want to point out that as of March 31, our gross leverage ratio declined to 4.5 times, driven by growth in EBITDA and the pay-down of $100 million of debt. We are on target with our commitment to deleverage to below 3 times over three years.","Moving on to slide 8, I'll review the revenue growth by segment on a comparable currency-neutral basis.","BD Medical second quarter revenues increased 4.2%, which includes a headwind of approximately 160 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change.","Revenues in Medication Delivery Solutions or MDS grew 4.9% in the second quarter. Growth was driven by strength in vascular access and vascular care, which includes our prefilled flush devices.","Revenues in Medication Management Solutions or MMS grew 0.5%. Revenue growth was impacted by a headwind of approximately 580 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change. Underlying MMS revenue growth was driven by strong adoption of Pyxis ES in the U.S. as well as international growth in infusion.","Diabetes Care revenues grew 5.7% driven by growth in pen needles in the U.S. and strength in emerging markets that was aided by the timing of tenders that we had initially anticipated in the third quarter. Diabetes Care revenue growth also reflects a favorable comparison to the prior year.","In Pharmaceutical Systems, revenues grew 7.9%. This reflects incremental market demand for our large pharmaceutical and biotech customers, for our Hypak and other prefillable drug delivery devices.","Turning to slide 9 and the BD Life Sciences segment. Second quarter revenues increased 7.3%. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in Biosciences and Diagnostic Systems, which was aided by a stronger flu season in comparison to last year and contributed an estimated 300 basis points to Life Sciences growth. On a year-to-date basis, the flu contributed approximately 170 basis points to Life Sciences revenue growth of 7.3%.","Revenues in Diagnostic Systems grew 12.6% in the quarter. Performance was driven by strength in core microbiology and continued strong growth in our BD MAX molecular platform, partially offset by the timing of Kiestra installations in the U.S. In addition, the flu season contributed over 800 basis points to Diagnostic Systems growth in the quarter.","Preanalytical Systems growth of 1% reflects a tough comparison to the prior year and the impact of a production issue in one of our product lines, which was resolved during the quarter.","Biosciences revenues grew 8.9% in the quarter. This reflects growth in our newer research instruments, such as the FACSMelody and FACSymphony analyzer, as well as continued strength in research reagents. Growth was also aided by a favorable comparison to the prior year.","Now turning to slide 10 and the BD Interventional segment. Second quarter revenues increased 7.1%.","Revenues in Peripheral Intervention grew 10.9% in the quarter. Performance reflects strength in drug-coated balloons driven by AV indication, strong international growth in biopsy products, particularly in China, and the continued strong growth in LIFESTREAM stents that were launched in May 2017.","Growth of 4.2% in Surgery was driven by our diverse leading hernia platform as well as strong international growth in infection prevention, partially offset by a continued hold on Progel that adversely impacted growth in Surgery in the quarter by approximately 70 basis points.","Urology and Critical Care revenues grew 6.5% in the quarter. This reflects growth in our global urology portfolio, including our acute and non-acute products. Growth also benefited from the timing of capital orders in our temperature management business from the first quarter to the second quarter.","Moving to slide 11, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the second quarter on a comparable, currency neutral basis. U.S. revenues grew 4% in the second quarter which includes an estimated headwind of 150 basis points from the U.S. dispensing change.","Growth in the U.S. was driven by strength across multiple businesses and the impact of the flu season. Within the BD Medical segment in the U.S., growth was driven by the Medication Delivery Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units. BD Life Sciences segment results in the U.S. reflects strength in the Diagnostic Systems and Biosciences units. Revenues in the Preanalytical Systems units were adversely impacted by the previously mentioned production issue in one of our product lines. Within the BD Interventional segment in the U.S., growth was driven by performance across all three businesses.","Moving on to international, revenues grew 7.9% in the second quarter. Growth was driven by broad strength across Medical, Life Sciences and Interventional segments.","Developed Markets grew 4.6% in the second quarter including an estimated headwind from the U.S. dispensing change of 90 basis points. Growth in Developed Markets was driven by strong performance in the U.S. as previously discussed, and strength in Europe in the Surgery, Urology and Critical Care, Diagnostics Systems and Biosciences unit.","Second quarter emerging markets revenues grew 12.4%. Revenues in China grew 13.3%, with double digit growth across all three segments. Double digit revenue growth in EMA was driven by infusion disposables and Medication Delivery Solutions and also reflects the Diabetes Care tender timing as previously discussed.","Revenues in Latin America grew high-single digits driven by strength across core microbiology and Diagnostic systems and research instruments and reagents in Biosciences as well as strong performance across the Interventional segment.","Turning to slide 12 which recaps the second quarter income statement and highlights our currency neutral results. As discussed, revenues were ahead of our expectations growing 5.7% in the quarter including approximately 80 basis points negative impact from the U.S. dispensing change.","Moving down the P&L starting with gross profit. Gross profit increased 45.9% year-over-year. I'll provide additional details on gross profit in just a moment.","SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 25.0% which reflects Bard's higher SSG&A spend profile. R&D as a percentage of revenues were 6.2% which reflects our continued commitment to invest in innovation. Both SSG&A and R&D reflect spending in a few key programs that was accelerated into the quarter from later in the fiscal year and offset some of our second quarter revenue outperformance on the bottom line.","Our tax rate was 16.9% in the quarter which is in line with our full year guidance range. Operating margins increased 290 basis points reflecting strong P&L leverage as the new BD. As expected, we paid preferred dividends of $38 million in the quarter. The preferred dividend is more dilutive to EPS than the additional preferred shares and as a result preferred shares are excluded from the adjusted diluted shares outstanding calculation.","In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.65 which is a 15.2% increase versus the prior year, or 7.8% on a currency neutral basis. Both operating income and EPS include approximately 500 basis points of negative impact from the U.S. dispensing change. Adjusting for the impact of the U.S. dispensing change, currency neutral EPS growth was in the low teens.","Earnings were ahead of our expectations due to strong revenue growth and more favorable FX partially offset by our decision to accelerate investments in SSG&A and R&D in the quarter as previously discussed.","Now turning to slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the second quarter. Gross profit margin was a strong 56.1% in the second quarter. On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved 340 basis points. This reflects the inclusion of Bard's more robust gross margin profile as well as our continuous improvement initiatives, cost synergies and favorable mix.","These items were partially offset by a headwind of 80 basis points from a combination of the U.S. dispensing change, raw materials and pricing. Currency had a positive impact of 10 basis points on gross profit margin. Operating margin grew 290 basis points in the quarter. This was driven by gross margin improvement partially offset by the increase in SSG&A and R&D as previously discussed. Currency had a positive impact of 30 basis points on operating margin in the quarter.","I'll take you through our fiscal 2018 guidance over the next several slides, but while we are discussing margins, I'd like to point out that we continue to expect to deliver significant underlying margin expansion of 200 basis points to 250 basis points this fiscal year which is in addition to approximately 500 basis points of margin expansion over the last three years.","Moving on to slide 15 and our full fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance. As previously discussed, we are raising our currency-neutral revenue guidance for the total company to 5% to 5.5% growth on a comparable basis which is the high-end of our previous range. This represents strong underlying growth of 5.5% to 6% excluding the estimated impact from U.S. dispensing change and the Bard impact from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in the quarter that ended December 31, 2017.","While we are maintaining our Medical and Interventional segment revenue guidance ranges, based on our strong year-to-date performance and current outlook, we expect to be higher in those ranges than previously anticipated. As a reminder, our Interventional segment guidance also excludes the first quarter impact from Hurricane Maria. We are increasing our guidance for our Life Sciences segment to 5% to 6% growth primarily as a result of the stronger than expected flu season.","We continue to expect revenue growth to be driven by recent product launches across all three segments and strength in both developed and emerging markets. Our increased revenue guidance reflects developed market growth of around 4% to 4.5% in fiscal 2018 or around 4.5% to 5% excluding the estimated 50 basis point impact from the U.S. dispensing change and the hurricane in Puerto Rico. In emerging markets, we continue to expect low-double digit growth driven by a diversified base with mid-teens growth in China and strength in EMA and Latin America.","Moving on to slide 16 and our full fiscal 2018 EPS guidance. There are a number of moving parts that impact earnings per share in fiscal 2018. For modeling purposes and to ensure consistency, I'd like to provide more color on EPS guidance. Starting on the left half of the chart with the guidance we provided on our February earnings call, we expected adjusted EPS of $10.85 to $11. This reflected currency-neutral growth of approximately 12% or 14% to 15% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in operating income excluding headwinds of 2% to 3% from the U.S. dispensing change. Assuming foreign currency rates in place at that time we expected currency would provide a 3.5% tailwind in fiscal 2018 resulting in an expected EPS growth of approximately 15% to 16%.","Our current guidance reflects our strong year-to-date performance and our updated revenue outlook as well as more favorable FX. Partially offsetting these increases are costs associated with additional clinical trials and investments in our quality systems in PAS that we anticipate occurring in the second half of the year as well as increased material costs. In addition, the divestiture of the Vyaire joint venture results in approximately $0.03 of pressure. All in, this results in a $0.05 increase to our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10.90 to $11.05 which represents growth of 15% to 16.5%. On a currency-neutral basis we continue to expect approximately 12% adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2018.","Our FX assumptions assume a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.23. Even with today's euro at $1.20, our full year outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect to deliver low-single digit accretion in fiscal year 2018 and high-single digit accretion in fiscal year 2019. We are committed to fully realizing $300 million in annualized cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2020.","Now turning to slide 17, I'd like to walk you through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2018. As a reminder, this guidance includes the results of Bard as of January 1, 2018, which is the beginning of our second fiscal quarter.","On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 31% and 31.5% which reflects a currency tailwind of about 250 basis points, an improvement from our prior guidance of about 200 basis points of tailwinds.","For fiscal year 2018, we continue to anticipate our adjusted average fully diluted share count to be approximately 261 million shares. For modeling purposes, I would like to point out that the net income reflects the deduction of approximately $114 million of preferred dividends. And the preferred shares are excluded from the adjusted diluted shares outstanding. Beyond revenues and EPS, all other P&L guidance from February remained unchanged.","In summary, I'm excited about the strong momentum we have across both the BD and Bard businesses and I'm highly confident that we will deliver on our commitments in fiscal year 2018 and beyond.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Chris. Moving on to slide 19, as we have been discussing with you, our integration of CareFusion is largely complete and we are on track to achieve our cost and revenue synergy commitments.","At the same time, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are making excellent progress with Bard. Our organizational design and integration plan are in place and we are pivoting from planning to execution.","As previously communicated, our initial focus is on public company costs and procurement savings. We have already begun to realize some of those savings and we have comprehensive work streams in place with assigned accountability for the future realization of operational cost synergies. We have also begun our investment in revenue synergies that we discussed with you last quarter.","We have started hiring salespeople in Europe for our Biosurgery and ChloraPrep platforms and also have started cross-training our strategic account management group. We look forward share updates with you as we make additional progress across our initiatives.","Turning to slide 20 and our planned product launches by segment, let's start with our Medical segment. Our new BD HealthSight platform for enterprise medication management that was introduced at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists meeting in December is being well received by our customers. This new platform offers a unique combination of connective technologies, analytics and expert services to help close the communication gap across disparate solutions and drive a safer, more efficient medication management process.","In our Life Sciences segment, as anticipated, we continue the targeted expansion of our BD MAX menu and are starting to gain traction in the EU with our Enteric Viral Panel that we launched at the end of the second quarter.","In addition, as expected, we received FDA approval of our BD Onclarity HPV assay which further differentiates our women's health offering. The BD Onclarity HPV assay detects and identifies HPV genotypes that put women at high risk for cervical cancer and provides information to guide physician decision-making.","Moving on to the Interventional segment. As we discussed last quarter, our new low-profile 5Fr. ProSeries Life Stent platform that launched in the EU mid-year 2017, received FDA approval in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter, we launched this new platform in the U.S. as expected. This new stent family provides the lowest profile, longest lengths and broadest indications for any peripheral arterial stent.","In mesh fixation, we launched a new resorbable-tack fixation device named OptiFix Open. This new family is designed to aid in open hernia repair and will deliver resorbable tacks through a curved distal tip.","And in Urology and Critical Care, we recently launched our new Magic3 GO Male intermittent catheter family. This new product incorporates our proprietary silicon technology of the Magic3 family with our new low friction coating technology that doesn't require the use of a water sachet or the need to lubricate the catheter prior to use.","As you can see, we have a very rich pipeline of new products across our businesses, and we look forward to sharing additional updates with you along the way.","Before I move on, I would like to remind you that we have again included a slide in the appendix of today's presentation that provides an update on our sustainability initiatives. We hope you find the information useful in understanding BD's commitment to this important topic.","Moving on to slide 21. I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. Our strong performance reflects our early progress as the new BD and the momentum across both the BD and Bard businesses. The integration of Bard is also off to a strong start. We remain committed to achieving our cost synergy commitments and have begun our investment in revenue synergies. We increased our revenue and EPS guidance as a result of our strong year-to-date performance and our expectation for continued momentum over the second half of the year.","In summary, we are very pleased with our performance and are confident in our outlook for fiscal year 2018 and beyond as we move forward as the new BD.","Before we open the call for questions, we'd like to take a moment to congratulate Mike Weinstein on his retirement from JPMorgan. Mike is an influential thought leader and has made a significant impact on shaping the sell-side coverage of the med tech industry. Mike, we wish you all the best in the future and hope that our paths will cross again. And, Robbie, we look forward to working with you.","So thank you, and we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys, a very solid quarter. Vince, one for you and then maybe one for Tom. Just, Vince, discussing the outlook in the back half of the year, if I back out the flu benefit this quarter, I think maybe it was 75 bps. Momentum was very stable first and second quarter. At the high-end of your range guidance for the back half of the year seems to bet rough stability, maybe slight momentum deceleration. How do you see momentum into the back half of the year relative to the guidance range?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, we see momentum continuing in the back half of the year. The only change I really see from momentum standpoint is really the flu, as you just mentioned. But we're feeling very good across all three segments. And we raised the Life Sciences guidance, but we think that we're going to see good momentum in the other two segments as well towards the upper end of the range.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And, Tom, the big change this quarter for Bard, obviously, underlying Bard was up about 1 to 2 points, kind of 8.5% versus 7% last quarter. Can you just discuss some of the drivers behind that reacceleration here in the second quarter? And how you see the Bard outlook for the remainder of the year? Thanks so much.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Hi, David. So I think as you saw strong performance across all three of the Bard businesses, Peripheral Intervention, Surgery, and Urology\/Critical Care driven by a lot of new product launches in each of those areas.","As we think about the back half of the year as you noted, we do expect growth in the back half to continue strong, and we're very confident in our full year range. We did benefit from some timing in the first half, some orders in temperature management in Urology. And we're going to begin to lap several key product launches in the back half, specifically the Lutonix AV and LIFESTREAM covered stent in the back half.","So we may see the back half slightly lower than the first half, but that's just due to that timing topic and the lapping those key product launches. But very solidly within the range, feel very confident about that.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thank you. Just on the Bard integration process, it looked like you guys reiterated your synergy goals. Just hoping to get a little more color on where the integration team is currently focused, kind of key initiatives over the next 12 months just from a step-by-step process? Thank you.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, Isaac. So as we have said before, the initial focus on synergies is the public company costs, which are pretty much behind us, as well as then the initial procurement savings, and that's typically the first bucket of synergy savings that you get.","I talk about this kind of as three separate buckets of $300 million, think about it as $100 million, $100 million, $100 million.","In the current year we'll get something like \u2013 because it's only three quarters \u2013 $70 million to $80 million and then you can think about it as ratable over the next two years.","But in the third year, let's say, that's when you start getting your manufacturing and operational synergies. They take a little bit longer to plan, so that's why it takes that long.","And then in the second bucket, in the second year, you can think about getting some of the process kind of improvements, things like shared service centers, integration of IT and the like, and the integration of functions. That's kind of a general sense of how to think about that.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And this is Vince. So in addition to that, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've started to work on the revenue synergies. And so we're doing the detailed account planning in the U.S., we've got the key account group involved in that, so that's off to an excellent start. And then in Europe, in the Surgery business, we started to build out the sales force for that area for both ChloraPrep and Biosurgery. So those are the two real short-term initiatives.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then maybe just a follow up on BD Life Sciences, with Patrick taking over, obviously, he brings a nice track record from Agilent. I was hoping you could maybe give us a little color as to how the strategic direction there might evolve under his leadership? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, I'm very excited to have him coming on board May 29, and I think he brings a broad view and a very deep view of the industry. I think what's attracted him is the programs that we have that are ongoing, both on, I'll call it the Life Sciences research side broadly and the opportunities we have around BD Biosciences, and we've been talking to you about some of them, the different markets that we can take flow into, including cell therapy, single-cell genomics. And he brings really in-depth knowledge of, I'll call them, companion spaces for you.","Also for him, I think, which is exciting is the opportunities we have on the diagnostics side of the business and how we can drive that. So what you should expect is that it will be about implementation around those opportunities in the short run, and then creating a more expansive strategy as we move forward.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Talk a little bit about flu real quickly. Can you talk about success with Veritor, where you are in terms of placements at this point? And also is there anything going on with new menu there or any other feature sets that you're going to be adding to Veritor as we get ready for the next flu season?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Alberto, would you like to take that?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes, we've continued to put more and more placements out there in terms of the flu. We're up to approximately 30,000 units out there that are currently working. We are taking share primarily from the manual segment, so we're doing well from that perspective and we launched our connected version of Veritor, if you like, recently as well, which has enabled us to penetrate more on the retail segment as well. Due to the broader menu, we are working on additional assays, but I think it's a little bit too early to be specific about it at this point.","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then as a follow up, we talked a lot about overall BD and kind of where you guys are going, but I'm curious within your entire portfolio where do you see the best chance of the next 12 months for meaningful share gains, if anywhere? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well, there's a number of businesses that are doing quite well, Brian, and in the Medication Management Space, you really saw a turnaround over the last, I'm going to call it 18 to 24 months and I think we feel exceptionally good with the launch HealthSight. It was probably the first place that I would point to, whether it's a share gain or not what's going on with the Lutonix clones, quite frankly. In the Interventional segment, we had some excellent growth because of the AV claim there and we're just starting on that piece as well. Temperature management is going well in that segment. I'm excited about what's happening in Biosciences with the new instrumentation, we just showed we've got both the Symphony analyzer and sorter now, Melody is doing great and BD MAX, quite frankly, is doing quite well, an area that I know you follow closely. So for us, it's never one thing, it's a whole series of things that's happening. And Alberto, what were you saying?","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","No, and I think we are very excited about Kiestra as well, that will allow us to really advance in the automated and connected segment out there with....","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. I think if you look at this growth, it's a good model. It's balanced growth across all three segments is the way I would sum it up. Thanks for the questions, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter here. And maybe I'll start with a high-level question, Vince. When you look at the strength in the quarter, right, obviously I think people are looking at next year in a sustainability of strength. So Bard is coming in better, your dispensing impact goes away, Biosciences, it looks like that business is inflecting. It looks like one of your supply chain peers this morning had a little bit of disruption in their supplies business. So is there some share gains going on, and what's the visibility confidence that we have on the sustainability of strength we are seeing now flowing through for fiscal 2019?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, I think we feel good about fiscal 2019. There are some additional share gains going on even in our core business, if you look at MDS, certainly in the hypodermic area we have also been taking share. We continue to do really well with our flush product line. So it goes back to the question that was just asked, I'd come back to that answer which is, across the portfolio, across all three segments we're feeling good with the product launches that we have just started with that we've been talking about today, but also the products that are coming behind them. So we continue to expect in line with the way we have been talking over the last 12 to 18 months in terms of good momentum from both the BD core and the Bard core, so across all three segments.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","And just may be one on the guidance. First, when you look at the guidance, gross margin, that has to step up meaningfully in the back half, and I am assuming that's because of your dispensing impact goes away. It looks like tax rate is coming down meaningfully in the second half and maybe could you just talk about, because I know you had spoken about synergies on the Bard side and whether that's helping you guys here a little bit?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, so I'll take that last one first on the tax rate. Our guidance is 17% to 19%. You saw the 16.9% quarter. I think you can expect the tax rate to be at the low end \u2013 very low end of our guidance range. And then gross profit, we were thrilled with the gross profit performance in the second quarter, 340 basis points expansion versus the prior year and right in line with where we expect it to be. We do expect the gross profit to continue to accelerate in the back half, as you expect \u2013 as you mentioned. And there's a couple of things driving that. We have the anniversary-ing of the U.S. dispensing headwind which sometimes gets lost in terms of the impact that it has on margins as well is the top and bottom line.","We have the synergies beginning to ramp, the Bard synergies, the conclusion of the CareFusion ones obviously, but the Bard synergies continue to ramp. And then you've got the full second half of rich Bard margins. We've only had one quarter in the first half, and so we'll have the full half of that. So we expect those margins to grow very nicely, and that flows down to operating margins as well. So we're feeling very comfortable about our guidance range on both gross profit as well as operating margin. As I said my script, 200 basis points, 250 basis points this year on top of 500 basis points over the last three years; we're feeling pretty good about our margin performance.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Vijay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One on Bard, one on Life Sciences. So on Bard, Vince, where do you think you are in the integration process? Do you think you're past the time when you would see disruption or dis-synergies? Could you talk a little bit about how PICCs and midlines did? I think that's in MDS now. And when you expect Progel to return? And I just had one follow-up on Life Sciences.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Sure. So let's start with the integration process. We have the organization set up, and so we feel good from that standpoint. And so people are implementing. They're in that mode. So I think I'd feel pretty confident about we're not in disruptive phase. You're always doing new things over three years, but as long as we have them well-planned and understood, then we can avoid that and that's been the history on CareFusion. We expect it to be the history on Bard as well. But in terms of the specifics you were asking on Interventional, Tom, do you want to take that?","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, hi, Larry. This is Tom. So first on the PICCs and midlines, we continue to see very strong growth in both of those platforms, particularly ex-U.S. in line with prior performance. I'd say we're seeing some very early positive signs of the opportunity and vision that we had set out to be able to offer customers a more integrated vascular access solutions, combining not only short-term peripheral access with our peripheral catheters but also with the longer-term value that PICCs and midlines offer in terms of longer-dwell catheterization. And so we're seeing our commercial teams in the U.S., ex-U.S., begin putting those value propositions together, beginning to have discussions with customers and we're hearing very positive receptivity there. So we're quite excited about the future and the opportunities with that combined portfolio.","On a Progel perspective, we're making good progress on the relaunch, and we expect relaunch at the end of calendar year 2018.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. And then on Life Sciences, I am trying to understand what you expect in the second half versus the first half on an underlying basis. So you did 7.3%, I think, in the first half. But I know you benefited from flu, but you had the headwind from the Preanalytical manufacturing issue. The guidance implies only about 3.5% growth in the second half. So help us understand first and second half in Life Sciences on an underlying basis. Thanks for taking the question.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Larry, I'll go first. This is Chris. Your calculation of the implication on the second half is off by a lot. It would imply over 5% growth in the second half. So that's...","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, that helps. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking the question.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","We can go through the details with you later.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, and good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just wanted ask a question on the new EPS guidance. It sounds like really the only thing that's changed is an assumption on currency. But I'm asking the question because currency, obviously, has been incredibly volatile from here. So just what do you sort of assume for currency for the rest of the year? And if the dollar continues to strengthen, would that matter to this guidance? Just trying to put that in perspective because, again, the dollars are all over the place lately.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So a couple of things on that, Bob. As we've said in the prepared remarks, our assumption is based on $1.23 to the euro, but as we noted, the $1.20 that it is today does not have a material impact on the rest of our year, and we're very comfortable with what we've seen already flowing through. And you're right that we did flow that $0.05 through on an FX. But there were a couple puts and takes there. Clearly, the performance on the top line is benefiting us in the remainder of the year, and we do have some investments that we need to make in the second part of the year. We talked about some additional clinical trials and investments in quality systems in our PAS business, and we're consciously making those investments. And so when you flow that all in, that keeps FX in neutral and raises the FX. So there's a couple of moving parts there.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you for that. And then just one other thing I want to quickly ask about is with the leadership change on the Interventional side, just maybe give us some color on the process for coming up with a sort of a full-time solution there. Is that likely to be internal? And just how long will that take? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. We don't think it's going to take all that long. We're talking maybe a couple of months, something like that from a process standpoint. It is likely to be internal, and you certainly want someone who has a background in devices who will understand the business quickly, the differences in the business model, but who also understands BD. And we think we have some excellent candidates.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Bob, and this is Tom. Just a note. I think one of the things that, as Vince mentioned, we're going to be relatively quick in that over the next couple of months. And in that time, because we have extremely strong leadership teams in each of the individual businesses that are continuing to run those which gives us confidence to \u2013 and actually the luxury, particularly with Bill stepping in as the Interim President, to take the time to make sure we appoint the right leader there.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Thanks for the color.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Robbie.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Hi, and thanks for taking the question. Vince, I know you touched on in a bit so far, but I was hoping you could just give us your early insights into how the integration is going, areas that you've been surprised by both on the positive and negative and what's been the reception from your customers in terms of the combined portfolio so far?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, let me start on the customer side, because myself and Tom, and Chris, other members of the management team, we've been talking to the key accounts and I would say it's been very positive. And the conversations we're having about how to we now strategically partner with these accounts as they do things like improve their care management teams, that's been very exciting for us. We're in the process of setting up some top-to-top meetings and to follow up on those kind of conversations. So I would say from a customer standpoint, very positive, and that's not just in the U.S., that's in Europe as well that we've done some of those meetings, so feeling very good about it.","In terms of surprises, I don't know that there has been any significant surprises. I think on the positive side, we thought the cultures were very similar, and they are more similar than we expected, very, very customer driven and focused and purpose driven and that's been a huge positive, and the way teams have come together even quicker than they did on the CareFusion integration has been a very strong positive. We had this philosophy about taking the best of either company, and we've been modifying some of our processes, some of them come from Bard, some go from BD as we look at running a $16 billion plus company. That has accelerated even faster than we thought.","So all in all good, very, very good start. And as you saw this quarter, it was off to an excellent start. Chris, do you have anything else?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, I would just add to the last point you made, Vince, that the key to any integration is maintaining the momentum in the core businesses. And you can see from this quarter and the previous quarter that the momentum is extremely strong on both businesses across all of our segments. And when you look at the performance on a Bard basis before we moved the products around, 8.5% is a killer quarter, and it just demonstrates the kind of momentum.","So that's the key to make sure you keep that momentum in a period of a lot of change, we've been able to do that, that's really important. And then the execution on the cost side, we know how to do that. We've got teams in place to do it, and as Vince mentioned earlier, getting that momentum on the revenue synergies, I would tell you when you talk to salespeople on both sides of Interventional now and BD legacy, they're excited about having the portfolio of products. So all of those are great indications of getting off to a good start.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Your second question, Robbie?","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then, Chris, one more for you, just on some of the onetime items in second quarter, you called out Kiestra placements, you called out timing of tenders in diabetes, flu was 80 bps. Can you just run through the different impacts of what was onetime in nature in second quarter? And then which will be either detracting or adding to third quarter, fourth quarter? Thanks.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, so in addition to the ones that you talked about, I would also say that we did have the advancement of some investments in R&D and selling, and so we made that decision consciously to invest earlier in some R&D programs. And so those, that's really more of a timing thing, that helps us in the back end.","But then as we pointed out, we had some production issues in PAS, which we resolved within the quarter in the second quarter, so that won't carry forward. But we do want to make some investments in our quality system and add some clinical trials in the back half, again in PAS, so that would \u2013 does impact us in the second half as I talked about previously.","The only other one kind of items, we talked about resin pressure on the last earnings call. If anything we see that pressure ticking up slightly from what we talked about. So just to refresh everyone's memory, in the beginning of the year we saw about $15 million pressure from resins. On the last earnings call we said it'd probably be about $15 million incremental to that. We're probably looking at another $5 million for the full year, just based on the way oil prices and the market in that area from a supply side.","The only other onetime kind of item that you got is we were delighted to consummate the Vyaire joint venture and divestiture. It wasn't core to our strategy, it helps us focus on our core business. But with that comes a little bit of dilution in the back half of about $0.03. I think that's all the onetime items in addition to the ones that you talked about.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning to you both. Maybe, Chris, just starting off with you, you talked about the accelerated spending, the second half spending moving into first half on the SSG&A and R&D side. Maybe give us if you would be so kind, a little more color on where is this going? Is it U.S., is it OUS, is it Bard, is it Becton? And how should we think about the implications of those stepped-up investments?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, and we saw the opportunity, and it's really in the MMS business, and it's primarily R&D. We're just looking at some next-generation kind of items, too early to talk about. But we saw the opportunity to advance that spending, and we took the opportunity. As we said in the past, as we saw FX becoming a tailwind, we would take the opportunity to invest some of that if we saw that option. And we did, and we felt it was the right thing to do.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And, Rick, the other piece of spending in the quarter was really in the PAS business. We mentioned that in the first half was some manufacturing issue. In the second half, we're doing some clinical trial work to resolve the warning letter. So it's a one-year spend is the way to think about that.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And two last ones, I'll just say them quickly. First, Chris, for you, you highlighted the 4.5 times gross leverage and the debt paydown and your three-year goal. Any reason that that couldn't happen faster? And maybe just reflect on all that a little bit.","And maybe last, Vince, you both talked about some big picture issues. Maybe talk, there's so many big topics, whether it's China, the trade war, the tariff concern. How are you thinking about that as you frame the outlook as well? Thanks to you both.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So on the debt paydown, we feel good about the fact that we're right on target. You saw the $100 million paydown. We look to paydown about $1 billion this year, and then $2.5 billion in each of the next two years or thereabouts.","Could you accelerate that? Sure we could, but we don't think that's the prudent way to do it. We like to keep some dry powder for M&A deals. Certainly, you want to be able to do some tuck-in acquisitions. That's something that we've always done on the BD side, but clearly the Bard strategy included small tuck-in acquisitions. And we want to make sure we keep the opportunity to do that and don't restrict that too much.","And as well as investing in our normal capital investments and what have you, while still increasing the dividend a little bit. So it's a balance of all those things, which is the way we thought about it as we announced the deal. And we're executing just on point.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Rick, from a tariff standpoint, we don't think it's \u2013 from an overall basis, it's going to be material. We do make our flu test in China and import it into the U.S. That's not that big a business that's going to have a big impact on the company. Needles and syringes are on that list, but we don't do that, so that's not an issue.","We do buy some material from China. Once again, we think we can cover that. So we're looking at it as manageable if it stays the way it is now.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning, Doug.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","I have a couple topics I want to cover. First, a follow up on PICCs and then a follow up on that last China question. So I'll just start on PICCs.","Tom, following up on that earlier question, are your sales reps now fully trained to sell the full suite of catheters and recognizing it's very early, is there any evidence that having a broader product portfolio is already benefiting overall core Medication Delivery Solutions growth?","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hey, Doug. This is Tom. So we have begun cost training some of our team members in the U.S. specifically. We expect that will continue through, though, the end of the fiscal year, and so we expect both U.S. and European teams to be cross-trained going into FY19. The training really ramps up in the June\/July timeframe is our expectation there. So I think it's too early to say you're not seeing the results in this quarter of that combined opportunity, again, as I mentioned, we're seeing very positive feedback from customers, it's intuitive in many ways of course, in the future we'll have the same people talking about peripheral catheters and PICCs and midlines and being able to holistically work with the customer to get the best solution for the patient, right?","Often there are questions on what device should I use? And we'll be in a position to be the leader in helping our customers figure that out the right way that's best clinically and economically appropriate for them. So I think more to come in terms of seeing the revenue impact, but we're hearing very good feedback overall and we're confident in our ability to get good value there.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for that, Tom. I think the second one is for you, Chris. China growth comparisons are, as you know, more difficult in the second half than they were in the first half, I think, by roughly 300 basis points. And there's also uncertainty not just about tariffs but the impact of the pricing to invoice changes. Does guidance embed an assumption that second half growth is going to moderate in China due to the tough comp or are you expecting some of the new products and the revenue synergies from various acquisitions to help you power through the comparison and the other dynamics I mentioned?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. So as we gave guidance in China, Doug, the full year we expect to be kind of in the mid-teens, and we see a slight acceleration, actually, in the second half, and that's due to actually easier comparisons in our Life Sciences segment compared to the second half last year. And we don't see any impact of the tariffs on our revenue stream, and as Vince mentioned, we don't see any significant impact on our cost basis either. But it's something that we'll watch.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, Vince. Hi, Chris. This is Jaime on for Richard Newitter.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC","Good morning. A quick question on the Lutonix below the knee trial. I was just looking for an update here. I know you guys in the past have cited end of calendar year 2018 for PMA submission, so is there any update that you can provide where you track on the submission and then how the trial is progressing?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Sure. Tom will take that.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hi, Jaime, this is Tom. So as we announced earlier, we did complete enrollment in this past January and we anticipate completing six months follow up and submission of the PMA to the FDA in Q1 of FY19. So all that remains 100% on track.","Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And then just one additional question with respect to the retail pharmacy initiatives going on, can you talk a little bit about what your expectations are here and potentially if you guys have any thoughts on what Amazon is attempting to do in this space?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So from an Amazon perspective, I'll take that, this is Vince. We continue to have conversations with Amazon and it's kind of unclear what they want to do. Of course they just announced about 10 days ago or so that they were not going to move ahead on the drug side, we do not have \u2013 they've tried a few things in the acute-care marketplace, it doesn't look like they're moving ahead there anytime soon either. So we continue to see if there's some ways for us to work with them, but right now I would say there's not much happening in that space.","On the retail pharmacy side of things, we continue to grow our Rowa automation business, and that business is growing double digits. We're excited about that, that growth of course is being driven by international, and we're excited about that product line.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And we continue to have \u2013 this is Tom, we continue to have very strong relationships. Obviously on diabetes, we'll look to expand those as we launch Swatch (01:07:01) in the future and we certainly recognize as that marketplace evolves, could be increasing opportunities for us in a number of other ways.","Veritor is another product platform, our point-of-care infectious disease platform which is widely used within the retail pharmacies today. And again opportunities as people look to shift care there in greater ways we'd look to partner with those institutions to help do that, so.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And we are talking broadly retail when we say that.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes, yes, yes.","Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back to Vince Forlenza for closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So thank you very much for your questions. Just to sum up here, we are proud of our strong performance across the board, all three segments as we discussed. We're very pleased to have raised guidance our first quarter as a combined company with Bard. And lastly the integration has been going smoothly and we look forward to updating you throughout the year. So thanks very much. Have a great day.","Thomas E. Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

It will be available for replay through Tuesday, February 14, 2012 on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at (855) 859-2056 for domestic calls and (404) 537-3406 for international calls, using conference ID 42951440. [Operator Instructions] Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki. ","Ms. Dolecki, you may begin your conference.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Jackie. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fiscal first quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our first fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are David Elkins, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; BD Executive Vice Presidents, Gary Cohen and Bill Kozy; and Tom Polen, President of Diagnostics Systems. ","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning. As we stated in our press release, we are off to a solid start this year and we are pleased with our performance in the first fiscal quarter. ","Revenue growth was 2.4% currency neutral, which was slightly better than our expectations. Fully diluted EPS of $1.21 declined by 9.6% on a currency-neutral basis. This reflects a $0.04 favorable benefit relating to various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions, which we expected later in the year. ","Excluding the tax benefit, earnings per share would have been $1.17, which is in line with the expectations we outlined on our conference call in November. ","We saw softer results in the U.S. due to an uncertain research spending environment and difficult pricing comparisons versus the prior year. David will provide more details around this later in his remarks. ","We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets. Our initiatives around new product platforms and extensions and operational excellence programs continue to be on track with our expectations. We are also reaffirming our full fiscal year revenue and EPS guidance on a currency-neutral basis. ","On a reported basis, we are lowering our revenue and EPS guidance to reflect the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. We expect reported revenue and EPS growth to be about flat. ","Now I'd like to turn things over to David for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter financial performance.","David V. Elkins","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by discussing the key financial highlights for the quarter. ","As Vince just stated, the quarter was in line with our financial projections with revenue growth coming in a little higher than our guided range. We saw good performance in our underlying business and with solid growth coming from Accuri and Carmel acquisitions. We experienced higher expenses in the quarter due to increased investments in our business. EPS of $1.21 reflects lower gross margin and higher SG&A costs. This includes the effects of pricing erosion, higher raw material costs, the rollout of investments in emerging markets, higher legal costs and some acquisition-related expenses from Accuri and Carmel. This is in line with our expectations we outlined on our year-end call in November. ","As Vince also mentioned, we are on track to deliver our revenue and EPS guidance on a currency-neutral basis. We are lowering our full year guidance on a reported basis due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our revised guidance assumes a full year average euro exchange rate of $1.30. ","Additionally during the first quarter, we completed about $400 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase plan. Our guidance for the program remains unchanged at $1.5 billion. ","Now let's move on to Slide 7 where we will review our revenue growth by segment, which I'll speak to on a currency-neutral basis. As I just mentioned, revenue growth was 2.4% for the total company. Pricing erosion was about 130 basis points, which is consistent with the guidance we provided on our year-end conference call. ","BD Medical first quarter revenues increased 2.6%. The growth in this segment was primarily driven by Diabetes Care with continued strong sales of pen needles and solid international growth in our medical surgical systems unit. Pharmaceutical systems growth was 0.6% in the quarter. This resulted from strong 2011 U.S. sales due to biotech sampling and fiscal prior year comparison due to launch of low-molecular-weight heparin and adjustment in customer inventory levels. When excluding the onetime impact from these items, revenue growth in our pharmaceutical systems unit would have been about 4% in the quarter, which is in line with estimated global market growth. ","BD Diagnostics' first quarter revenues increased 3.3%. Growth in this segment was driven by Preanalytical Systems safety-engineered products and overall Diagnostics Systems growth with strength in Women's Health and Cancer and our microbiology products. ","BD Biosciences revenue growth was about flat versus prior year, driven by solid international growth, mostly offset by declines in the U.S. I will provide more details around this on the next slide.","Moving to Slide 8, I will walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter. Overall, BD's reported U.S. revenues were flat versus prior year. Growth in our Medical segment was 2.3%. This is driven by strong growth in pharmaceutical systems and Diabetes Care and partially offset by difficult pricing comparisons in our medical surgical systems units. ","Growth in our Diagnostics segment was about 1% due to flat testing volumes impacting our Preanalytical Systems unit. ","As I just noted, Biosciences sales for the first quarter declined 10% or $12 million on a currency-neutral basis in the U.S. About 1\/3 of this decline is related to lower sales in our Discovery Labware unit, driven by product rationalization. Another 1\/3 of the decline is related to Cell Analysis research reagent sales. These were unfavorably impacted by uncertainty around NIH research funding levels in the first quarter with the NIH budget not being approved until late in the quarter. The balance of the decline is related to lower demand for high-end instruments in Cell Analysis due to a contraction in pharmaceutical and biotech research spending. ","International revenues grew 4.4% currency neutral, with growth coming from all 3 segments. Medical segment grew 2.8% with Diagnostics and Biosciences both growing at about 6%. Additionally, we saw strong growth in emerging markets across all 3 segments with total emerging markets growth coming in at 12%. ","Moving to Slide 9, currency-neutral sales increased 7.8% and grew to $488 million in the quarter. Revenues in the U.S. increased by 2.4%. International sales were up 16.8% on a currency-neutral basis with both Western Europe and emerging markets showing double-digit growth. Medical safety sales grew 12%, driven by IV catheter products and our newly acquired PhaSeal closed system drug safety device. Diagnostic safety sales increased about 4%, driven by a range of safety-engineered products. ","Slide 10 recast the first quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. As discussed earlier, first quarter revenue growth increased by 2.4%. Our gross margin declined by 210 basis points, in line with the guidance we provided on our year-end earnings call. This primarily reflects the negative effects of price erosion, higher raw material costs, software amortization in our Biosciences business and amortization of intangibles related to our acquisitions of Accuri and Carmel Pharma. Unfavorable currency translation contributed about 10 points. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs from continuous improvement and our ReLoCo program. We expect pricing, raw material costs and acquisition-related expenses to be less of a headwind in the second half of the fiscal year. ","For the total year, we are reaffirming our guidance and our expected gross margin to be between 51.3% and 51.5%. ","Moving down the income statement, SSG&A increased about 9%, primarily due to EVEREST SAP implementation costs, higher expenses related to our Accuri and Carmel Pharma acquisition and increased investments in emerging markets. Our legal fees also increased due to trial preparation costs associated with the RTI litigation, which has subsequently been postponed until November. ","R&D increased 1.4%, which is in line with our expectation as the prior year period had significant R&D costs. ","Our operating income decreased 12.8% due to lower gross margin and the higher SSG&A costs. We expect to see improvement in the second half of the year as we move past the tough comparisons, higher raw material costs and legal expense timing and the acquisition-related expenses become less dilutive. ","For the total year, we are reaffirming our guidance and our expected operating income to be between 21.5% and 21.7%. This resulted in an earnings per share of $1.21. When excluding the tax benefit of $0.04, our earnings per share was $1.17, which is at the high end of our guidance provided in November. ","Turning to Slide 11. As I indicated earlier, we expect our total revenue growth to be between 2% to 4% on a currency-neutral basis. We are raising the lower end of our Medical segment guidance and expect revenues to grow between 2% and 3%. We expect Diagnostics revenues to grow about 2% to 4%. For our Biosciences segment, we are lowering our revenue guidance to 2% to 4% from our previously communicated guidance of 4% to 6%. This is due to the weakness at -- in the U.S. market as I've previously described. ","Turning to Slide 12. As we discussed, we are affirming our total company revenue growth of about 2% to 4% currency neutral, based upon the current market environment. On a reported basis, we are lowering revenue guidance we provided in November to 1% to 3% to be about flat as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar. We now expect EPS to be between $5.60 and $5.70 for the total year, which reflects recent spot rates. ","While we don't normally provide guidance for the quarter, I would like to outline our expectations for the second quarter based on our first fiscal quarter results and what we are expecting for the balance of the year. From a revenue perspective, we're expecting a step-up in growth rates in certain units. In our Medical surgical systems business, we expect growth rates to improve in the second half of the year as we move past pricing comparisons. In pharmaceutical systems, we anticipate continued growth due to timing of orders associated with seasonal customer demand. And in Diabetes Care, we expect continued growth fueled primarily by strong sales of pen needles. In our diagnostics systems unit, we are expecting a step-up from our BD MAX launches. Due to these factors, we're expecting total company revenue growth to be between 3% and 4% on a currency-neutral basis. ","From an EPS perspective, we anticipate earnings per share to be between $1.36 and $1.40 or about flat versus the prior period. Second quarter EPS growth versus the prior year period will continue to be unfavorably impacted by tough comparisons in 2011. These tough comparisons include price erosion and increased investments in SSG&A, which began in the second half of fiscal year 2011 and will continue through the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. It also reflects an increase in SSG&A from Carmel Pharma and increased legal costs in the fiscal year. We expect a step-up in EPS growth during the second half of the year once we move past the difficult comparisons of 2011. ","We will continue to update you on our -- and tighten our guidance range as we make more progress throughout the year. ","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince who will provide a more detailed update on our performance in emerging markets and progress against our key initiatives.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, David. Moving on to Slide 14, I would like to highlight our emerging market results. We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, which accounted for approximately 22% of our total revenues in the first quarter. ","Emerging market revenues grew about 12% in total over the prior year. We continue to see double-digit growth in a number of key markets, with China growing at about 27%. We are very pleased with Safety revenue growth in emerging markets, which was up about 27% over the prior year. We will continue to accelerate our investment in geographic expansion, market development and market-appropriate product solutions to sustain long-term growth in these markets. ","Now moving on to Slide 15. On our year-end earnings call, we discussed a number of key product initiatives and milestones. I'd like to provide an update on these key initiatives. ","This fiscal year, we have many exciting opportunities in our pipeline. In our Medical segment, we launched the BD Nexiva Diffusics Closed IV Catheter System with a diffusion tip. This product is an innovation from the already proven and effective BD Nexiva Closed IV Catheter System. In the second half of the fiscal year, we also plan to launch the world's first 6-millimeter insulin syringe and our BD pentapoint pen needle, which is more comfortable and anticipated to be preferred by patients. ","In our Diagnostics segment, in the first quarter, we launched our BD Veritor CLIA-waived flu A & B test in the United States. This is the first flu test to be CLIA-waived in over 4 years and represents a significant advancement in the sensitivity of point of care-based flu testing. In the first month, we made about 70 new Veritor placements. Early customer feedback is positive. While we're making placements, the incidence of flu in the U.S. has been below normal levels so far this season. Earlier this month in Japan, we received clearance for the Veritor flu A and B assay from the Ministry of Health, and we are preparing for launch in the next couple of weeks. ","In molecular diagnostics, we continue to be pleased with the early progress of the new 6-color BD MAX Open System. This is positioned in the mid-volume molecular assay market with more than 15 assays active in our pipeline. Also, customers can develop their own assays on their spot systems using its open channel architecture. ","In the first quarter, we also launched the BD MAX MRSA assay in the EU, which was one quarter ahead of schedule. We made our first several conversions with this new assay and we are receiving positive feedback from customers. The U.S. launch of MRSA on BD MAX remains on track for later in 2012. ","We have a series of additional MAX assays launch -- launches scheduled, including our Group B Strep assay in the second quarter of this year. Our BD MAX C. difficile assay remains on track for launch in the EU in the third quarter, followed by a U.S. launch in the beginning of fiscal year 2012. ","Our BD Viper molecular platform remains positioned as delivering best-in-class lab efficiency and performance for high-volume screening assays. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we will begin launching the Trichomonas assay on this platform. Our launch of the bench-top BD Viper LT and Chlamydia gonorrhea assay remains on track for fiscal 2013 globally, followed immediately by the launch of our HPV genotyping assay on Viper LT x U.S. Complementing this launch, our Women's Health front-end automation system remains on track for launch in fiscal year 2013 and will automate the decapping and transfer of liquid-based cytology samples to the Viper and Viper LT molecular systems, as well as prepare a cell pellet for testing on our SurePath cytology system. ","Our BD SurePath Plus molecular Pap test completed the initial phase of our clinical trial with very promising results, and we are continuing the U.S. trial to its endpoint. Our launch remains on track. ","In our Bioscience segment, we launched our new cell culture medium, Mosaic, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. In fiscal year 2013, we plan to launch 2 new analyzers for CD4 testing. One is meant for mid- and smaller volume laboratories in both emerging markets and the developing world, while the other is a more affordable point-of-care instrument targeted toward rural clinics in the developing world. Of course, we will continue to provide you with updates on our products and programs as we continue to make progress throughout the year.","On Slide 16, before we open the call to questions, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our discussion today. First, we are pleased with our solid start to the fiscal year, given the challenging macro economic climate. We continue to see strong growth in our emerging markets and international sales of safety-engineered products. Second, our key product launches and operational excellence programs remain on track and are producing results. Third, based on our expectations for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our previously communicated guidance on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, we are lowering guidance to -- due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Lastly, we remain focused on delivering on our strategy in driving efficiency throughout BD. Despite the challenging environment in which we operate, we believe we are positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to customers and shareholders. ","Thank you, and we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from the line of Larry Keusch with Morgan Keegan.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","Could you -- obviously, Safety, Vince, I think you said was strong in Western Europe and obviously in the emerging markets. Could you just remind us sort of where we stand with the whole program in Europe for the adoption of safety? How much is left on that time line and kind of where do you think we are at this point relative to the adoption?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes, Larry, you're referring to the fact that a couple of years ago they set a 3-year deadline and where are we in terms of moving towards that whole implementation, so I'll ask Gary to talk about that.","Gary M. Cohen","Sure, thanks. This is Gary. So you're testing my memory a bit. I believe it's around June 2013 that the compliance -- the official compliance state occurs, although we're getting solid conversion growth already in Western Europe. We're seeing strong growth overall in a number of countries, particularly the northern countries in Western Europe. And I should also mention we're getting double-digit growth in Safety now in every market except the U.S. and Canada, which have been more largely converted with particularly strong growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, but also EMA and even Japan. So we're just seeing strength across-the-board in the markets that still have a ways to go to full transition. And we can anticipate, particularly in Europe as we move toward that compliant state that, that growth should continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein from William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Question then. Probably -- maybe you can quantify the impact of the lighter flu season not just on Diagnostics, but also what it might have meant in the Medical segment as well.","Vincent A. Forlenza","I don't think we really have a quantification of the flu. It's not -- the flu was not really material to our results. We really haven't seen any flu year-over-year.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, and then a quick follow-up. You talked a little bit about what the euro is expected to be. In your model, I think you said 1.3. Can you just go through what your exposure is to the euro and then the other currencies, can you refresh us on that and then what the assumptions would be on some of those other currencies as well?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure, David can talk to that.","David V. Elkins","Sure, the euro, we have a little over $2 billion in euro-related sales and we haven't broken out the other currencies other than to say that the other exposures are Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real and the Japanese yen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Maybe just focusing on the Biosciences segment a little bit. Can you maybe just talk about other players in that space have seen varying degrees of weakness or saw it throughout 2011. Sounds like it hit you pretty hard in the U.S. here in this last quarter. Can you maybe just talk about how that played out and then also why you're comfortable with that business kind of overall improving in the -- for the remainder of the year given that there could be even more uncertainty with potential cuts with sequestration. So maybe just kind of talk about your outlook for that business.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure, Jon. As you mentioned, it was really the U.S. market where we saw the difficulties, and Bill will break that out a little bit more for you. Europe and the rest of the world did well in that business. And you're right also, Jon. From just talking to folks around the industry, I think the research market, depending on the segment you were in, you more or less saw what we were talking about that. But there was some variability there. But in particular, we saw the uncertainty affecting our customer base in the academic and the government marketplaces and some impact for biotech, and Bill will break those out for you.","William A. Kozy","This is Bill. Just 2 factors, as Vince just referenced. Number one, we saw a notable slowdown in the pharma and biotech purchasing, and this was driven mostly by significant restructuring that we saw across several of the major pharmaceutical companies as they're in the process of assessing their R&D as well as moving significant volumes of R&D offshore. And generally speaking, it touched a number of our Big Pharma customers, so that was factor one. Factor two relates to the academic and government spending and there was some uncertainty created by -- many of the discussions, by the way, that you've followed related to the NIH budget. As you know, that budget never got finalized until December 23, 2011. So we pretty much went through a whole quarter where a lot of our grant-driven procurement activities were really slowed down and delayed. So to get back to the other part of your question, Jon, the reason we've got a little bit of optimism in the remainder of the year now that the budget is set and even though it's only at a 1% increase, there is some stability in some of the understanding of available funds, and we think that will help us in the remainder of the year in terms of some bounce back. The single biggest impact in the quarter was because of this uncertainty was on high-end instruments, things like Aria, some of our high-end sorters and analyzers. And again, we know that there's a little bit of interest in those instruments and we're expecting that to be a factor also in a little bit of the U.S. recovery in quarters 2, 3 and 4.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Kim in for Mike. So I guess 2 questions. The first is on the updated guidance and wanting to come back to the change in outlook relative to FX. So it looks high to us, first of all. It looks like you've raised that FX headwind for the year by about 100 to 300 basis points relative to early November. And if we're looking at it in our currency models just that delta and maybe this is just the euro, but we're looking at really across your currencies, it looks like it should be closer to 100 basis point delta. So just maybe, David, if you could help us understand how we could get ourselves to that, call it, 300 basis points of incremental pressure from FX.","David V. Elkins","Yes, I think -- it really comes down to the major movers, the euro, but obviously other currencies that have moved as well. But for the remainder of the year, obviously where we were at the first quarter was around 1.36. For the remainder of the year, we're anticipating that to be in the high 1.20s, which gets you to about a rate of 1.30 for the full year and that's versus the rate of last year, which averaged around 1.40. So that's the biggest driver. But as you know, the dollar has moved pretty consistently across most currencies.","Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So you're using for the rest of the year a euro into the 1.20s.","David V. Elkins","That's right, high 1.20s.","Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I guess the follow-up is I wanted to ask maybe Vince to talk about on the investment spending side, particularly as we look at the EVEREST program, the SAP upgrade. Can you just talk through the cadence of that spend in fiscal '12 and '13 and relative to when you're going live in Europe, when you're going live in the U.S. and kind of how you would compare the overall level of spend for EVEREST in fiscal '12 and fiscal '13.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. So our first go live is going to be this year, Biosciences. And then next year, we'll have a go live for North America and then another wave following that. But from a spending perspective, the spending on the project continue -- it increased '11 to '12. It will continue to increase in '13 and then the project spending will go down. And as we go live, the amortization of the system kicks in, which means that spending starts to flatten out after you get past '13. That's the dynamic on the system. Right now, the project is on track. It's obviously a large effort. Our Bioscience group is doing a great job on it, but that's the dynamic that we have.","Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's super helpful. And so can you quantify for us, just ballpark what that spending is, sort of what the impact on the SG&A line is in terms of kind of the spending on EVEREST this year and next?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, for this year, David, year-over-year, I think the increase is about 25, 20?","David V. Elkins","Yes. Around 20 to 25 in that range, and we haven't quantified it for next year at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just maybe one question, one very quick follow-up. Just first off, Vince and maybe for Gary as well, you talked a lot about European austerity pressures. I just sort of noticed in the quarter China remains very strong for the company. In the last several weeks, we've seen sort of some macro weakening across China mainland. Is there any sort of economic sensitivity to the business in China we should be thinking about throughout the remainder of the year? Or from what you've seen, the business remains very well insulated in China?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So we don't think so. We've been talking to our China team about it, and Gary can comment on what we're hearing directly from them.","Gary M. Cohen","This is Gary. What our team is seeing is that while there may be some downward pressure on overall GDP growth, we're not seeing that downward pressure on health care investments. What they're tracking is the level of commitment the Chinese government has, the Central Government to rolling out the investments in health care, which clearly seem to be remaining on track. And also what's funding that are the tax revenues. And if you dig a little deeper, you see the tax revenues that the Central Government is getting are actually up. They're probably higher than what had been expected, and that's what's behind the funding for health care. So we're not seeing that slowdown. We've been asking the same question, watching the same indicators and what we're seeing so far is that the health care investments are remaining on track.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and then, David, just a real quick follow-up. On Discovery Labware, you talked of product rationalization. Could you sort of give us some more granularity on that?","David V. Elkins","Yes, we've continued to look at products within our portfolio that may be growing slower than the company average, but as well from a profitability perspective, from profitability perspective that we're looking to rationalize. So there are several products in order to drive efficiencies in the supply chain, we rationalize SKUs. So as we start to do away with some of those products, that impacts the sales growth the first year you do it. But again, further out years you start to see improvement as a result of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just quantify for us the impact of acquisitions both from a top line perspective as well as from the earnings perspective. Because I think you had mentioned last year that those might be a little more dilutive earlier in the year.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure, David can take that.","David V. Elkins","From a margin perspective, what we had said for the full year on our gross margins, the acquisitions would dilute margins by about 20 basis points. In the quarter, obviously, it's a little heavier when comparing versus prior year. It was around 30 basis points. As we talked about on the acquisitions from a revenue perspective, on the Accuri, it was about 1 to 2 basis points of growth we anticipate getting for the full year this year. And Carmel Pharma -- I'm about to give that number for you on what we think the full year impact is on the Medical business.","Vincent A. Forlenza","For the quarter, we spent $20 million in sales for the 2 of them.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, so on an organic level, do you have the organic growth feed on the top line for this quarter?","David V. Elkins","Yes, as Vince just said, it's about $20 million worth of sales in the quarter. That's relation to both acquisitions.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Bill's got a follow-on comment here, Bill?","William A. Kozy","Just to the get to the question, Accuri -- excuse me, Carmel will contribute this year incrementally. Remember, we acquired that in August of the fourth quarter of last year. So just fiscal year '12 incremental impact about $45 million of revenue.","Vincent A. Forlenza","For the year.","William A. Kozy","For the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to come back to Biosciences and maybe for David's comments on the rationalization of certain parts of the Labware business. How much of the reduction in guidance is due to weak underlying market trends versus the rationalization of those product categories?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So I'll let Bill Kozy actually walk you through that but -- Bill, do you want to talk to that?","William A. Kozy","Sure, this is Bill. Actually, our international sales in the Labware business were relatively solid, and the most significant impact of the rationalization did take place in the United States. As David mentioned, these are products that weren't contributing a lot of long-term growth or profitability to the unit. And our guidance is not in any way affected by the DL activity. We already have started that in 4Q of last year. It'll carry through our 3Q of this year and then it'll be behind us.","Vincent A. Forlenza","It was about 1\/3 of the reduction in the U.S. if I remember correctly, right? Of the total U.S.?","William A. Kozy","Of the total U.S. decline.","Vincent A. Forlenza","And so it was a fraction of that.","William A. Kozy","If we took the $12 million, it's $3 million to $4 million impact on the quarter.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then a follow-up. I don't know if you've had a chance to review the IRS filing on the med tech tax, but it looks as though some of your businesses actually might be excluded from that such as the Diabetes. Can you maybe provide some clarity as to which of your franchise, you think, fall in the exclusion category from the medical device tax that begins in calendar '13?","Vincent A. Forlenza","David, you have a...","David V. Elkins","Yes, some of the diabetes businesses are excluded, our Biosciences and a good portion of our Diagnostics business would be excluded from the tax. So as we talked about before, it's a little more than $2 billion in revenue that would be exposed to that tax, and initial indication is 2.4%. It's around a $55 million impact to our business next year. We're going through -- as everyone else just received this on Friday, we're going through and evaluating the details and going SKU-by-SKU so we can a better figure of that. We'll let you know as soon as we finish that work. We'll let you know.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to see if you can go into a little more detail about the strength in Women's Health Care and Cancer and the level that you believe that is sustainable there?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Tom Polen will take that.","Tom Polen","Amit, this is Tom. So, overall, we saw in Women's Health and Cancer we were 6.9% for the quarter. And if you look at actually our last few quarters, we've been growing at that rate, so we see a continued -- that's been the trend for the last few quarters and we see that trend going forward as well as certainly for the balance of this year it's sustainable and we don't see an end in...","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And Tom, can you go into a little more detail about the growth rates between TriPath, GeneOhm and STD?","Tom Polen","Yes, will do. Let me just finish a note there on Women's Health and Cancer specifically. So we still see the U.S. being relatively flat with the Pap volumes, relatively flat due to both low physician visits and extended intervals. X U.S. is really what's driving that growth, and we're seeing double-digit growth in nearly every single region outside of the U.S. For your other question regarding molecular STDs and then the separate question on GeneOhm, so in molecular STDs, we saw solid growth at 4.5% for the quarter. GeneOhm was a tough quarter. In fact, we were just over 1% in the quarter for GeneOhm and the mix of that is we're continuing strong double-digit growth in our C. difficile business there, north of 25% growth, but have seen that offset by a performance in MRSA and that's due to new competition driving down price in the market for MRSA as well as the rollout of some lost accounts that I mentioned last year where we are also still seeing customers hold for MAX on MRSA. Of course, we've just launched MRSA about a month ago in Europe. Sales are ramping up there, and we have MRSA in the U.S. planned for a launch in Q3.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And if I just have a quick follow-up for David. David, you talked about hospital acuity being an issue over the last quarter or so. Can you just give us an update on what your latest thoughts are on the impact from hospital acuity?","David V. Elkins","Yes, we really haven't seen any further deterioration. Pretty steady in the quarter on where it's been, so I think it's positive. We're seeing things stabilize out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Wood with Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So Vince, just going back your guidance for 3% to 4% top line in the second quarter, it looks like that's the toughest comp of the year. First, am I accurate in that statement? And second, if that's true, it just seems like you've got a bit more core momentum in your business than that 2% to 4% for the year would suggest. So would you give us some kind of clarity around pacing?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, I would come back to what David just said, which is we did see a stabilization. If we talk clinical marketplace now and put aside the research market for Biosciences and say clinical seemed to stabilize and of course, that was a concern going into the year and I think you see that reflected in our second quarter guidance. You also see a bounce back in the pharm systems business, which also helps us as well. So it's those issues that are causing the pattern that we're talking about. And as Bill mentioned, we'll see what happens on the life science side with now that the NIH budget is set because we just saw people not just on NIH-funded programs, but other academic programs just kind of in a hesitation mode. So those are the things that are impacting. David, anything else on that?","David V. Elkins","I think the only other thing I'd add, Vince, is on the way to think about it is there has to be a deterioration from where we are today to be at the bottom end of our revenue guidance, and at the top end we would see continued improvement.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So Vince, it's safe to say that based on your first quarters numbers and your second quarter guidance that you feel marginally better about the world at this juncture than you did last update. Is that correct??","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, I would say we feel marginally better about the clinical marketplace. I'd say we feel consistent with Biosciences outside of the U.S. And of course, we had some issue in the U.S. Those are the pieces. I feel very good about emerging markets, quite frankly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First off, I guess it looks like excluding the emerging markets, the balance of business was pretty flat in the quarter. If we think about, I guess, longer-term resource utilization, Vince, what type of, call it, 3-year growth are you funding in the developed world and how dependent are you on this between new product development versus, say, macro improvements like NIH stabilization, for example?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So I'm trying to make sure I understood your question, first off. So you were talking about the research business and the longer-term trends in research funding and how we see that and how things might be impacted.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Actually, Vince, I'm speaking kind of more broadly to the developed market in terms of as you -- the company has obviously made efforts to increase emerging markets resources and focus a lot of the growth there. If I turn the business to the developed side, what are you thinking from a 3-year standpoint and how do we get there?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. So we do see that growth will come back in the developed world and it is going to be driven by new product development. So just take for a second and we say, stabilization in volumes and in the marketplace because of improving economic conditions. Number one, in the U.S., it's a wild card, which I cannot predict, which is going to be the impact of health care reform. One would think in the back half of '13, '14 time frames you would start to see some impact, there's some positive impact as the economy gets better and people are covered by health care reform. We haven't quantified that. But we're watching that and that could be a positive. Then from the new product side and I can't split it into developed versus developing, but many of the new products that we're talking about are going to have their major impact in the developed world, and we said that was about for the products we went through on our Analyst Day, if you go back and look at that presentation, that's about 250 basis points of growth. And a lot of that is going to be driven in the developed world. And then of course, expansion. Those products will hit the developing world as well, but probably a little later term. But the molecular assays will be first. So we've got both of that. Gary, you want to make a comment on emerging?","Gary M. Cohen","Well, the only thing I would about the developed world, in fact, is even now in Western Europe the picture when you look at the total continent or the area of Western Europe, it's not as clear as if you start to break it to its pieces. We have 8 country organizations in Western Europe, and 5 of those 8 are growing and some of them are growing quite nicely. Then you have, one, France where we ship all pharmaceutical systems in Europe out of France and because of the impact of pharmaceutical systems, that's down. And then Italy and Spain, as you might expect, because of economic conditions are slightly down, but we're getting very good growth otherwise from Western Europe. So even now, driven by Safety other factors, the developing -- the developed world picture there is a little better than what it looks like.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Bonello with RBC Capital Market.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I was hoping to follow up a little bit on the pricing comments both if you can just give us a little bit more detail, sort of where -- I don't mean geographically where, but product where you saw some of the pressure and then you specifically made a comment about seeing increased competition in MRSA that was driving down price and maybe you could just tell us what that is?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. We said 130 basis points in the quarter, which was in line with what our expectation was. We knew we would have more pricing in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. Going back to last year, remember we talked about that about half of what we were seeing coming into this year was driven by a one-off situation in our Med\/Surg business. We're seeing the majority of the pricing issues in device businesses not so much on Diagnostics -- I'll come back to MRSA in a second, and not so much -- just a little bit in Biosciences in the research reagents, which has gone on for a number of years, but not really the instrument side. Not so much the clinical piece of it, but the research reagent. On MRSA, it's probably -- I'll let Tom comment, but I think it's more Roche as a new entrant coming into the marketplace.","Tom Polen","Yes. So specifically, it wasn't -- as Vince just mentioned, last year about mid-year, Roche entered into the marketplace. It had been primarily -- in fact, Roche entered in at a substantial price discount north of 30% price discount and their approach. And so we're seeing MRSA pricing down year-on-year overall about 5%, and that's where you see that impact. We've all seen pricing as an issue across the rest of the Diagnostic business. It would seem very focused within that MRSA space.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and is that a -- sorry to have to ask this, but is that a U.S. market entry?","Tom Polen","That was a U.S. market entry, happened midpoint last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Miroslava Minkova with Leerink Swann.","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could help us understand the impact of the Biosciences business declining in the U.S. this quarter on your gross margins. And with that, perhaps if you could help us also understand when do we see your gross margins perhaps recovering from here?","Vincent A. Forlenza","All right. Well, I can't talk -- I'm sorry, this is Vince. I can't break out the impact of the decline in the U.S. margin on how that translate into gross margin, but I wouldn't expect it would be a very big impact. In terms of where our gross margins go, we're sticking with the gross margin guidance that we gave you in the beginning of the year. We haven't changed that. Now remember what's going to happen here is that the pricing comparisons are going to change over the course of the year, number one. So I'll give you a couple of factors why it's going to improve. Number two, the raw material cost is a figure in negative in the first half of the year as well. Three, amortization and deal costs are kind of front-end loaded a little bit as well. So you have all of those 3 things impacting the first half of the year disproportionately. So that's why we're lower right now, and it will improve over the course of the year.","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And just a bit of a more broader picture question also in the margin side. Your operating margins sort of -- and I understand there is a lot of investment and factors going into that, but they're kind of at the very low in the last at least 5 years that we've seen them. I guess I'm kind of wondering if you would be willing to provide some of your thoughts on whether you see your operating margins recovering to the levels that we've seen them in the past and what could take you there and how long it might take.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So I'm not going to forecast, but I will tell you this that we still remain committed to 50 basis points a year in terms of operating leverage. Some years we get it, some years we don't. Some years we get more or less. We're working very hard on it. We haven't really talked through ReLoCo I, ReLoCo II as part of the call today. Those programs are on track, number one. Number two, on the G&A side, the shared service centers are still in investment mode. In a year or so, they start to turn positive. We talked through the EVEREST impact, that EVEREST goes up next year then it starts to flatten out, and so we haven't -- and then the investments in emerging markets we're comfortable that they are going to pay off. We're seeing good progress on those pieces. Then lastly, we have the new products that I spent a lot of time on the prepared remarks going through and those new products have good margin. So there's a mix impact as well. And lastly one other factor, which is this growth in Safety that we're talking about with both Europe doing well and starting to do better and emerging markets doing well, those are a whole series of factors that factor into our analysis on the margin going forward.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Maybe just a clarification. That $0.15 delta, this is the prior year guidance, it sounds like it's all FX and not higher assumed costs coming from Carmel or any other puts and takes.","Vincent A. Forlenza","That's correct. It's all currency.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And then R&D, is there any change in the outlook on this year being a kind of a high year for investment into R&D? Just seemed that you had lower R&D costs in the quarter. I just wondered if that was a lever you pulled as you saw rising costs.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Peter, no. If you go back and look at last year, we had an unusual pattern in the first quarter, where R&D spiked in the first quarter because of some timing on some projects. So no, it's just an anomaly in the spending pattern.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Palmer with CLSA.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Vince, you mentioned emerging markets and the China growth. I was wondering if you could give us some color on the markets that may be outside of China.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure, Gary can do that for you because quite frankly, we're having some good growth in those other markets as well.","Gary M. Cohen","So we -- this is Gary. We had double-digit growth in all the emerging markets in the first quarter. We had a particularly strong quarter in EMA, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and that was some impact of year-to-year comparison. Also, particularly a lighter fourth quarter last year, but it was very strong growth in the first quarter. And that tends to be a little lumpy based on the timing of some major orders. We actually had one aspect in the first quarter around immunization sales units that was lower than expected, so -- but despite that, we had very strong high teens double-digit growth in EMA. We had double-digit growth again in Latin America. We had strength throughout all the country hub organizations in Latin America, particularly in the southern part, Brazil, Argentina, Chile. Very strong. In Asia Pacific, we had double-digit growth, which we are anticipating with our investments to sustain through the year. So we just had a really solid quarter in emerging markets right across-the-board.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then one quick follow-up, if I could. On ReLoCo, any improvement in terms of the targets or timing?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes, the program is on track, really hasn't changed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Thanks for taking the question, which is a clarifying one on Biosciences. In listening your prepared remarks and answers to some of the other questions on the call thus far, it sounds like there were 3 negative dynamics that impacted Biosciences in fiscal Q1 and how you're thinking about the business moving forward through the year. The first was the uncertainty related to the outlook for funding in the U.S. The second was some product rationalization on your part. And the third was, I guess, a change in Big Pharma spending patterns. So if that's the case, it seems like the uncertainty related to research funding was there when you provided guidance for the year 3 months ago. I imagine you were planning for some of the product rationalizations that you mentioned on this call. So was the major change really that Big Pharma dynamic? And I guess did you see improvements in the U.S. academic and market at the end of the quarter that some others have spoken about?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So Big Pharma was certainly a new change we were not seeing in the fourth quarter, number one. Number two, on the academic and NIH side, there was a bigger impact than we anticipated. We were seeing some falloff in the fourth quarter. We couldn't quite tell whether that was a trend or not so it was bigger than we thought when we gave you the guidance. On the rationalization, the rationalization certainly impacted the results. It's kind of noise in the background. I don't want to make a big deal about that, so -- and then there was just some timing on some things in the marketplace. So those are the major impacts. Now going forward, we'll have to see how the U.S. market shakes out from a research standpoint.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that is helpful. I guess just one very quick follow-up. Some of the other companies that you compete with said things got a little bit better at the end of the quarter, as there's a little bit more certainty in that end market. Did you guys see that as well?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Not yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nandita Koshal with Barclays Capital.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Vince, if you could comment a little bit broader and longer term on the pricing environment and how we should think about pricing for BD going forward, is it basically weak and down 1 percentage on an ongoing basis, or is there something that changes in terms of the environment?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. So let's focus on this year and as we said slightly over 100 basis points and that a little less than half of that is a rollout of a one particular situation where we were -- it was a competitive situation that a 3-year contract, a bunch of 3-year contracts were all up at the same time, and you had a competitor who had expanded their capacity and was looking to fill volume in a plant. So that's half of what we saw going into this year and was built into our expectation. In terms of the pricing environment going forward, we're not seeing any changes based on what we saw this year in the way people buy, the tender structures. And obviously, we will keep our eye on that going forward.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, and I guess x U.S. more than in the U.S., are you seeing any government-related sort of programmatic price cuts either in Europe or the pharma companies, for instance, are certainly seeing those. Are you seeing that on your side of things? And then even in China, we're hearing some fairly bearish commentary around pricing as that broader health care coverage is built out. So is that consistent with what you're seeing or is it different?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. So first off, just to back up a little bit. Between '11 and '12, we're not really seeing much of a change in pricing. We're certainly not really seeing what you're talking about in Europe for the pharma companies, and Gary can give you a little more color on what we're seeing. But I don't think we're seeing any big change in these environments. Gary?","Gary M. Cohen","This is Gary. I just want to mention that we, based on the nature of our businesses, have been working in a highly constrained pricing environment for many years historically. And I would say in Western Europe that may be intensifying somewhat, but it's not a fundamental change. So we're seeing governments being a little bit more price oriented in their tenders, but I would consider that more of a evolutionary rather than revolutionary change in pricing perspective and more of a continuation of what we're accustomed to. Likewise, I would say in the emerging markets, it's -- we have to know how to serve those markets very efficiently from a price and cost perspective and align what we do to the access requirements of being able to buy our products at a very reasonable cost. And that's something we're also accustomed to. So in that respect, these are not changes in the environment, let's say, like we saw in the U.S., particularly around the product that Vince mentioned.","Vincent A. Forlenza","But most of the pricing pressure we see, the majority will be in U.S. and Europe, some small amount in emerging markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Michelmore with Brean Murray.","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but as we think about this pricing dynamics and some issue that happened in U.S., I'm just wondering if you can talk about the competitive environment for the infusion systems and the injection products because typically we do think of those as being areas where you have very dominant market shares, and I'm just wondering if you can comment if there's been any changes in the competitive environment. And then my follow-up would just be back on Europe. I think I did with an earlier question did, which was back out the emerging markets numbers out of the international numbers, it does like Europe -- it does look like Europe was flat. You talked about growth in Diabetes Care and some of the others this year. Is that just a pharma systems issue or is there something else there that's in a state of decline?","Vincent A. Forlenza","No. It's pretty much pharma systems. And Gary, you want to comment any further on Europe?","Gary M. Cohen","Yes, just I had mentioned before, of the 8 country areas in Europe, 5 are growing quite nicely, 4 of them are growing above mid-single digits. And it's really the pharma systems impact in France and then a small decline in Italy and Spain given the economic conditions there. But I think low single digits is a good assumption for your growth.","Vincent A. Forlenza","It was 4 in the quarter when you pull all of those.","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful.","Vincent A. Forlenza","And Bill will talk to you about the environment. Now we would disagree. We don't have dominant positions. We've done a good job in the U.S. market, but I'll turn it over to Bill.","William A. Kozy","This is Bill. Just on the competitive environment, first of all on the infusion side, remember that we've got an array of Safety products, some of which are very new, which are launched in both the U.S. and in Europe. If you start in Europe, we did get accelerated capacity in place last year on the Venflon Pro Safety. That's the safety product for side port infusion. We're getting very, very solid growth there. We're also getting double-digit growth on our Nexiva platform worldwide. And we just launched just a few months ago, so it's too soon to talk much about the Insyte Autoguard with Blood Control, but we've got significant number of evaluations going on with that product. So we're comfortable that we're well positioned on the infusion side to compete, particularly in the developed markets. And our safety product also in China continues to grow at very high rates, well into double digits. So we think we're just fine in terms of competing in that category. We're also just starting to roll out our ReKindle product portfolio for the hypodermic side. That really doesn't complete its full array availability until we get into late second quarter or third quarter. That's more of a second-half factor. But anyhow, all those changes that I know we've talked to you about for a couple of years now starting to roll out. So we're probably a little more confident in our ability to compete around the world than we might have been even 1.5, 2 years ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Frelick with Canaccord.","Jeffrey Frelick - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","A question for David with respect to Med\/Surg. The challenges over the last 4 or 5 quarters with U.S. Med\/Surg business and then you talked about maybe bumping up the low end of guidance for this year for the overall Med\/Surg business, is that due to a change in the U.S. business or mainly some outperformance or improvement in o U.S.?","David V. Elkins","Just to clarify, the improvement in Med\/Surg is globally, number one. Number two, the difficulty -- the recent difficulty that we had with Med\/Surg is the pricing that we talked about. And Vince mentioned earlier one particular product in particular how that pricing pressure, which is impacting it in the last half of 2011, in the first half of 2012. So we will see improvement in U.S. as that tough comparison goes away. And then overall, we're seeing very good growth and increased confidence internationally on Med\/Surg business and the fact, those 2 factors combined, is why we're bringing up the bottom end of the range on the Medical segment overall.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Robert Goldman with CL King.","Robert M. Goldman - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Going back to the guidance and on the currency, it does look like since you had the Analyst Meeting that the dollar did appreciate relative to the euro by about 3%. And lowering earnings per share and sales guidance as you have seems quite logical unless you have, which I would imagine you do, some natural hedges and if you have any synthetic hedges, and I wonder if you would speak to that. And also is it sort of your intent every time the dollar does move up or down a couple, 3% relative to the euro to be changing your annual guidance on a quarterly basis?","David V. Elkins","First off, we don't have hedges anymore in relation to cash flows. Second, in relation to how we provide guidance, we've been pretty consistent over the years on how we look at guidance in relation to movements in currency as we talked about early. Euro is our biggest exposure to the currencies. As I said earlier, it's a little over $2 billion. So we provide guidance changes in those major currencies, we updated the reported numbers. So we do, do that on a quarterly basis.","Robert M. Goldman - CL King & Associates, Inc.","And the natural hedge question?","David V. Elkins","Well, we have a natural hedge and what we said is about 25% of any impact on the top line flows through to the bottom line, so that gives you an idea of the natural hedge that we have.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Which we take into account when we make this change in guidance.","David V. Elkins","Yes, and recall we don't make any statements about where we think currencies are going to be. When we provide guidance, it's usually right around where the spot rates are. In November, the spot rate in the euro was around $1.38, and as we said earlier, we're at the high $1.20s when we pull together our guidance and where we think it's going to be for the remainder of the year.","Vincent A. Forlenza","All right. So listen I would like to thank all of you for your questions. I'd like to say that we're pleased with the start to the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we saw some strong growth in emerging markets, good safety growth. The product launches are on track and so are our operational excellence programs. We look forward to talking to you during the balance of the year. Thank you very, very much.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

It will be available for replay through August 13, 2015 on the Investors page of the BD.com website or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 78953246. I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment.","Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique N. Dolecki - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at BD.com.","During today's call we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A section of recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, as we will speak to our revenue and earnings results on an adjusted basis, which exclude certain items we recorded during the quarter. These items primarily reflect purchase accounting adjustments that include the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles as well as adjustments to reflect CareFusion's inventory, fixed assets, debt, and deferred revenue balances at fair value as of the acquisition date.","As a reminder, our third quarter results now reflect the New BD, which includes the results of CareFusion for the full quarter. To provide additional revenue visibility into the New BD, we will speak to our revenue results this morning on a comparable currency neutral basis, which include BD and CareFusion in the current and prior-year periods. The comparable basis presents current period revenues on an adjusted basis that excludes a small impact related to a purchase accounting adjustment to record CareFusion's deferred revenues at fair value as of the acquisition date. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable-basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","Lastly, we have provided slides that illustrate the new reportable segment and business unit structure of the combined company, which can also be found in the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. Copies of the release, including the financial schedules and Investor Relations slides, are posted on the BD.com website.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Administration; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President of BD Medical; and Linda Tharby, Executive Vice President of the BD Life Sciences segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As we stated in our press release, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter, which was ahead of our expectations.","This quarter marks an important milestone in BD's history, as it is the first time reporting our results as the New BD, which combines the BD and CareFusion businesses, generating over $3 billion in revenues in the quarter. We continue to be on target with the integration of BD and CareFusion. We've made excellent progress with our leadership assessment across the organization and are confident we have the team in place to execute on our strategy. We remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2015 and 2016 accretion commitments.","Our solid results this quarter clearly demonstrate our early progress as the New BD. This performance was driven by continued solid mid-single-digit top line performance from the BD business coupled with better than expected revenue performance across the CareFusion businesses. Once again, our solid results highlight the benefit of our diverse portfolio both on a product and geographic basis.","Additionally, the operating leverage in the quarter demonstrates we're making good progress towards delivering on our synergy commitments. Our strong performance to date and full-year outlook gives us the confidence to raise our adjusted diluted EPS guidance despite additional foreign currency headwinds.","Now I would like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our third quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2015 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by discussing our third quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter.","Total third quarter revenues of $3.1 billion grew 55.6%. On a comparable basis, revenues grew 2.4%, which is above the 1% to 2% growth we had anticipated and communicated on last quarter's earnings call. This reflects solid growth in line with our expectation of 4.7% in the BD business. The CareFusion business declined 2% in the quarter due to a tough comparison in infusion, which was better than the 5% to 7% decline we had anticipated and communicated last quarter.","Fully diluted adjusted earnings per share came in ahead of our expectations at $2.05, growing at 34.3% over the prior year. Growth was driven by continued solid underlying performance of the BD business coupled with the inclusion of CareFusion. As we just discussed, CareFusion's revenue performance exceeded our expectations, and we were able to realize some cost synergy benefits beginning in the third quarter, which is sooner than we had anticipated. However, we continue to see an increasingly negative impact from FX, given the year-over-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","As Vince mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our first quarter as a combined entity. Our results year to date combined with our full-year outlook give us the confidence to increase our EPS guidance despite the increased FX headwinds. These financial metrics remain consistent with our expectation for high teens currency neutral earnings accretion in fiscal 2016 from the CareFusion acquisition. I'll provide more detailed guidance commentary later in my remarks.","We are also pleased to announce that we have continued to deleverage, as we reduced the debt associated with the acquisition of CareFusion. In addition to the $650 million paydown at the end of April, we paid down an additional $250 million of our $1 billion term loan facility in July. We remain on track to achieve our commitment of three times gross debt leverage within 24 months of close.","Moving on to slide seven, I'll review our third quarter revenue growth by segment on a comparable currency neutral basis. In the quarter, pricing was about flat on a legacy BD basis. Year-to-date pricing is better than our expectations. As such, we are revising our full-year guidance for pricing to be about flat year over year.","BD Medical third quarter revenues increased 1.6%. Underlying Medical revenue growth was approximately 4%, which includes normalizing for the tough comparison in infusion. Growth in this segment was primarily driven by Medication and Procedural Solutions, or MPS. As a reminder, MPS includes BD's Medical Surgical Systems unit as well as CareFusion's Infection Prevention and Medical Specialties businesses. MPS growth was 5%, which reflects growth across all platforms, including strength in flush, ChloraPrep, and safety engineered products.","Revenues in Medication Management Solutions, or MMS, declined 6.1%. The infusion business had a difficult compare to last year's June quarter, which grew 40%. The dispensing business also had a difficult comparison to the prior year. However, we are experiencing continued strong demand for our Pyxis ES product, and it has continued to perform in line with our expectations. Adjusting for the difficult comparisons, underlying MMS revenues grew about 5% in the quarter.","Respiratory Solution revenues declined 2%, reflecting the lost revenues associated with the previously announced recall, as anticipated. This was partially offset by favorable timing of other Respiratory Solution products which shifted from the fourth quarter to the third quarter.","Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.4%, reflecting some softness in the U.S., due primarily to the slowing of conversion from syringes to pen needles and flattening of price trends. Offsetting this were solid sales in international markets.","Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 8% reflects favorable timing of ordering patterns, as expected, with year-to-date growth of 3.6%.","BD Life Sciences third quarter revenues increased 4.2%, primarily driven by growth in biosciences and Preanalytical Systems. Biosciences revenue growth was 5.1% in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in research, instruments, and reagents, and the timing of orders in our advanced bioprocessing business. As we expected and communicated to you on our last quarter earnings call, we saw a small favorable impact related to the timing of government funding in Japan. Preanalytical Systems growth of 4.1% was driven by safety engineered products and growth in emerging markets.","Diagnostic Systems growth of 3.7% reflects solid core microbiology growth and double-digit growth in our BD MAX molecular platform, partially offset by the impact of extended interval testing in the U.S. and continued pressure in our ProbeTec Viper platforms.","Moving on to slide eight, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the third quarter on a comparable basis. U.S. revenues declined 1.5%. I'd like to note that our third quarter results in the U.S. are not indicative of our year-to-date results or our go-forward expectations, as we expect growth in the U.S. to normalize next quarter. U.S. Medical revenues declined 2.8% due to the aforementioned tough comparisons in Medication Management Solutions, or MMS. Normalizing for the tough comparison in MMS, U.S. revenues and U.S. Medical segment revenues each grew about 2%. We saw solid growth in our Medication and Procedural Solutions unit, driven by flush and ChloraPrep, partially offset by a tough comparison in Pharmaceutical Systems and the AVEA ship hold impact on Respiratory Solutions. U.S. revenues in Diabetes Care were about flat.","The U.S. Life Sciences segment grew 2.9%. This reflects strong growth in our U.S. Biosciences business, driven by research instrument and reagent sales and timing in our advanced bioprocessing business. In our U.S. Diagnostics business, we saw continued strength in our core microbiology business and growth in our BD MAX molecular platform, offset by the extended interval testing impact and continued pressure on our ProbeTec Viper platforms.","Moving on to international, revenues grew 6.6%. The Medical segment grew 7.4%, driven by strong performance in Pharmaceutical Systems and international safety sales. The Life Sciences segment grew 5.2%, reflecting strength in Preanalytical Systems and Diagnostics Systems.","Moving on to slide nine, before I get into the emerging market results, I'd like to start with some comments on developed markets. U.S. revenues grew about 2% on an underlying basis, as we just discussed. In the non-U.S. developed markets, we saw strong performance, with Europe, Japan, and Canada all growing in the mid-single digits on a currency neutral basis. With the inclusion of CareFusion, developed markets have become a larger and more impactful portion of the total company revenue base.","Moving on to emerging market results, you'll see that emerging markets are presented on a legacy BD basis, as this provides a more meaningful comparison to the guidance we have been providing all year. Beginning in fiscal 2016, we will provide a bridge to a new emerging market baseline that combines BD and CareFusion. With CareFusion revenues predominantly in developed marks, emerging markets will clearly be a lower percentage of total company revenues on a combined basis. It's important to note that emerging markets will continue to be a very important growth driver for the company.","In the third quarter, emerging market revenues grew 11% currency neutral over the prior year, bringing our total growth year to date to 10.4%. This growth was driven by Latin America and China. As we expected, our growth in Brazil improved slightly compared with last quarter's growth rate. For the total year, we expect growth in the emerging markets in the BD legacy base of about 10%.","China growth for the third quarter was 15.4%. We saw some softness in China, and as a result, have revised our growth outlook slightly lower, to 16% to 17% for the total year.","Moving to global Safety on slide 10, comparable currency neutral sales increased 6.2%. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 0.9%, while international sales grew 13.5% currency neutral, with continued strength in Europe which grew double digits, as compliance with safety legislation continues. Safety revenues grew 13.5% in emerging markets. Medical Safety sales grew 7.4%, driven by a range of safety engineered products, including infusion disposables, with strong international growth across Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems. Life Sciences Safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4.3% in the quarter.","Turning to slide 11 and our gross profit margin for the third quarter, foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of about 50 basis points on our gross profit margin in the quarter. On a performance basis, margin expansion was driven by continuous improvement initiatives and favorable raw materials. These contributions were partially offset by higher pension expenses, product mix, and other items.","Slide 12 recaps the third quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency neutral results on an adjusted basis. As we discussed, revenues were ahead of our expectations, while gross profit was in line with our expectations. SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.3%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting that includes the accelerated cost synergy capture, as previously discussed. When you look at the results on a comparable basis to what the combined company would have been last year, we achieved 110 basis points of improvement year over year.","R&D as a percentage of revenue was 5.7%, which is slightly lower due to the timing of spending with the fourth quarter. We continue to invest in innovation and expect R&D spend to be about 6% for the full year. Operating income grew 62.9% in the quarter on revenue growth of 55.6%, reflecting strong P&L leverage as the New BD. Our tax rate increased by 110 basis points, as expected, due to the inclusion of CareFusion's U.S.-based results.","In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.05, which is a 34.3% increase versus the prior year. This reflects operating profit growth, partially offset by the transaction impact on the tax rate, interest expense, and increased shares outstanding. Earnings were ahead of our expectations due to the underlying strength in the CareFusion business, as well as our ability to achieve some cost synergies and eliminate some costs in the third quarter that we had anticipated would take place in the fourth quarter.","On slide 14, I'd like to update you on our organic revenue growth profile and phasing in fiscal 2015. Third quarter performance across the CareFusion business exceeded our expectations. While some of the Respiratory Solutions sales reflect favorable timing in the third quarter, we now expect organic CareFusion growth of about 3.5% for the fiscal year. When combined with our continued expectation of about 5% organic BD growth, we continue to expect about 4.5% growth for the full fiscal year.","Moving on to slide 15, there are a number of moving parts that impact earnings per share expectations. For modeling purposes, and to ensure consistency, I'd like to provide more color on EPS guidance.","Starting at the top of the slide with legacy BD, the guidance we provided last quarter of $6.43 to $6.50 assumed adjusted earnings per share growth of 9% to 10% on a currency neutral basis and an estimated unfavorable impact from foreign currency headwinds of about 10 percentage points. Since our May update, the dollar has strengthened further against the euro and other major currencies to which we have exposure, such as the yen, the Canadian dollar, and the Brazilian real. The result is that we now expect an additional 50 basis points of FX pressure to legacy BD EPS at today's spot rates. Incremental FX pressure resulted in a reduction of about $0.03 to our estimated BD legacy adjusted earnings per share guidance, to a range of $6.40 to $6.47.","The chart at the bottom of the slide presents our total company guidance. As you'll recall, we had expected about 10% currency neutral accretion from the CareFusion acquisition and a currency headwind to CareFusion's earnings of about 100 basis points, which when applied to our May legacy BD base of $6.43 to $6.50, resulted in a May total company earnings guidance of $7.00 to $7.10.","Given the stronger than expected performance in the third quarter from the CareFusion business and our ability to realize some cost synergies and eliminate some costs earlier than we had anticipated this year, we expect an additional 100 basis points of currency neutral accretion in fiscal 2015, partially offset by the incremental 50 basis points of headwinds from FX. This gives us the confidence to raise our guidance to a range of $7.08 to $7.12.","With the revised BD legacy base for fiscal 2015, we remain comfortable with what we have previously disclosed in terms of our currency neutral legacy BD and CareFusion accretion profile of high teens accretion in fiscal 2016. We will update you for the FX impact in 2016 when we give guidance in November based on rates in effect at that time.","Turning to slide 16, I'd like to walk you through the additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2015. We expect total company currency neutral revenue growth of 28.5% to 29%, with BD Medical growing 48.5% to 49%, both of which are at the higher end of our previous ranges given better than expected CareFusion performance in the third quarter. We continue to expect Life Sciences growth of about 5%.","Also to note beyond revenues and EPS, all other P&L guidance for May remains unchanged. We continue to expect gross profit margin of 52% to 52.5% and SSG&A and R&D as a percentage of revenues of about 25% and 6% respectively. Our operating margin and tax rate guidance also remain unchanged.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide a brief update on our progress around our key initiatives.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Chris. Moving on to slide 18, I would like to go over the Medical & Biosciences segment and the Life Sciences unit. We remain excited about the Intelliport opportunity. Excuse me one second.","We remain excited about the Intelliport opportunity, our system for eliminating bolus IV injection errors at the bedside. We're receiving early positive customer interest, and we remain on track for commercial release.","We continue to expect to launch our insulin infusion sets in fiscal year 2016. Our collaboration with Medtronic, announced in June, will enable BD FlowSmart technology to be made widely available to as many people living with diabetes as possible. We had presented three different evidence posters at the American Diabetes Association's annual meeting with data on BD FlowSmart technology. This included results showing a 75% reduction in pressure rise events or silent occlusions. We are confident that this product will have a meaningful impact for diabetes patients globally.","Within Biosciences, we continue to anticipate the launch of two additional BD Horizon dyes based on the Sirigen technology. As we have been sharing with you, these dyes combined with our high-end research instruments are enabling significant gains in multi-parameter flow cytometry analysis. We also continue to anticipate the launch of two instruments, the X14 high-parameter multicolor research instrument and the BD FACSVia clinical instrument, aimed to enable increased market adoption in emerging markets, particularly in China.","Turning to slide 19, you will see the various product launches in our Life Sciences Diagnostic unit. Our BD MAX molecular instrument continues to gain traction with customers in Western Europe, where our expanded menu that includes the CE Marked GC\/CT and GC\/CT\/Trich assays launched last quarter are enabling increased placements. We remain focused on menu expansion on the BD MAX platform and expect the Enteric Parasite assay to launch later this quarter in the U.S., followed in fiscal 2016 by the Extended Enteric Bacterial and Enteric Viral assays in the EU and the U.S. in 2016 and 2017.","In 2016, we also expect to launch GC\/CT in the U.S. and the Vaginitis\/Vaginosis assays in the EU and the U.S. We also expect to launch the BD Totalys system in the U.S. in women's health and cancer for cervical cancer screening automation in the first half of fiscal year 2016. As you can see, we continue to have strong opportunities in our pipeline, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you going forward.","On slide 20, before we open the call to questions, I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, we're very pleased with our results as the New BD. Second, our performance was driven by continued solid mid-single-digit top line performance from the BD business coupled with better than expected revenue performance from the CareFusion businesses. Once again, our solid results highlight the benefits of our diverse portfolio, both on a product and geographic basis.","Third, we are making significant progress successfully integrating CareFusion into BD while achieving cost synergies. Fourth, our strong performance in the quarter and our full-year outlook gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for fiscal year 2015. Finally, we look forward to the future with confidence, as we continue to deliver on BD's strategy of providing complete solutions for global health care needs.","Thank you, we'll now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan","Thank you, guys. Good morning. Maybe I'll start with just the question of now that we are a quarter in, anything new or surprising that you found in CareFusion, either positive on the opportunity side or negative that you have to deal with?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Mike, I can't think of any significant surprises. What I would tell you is that I think the implementation, it's not a surprise, we planned it out, is going very well. We're very much on track with what we expected. As we think about both the cost synergies and the planning for the revenue synergies, I think all that detailed planning has come together quite nicely. I wouldn't say it's a surprise, but I did mention in my opening remarks that the talent assessment and integration, we feel very good about the team that we now have in place.","Now was it a little bit of a surprise in terms of the strong performance in the quarter of the CareFusion businesses? Yes, we had communicated a revenue expectation that was less. And so that was a bit of an upside for the short run, but in the longer-run issues, really nothing \u2013 really on-track performance.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan","Okay, good. Let's talk about China, because there were a number of reports over the course of the earnings season from companies with issues in China, most of them more consumer-facing companies than Becton-Dickinson. But you did comment that you thought China was a little bit softer and your expectations came in a little bit. So number one, can you talk about that?","And then second, I was hoping you could spend a few minutes on the infusion opportunity in China, which infusion pumps are still very very early in China. That isn't a market that has really developed to this point. And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you plan on developing that market. I knew there was a product that you acquired from Israel that you thought might be a good fit, and I was hoping you could you spend a few minutes on that. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Mike. That's great. So I'll take China in the quarter, and then I'll ask Tom Polen to talk about the exciting opportunity that we have in the infusion business in China going forward.","So we did see a little bit of softness in China in the quarter. It was mostly on the diagnostics side, where we saw longer purchasing cycles for equipment. And so that's what impacted the third quarter. We did change the guidance to 16% to 17%. It's down slightly from where we were last quarter. We do expect that there will be some inventory adjustments on the medical side of the business in the fourth quarter, and that's just being proactive with our distribution partners, to make sure that they have the right level of inventory. That's how we get to 16% to 17%.","But when we look at it more broadly, it's still a very exciting opportunity for us. We're still outperforming our peers, but what is going on, it's becoming very big. And as it's becoming bigger, just the law of large numbers is starting to come into effect here. And so, at these growth rates, it's still going to be contributing significantly going forward. And as you mentioned, and asked about, we see the opportunity in the core continuing, but on top of that, as we go forward, the opportunity, not just infusion, but in other product lines. But let me turn it over to Tom to talk about the opportunity in infusion.","Thomas Polen - Executive Vice President and President - Medical Segment","Okay. Hi, Mike. This is Tom. So as we think about the opportunity in infusion, maybe I'll break it into a time horizon approach. And so, across both consumables and capital, we've actually recently just launched CareFusion's IV needleless connectors through our sales channel in China. And so that's a near-term opportunity associated with the infusion process. They're actually getting our first incremental sales from putting that through the BD sales force. So that's actually in the market underway.","The next product that we're looking to launch there related to infusion are the infusion sets. And those are actively being prepared for SFDA submission. But those will be the next products to be launched.","And following that are the pumps. As you mentioned, the pumps per hospital bed in China are a fraction, less than 10%, of the ratios that you see in the U.S. And we do see opportunities there, confirmed by research we've done directly and in the market space. We see both \u2013 and we've confirmed interest from customers for CME pumps broadly across hospital segments, but we also actually see opportunity for Alaris in the very top tier hospital segment. And so we're preparing registration for both of those products now in China, with more to come. But those will take a couple years to get through the SFDA process.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan","Tom, I know you were coming up on a potentially new memorandum of understanding in China related to the medication delivery business. Has that gone into place? Is there anything different about the new memorandum versus the prior one?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Mike, I'm going next week to China to sign the new memorandum of understanding, and so I'm really looking forward to that. The last one was a couple years ago. This will include infection control products as well, and it will be focused on infusion therapy.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan","Perfect, thank you, guys.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning, everyone. I just had one question on the business and then one financial follow-up. Maybe first on the business, could you talk a little bit more about the Special Order Research Processing [SORP] franchise, and just remind us how big that is? And one of the things we've seen across the biopharma industry is the resurgence of R&D spending, and to what extent that might influence that business on a go-forward basis? And I had one financial follow-up.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So our SORP business is over $100 million, and it's been a strong franchise for us for a long time. And I think, Linda, at the high end of the research market, you're now starting to see some real traction with that product line.","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President and President - Life Sciences Segment","Hi, it's Linda here, a couple of additional comments to what Vince mentioned. So, with the addition of our Sirigen dyes and our multi-parameter flow analysis, we're really able to drive multi-parameters up above 50 parameters now, which is unheard of in the market, which is fantastic ,and driving double-digit growth across that research platform.","The other area that you mentioned is spending. Of course, we're seeing stability in spending, both in the U.S. and Western Europe, which is helping, and also the NIH budget, which just saw an increase recently with the passing of the 21st Century Cures Act. So overall, as we look ahead to our research business, we continue to see strong performance, and with the funding, continue to see a positive outlook as we move forward.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, so as Linda says that, it's more than just the SORP product line that I mentioned. Linda is also talking about the standard research products, which we're very excited about.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","David, did you have a follow-up on the financials? Is David still there?","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","FY 2016, I just want to confirm that you're still comfortable with that, which was taking the base BD earnings for FY 2015, growing that at 10% FX neutral, then adding in a high teens accretion number. And at that point in time, you had talked about being comfortable with a mid-$8 number. Has anything changed with respect to those assumptions, and how should we think about changes in foreign currency in that context?","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","You hit it on the head, David. As we said in and I said in my prepared remarks, we have the baseline of what BD would have been in 2015. You grow that 9% to 10%. It's high teens accretion off of that, but obviously currency neutral. And so you've seen the strengthening U.S. dollar impact that it had this year. So that's why I said we'll address that on the next call based on where rates are at that time.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Good morning, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Maybe just a couple quick questions. Chris, just coming back to margins for a second here, so they're obviously so far tracking higher than even our expectations, so two things. Where is the strength coming from the core BD? I think you talked about over 100 basis points. So where is that strength coming from? And then as it relates to CareFusion, you talked about some strength there. Is this faster implementation of the synergy plan or, frankly, is the magnitude of some of the opportunities proving to be larger?","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","So far what we're seeing is that the savings are coming sooner, so I don't think it's a magnitude issue. But we were able to get some savings right out of the box in the third quarter that we originally thought would have been fourth quarter items. So you actually pick up an extra quarter of that because we'll get those same kind of savings in the fourth quarter as well. So that's a nice little benefit.","In terms of the margin improvements core business, as you know, the raw materials, when we laid that out on the gross profit side, is certainly benefiting us. That is offset, as we always expected, by some pension expense and the like. And then on SSG&A, that 110 basis points improvement is fairly significant, and that's certainly driving good operating margins. So it's all of those things contributing to very nice margins.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, and then maybe just two product segment questions. You talked about obviously CareFusion was stronger than expected. Respiratory was much stronger than we would have expected. I know some of that reflects timing, but how much of that is timing? And then can you just update us on the progress on the recall, either revenue impact or earnings impact? And then on the core company, the only business line that looked a little weak to us was Diabetes. Is there anything in particular we should focus on, or is that simply order timing or stocking? Thank you.","Thomas Polen - Executive Vice President and President - Medical Segment","Sure.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","So before we move to Tom, let me just say on the recall issue, I'll remind you that we gave an estimate last quarter of the impact that would have. That is already contemplated in our guidance, and so we're in good shape from 2015. And in 2016, it's really not material, and I would just point out that this is a product line that's about $35 million in revenue, so not material going forward either. So I think we've got it contemplated both in 2015 and our expectations for 2016.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Tom, do you want to take those questions?","Thomas Polen - Executive Vice President and President - Medical Segment","Sure. Hi, David, this is Tom, so just maybe one or two other comments on respiratory. Some of the better performance we saw this quarter was driven primarily in our respiratory capital business with favorable timing of orders, as one could expect within those capital-type businesses. So that's the one point there.","Regarding the AVEA product, as Chris mentioned, it's about a $35 million product line. We have not assumed in our guidance that that returns to the market within this fiscal year. And so we don't see a risk for that from a timing perspective.","On diabetes and your question there, as Chris had mentioned earlier, we did see some softness in Diabetes Care growth of about 3.4%, driven essentially exclusively by the U.S., which was 0.3% growth. And we really see that due to flattening of the price trend coupled with a decrease in the conversion rate from syringes to pen needles. As we sell pen needles at higher prices than syringes, slower conversion creates a drag on the revenue growth. Now with that said, more broadly, we remain really excited about the future in Diabetes Care and we're focused on meeting needs of our customers and growth opportunities, both in the core business as well as in new adjacent spaces, such as the new upcoming infusion set launch in FY 2016 that Vince mentioned in detail with Medtronic.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Thomas Polen - Executive Vice President and President - Medical Segment","Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, good morning, two questions actually dovetailing on your answers. Stepping back on CareFusion, I understand the comments around the respiratory business and the timing of orders. But could you also speak to perhaps what else did a bit better there, CareFusion broadly?","And then separately, on the insulin infusion set opportunity, which I think is a really good opportunity for you guys, could you help us think about either sizing that or putting some parameters around what this might mean to the company?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Tom?","Thomas Polen - Executive Vice President and President - Medical Segment","Yes, this is Tom. So in the CareFusion business, across the board we saw good growth, as we mentioned. In MMS underlying, we were about 5% growth for the quarter. So Pyxis ES and infusion are both doing well there. As Chris had mentioned, we had a very large 40% growth in the prior-year quarter in infusion, which made a tough comp. We also saw very good performance, though, in the Medication and Procedural Solutions business, the legacy CareFusion products, with a focus on both the ChloraPrep products but also the infusion consumables, the IV sets, valves, et cetera, so really positive momentum there.","As we think about the infusion set in Diabetes Care, we haven't sized that opportunity. But maybe some comments that I can mention is that we have received FDA, CE, and Health Canada approval. At this point, we're really focused on ramping up our manufacturing for that product and preparing for launch in partnership with Medtronic in FY 2016.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks, Larry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, Vince. Hi, Chris. Hi, everybody.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Rick.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Maybe starting off, if you would, with two product questions. First, on the pump side of the business, Baxter reported that their pump business, their pump system rebounded nicely. And in talking to them after it, I had the sense that one of your other competitor's regulatory and other dislocations are maybe helping out. Are you seeing any benefits on that side of business? I assumed you all gained share in pumps. But is going to be an incremental better number going forward?","Thomas Polen - Executive Vice President and President - Medical Segment","We do continue to do very well in our pump business. That's probably what we would say there.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, that sounds good. Back to CareFusion, on the Pyxis side, just rereading last quarter's transcript, you were saying that you're seeing improved \u2013 you're throwing additional resources into the Pyxis install process. Acknowledging the complexity of the installs, are you gaining those efficiencies, are you accelerating the penetration of your existing backlog? What's happening there?","Thomas Polen - Executive Vice President and President - Medical Segment","This is Tom, good question. We do have significant work underway. As we mentioned before, we've put in some Lean Six Sigma teams to help lean out the Pyxis ES installation process, and the team is making some early positive progress there.","With that said, we do continue to experience very strong demand for the Pyxis ES system. And so while we're installing off of the backlog, the backlog does remain essentially at those record high levels still because the pipeline is being filled in with new orders at quite a good rate. And so the process improvements are underway. We have made progress. More to do there, I would say, but we're heading in the right direction.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we're early on, but we think it's a real opportunity for us. And as Tom is saying, we're seeing the initial impacts, but we've got a long way to go.","Thomas Polen - Executive Vice President and President - Medical Segment","Rick, and maybe just one other comment I could add is to the earlier question on infusion pumps that you're maybe looking for a little bit more color on, one other comment I could add is that we are seeing customers respond very favorable to the medication management end-to-end vision and the connectivity of our solutions across that process, valuing both the pumps and the Pyxis ES being interoperable with one another through the electronic medical record and our SmartWorks platform. So that's resonating very positively with our customers.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, both Tom and I have been out visiting accounts, and we've seen this first-hand. It's a really powerful value proposition that we have now.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I appreciate that, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Brian.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey. So you talked about product mix a little bit. One of the things I'm trying to get my arms around is in the New BD, can you talk about within the different sub-segments? Which sub-segments have significantly stronger and significantly weaker growth in operating margins relative to the corporate average so that we can have some idea going forward about where strength is going to come from, one, and what that can potentially mean for margins?","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","I'll take that, Brian. I actually don't see anything to point to across the business. I think it's partly, again, what we point to as the diversity of the business. And so there's nothing that I would call out as exceptionally weak or exceptionally strong. I think each of these businesses have the ability to drive the mid-single-digits revenue growth and improving profitability from where they are now. So I don't think there's anything really to call out there.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","They're pretty much clustered around the corporate average. Diagnostics may be a little bit below, but we see the margins there improving. So nothing in terms of modeling and going forward that I would really be pointing to, I think pretty much a cluster.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on BD MAX, you guys talked about, I think you said double-digit growth. Were you looking at new products driving that? Was it an easier comp? What's going on with BD MAX, and should we expect this level of growth going forward? Thanks.","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President and President - Life Sciences Segment","It's Linda here. Thanks for the question, Brian. So on BD MAX, we continue to see expansion of the instruments in the U.S. and in EU being driven by the expanded assays. So we launched CT\/GC and CT\/GC\/Trich in Europe and our enteric panels. We expect that to follow in the U.S. And then Vince provided very good commentary on our expected assay launches in 2016 and 2017. So really now starting to see double-digit growth in the MAX platform and positive feedback from our customers.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Linda, maybe you want to comment on what you're seeing in Europe with the expanded menu.","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President and President - Life Sciences Segment","So in Europe, what we're seeing there is, again, very high double-digit growth, and in terms of instrument placement, a double-digit growth percentage in terms of the uptake in overall instruments, so very positive in Europe. And as we get our expanded menu, expect great things in the U.S. market as well.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Linda. Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a quick question. The adjusted revenues for this quarter, is that a one-quarter phenomenon, or do we need to think about that $13 million or something similar to that going forward? How do we think about that?","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","There's a little bit going forward that will continue to bleed in. It's not significant.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, and then just one quick follow-up. On the intervals and on the Viper headwinds, when do those begin to subside? When do you start to annualize those?","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President and President - Life Sciences Segment","Hi, it's Linda here. Of course, the guidelines came into effect in late 2012. We put that number today at about 70% to 75% penetration, in terms of doctors who have adopted that new interval testing. So probably over the next year or so, we say \u2013 where does that finish out, 85% to 90% of doctors adopting. So we probably have another year or so of the interval testing to get through.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great, thanks and good morning, everybody.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Good morning, Bill.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","I guess first question, Linda, just to follow up on that last response, we saw CMS recently talk about a five-year interval, from three years. And this actually follows up on, if I remember correctly, the additional guideline or recommendations made last year. So I guess, on a long-range basis, should we think at all about intervals potentially going to five years on pap testing?","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President and President - Life Sciences Segment","So, I think those guidelines are probably way too early for us to comment on. I can tell you that what's out there publicly from the medical community would say that five years, depending on age bracket, is way too long for screening. So it's something that we continue to monitor, but today, there's no healthcare system on a global basis that has moved to a five-year interval timing. So we'll monitor it. Too early to comment, but nothing that concerns us in the short term on that.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay, got it. And then I guess, staying on a similar diagnostic topic, microbiology in the U.S., can you flesh out for us a little bit how that's performing? I would certainly expect that we should see some pretty good things here, given the pretty updated suite of products that you have into that space.","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President and President - Life Sciences Segment","Yes, thank you. Our core microbiology business is doing very, very well in the U.S. and ex-U.S. And it's driven by the strength of our BACTEC platform, driven by the strength of ID\/AST and our new partnership with Bruker on the MALDI platform. And really tying all of this together is our new Kiestra lab automation system.","So we've now just begun our footprint on that in the U.S. We have less than 2% market penetration. So we see a lot of opportunity, as we move forward, to really reinvent that microbiology lab from the specimen through the ID\/AST, really starting with automating the workflow. We'll have papers now globally published that say efficiency with the Kiestra lab automation system installed are 60% to 70% improvements in their workflow efficiency. And the next thing we'll look to do is really introduce smart imaging into that platform. So I'm very excited about our U.S. microbiology business and what we're doing across the entire platform.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And it really had good growth this quarter.","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President and President - Life Sciences Segment","It did, very nice.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Very good, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with UBS.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, so just two quick questions. One, Vince, can you update us where you are on the strategic review process? Obviously, there were a number of press reports that there could be some businesses that might be divested.","And then secondly, I think you maintained your emerging market growth outlook. But China, which is a big part of that, was brought down. I'm just curious where you saw some offsets there to maintain it. And what do you think is a reasonable emerging market growth rate, say, for the next three to five years, just given a lot of the macro noise that you have seen this year? Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We haven't changed our perspective on emerging markets. We kept it at 10% for the year. I think that's a good way for us to be thinking about it. And you're right, there are moving pieces there. We saw Brazil bounce back, for example. India actually, we don't talk about, has been doing better and better for us. So, we expect Asia to continue to be strong. So it's not just China. And as we said, China is going to \u2013 continue to be strong for us. It's not going to be at 20% going forward. So that's the way we think about that.","In terms of the strategic review process, we're making good progress on that program, and we're to the point of doing some market checks on appropriate assets. And we'll keep you updated as that moves forward.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Doug.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","If cost synergies were to continue to track ahead of plan, how do you balance the opportunity to let that flow through, versus accelerating the pace of investment in growth and sales synergy initiatives?","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Clearly, we have some commitments and targets to meet. I would say right now, we're not seeing the acceleration increase in the total amount of synergies, so we're not saying that. And so we're going to meet our commitments of high teens, and that's very important to us. Clearly, there's always a balance, but we feel like we are making the right investments. We're not holding back in investments. You saw us last quarter announce that we were going to do some registrations in China right out of the box because, even though it was a little bit of a drag, we knew that it was the right thing to do. So I don't see anything we're holding back on because of that. So, that's the way I would leave it.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, and I do have a second question, but just to be clear on that, you did pull forward some of the cost synergies into this quarter. I guess really the question is, as we think about the next few quarters that there are opportunities to do more of that. Does that allow you to accelerate investment, or would you actually allow some of the upside to flow through for investment?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's a hypothetical question. We're going to do the right thing. If we think there's a benefit to accelerating something, we would accelerate it, keeping in mind, if we were in that position, keeping in mind our commitments that we're making. We talked to you, I think it was last quarter, about the fact that we accelerated the work on registration for China. So those one-off decisions we'd be making; we'll just be rational about it.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then I think for Tom, Earlier this year, we had talked about the ability to move some of the CareFusion products in Europe out of distributors and into the BD direct channel. I think that was something that maybe was at least one area of focus within the context of the annual strategic review, any update on that? Thank you.","Thomas Polen - Executive Vice President and President - Medical Segment","Yes, we haven't been driving that yet. We've been focused in some markets where the products were not necessarily launched yet. It's been our focus, such as ChloraPrep has been a primary area. The other thing I would say perhaps is that we have integrated in our distributor for dispensing in Europe, and so we do now take that. We are taking those products direct. So the entire dispensing business we are now taking direct through Europe.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay M. Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in here, and maybe one quick housekeeping question. On the guidance for the year, it looks like CareFusion came up a little bit, and you hinted that legacy BDX was around the mid-single-digit range. So I'm wondering. Did the organic for the combined BD, did it just come up versus the prior guidance?","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","As we laid out on that chart, Vijay, we're still at about 4.5%. And so a little bit up on CareFusion, but it's more rounding than anything else. So we've continued to show the 4.5%, and we laid that out on the chart as to where that's coming from, so pretty much in line with what we would have expected.","Vijay M. Kumar - Evercore ISI","Great, and then one on pricing. It's heartening to see I guess pricing actually coming in flat. I think that's the first time we've had a flattish pricing year in quite a number of years. And I'm just wondering. Is this a market phenomenon? Are you seeing anything on the competitive front? Is that what's going on? I'm just curious. How should we be thinking about pricing on a go-forward basis?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll have to look at that again next year as we get into it. Last year we saw a little bit of negative pricing in the fourth quarter, and I know we're guiding pretty much flat pricing for this year. But it's still a very competitive marketplace. I'm very happy with the way we have managed pricing this year. It's something we're really intensely focused on. But I think we have to stay tuned and do our plan before I say it's going to be \u2013 that the market has changed, I wouldn't be making that statement. I think we've done a good job this year, and so we'll revisit it next year.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","I would just add that it feels to me pretty much the same as it did last year. We did have a little bit of a blip in the fourth quarter last year, but it was pretty flat up to that point. It feels the same here.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's what I think.","Vijay M. Kumar - Evercore ISI","And the last one, leverage levels, you reaffirmed that 3X within 24 months of deal closure. I'm just curious. Are there any adjacencies that you've reinvested? You're obviously getting into medication management, a lot of EHR, informatics opportunities. And would that be appealing for you?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Vijay, I wouldn't comment on a particular adjacency, but we do continue to think about plug-in acquisitions as we go forward, and we look forward to having more flexibility as we take those debt levels down.","Vijay M. Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That was a good question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Rich Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Just on the CareFusion side of things, Pyxis or Pyxis ES, can you just update us on where you are with respect to the installed base, the opportunity, and the upgrade cycle, whether it's in innings or actual quantification? Can you give us a sense of where you are and where you see you can go?","Thomas Polen - Executive Vice President and President - Medical Segment","Sure, this is Tom. So we're less than 20% converted, our base business, and so we're in the early innings.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A long way to go.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, that's very encouraging. And then just maybe higher level, as you engage further with customers with the combined portfolio and the broad complementary nature of the BD and CareFusion full suite of offering across the hospital, are the conversations \u2013 or can you characterize where the conversations are going there, anything to suggest that maybe some revenue synergy potential could begin to formulate even faster than expected as we look to 2016 and beyond, anything to increase or decrease your confidence on that front? Thanks a lot.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think we're pretty much where we said we were going to be. Tom mentioned that the concept in terms of Medication Management is resonating very well. We have some work to do with integrating Cato and CRISI into the system and getting the software aligned. So there's some technical work to be done that gates us a little bit in the short run. But in terms of how we are thinking about it and the timing, I think we're right on track. Tom also mentioned we are making progress, getting products into the market outside of the U.S., as he mentioned, in China, so right where we expect it to be.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","That was our final question, and now I'd like to turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for any additional or closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thank you very much for your participation today and your thoughtful questions. It's a very exciting time at BD, and we look forward to updating you on the progress of this strategy as we wrap up the year. Thanks very much, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through November 12, 2019, on the Investors webpage of the bd.com website or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 5994332. I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed on in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment.","Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Dorothy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us to review our fourth fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our fourth fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Our fourth quarter results include a non-cash charge in the period related to product liability matters of $582 million pertaining to certain legacy Bard surgical products. This item along with the details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release and in the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. A copy of the release including the financial schedules is posted on the bd.com website. ","As a reminder, to provide additional revenue visibility, we will speak to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 revenue results on a comparable currency neutral basis. The comparable basis includes BD and Bard in the current and prior year periods, and excludes intercompany revenues and revenues associated with divestitures among other adjustments. ","Before I turn the call over to Vince, we would like to comment on the leadership change that was announced back in September. We are very pleased to have appointed Tom Polen as BD's next CEO effective January 28, 2020. Vince will remain Chairman of the Board upon his retirement as CEO. While the company is energized for our next phase, it is truly bittersweet for all of us, who have worked closely with Vince over the years. He is a wonderful person, who has showed us that the secret to success lies in simple things like hard work, perseverance and having a little fun along the way. ","We're also excited to announce that our next Analyst Day will be held on May 28 of 2020. Tom and the management team will share our vision and strategy for BD's next era of value creation. So please save the date and look for more information in the coming weeks. ","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, Executive Vice President and President of the Interventional segment; and Patrick Kaltenbach, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment. ","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vince Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss the company's performance, I would like to spend a few moments reflecting on the previously announced CEO succession. As Monique just mentioned, I will retire as BD\u2019s CEO on January 28 of 2020, while continuing to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Board has unanimously elected Tom Polen, our current President and COO to succeed in as BD's next CEO and President. Tom's appointment reflects the leadership role he has played developing and implementing BD's strategy and vision. ","We believe that it is the right time for a leadership transition, given where we are in BD's journey. As we begin the final year of the BD Bard integration, we're looking ahead to our next phase of value creation, including how we leverage the capabilities we\u2019ve built to better serve our customers. You will know Tom well, and we are confident that Tom's vision, energy and drive make him the right leader at the right time to deliver on BD's strategic and cultural evolution. ","With that, let me turn it over to Tom to say a few words. ","Tom Polen ","Thanks, Vince. I've had a privilege to work alongside Vince and to learn from him for more than 15 years. What stands out the most is what an authentic and purpose-driven leader he is. Vince is committed to doing what is right for customers, associates, shareholders and our communities. Vince has led the company during the most transformative period in BD's nearly 125-year history. Under his leadership, BD evolved from what was largely a medical device manufacturer into one of the top five leading companies in med tech today. Vince has made a lasting impact on our team, our company and the entire med tech industry. And for that, we're all grateful. It is an honor to have the opportunity to follow Vince as BD's next CEO, and to lead this company as we prepare for our next phase of growth and impact, while staying true to our purpose and core values. ","We have built tremendous capabilities unmatched in our industry, and assembled a leading portfolio of solutions to better serve the entire healthcare continuum, from discovery to diagnosis to the process of care, and the treatment of disease. As we look forward, I believe we have an exciting opportunity to unleash the potential of the new BD to further our impact. I very much look forward to the journey ahead. ","And with that, let me turn the call back over to Vince. ","Vince Forlenza","Thanks, Tom for your kind words and congratulations again. Now let's move on to Slide 4, and our key achievements for the year. As expected, we finished fiscal year 2019 with very strong underlying performance and momentum across our businesses. For the full year, we grew revenues 5.1%, which includes the impact of DCBs. Revenue growth reflects the planned back half acceleration that we have been discussing with you throughout this year. As expected, growth was broad-based, reflecting the breadth and depth of the portfolio. ","We also drove approximately 60 basis points of margin expansion and delivered double-digit EPS growth before the impact of currency. And we achieved all of this while overcoming significant headwinds and the impact of divestitures, while continuing to make strategic business investments. At the same time, we are delivering on our Bard commitments.","If you turn the Slide 5, I'd like to highlight the value we've already created with the BD plus Bard combination, as we head into the third year of the deal model. We're very pleased with the progress we've made so far. Our core has grown stronger, and we are delivering more impactful solutions to our customers.","On an underlying basis, both companies are driving strong revenue growth with legacy Bard growing over 6% and legacy BD growing over 5% creating durable and sustainable top-line growth. Underlying earnings growth has been in the mid-teens. The integration of our two companies and cost and revenue synergy capture are on track. ","In addition, we are well on our way to quickly reducing our leverage to below 3 times over the three-year deal period. ","Lastly, Bard has entered BD into higher growth markets that we will continue to leverage and build upon beyond the deal period as we enter our next era of value creation. WavelinQ, Venovo, Covera and PureWick are good examples of products in these new higher growth categories.","Before I move on to guidance, I would also like to highlight the great work that has been done in new product innovation across the other segments. They also continue to fuel growth from the new Alaris Pump, Pyxis ES and our HealthSight platform in the Medical segment to our expanded BD MAX menu, BD FACS Research and clinical instruments and continued expansion of our BD Horizon brilliant dyes and Life Sciences, just to name a few. ","There are additional products and solutions in the pipeline that we are equally as excited about, and I'll touch on those later in the presentation. All-in-all, we are proud of our organization\u2019s performance and strong execution.","Before I review the guidance for 2020, I want to touch on the recent news with respect to our Covington facility in Georgia. Many of you already know that we entered into an agreement with the State of Georgia to ensure that the company can continue to provide critical medical devices that are sterilized at our Covington facility. Based on this agreement and our business continuity efforts, we are confident we can continue to meet customers\u2019 demand for these essential products without interruption. BD is safely operating in full compliance with our permits, has proactively adopted the most advanced and best available technology and is emitting a fraction of our allowable limit. We remain confident and science has confirmed that our operations are both -- safe for both employees and the community.","Now moving on to Slide 6, you will see our initial guidance for fiscal year 2020 which reflects continued momentum across our businesses and strong revenue growth of 5% to 5.5%. On the bottom-line, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS between $12.50 and $12.65. This represents currency neutral growth of 9.5% to 11% that is driven by strong underlying growth that is reaching high teens. All-in-all, we expect to drive earnings growth of about 7% to 8.5%. Our outlook is based on our current view of the environment. ","As Monique stated in her opening remarks, Tom and the team look forward to sharing more details about the vision and strategy for BD\u2019s next era of value creation at our next Analyst Day in New York City on May 28, 2020. ","I will now turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our fourth quarter financial performance and our fiscal year 2020 guidance. ","Chris Reidy","Thanks, Vince and good morning, everyone. Before I move to Slide 8, I'd also like to take a moment to congratulate Vince on his upcoming retirement as CEO of BD and thank him for his many years of partnership, friendship and wisdom. Under Vince's leadership, BD has transformed into a top five leading med tech company, laying the foundation for our next phase of growth. Vince is known and respected for his deep commitment to our purpose, our culture and the development of our associates. I think it's an understatement to say that you'll be missed by all of us. ","I'd also like to congratulate Tom on his appointment. I look forward to my continued partnership with Tom as he guides BD through its next phase of growth and value creation, while remaining committed to BD\u2019s purpose and core values. ","Now moving on to Slide 8, I'll review our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results, as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year. Fourth quarter revenues grew 6.2% on a comparable currency neutral basis. Our fourth quarter revenue growth was broad-based and in line with our expectations for continued acceleration in the second half of the fiscal year. I'll provide more color on fourth quarter revenue growth in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and geography. ","Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $3.31 growing 13% over the prior year, or 12.3% on a currency neutral basis. For the total year, revenues grew 5.1% on a comparable currency neutral basis. Adjusting for the impact from DCBs, revenue growth would have been approximately 5.5% for the full year. We also expanded our margins in fiscal 2019. ","On an underlying basis, we drove 130 basis points of operating margin expansion during fiscal 2019, driven in part by the realization of approximately $100 million in Bard cost synergies. The leverage in the business model is evident in our fourth quarter results where operating margins of 27.4% expanded a 150 basis points on a currency neutral basis. ","Full year adjusted EPS of $11.68 grew 6.1% or 11.9% on a currency neutral basis. Growth was driven by strong operating performance, which mitigated the notable headwinds we faced throughout the year. I'll provide more color on fiscal 2019 EPS growth later in my remarks. ","We also continued to delever during the fourth quarter, paying down approximately $675 million of debt and $2 billion for the full fiscal year. As a result, our gross leverage ratio declined to 3.5 times as of September 30. We remain on track to achieve our commitment to delever below 3 times over the three years ending December 2020. ","Additionally, we are also very pleased to have continued our longstanding record of delivering an increasing dividend. Fiscal 2019 marked our 47th year of consecutive dividend increases.","Now moving on to Slide 9, I will review our Medical segment revenue growth. BD Medical revenues grew 5.3% in the fourth quarter and 5.1% for the full fiscal year. As expected, fourth quarter performance in the Medical segment was driven by ongoing momentum and share gains in Medication Management Solutions and continued strength in Pharmaceutical Systems.","Growth in Medication Delivery Solutions was driven by our leading Vascular Access and Vascular Care portfolios. Performance in diabetes care reflects strength in emerging markets that included a particularly large tender in the quarter. ","Now turning to Slide 10 and the BD Life Sciences segment. Revenues increased 6.9% in the fourth quarter and 4.9% for the full fiscal year which was at the high end of our guidance range. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strong performance in Diagnostic Systems and Biosciences units. Strength in our molecular platforms with continued double-digit growth in BD MAX, as well as in our microbiology solutions for ID\/AST and blood culture drove growth in Diagnostic Systems. ","Biosciences growth was strong globally in research and clinical instruments sales, as well as research reagents. Growth in Preanalytical Systems reflects a tough comparison to the prior year when we brought on additional capacity to meet demand for our push button blood collection sets.","Now turning to Slide 11 and the BD Interventional segment. Revenues increased 7.7% in the fourth quarter, and 5.5% for the full fiscal year. BDI's fourth quarter results included a reduction of approximately 50% versus our originally budgeted DCB-related sales, which is consistent with the trend we have been seeing since the FDA letter. ","While the market is contracted, we continue to maintain stable share and our leading position. Excluding the DCB impact, BDI segment revenues would have grown in the low-double-digits in the fourth quarter. Our overall revenues in Peripheral Intervention grew solidly in the mid-single-digits as our WavelinQ, Covera and Venovo products continued to perform extremely well. Excluding the DCB impact, fourth quarter revenue growth in PI would have also been in the low-double-digits. ","Fourth quarter revenue growth in Surgery of 8.9% reflect strong performance in Biosurgery in the U.S. as Progel sales continue to ramp, ongoing strength in Infection Prevention and Biosurgery in Europe where we continue to see the benefit from our revenue synergy investments and global strength in Hemostats. ","Revenue growth in Urology and Critical Care of 9.9% continues to be driven by acute urology as well as continued strength in our Targeted Temperature Management business. ","Now moving on to Slide 12, and our geographic revenues. Developed markets revenues grew 5.7% in the fourth quarter, driven by broad-based strength in all three segments. By geography, performance was strong in both the U.S. and Europe. For the full fiscal year developed markets grew 4.5%. Emerging markets revenues grew 8.8% for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Growth in the quarter was driven by high-single-digit growth in China and the broader Asia Pacific region, and double-digit growth in EMA. ","Growth in China was lower than we anticipated in the fourth quarter as we saw pricing pressure late in the quarter in some of the more basic medical devices within our MDS portfolio. This is related to new volume-based purchasing being adopted in certain provinces in the annual tender process. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2020, we expect high-single-digit growth in China, driven by double-digit growth in the BD Life Sciences and BD Interventional segments and single-digit growth in the Medical segment. ","Turning to Slide 13, which recaps the fourth quarter income statement. As discussed, revenues was strong growing 6.2% in the quarter on a comparable basis. Moving down the P&L, gross profit grew approximately 5% year-over-year. Gross margin was a strong 57.1%. Currency headwinds abated as anticipated, and margin pressure from lower DCB sales and raw materials was more than offset by accelerated revenue growth, continuous improvement and synergy capture.","SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24%. SSG&A reflects our disciplined spending as well as continued achievement of Bard cost synergies. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 5.6%. For the full fiscal year, we invested $1 billion in R&D which reflects our continued commitment to drive innovation. Fourth quarter operating margins of 27.4% are the highest quarterly adjusted operating margins to-date, increasing 200 basis points, or 150 basis points on a currency neutral basis, reflecting the leverage in our model. ","Our tax rate was 17% in the quarter bringing our full year tax rate to 14.4%, in line with the lower end of our guidance range. As expected, we paid preferred dividends of $38 million in the quarter. As a reminder, the preferred shares will convert in May of 2020. As previously discussed, adjusted earnings per share of $3.31 grew 13% versus the prior year, and 12.3% on a currency neutral basis. ","Now, turning to Slide 14 and our gross profit and operating margins for the fourth quarter. As previously discussed, growth in operating margins was strong in the fourth quarter at 57.1% and 27.4% respectively. For the full fiscal year, we delivered gross margin and operating margins in line with our guidance ranges. Operating margins expanded 60 basis points on a currency neutral basis. Looking back over a multi-year period, we're proud to have delivered 800 basis points of currency neutral operating margin expansion over the last six years. This demonstrates our strong execution and ability to drive continuous improvement. ","Now moving on to Slide 15 and our fiscal 2019 EPS growth. Revenue growth combined with solid operating performance drove strong underlying EPS growth of 16.5% in fiscal 2019. As a result, we were able to mitigate the impact from headwinds, divestitures and FX and deliver EPS of $11.68. This is in line with our expectations and what we have been sharing with you since our earnings call in May. Since May, currency continued to pressure the P&L and we were able to offset the additional FX pressures that materialized over the back half of the year. ","Moving on to Slide 17 and our full fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance. We expect currency neutral revenue growth of 5% to 5.5% on a comparable basis. Our revenue guidance includes an estimated 40 basis points impact from pricing, primarily driven by the China MDS and the process for certain basic products, as well as an estimated 30 basis point impact from DCB sales, which are expected to be lower year-over-year until we anniversary the impact of the FDA letter towards the middle of the fiscal year. ","From a phasing perspective, we expect revenue growth in the first half of the fiscal year to be approximately 100 basis points below the full year guidance range, driven by first quarter revenue growth of 1% to 2%. ","In our MMS business, we are planning to make some improvements to our Alaris Pump software, including upgrades to alarm prioritization and optimization. We are in discussions with the FDA about the timing of implementation of these upgrades, and the possibility of bundling them with new software version release. This is expected to move the timing of some sales from Q1 to the balance of the fiscal year. Beyond MMS, the first quarter will also be impacted by pricing and DCBs. By segment, for the full year, we expect BD Medical revenues to grow between 4% and 5%. We expect BD Life Sciences revenues to grow between 6% and 7%. And we expect the BD Interventional revenues to grow between 5% and 6%. ","Similar to fiscal 2019, we expect revenue growth to be driven by recent product launches across all three segments and strength in both developed and emerging markets. We anticipate developed market growth of around 4.5% to 5% in fiscal 2020. In emerging markets, we expect high-single-digit growth driven by a diversified base with high-single-digit growth in China, as previously discussed, and strength in EMA. ","Now moving on to Slide 18 and our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance. Starting on the left side of the chart, growing off of fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS of $11.68, we expect underlying EPS growth that is breaching high teens of 15.5% to 17%. This strong operating performance will help us to mitigate the headwinds from the expiration of the Gore royalty, tariffs and FX. As a reminder, the Gore royalty expired toward the end of fiscal 2019 and increased in size from our original deal model view, resulting in a 5 percentage point headwind to growth in fiscal 2020. ","Tariffs are expected to impact growth by approximately 1 percentage point and we continue to actively work with our partners to minimize the unfavorable impact to the company. Currency is expected to be a headwind of about 2.5 percentage points in fiscal 2020. This assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.11. All-in, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $12.50 to $12.65, which represents growth of 7% to 8.5% and 9.5% to 11% on a currency neutral basis. ","From a phasing perspective, lower anticipated first quarter revenue growth, combined with the impact of negative foreign currency translation in the absence of the Gore royalty, are expected to result in first quarter EPS of $2.55 to $2.65. We continue to expect to achieve approximately $100 million in cost synergies in fiscal year 2020. We are committed to fully realizing $300 million in annualized cost synergies over the three-year deal period. ","Now turning to Slide 19, I'd like to walk through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2020. On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 4% and 4.5%. This reflects a currency headwind of approximately 100 basis points. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 56% to 57%. This is due to strong underlying performance, including cost synergy capture. ","Adjusted SSG&A is expected to be 24% to 24.5% of sales. This is an improvement of approximately 50 basis points to 100 basis points compared to fiscal 2019 and is driven by the leverage in our business model and our continued cost discipline.","We expect to invest approximately $1 billion in R&D which is in line with fiscal year 2019. This represents 5.5% to 6% of revenues, and reflects our continued commitment to invest in new products and platforms. ","As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 26% and 27% of revenues. On a currency neutral basis, we expect strong operating margin expansion of approximately 150 basis points. We expect our tax rate to be between 14% and 16%. ","For fiscal year 2020, we anticipate our adjusted average fully diluted share count to be approximately 287 million shares. For modeling purposes, I'd like to remind you that net income reflects the deduction of approximately $76 million of preferred dividends. The preferred shares will convert in May of 2020, at which time the final preferred dividend will be paid. The conversion is about neutral for fiscal 2020 EPS. ","Cash flow is expected to be strong with operating cash flow of about $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2020. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $900 million and $1 billion. ","In summary, I'm excited about the momentum we have across our business. And I'm confident that we will deliver on our commitments in fiscal year 2020 and beyond. ","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our product portfolio. ","Vince Forlenza","Thank you, Chris. Turning to Slide 21 and our planned product launches by segment. As we've been discussing with you, we have a very robust pipeline across the entire company. There are a number of things we're excited about. I'll touch on just a few recent launches here, starting with the BD Medical segment. ","Early in fiscal year 2020, we expect to launch BD InSyte Autoguard blood control pro, our latest generation of active safety PIV catheters. This catheter adds new features to the world's best selling PIV catheter, which allow a nurse to know that the cannula is in the vein potentially increasing first stick success and ease of use. ","We are also continuing to build our BD HealthSight platform with new applications as part of our connected medication management strategy. BD HealthSight Clinical Advisor represents the next generation platform and integration of MedMined\u2019s Surveillance Advisor. This application will deliver expanded access to timely patient insights for infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship. ","We also look forward to launching the BD Intevia, the 1 ml disposable auto injector, a two-step push on skin device that is designed to effectively and safely inject a variety of drugs of different viscosities and different volumes. This is BD's first device to combine syringe and auto injector technology in a true systems integration approach. ","Now, moving on to the BD Life Science segment. In fiscal year 2020, we continue to ramp the launch of our BD COR high throughput molecular system, building off of strong interest and excellent feedback from initial placements in Europe. ","The initial launch includes the BD Onclarity HPV assay for the detection and extended genotyping of HPV. The COR system performs the sample preparation and processing steps necessary to complete molecular assay workflows and decreases manual user interactions. The system is CE-IVD marked and is not yet available for sale in the U.S. or other markets with additional registration requirements. ","Over the coming years, we plan to continue seeking regulatory authorizations to sell the BD COR systems around the world, while expanding the content menu to include many additional assays for infectious diseases including enteric disease, STIs and viral load. We are also looking forward to a full access launch of the BD FACSymphony S6 high parameter cell sorter, which offers 6-way sorting, and supports the simultaneous analysis of up to 30 parameters, giving researchers the ability to better understand cell phenotypes for immunology and multi-omics research. This will be a unique high parameter sorting solution significantly raising the competitive bar. We will also extend our capabilities on our successful FACSMelody platform with new enhanced 4-way sorting capabilities, broadening the application space. ","Within the BD Interventional segment, in our Critical Care business, our new Arctic Sun Stat launch will allow us to leverage BD's informatics capabilities that will enable this platform to move from a standalone device to a solution. ","BD Targeted Temperature Management solution will be the first and only comprehensive TTM solution that is in indicated to treat all appropriate patients from adults to neonates. We're particularly proud of the new guardrail and monitoring features of the Arctic Sun Stat that wirelessly connect to the EMR at the point of care enabling advanced analytics that supports data-driven clinical decision and benchmarking. ","In our dialysis access platform, we are excited that the WavelinQ product platform, our new innovative solution that provides a minimally invasive non-surgical option for creating critical AV fistulas for patients with end stage kidney disease. We'll launch a next generation device that will continue to facilitate excellent procedural success rates with optimized ability and better connectivity. And in our oncology platform, we are looking forward to launching our Caterpillar embolization device and Elevation breast biopsy device later this year. ","Before I move on, I would like to point out that we have included slides in the appendix of today's presentation that provide an update on our sustainability initiatives and awards we were proud to have earned during fiscal year 2019. We hope you find the information useful in understanding BD's commitment to these important initiatives. ","Moving on to Slide 22, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. In the year of significant headwinds, we delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2019 in line with our planned second half acceleration. Growth was broad-based across businesses and regions, which reflect the breadth and diversity of our portfolio. The integration of BD and Bard and related costs and revenue synergy capture are on track, and we are confident in delivering on our commitments in the third year of the Bard deal model. ","And last but certainly not least, I would like to take a moment to thank the 65,000 BD associates around the world, who embody our values and come to work every day to fulfill our purpose to advance the world of health. It's been a great privilege leading a team of such talented associates over the years. ","As we move forward, I'm excited by the opportunities ahead to continue to build upon our capabilities and invest in our growth-based strategy. I would also like to thank our analysts who provide excellent coverage on the company and our shareholders for choosing to invest in BD. Your partnership and support over the years has helped BD become the company we are today and provides us with the ability to continue to do great things for our customers and their patients around the world. We look forward to sharing more with you at our upcoming Analyst Day in May as we enter the next era of value creation for BD. ","So thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. So first question is coming from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","First off, Tom, congratulations and Vince thank you for your leadership and value creation. I think Monique got it right with her bittersweet comment. But thank you both.","Vince Forlenza","Thank you very much.","David Lewis","And then just two quick questions from me and I'll ask them both here in the interest of speeding things along. One for Chris and maybe one for Tom really centering on 2020. So Chris, just first off, EPS a little below the street. We discussed the impact of FX at our conference a few months ago. I'm kind of curious on your philosophy this year, is it fair to say that the 250 basis points embeds some cushion for FX volatility across the year, given the experience this prior year? And then for Tom, 5% to 5.5% is a little tighter than normal. So how should investors interpret that range relative to the deal model of a 5% to 6%? And what are some of the key tailwinds or headwinds to consider this year? Thanks so much. Nice quarter. ","Chris Reidy","Thanks very much, David, and thanks for your nice remarks. The -- on FX, you're right that at your conference, we did talk about the volatility of FX. And we were indicating that we weren't going to chase that because we do have underlying growth of 15.5% to 17%. And we didn't want to damage lack of investments that drives revenue growth in the future. And so as a result, we wouldn't chase it. And we were seeing volatility that was getting worse. And we indicated it was about 200 basis points back in September. Since then we've actually seen a little bit of a worsening. It's come back more recently. But on a 30 day average, it certainly has gotten a bit worse with the volatility in currencies like the yuan and the pound with Brexit. So, we see a lot of volatility in those currencies. And so our estimate for the year of $250 does take into consideration there might be a little bit of movement over the course of the year. And we don't want to be chasing that within our guidance range. So we did take that into account in the guidance range that we gave. But right now as we see it, it's in that 200 basis point to 250 basis point area. And again, we're very committed to driving that 15.5% to 17% underlying and to do any more than that we think wouldn't be prudent.","Tom Polen","Hey David and thank you again also for your kind comments. Regarding our range, so certainly the deal model is very much intact. We are within that 5% to 6% range. And as we had shared in the past, of course, we're annualizing the impact of DCBs and we also have assumed no BTK approval within the year. And so we think about it as we -- the -- if DCB stay at the level that they are today, so no improvement in DCBs, and no BTK approval, we would be at the bottom half of the 5% to 6% range. And if we were to get a BTK approval, or we see a notable improvement in the DCB run rate, we could end up moving above that. But at this point, we are making the assumption that its status quo on DCBs and we have not included BTK within our guidance. Therefore, we thought it was appropriate to tighten the range to the bottom half.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","Hi, good morning. Vince, congrats on the retirement. I hope you stay in touch and can meet up at The Stone Pony for a beer, go see Bruce again. And, Tom, congrats to you. I look forward to our first Springsteen experience together so.","Vince Forlenza","Hey, Brian. Just before you go on, just send me the date. I\u2019ll be there.","Tom Polen","And I\u2019ll provide the beers. ","Brian Weinstein ","Deal. As far as Medical goes, I wanted to ask you a little bit there. Can you talk about the cadence given some of the timing things that we typically see in Medical as well as the comps that we're going to be coming up against, and also the China commentary? So it sounds like there's a lot of things to kind of consider as it relates to Medical. And then the guide in total looks to be a little bit below trend over the last couple of years, from what we've seen out of the Medical segment. So anything to be aware of, or any kind of color that you can give us by product category that would inform and kind of what you guys are thinking there? Thanks so much.","Tom Polen","Okay. Hey, Brian, this is Tom. I certainly very much look forward to continuing that tradition, even Vince had started there so. Yes, as we think about BD Medical, as we noted, FY \u201819 we saw 5.1% growth for the full year. We noted in our comments earlier. We have seen some pressure specifically within really MDS China related to pricing on some of the very basic medical devices that we sell there. And so we've reduced the guidance then to 4% to 5%. So just a slight reduction versus the actual that we saw in FY \u201819, reflecting that observation that we've made. And that's really the only thing. We continue to see very strong performance in MMS through FY \u201819 as well as Pharm Systems for the year -- in FY \u201820, sorry. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","Hey, guys. Feeling kind of left out without the Springsteen invite here.","Tom Polen","Sure, Brian would expand it.","Kristen Stewart","And maybe we can all go to a Giants game or something, I don\u2019t know.","Vince Forlenza","After last night, I don't know where they\u2019ve been.","Kristen Stewart","I know, and they\u2019re looking for you to have this season. But anyway, I was wondering if you could just kind of talk to your updated thoughts kind of on capital deployment. You're making some pretty good progress on paying down the debt and kind of getting close or making your way towards getting down to that 3 times levered number that you've kind of said rating agency. How are you just thinking about the model, as you look ahead? And Tom, how are you thinking about it? And Vince, thanks for all the years and Tom congratulations as well, as you take on over.","Chris Reidy","Great. Kristen, this is Chris. So I'll take that question. And we're going to give a lot more specificity to that very question at the Analyst Meeting in May and we look forward to that. But I would point you back to this past January, where I did give a little bit of color on that at a conference. And so as we think about coming to the 3 times leverage, and to be clear, that was the commitment we had, we would expect to float that down to the kind of the mid 2s, mid to low 2s over time, befitting a company like ours that we should be, strong balance sheet and be in the zone. So the 3 times was just a commitment to the rating agencies to do that in three years. But we would expect to float below that. ","The good news is we throw off a lot of cash. And so we often think about the $6 billion of debt that we repaid over the last couple of years or three years. But as we look at \u201821 to \u201823, between that cash as well as the additional earnings growth that we have, over that three year period we'll have about $11 billion with some basic assumptions to allocate once we've done with dividends and CapEx.","So it's a high class problem to have. And so as we think about allocating that, I think it gives us room to do a number of things. First and foremost, we will look at the M&A and tuck-in acquisition and we've talked about how we're not interested in doing another big deal, we've been very public about that. So this would be an acceleration in tuck-in acquisitions. And some of the investments we've made, particularly the Bard transaction opens up opportunities for us in those areas, as well as in Life Sciences and Medical. ","So we see lots of opportunities. And over these last couple years, we've done some very good acquisitions. But they've been limited. So we expect to expand that. And then we still believe that there will be money left over from that $11 billion to buy back shares and that'll be part of the model on a yearly basis. We're committed to not letting the cash build up on our balance sheet. ","So it's a combination of those two areas, I think. And the underlying dividend, I think the payout ratio is about right, might be some tweaking there. We will be thinking more and talking to people about that. But I think it's in the right zone. And again, we talked about our CapEx, we\u2019re in the right zone with CapEx. You see it's increasing a little bit this year from $900 million to $1 billion. I think that's about right. I don't think there's a lot of movement there. So that gives you a little bit of a sense, but more to come with some specificity in May. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","And definitely best of luck to Vince and Tom. I was just wondering if I could just get a quick commentary from you guys on two topics. One was just any update on the BTK regulatory filing, is it kind of just in the FDA\u2019s hands or is there still more back and forth? And then I was also wondering if you could just drill down a little bit more on China price pressure, like what product specifically, what percentage of total China does that represent? And how does that impact the growth guidance for China overall that\u2019s embedded in your guidance for this upcoming fiscal year? Thank you very much.","Vince Forlenza","Right. So we'll start with Simon and I will talk about BTK and then Tom will talk a little bit about China.","Simon Campion","Good morning, Bob. Simon here. So on BTK, as we commented last time, we were going to have an interactive session with the FDA. That has taken place. We're currently going through an available data set that we have on BTK. And over the next couple of months, we would expect to file that data with FDA. This is an active PMA. So we continue to work on it and continue to interact with FDA and we\u2019d expect in the next couple of months to be able to file something.","Tom Polen","Hi, Bob. This is Tom. Just a quick note, as we mentioned earlier, we do expect continued strong double-digit growth in both Life Sciences and the Interventional segment in China. And so as you indicated, the topic we see in China is specifically concentrated in Medical and even more specifically we see within the MDS business. And so let me turn it over to Alberto to answer your question in a bit more detail.","Alberto Mas","Yes, I think it's important to put this in overall context for the Chinese government and then authorities have tried a few initiatives in the past to control healthcare expenditure. Frankly with mixed results, this is their latest version of trying that. They're calling it a value-based purchasing and tendering process. This new process significantly overweighs the price component, hence the pricing pressure that we're seeing. We're seeing this playing out in MDS basic products, not necessarily in broader categories. ","So in Q4 we\u2019ve seen some selected cities and provinces introducing this new tendering system. And we're expecting continued impact in fiscal year '20 as Chris and Tom have already highlighted. So we've been prudent and we're moderating our growth in MDS, specifically in MDS basic products categories in China somewhat.","Vince Forlenza","Yes. So to be clear, it's not a national program at this point. It's actually a couple of provinces with some cities experimenting. And we'll have to see how this works. We've seen this happen in other geographies around the world. It has not played out very well for the governments because of the lack of focus on quality. So we'll see what happens here. And we'll keep you informed.","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise","And Vince, it's been just a pleasure knowing you all these years. Let me start with the new product pipeline. I mean clearly a couple of years you are spending roughly $1 billion on R&D. I'm just curious maybe, Tom, as you're reflecting on that R&D spend, what are your top priorities as you look ahead? And maybe highlight for us if you could, just as part of that, the products you'd have focus on most that have the most growth potential as we look at the fiscal year ahead?","Tom Polen","Hey, Rick, this is Tom , and thanks for the question. So as we think about R&D, obviously, you heard Vince walk through quite a wide and diverse range of the portfolio. And so as we think about specific products, I wouldn't extend those beyond the list that, that actually Vince went through in the script and as is described in our slides. So I won\u2019t iterate those again. I would just say as we think internally and our focus on the portfolio, obviously we continue to strengthen the moats in the core businesses in which we participate. And we're very focused on continuing to shift our portfolio into higher growth sectors and we look to combine really the focus in those two areas as to how we direct our investments going forward. ","Rick Wise","Just again thinking about the guidance for this next year -- I don't want to overdwell on the flu season, but obviously, this year was kind of tough comp, the year just ended. Any early thoughts on flu season assumptions? And what's in your model at this point? And would that -- if that\u2019s also potentially depending on the severity of the season, maybe potentially some upside to the numbers? ","Vince Forlenza","Sure, Rick. So the assumption is for a normal flu season, which is essentially what we had this past year in 2019. So we don't expect the same unfavorable compare we had in 2019. So that's our assumption. It's really way too early to tell as it is always this time of year. Some indication of some severity of flu season in Australia, et cetera. But that doesn't always play out here. So it's way too early to tell. ","And within the guidance range, yes, if it's a severe flu season, that would bump us up in the guidance range. And if it was significantly weaker than a normal flu season, it could take you down. And we're talking probably 30 basis points of revenue on either side of that, 20 basis points to 30 basis points at this point. And so that's kind of the way we think about it. And very similar to the way we think about it in the first quarter every year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Vince, congrats on a successful career. Wish you the best in your next phase of life. And maybe starting with the quarterly cadence here, Chris. On I guess the Q1 impact on MMS. I think you mentioned software changes. And I think your main competitor is talking about roll out of new platform. Can you maybe just talk about the competitive dynamics and whether the software rollout, whether that's just first quarter phenomena or -- usually when I hear software, I think about integration issues. So just maybe give some color on what's changing there?","Chris Reidy","Sure, Vijay. So I'm going to get started on that. We did say that we expect revenue growth to be between 1% and 2%. And one of the drivers of that is the timing of the upgrades in the Alaris Pump software, which I'll have Tom talk about in a moment. But you also have the tough compare on the DCB impact that you get the full brunt in the first quarter. And then a tough compare in Pharm Systems, which grew extremely well in the first quarter of FY '19. So you\u2019ve a little bit of that China MDS impact that we've referred to. ","We also expect Diabetes Care growth to be flat in the first quarter. And pricing is most acute in Q1. Having said that, despite the 1% to 2% growth in the first quarter, we expect the first half to be relatively close to guidance of within 100 basis points. So you kind of have the similar split between first half and second half that you had in '19, driven by a number of those factors. So for a little bit more color on the Alaris Pump upgrades, I'll turn it over to Tom. ","Tom Polen ","Hey, Vijay. So just a note, as you know Alaris is the clear leader and product choice in not only the infusion market but also as part of a broader Medication Management Solution that our customers are investing in. And it's part of our process and our strategy in the business to continually iterate and make enhancements to the platform. And so, you've seen us do that certainly on the hardware side with significant investments such as the new Alaris M2 pump launch which has been extremely well received by our customers. And we've been making those same type of investments in software upgrades over the last couple of years. And this upgrade right here is a continued reflection on those investments and will be forthcoming.","Just in terms of momentum, maybe just one other comment there on your question. We saw in FY'19 near or at I\u2019d say record levels of continued share gain, both in the infusion and the dispensing business. So about 200 basis points of gain in infusion and 100 basis points in dispensing. And we see no slowdown in that momentum. ","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful Tom and Chris one quick housekeeping on share count. From my understanding May 1 is when it steps up, the conversion kicks in. It just looks like the 287 million maybe it's a tad higher than that, what the street was expecting. Maybe some comment on share count?","Chris Reidy","Yes, so that's -- we did give that guidance in the script as the 287 million. We don't think that the conversion of the preferred dividends is going to be that meaningful. And obviously we issue some stock comp that would naturally float it up since we're not in a position to buy back shares at this point. And so you see a natural floating up of that. I think it's a combination of all those things that get to, to the 287 million. But we can certainly talk to you after the call if you have any further questions. ","Operator","Our next question comes from our line of Lawrence Keusch with Raymond James.","John Hsu","Good morning. This is John Hsu on for Larry. Tom, if we can start maybe, in the prepared comments since you mentioned the strategic and cultural transformation, can you talk about what you're seeing happening from a cultural perspective?","Tom Polen","Sure, certainly, John good question. From a cultural perspective, we've been very focused on continuing our focus on growth and innovation. And we've been talking about that quite a bit. As we've gotten larger, so quickly, we've also been very focused on agility and removing complexity from the organization and our processes. We think that -- and that fits right aligned with some of the actions that we're also building into our business strategy, as Chris mentioned, our focus on -- and plan not to do another large transformational M&A deal, fits with our focus on continuing to transform our culture from an agility perspective as we simplify and remove complexity from the organization in our next phase. And we will share more about not only those strategies, but our focus on culture and you'll see it actually more in action at the Analyst Day that Monique announced that we\u2019ll have later on in FY '20 in May.","Vince Forlenza","Yes, I would just add that Tom and I've been working on this. And I think it is a natural next step based on all the things that we've done. And as Tom and Chris and others are really looking at the next step of value creation, as Tom just mentioned, there's a lot of work going on, not just on synergies, but on business process. And that gets to both the agility that Tom was talking about, but empowerment of people with those new systems, aligning with the big efforts that we started year and a half ago around customer experience. So Tom is pulling this together in a really nice way is what I would say. And I think the company is getting very excited about it. So I'm looking forward to see how this rolls out.","John Hsu","Okay, great. And then just on the Bard synergies, those are tracking to plan. If we look back to CareFusion, you clearly were able to outperform the initial guidance there. Can you just talk about maybe the confidence that you have in the $100 million remaining synergies. And then is there any potential for upside to those numbers? ","Chris Reidy","Well, you're right, we did beat the CareFusion synergies, I think when we learned a lot when we did that and I think we assessed the Bard synergies more accurately. Having said that, we've already seen upside to what we initially announced, and that's on the tax side. So, we didn't promise any tax synergies as part of the deal. And we certainly have seen those. And that's enabled us to offset some other headwinds. ","As I look at it, we are very confident in this $100 million that I referred to, as the final phase. I don't see too much potential to raise that significantly. We will see that as we go through throughout the year. But executing that I would remind people that when we did the Bart deal, people were saying, how are you going to get any synergies at all, it was a well run company. So I think getting $300 million in the three years is quite an achievement. And then on top of that is the revenue synergies which we're seeing in the business and you're seeing in the results. So when you think about what we're driving on the Bard deal, the top-line growth of 5% to 6%, what we've seen in the last two years is that the combined company drives about 5.8% over those two years, legacy Bard driving 6.2% and legacy BD driving 5.6%. So a lot of revenue growth, some of that coming from the synergies as well. So we really feel good about what we're accomplishing right in line with our expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. ","Larry Biegelsen","And congratulations to Tom and Vince. Two questions from me, one high level for Tom and one on sterilization. So, Tom you're going to step into the CE role in January. I know it's early, but what changes can we expect under your leadership? And then secondly, on sterilization, I'll ask both my questions upfront here. I think the shutdown in Georgia is supposed to end tomorrow. Could you give us an update on where you are with the remediation, your confidence in resuming production? And just lastly, I think, in the press release you put out, you said you expect to operate at a reduced capacity. How long do you expect that process to last? ","Tom Polen","Hey, Larry, this is Tom, thank you for the comments and the questions. So as you know, Vince and I have worked together for quite some time, 15 plus years, and have been on the journey that BD has been on together. And so as we think about the next phase for the company, I would say that while we'll share more of that, of course, in upcoming forums, you can expect very much a continuation of the journey that we're on. There is a natural of course inflection as we come to the end of the Bard integration window, whereas we now realize the full cost synergies. We, of course, will be freeing up capital to create value in other ways, as you heard Chris walk through. And so we will be contemplating what is a natural inflection in our strategic cycle, refreshing that but continuing very much in line with I think what has made BD a attractive place for investors, that bellwether performance, the dynamics of the company, and building off of the new capabilities, technologies and assets that the company has built over particularly the last seven years under Vince's leadership and moving those forward into the next phase of growth.","Vince Forlenza","So let me just comment on EtO, it's November the 7th that we get back to production. Well, we're producing, we're not sterilizing. And just to make sure you understand it was voluntary, so that they could do some ambient air testing and that will get done and then we'll go back to producing. Going forward, what we're talking about is we've made some process changes to further optimize eliminating fugitive emissions. ","We think that with those changes, we can meet all customer demand going forward. And we'll just continue to optimize. So we're not sitting here saying that we're not going to be able to meet customer demand. We're very confident that we can do that. So that's the way you should think about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","Bill Quirk","Vince, great ride. And certainly thank you for everything. And Tom congratulations on the new role. So Chris, I hate to come back to China and pricing, but I just want to confirm that the guidance assumes it does continue into '20 kind of beyond what you've already experienced at the city or province level? And then secondly, congrats on the initial BD COR release in EU. When might we see that in the U.S.? Thanks guys.","Vince Forlenza","So I'll start Bill, and you're right, we do have that baked into our guidance for the year that it would continue. As you might expect, the provinces are very transparent on the kinds of pricing results that they're getting. We do expect that at some point they will experience some issues related to quality and that might change things. But right now it\u2019s very much focused, as Alberto said on pricing as a component of the tenders. So we do expect some of that to continue throughout the year and our guidance has that baked in.","Alberto Mas","Let me briefly comment on BD COR. As you know, we launched this product mid of 2019 in Europe. It's now CE marked and available in European selected markets. We will continue to extend that into CE marked regions and target towards the end of 2020, maybe beginning of '21. That depends on the regulatory process to make it available in the U.S. as well. So we are really excited about this momentum we\u2019re seeing the customer demand in Europe, and also the customer feedback we're seeing. So we work very diligently on releasing it in the other regions as soon as possible.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.","Matt Taylor","So I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the DCB dynamics. You touched on this a couple times on the call. But have you seen any change since the FDA\u2019s second memo in August in terms of any pickup, there's been some more data has come out? What do you think would have to happen to actually improve the trajectory of the existing core DCB business? That\u2019s my first question.","Simon Campion","So, good morning, Matt. It\u2019s Simon here. So yes, in relation to the second letter that FDA pushed out in August, I think it's fair to say that we certainly didn't see any initial uptake or decline in DCB utilization. But then in late September, as you may know, the independent analysis of the Lutonix data was published in JACC, I think it was September 28. And the response so far to that data has been quite favorable for us. We\u2019ve obviously trained all our sales forces on that and they've been pushing that message to our customers that Lutonix DCB is not only effective but it's also safe. So, I would say that we are quite pleased with the response the market has shown in that regard, but qualify that it's only one month ago. So it's very early, but we're quite pleased with that. And I think then to your second -- to your more -- maybe more macro question about probably what it will take to really shift this market back to where it is, I think that quite frankly is a resending of the FDA letter, that\u2019s required to get it back to where it was.","Matt Taylor","And just a clarification on the BTK comments before. You mentioned that you expect you might be able to see a filing at some point next calendar year. Would that be something that could create kind of a normal filing timeline or would it be different given the fact pattern here? Just help us under understand that. ","Simon Campion","It would be a normal filing cadence. It would be a PMA supplement. So it would be probably within the typical 180-day plus range. So that's the usual method FDA would take to assess that. ","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan. ","Robbie Marcus","It's been two years now where you've had great underlying EPS growth, but single-digit reported EPS growth. I was wondering if you could talk philosophically about your commitment to double-digit EPS growth? And are there any levers you can pull throughout the year to get you back up to double-digit? ","Chris Reidy","Sure, Robbie. So I think, when you look at the headwinds that we've had in this past year, we tend to forget that there was 600 basis points of pressure from FX. And to jump over 600 basis points would be not prudent in terms of running a long-term business. Now, we always do try to jump over some portion of the FX and we\u2019ve had a good track record of being able to do that. And so, we -- when we look at the guidance going forward, we would expect to have 100 basis points. But at some point, you would expect that those headwinds from FX to not be 600 basis points or not to be 250 basis points even. So, as we think about it, we'll jump over some of it as we did in the fourth quarter and the second half of the year. As bad as it was, it was worse than we had anticipated. It kept getting worse. The volatility of the yuan, the euro weakness and the dollar strength and then the volatility of the pound, all of those things were driving the strength of the dollar. ","And so we jumped over that in the second half of this year. And we don't talk too much about that. As we look at the guidance for this year, we have another big issue to deal with and that's a drop off of the Gore royalty, and that's 500 basis points. And so, if you take that and the 250 basis points, we\u2019re jumping over -- we're dealing with 750 basis points of pressure that is not part of the underlying business. And I would say our ability to offset that Gore royalty was better than it would have been on a standalone Bard basis. It would have been very difficult to offset any of that. And we were able to offset a very good portion of that. ","So we feel good about the ability to jump over headwinds. There have been more than our share of headwinds in the past. We don't see that once we get through the Gore royalty. We don't see a lot of that going forward. It goes kind of back to normal. And we do have a business that is on an underlying basis, very reliable, very predictable. Tom talked about the nature of our business as having the kind of moats around our business, strong product lines, and an excellence in manufacturing. ","And then we also will have the ability to buy back some shares in the future as we pay down the debt. And we've been dealing with those headwinds without the ability to do that over the last couple of years. And so we have that lever back in our arsenal as we go forward. And that will be very helpful as well. So we're, I believe, coming to a point where some of this will be behind us and we go back to being the predictable BD that we've always been. So, thanks for your questions. ","Robbie Marcus","Understood. And then a quick follow-up. I'm going to sneak two very quick ones in here. One was there any extra selling day in the quarter and two the Urology business continues to exceed expectations. Can you just talk about the drivers and sustainability there? Thanks.","Vince Forlenza","On the first, we don't make a habit of talking about days, some companies do. It all evens out. So nothing to speak of there. And on Urology, that's a great point. We very rarely talk about things like 9.9% growth in the quarter and so I'll pass that over to Simon.","Simon Campion ","Yes. So again, Urology has been a sustainable performer. This year we've seen sequential growth in a number of our businesses, particularly TTM and the acute Urology business. So it continues to inspire us with confidence. We've got a cadence of new product launches that will come out across the entire Urology business in the next year. So that's just another leg on the legacy BDI stool. So we're very pleased with it.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.","Jaime Morgan","Hi, this is Jaime on for Rich. Thanks for taking my questions. Just had one quick question since most of them have already been asked. What is your strategy on the Diabetes business going forward? I know last call you had mentioned you were evaluating your strategic options for the T2 Patch Pumps. So I was just looking to see if you could provide an update for us there. Thanks.","Tom Polen","Hi, Jamie. This is Tom. Thanks for the question. We are continuing to advance the patch pump in our pipeline. We did, as we had mentioned on a prior call withdraw our FDA application after getting feedback from them. That was a bit more comprehensive than what we had anticipated. And so as we also shared on the last call, we are now progressing that primarily with a third party R&D partner with deep expertise in that space, but we are progressing that forward. As that continues to advance in our pipeline, we'll share an update on that as it ends up approaching closer to launch. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for closing remarks.","Vince Forlenza","Thank you very much. Let me start with saying we had strong performance to close our Fiscal Year 2019. It was broad based. It was all three legs of our stool. All three segments performed really, really well with great momentum going into this year. Entering fiscal 2020 in the final year of the Bard deal, we're confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitments. And I think you'll hear more about in May, Tom's vision and the company's vision in terms of how we continue to drive shareholder value. I'm looking forward to that. And then finally, I'd like to say once again thank you to all of you, the investors, the analysts who have been with us on this exciting journey and I'm confident that the company is positioned well for continued success. So thank you very much and greatly appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"3371":["Becton, Dickinson & Co. (NYSE:BDX) Q4 2015 Earnings Call November  4, 2015  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Monique N.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through November 11, 2015, on the Investors page of the BD.com website or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic calls, and 404-537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 51724857. I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question and answer segment. Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique N. Dolecki - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Christy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at BD.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our fourth fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the BD.com website.","As a reminder, our fourth fiscal quarter results reflect the new BD, which includes the results of CareFusion for the full quarter. To provide additional visibility into the new BD, we will speak to our revenue results this morning on a comparable currency neutral base, which includes BD and CareFusion in the current and prior-year periods. The comparable basis presents current-period revenues on an adjusted basis that excludes a small impact related to a purchase accounting adjustment to record CareFusion's deferred revenues at fair value as of the acquisition date. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments, and the comparable basis revenue results, can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","In addition, we would like to note a change in a distribution agreement effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. Fisher & Paykel terminated its agreement with CareFusion for the sale of F&P's hospital respiratory care products, which has an unfavorable impact to revenues of approximately $12 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and approximately $90 million in fiscal year 2016. The fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance provided today will exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Administration; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical Segment; and Linda Tharby, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences Segment. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As we stated in our press release, we are very pleased with our results this quarter and our great finish to the year. Many of you already know that this was a unique year for BD in which we successfully completed the largest acquisition in the company's 118-year history. The powerful combination of BD and CareFusion has already delivered measurable results, which we will speak to throughout this presentation. As we continue to make progress with the integration of these two great companies, I've become increasingly confident in our ability to deliver end-to-end solutions that increase efficiencies, reduce medication errors, and improve patient safety in all healthcare settings.","Turning to slide 4, I'd like to highlight some key achievements in fiscal year 2015. First, our results reflect our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio, with revenues growing at 5.3% this year. Our core remains strong, and our product pipeline continues to drive growth across the portfolio.","Second, we moved into two highly strategic areas. Through the acquisition of CareFusion, we significantly expanded our presence and are now the global leader in a $20 billion medication management industry. We also entered into the high-growth area of genomics through our strategic acquisitions of Cellular Research and GenCell. We believe that BD is well-positioned to add long-term value in these spaces by providing researchers and clinicians with leading technologies that are scalable, high-quality, efficient, and cost-effective.","Third, we have continued to invest in higher-growth emerging markets. Emerging markets grew over 9% this year and continued to be a key driver of growth for the company. We're also working to create new growth opportunities for CareFusion products in these markets and expanding their global reach by leveraging BD's international infrastructure. We currently have numerous products in the registration process across multiple geographies.","Fourth, we have continued to refine our operating effectiveness and efficiency initiatives, which have generated accelerated margin expansion. Together with CareFusion, we drove approximately 100 basis points of underlying margin expansion year over year, which includes approximately $50 million in cost synergies, demonstrating our ability to deliver on our synergy capture commitments. Our synergy cost savings have largely been driven by G&A, and we have already made good progress with our optimization of our manufacturing footprint, with six plant closures this fiscal year. Over the deal horizon, we have detailed plans to continue our plant network optimization and drive increased automation across the network.","Lastly, we completed our 43rd consecutive year of dividend increases, in addition to paying off the $1 billion term loan used to partially fund the acquisition, which highlights our effective deployment of capital. As we look back, we closed our first combined year with broad business strength. We exceeded our financial and operating goals, and we are successfully executing on our acquisition of CareFusion. As we look forward, we will continue to build on our strong foundation, and our acquisition of CareFusion helps us significantly accelerate our ability to deliver effective healthcare solutions for customers around the world.","Moving to slide 5, you'll see the guidance for fiscal year 2016 on a currency-neutral basis. For fiscal year 2016, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth of 4.5% to 5%, based on our current view of the environment and various macroeconomic factors. Of course, we have contemplated a number of items that could bring us above or below that range, including pricing, a stronger or weaker flu season than expected, the performance of new product launches, and emerging market growth.","On the bottom line, we will continue to drive accretive, high-quality earnings growth. For fiscal year 2016, we expect adjusted EPS of $8.73 to $8.80, currency-neutral. On a reported basis, we expect adjusted EPS of $8.37 to $8.44, while overcoming significant FX headwinds. This reflects operational accretion from the CareFusion acquisition of about 22%, an increase from our previously stated deal accretion target of high teens. In addition, we are pleased to announce that we've increased our cost synergy target from $250 million to $325 million to $350 million as we exit fiscal year 2018.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris, who will walk you through our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year, along with additional details about our fiscal year 2016 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by discussing our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results, as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and total year.","Total fourth quarter revenues of approximately $3.1 billion grew 49.1%, or 5.1% on a comparable basis. Fully diluted adjusted earnings per share came in ahead of our expectations at $1.94, growing at 21.8% over the prior year. Top and bottom line growth was driven by broad-based overperformance versus our prior expectations from both the BD and CareFusion legacy businesses.","As Vince mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our strong finish to the year as a combined entity. For the total year, revenues grew 5.3%. We significantly expanded our margins and captured approximately $50 million in synergy cost savings. EPS of $7.16 exceeded our expectations, driven by stronger revenues and margin expansion. We were also pleased to announce that we have continued to deleverage as we reduce the debt associated with the acquisition of CareFusion. We have successfully paid off the $1 billion term loan facility and remain on track to achieve our commitment of 3 times gross debt leverage within 24 months of close.","On slide 8 I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenue growth was 5.1% for the total company. In the quarter, pricing was about flat on a legacy BD basis. BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased 5.2%. Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 5%, which reflects strength in Flush, ChloraPrep, and safety-engineered products.","Revenues in Medication Management Solutions, or MMS, grew 11.1%. This was driven by strong infusion capital installations, which can vary quarter to quarter, and disposables. On the dispensing side, we continue to gain traction with the Pyxis ES platform, as we place focus on the continuous improvement of the installation process.","Respiratory Solutions revenues declined 12.4%, as expected. This reflects timing of orders that occurred in the third quarter, which negatively impacted the fourth quarter, the loss of the F&P distribution agreement, and the AVEA ship hold. After adjusting for these items, revenues would have been about flat. The AVEA ship hold has been released and we began shipping again last month.","Growth in Diabetes Care was 5.8%, driven by solid growth in pen needles. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 9% reflects favorable timing of ordering patterns as expected, in conjunction with strong safety sales. For the total year, BD Medical grew 5.5%.","BD Life Sciences fourth quarter revenues increased 4.8%, primarily driven by growth in Diagnostic Systems and Preanalytical Systems. Diagnostic Systems growth of 5.9% reflects solid core microbiology growth driven by increased installations of our Kiestra Lab Automation system and continued core blood culture strength. We saw continued strength on the BD MAX platform, which grew double digits in the quarter. Preanalytical Systems growth of 5.8% was driven by safety-engineered products and growth in emerging markets and Western Europe.","BD Biosciences growth of 2.2% reflects strong research instrument placements and reagent sales in the U.S., partially offset by delays in government funding in Japan and some operational management changes in Japan. For the total year, Life Sciences grew 5%.","Moving to slide 9, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. growth was strong at 4.6%. This was comprised of BD Medical growing at 5.1% and BD Life Sciences growing at 3.3%. BD Medical's performance reflects broad portfolio strength, including Flush, ChloraPrep, and Infusion Systems. BD Life Sciences growth reflects strong performance in the U.S. Biosciences business driven by research instrument and reagent sales. In our U.S. Diagnostics business, we saw continued growth in our BD MAX molecular platform, as well as seasonal distributor stocking related to the flu offset by continued declines in our ProbeTec\/Viper platforms.","Moving on to International, revenues grew 5.5%. This is below our normal growth rate, which primarily reflects the aforementioned challenges in our Respiratory business and a moderation of growth in China in the fourth quarter. I'll provide more color on China in just a moment.","The Medical segment grew 5.4%, driven by strong performance in Pharmaceutical Systems and safety-engineered products. The Life Sciences segment grew 5.8%, which reflects strong growth in Diagnostic Systems, driven by solid performance in microbiology, including Kiestra installations. Preanalytical Systems was driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets and strength in safety-engineered devices in Europe.","On slide 10, emerging market revenues grew 5.9% currency-neutral, bringing our year-to-date growth to 9.2%. The fourth quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects a tough comparison to the prior year coupled with some moderation in China and Brazil. China growth for the fourth quarter was 8.5%, bringing the total year growth to 15.4%. This was primarily due to longer purchasing cycles and softness in instrumentation sales, consistent with what we shared on our last earnings call. In addition, we took proactive steps to align inventories in our distribution channel. On an underlying basis, China grew about 12% in the quarter. In Brazil, the challenges are largely macroeconomic, which we expect to continue into fiscal year 2016. Despite softness in Brazil, the rest of Latin America was strong, growing double-digits.","Looking into fiscal year 2016, we expect emerging markets to grow at about 10% driven by a diversified base, with China growing in the low to mid-teens, continued strength in Latin America outside of Brazil, fewer headwinds in EMA and strength in India. With CareFusion revenues predominantly in developed markets, emerging markets will be a lower percentage of total company revenues on a combined basis at about 16%, with China accounting for about 5% of total revenues.","Moving to global safety on slide 11, currency-neutral sales increased 8.2% and grew to $744 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 4.4%, while international sales grew 13.4% currency neutral, with continued strength in Europe, which grew double-digits, as compliance with safety legislation continues. Safety revenues grew 10% in emerging markets. Medical safety sales grew 9%, driven by a range of safety-engineered products, including infusion disposables, catheters and a range of products in Pharmaceutical Systems. Life Sciences safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 6.8% in the quarter.","Turning to slide 12 and our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter. On a performance basis, margin expansion was driven by continuous improvement initiatives and favorable raw material prices. These contributions were slightly offset by higher pension expenses and other items. Currency had a positive impact on gross profit in the quarter. This was driven by a translation adjustments recognized in the quarter due to the timing of inventory movements, otherwise known as profit and inventory. In addition, our gross profit margin reflects the impact of a reclass from SSG&A to cost of goods sold associated with the alignment of accounting policies in connection with the acquisition integration.","Slide 13 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. Since we have already discussed revenue and gross profit, I'll move down the income statement to SSG&A. SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.4%. We're very pleased with the leverage we're getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture, as previously discussed. R&D as a percentage of revenue was 6.4%, which is slightly higher than normal due to the timing of spend, as anticipated, while full-year R&D as a percentage of revenue was 6.1%.","Operating income grew 52.3% in the quarter on revenue growth of 49.1%, reflecting strong P&L leverage as the new BD. Our tax rate increased by 160 basis points, as expected, due to the inclusion of CareFusion's U.S.-based results. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $1.94, which is a 21.8% increase versus the prior year. This reflects operating profit growth driven primarily by strong revenues and continued margin expansion.","Now turning to slide 15, I'd like to walk through our expected revenue guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. In summary, we expect revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. This is comprised of legacy CareFusion growing at about 4% and legacy BD growing at about 5% on the top line. This is very consistent with our long-term growth profile of BD growing midsingle digits and our objective of accelerating CareFusion's top line growth profile to reach BD's average over time.","From a phasing perspective, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth in the first quarter to be well below this range. This is primarily due to a tough comparison to the prior year period, in which legacy CareFusion grew 9.9% and legacy BD grew 5.3%. This will result in currency-neutral revenue growth of about 1% to 2% in the first fiscal quarter. After adjusting for the tough comparison, as well as the loss of F&P, growth would be roughly in line with revenue guidance for the total year.","On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 23% and 23.5%, reflecting a currency headwind of about 150 basis points. This assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.13. The depreciation of Brazilian real year over year, as well as other currencies, such as the euro and the Canadian dollar, results in a significant impact to our performance. We expect this unfavorable impact to be the most acute in the first quarter, with a headwind of approximately 450 basis points. We expect the currency impact to moderate through the rest of the year.","We expect growth in both BD Medical and BD Life Sciences of 4.5% to 5%, driven by continued growth in the core in conjunction with new products in both segments. BD Medical growth will be driven by dispensing, pen needles, and infusion infection prevention relatable disposables. Life Sciences anticipates continued growth in biosciences instruments and reagents, microbiology, including expansion of the KIESTRA platform, as well as growth in molecular driven by BD MAX. Both segments expect continued growth of safety-engineered devices and solid growth in both developed and emerging markets. Based on our current view of the environment, we expect pricing to be flat to slightly negative for the year.","Moving on to slide 16, there are a number of moving parts that impact earnings per share in fiscal year 2016. For modeling purposes and to ensure consistency, I'd like to provide more color on EPS guidance. First, we are very pleased with the strong performance from legacy BD, growing 9% to 10% on an underlying basis. In addition, we now expect to deliver a significantly lower tax rate, which results in 3 percentage points of improvement to the bottom line. We're particularly pleased with our execution on operational synergies and expect to outperform our high teens target by driving accretion of 22%.","As Vince mentioned earlier, we have also increased our cost synergy target to a range of $325 million to $350 million over the deal horizon. As a result, we expect to achieve very strong earnings of $8.73 to $8.80. This enables to us overcome an unfavorable impact from pension expense and a significant headwind from foreign exchange. We expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $8.37 to $8.44 for fiscal year 2016.","Turning to slide 17, I'd like to walk through additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. But first I'd like to make some comments on the phasing of earnings. Similar to revenue, the impact of unfavorable currency will be most acute in the first quarter, and we expect EPS to be between $1.80 and $1.85. This reflects a currency headwind of approximately 1,500 basis points and a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.13 versus $1.26 when compared with the prior-year period. In addition, the Brazilian real has declined 55%, and the Canadian dollar has declined 15%.","Moving on to the total year guidance, we have provided comparable fiscal year 2015 results, which include BD and CareFusion for the full year. We expect gross profit margin to be between 52% and 52.5%. Performance improvements are partially offset by negative currency translation and pension. SSG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 24.5% and 25%. Our guidance also reflects continued investments in emerging markets, as well as costs related to new product launches and registration cost. We expect our R&D investment to be in line with fiscal year 2015, at about 6% of revenues, as we continue to invest in new products and platforms.","As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 21% and 22% of revenues. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve by 130 to 150 basis points. This also excludes slight pension headwinds. We expect our tax rate to be between 21.5% and 22.5%. For fiscal year 2016, we anticipate our average fully diluted share count to be approximately 217 million. Cash flow is expected to remain strong, with operating cash flow of about $2.6 billion in fiscal year 2016. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $650 million to $700 million.","In summary, we have strong momentum exiting fiscal year 2015. And looking forward into 2016, we are building off of a very solid foundation. Our core remains strong, and we've moved into new adjacencies. We're outperforming on our synergy and accretion targets, as well as delivering earlier tax efficiencies. As we continue to execute and deliver on the factors that are under our control, I'm confident that fiscal year 2016 will be another year of strong performance, positioning us well for continued success.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Chris. Moving on to slide 19, we have been discussing our pipeline for some time now, and in fiscal year 2015, there were a number of product launches. I'll not review them in detail, but they are highlighted on slide 19. We're committed to the successful ramp up of these products while we also look to the future and continue to expand our portfolio.","Moving on to slide 20, we have some new product launches that we would like to share with you. In BD Medical, we continue to make progress with our insulin infusion sets, with an expected product launch in the middle of the fiscal year 2016. This product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery by significantly reducing silent occlusions, simplify the user's experience, and increase a patient's overall satisfaction with insulin pumping.","Also launching in 2016 is the new Pyxis Mini tabletop medication management platform. This is a unique system that supports customer needs in non-acute care settings, such as ambulatory care centers, long-term care, and surgery centers. Leveraging the Pyxis ES platform, the Pyxis Mini extends the value of the ES server and the hospital's IT infrastructure by providing safe and secure medication management. We look forward to sharing further details on the newly combined Medical Segment with new product portfolio launches later in fiscal year 2016.","While there has been a strong focus on the Medical Segment due to the CareFusion acquisition, I'd like to note that our Life Sciences Segment remains an important growth driver for BD. It was an exciting year for BD Biosciences, which includes our new genomics business. In fourth quarter we acquired Cellular Research and launched the BD FACSseq, a high-throughput cell sorter which targets solving significant unmet needs in single cell analysis. The combination of Cellular Research's molecular indexing technology paired with cell sorting allows researchers to choose which cells to study and enables the correlation of cell surface markers with genetic data. The combination is intended to enable a more simplified workflow, time reduction to isolate cells, and all of this with higher accuracy.","Also in the fourth quarter we launched the new X-50 research flow cytometer. The X-50 represents a significant advancement in technology, enabling simultaneous measurement of up to 50 unique characteristics at the single cell level. The X-50 single cell analyzer enables superior resolution of rare cell populations, providing richer scientific insights to advance the understanding of human disease and intervention strategies. In fiscal year 2016, we expect to launch our GenCell library preparation system. This platform will consolidate and automate NGS library preparation workflow at a reduced total cost position.","In our Diagnostic Systems business, we anticipate launching four new assays in the next year, including CT\/GC and vaginitis, as we continue to drive menu expansion on the BD MAX platform. We're also on track with our launch of the next-generation Veritor point-of-care instrument, which incorporates smart features to enable connectivity.","In our Preanalytical Systems business, we anticipate launching two new products during 2016. The UltraTouch push-button blood collection sets will deliver significant improvements in patient outcomes for patients with challenging venous access. The BD Barricor tubes are an innovative technology which will enhance sample quality as well as lab turnaround time. As you can see, we continue to have strong opportunities in our pipeline, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you as we make progress throughout the year.","On slide 21, before we conclude and open the call to questions, I would like to take a moment to discuss a leadership change within the organization. BD announced this morning that, after 41 years of outstanding service to BD, Bill Kozy, EVP and Chief Operating Officer, has decided to retire effective April 1, 2016. Bill has had an exemplary career at BD, and his accomplishments are too numerous to mention them all. As we all know, he has spent the past year leading the successful integration of CareFusion and BD. While we believe this process is well under way, and Bill will stay on until March to ensure a successful transition of these duties to Chris Reidy, who will lead the current integration team. I would like to make a special mention of Bill's relentless commitment to operational excellence to our customers and to our associates. They are highly valued and have made a tremendous difference for all of us and for the company. We would like to express our sincere gratitude and also congratulate him on reaching this milestone.","Now, I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a pivotal year for BD in history, and we are pleased with our strong results. We've exceeded our financial and operational goals for this year, and our increased synergy and accretion targets are evidence that we are successfully executing on our acquisition of CareFusion.","Second, our core remains strong. Our investments drive robust revenue growth of 5.3%, and we continue to deliver high-quality double digit earnings growth. We expect to deliver a similar growth profile in fiscal year 2016, with top line growth of 4.5% to 5% and earnings accretion of about 22%. We are pleased with our financial performance, and we continue to deliver and believe we have built a strong foundation for future growth.","Third, we expanded into new areas of medication management and entered the genomic market. We're excited about the value that CareFusion brings to BD and our customers as we execute our medication management strategy. We're also very pleased with the progress we've made in Life Sciences with our acquisition of GenCell and Cellular Research, which underscore BD's commitment to drive value through our genomic strategy.","Finally, I would like to say thank you to all of our associates around the world. It's a testament to the hard work of the BD and CareFusion employees that we are here today, with what I believe is a tremendous opportunity to create a true industry leader. As we embark on this next phase of growth, I look to the future with enthusiasm and confidence.","Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. And good morning, everybody. Hopefully I can just sneak two in here along the same lines. Vince, maybe you could just start with the pipeline. The list of products that you're laying out for FY 2016 is probably one of the deeper pipeline benches that you've presented in some time. Can you maybe help you think about the contribution from that pipeline and how that squares with the growth rates that you're presenting here in your guidance? Because it would seem like, given that breadth of product launches, we would see an acceleration in the base business. So can you maybe help us think about some of the gives and takes with respect to product launches versus the performance of the base business?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, David, we feel really good about the guidance that we have given on revenue, the 4.5% to 5%. And you are right. There is a strong breadth of products across the entire portfolio. I think the one business you might have noticed in the guidance that we hadn't talked about before was PAS, with the new launches of the Barricor tube in there and the new push-button product. But I think what you haven't taken into account is it's just going to take a while to ramp up those new products as we get the automated manufacturing in place. So not as much of an impact that would take us above the range.","Now, if they go faster, as I said in my remarks, okay, there's some potential upside. And I'm not just talking about the PAS products, but the Pyxis Mini and others, the infusion sets, which is in a similar situation. So I think across the board we're feeling good. We're feeling good about the base business as well. There's little puts and takes, as I mentioned, from a geographic standpoint, but we're still going to get about 10% in terms of emerging markets.","So when we put all of that together, we're saying, look, developed world up a little bit, emerging markets still a strong growth driver. And when you put it all back together, it gets you to the 4.5% to 5%.","So anyway, that was your first question?","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, then the second was just on emerging markets. In your prepared remarks, you talked about product registrations on the CareFusion side. Can you maybe just walk us through the steps and timeline associated with product registration to commercialization and then financial impact, just to maybe frame up how we should think about the progression of that opportunity on a go-forward basis?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. Tom Polen will do that for you.","Thomas Polen - President, BD Preanalytical Systems","Hey, David. This is Tom. So, as we've discussed in the past, we are pursuing a number of opportunities for revenue synergies in the combined portfolio. We have begun investment work on those registrations and actually submitted several dozen registrations in FY 2015. Of course, that process does take some time. And as I've said in the past, we expect it to take about two years to start seeing the benefits of those pull through in sales. So more of an FY 2017 effect than a 2016, and that's right in line with what we've said since the deal announcement.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and we really haven't changed our view on the revenue synergies from the start of all of this. The geographies may have moved around a little bit, but in total, it's looking like the same opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Chris, just one quick question on first quarter guidance and then I had another question for you on tax rate and synergy, if I could. So just on first quarter guidance, just reviewing, the 1% to 2% constant currency. I'm assuming that just reflects CareFusion numbers year on year, which were, I don't know, 11% in dispensing and 8% in Procedural Solutions, so an unexpected CareFusion quarter. Is there anything else going on in the first quarter we should be aware of besides that harder comp?","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Yep, you got that piece right in terms of infusion. So, as we pointed to, the overall CareFusion was 9.9%. If you remember, that was a quarter that was their closing quarter, so that comes into play. You also got the F&P contract loss that we talked about. And then on the legacy BD side, we have the normal pharmaceutical sales, timing of orders, and so that tends to be weaker in the first quarter. And then last year you had Diagnostic Systems with a strong flu season. We're just calling a normal flu season this year. So that could vary, but you put all of those things together and it makes for a tough comp in the first quarter.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then maybe two questions about the long-term outlook. One on tax. You signaled the tax rate continuing to move down maybe to the upper teens over time, but the 2016 guidance is coming in stronger than we expected. So do you have greater tax opportunities before 2018 than you thought and can we get down to upper teens maybe quicker than we thought?","And then on synergies, just help me understand with the 30% raise, what are the principal drivers, and what's the pacing of synergies across these three years, and any update on revenue synergies? Thank you.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Okay. That's about four questions, David, but they're all good ones. So on the tax, I think we've said from the beginning that we do expect to get tax synergies, but we thought that when you put two big companies like ours together, it'll take a while to get those structures in place and see through that. We've done a lot of that work and we do see those synergies coming sooner than expected and so you're seeing that in 2016.","We do say that ultimately we want to be at the high teens, which is where we've been driving for a number of years. But I wouldn't say past 2016, 2016's in that 21.5% to 22.5% range. After that, I wouldn't ramp it much more than 50 basis points a year after that. We'll provide more insight into that going forward, obviously. But that wouldn't get you down to the high teens by 2018. So I wouldn't say it's an acceleration of the ramp to the high teens, but we are getting it earlier than we had originally anticipated and it's showing up in 2016.","In terms of the synergies, what's driving the increase from $250 million to $325 million and $350 million is, as we've been saying all along, we needed to see some traction. Initially, you get out-of-the-box synergies early on, so a reduction of public company costs. And we had good visibility to that. What we needed to see is visibility to the next wave, which is things like IT synergies, putting the combination of the two companies together and getting system synergies and system synergies throughout all of the functions. And so we've now seen some of that traction. We've also even seen some traction in the manufacturing area. As we mentioned in the remarks, we've had six plant closures. So we've started to see some visibility and traction along those lines and that's what gives us the confidence to raise it to the $325 million to $350 million.","Now, in terms of the timing that you talked about, we mentioned that we had about $50 million in the first six months. We see that turning into about $100 million for next year on a full-year basis. Then you get about an extra $40 million incremental and that turns into a full-year impact the following year of $80 million. We see the about $40 million incremental kind of ratably over the next couple years, and if you roll it out that way, you get to the $325 million to $350 million.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks a lot, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, this is actually Robbie Marcus in for Mike. I was wondering if you could talk a little more about your 10% growth target for emerging markets and how you see that rebounding off fourth quarter, particularly in China and Latin America. And then also, if you don't mind touching on hospital budgets for 2016, given how poorly some of the facility reports have been lately, and what you're considering in your guidance for budgets next year. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think you're talking about the U.S. from a hospital budgeting standpoint, and we're assuming pretty much status quo in terms of the U.S. marketplace. Not a lot of improvement, but continued, consistent demand. And we feel good about where we are from a capital standpoint and the backlog that we have. So I think we're in good shape there.","In terms of emerging markets, as we mentioned in the quarter, in China we did some proactive work with the distributor community. Remember, we don't give credit to the distributors. So we want to make sure we had the right amount of inventory, and so we've completed that work. So underlying growth I think was closer to 11% in the quarter for China.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Actually 12%.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","12% Excuse me, 12%. And so we see China continuing to grow in the low teens. And of course it's become quite large at this point in time. It's about 5% of BD's sales. We expect India to do well, and we saw good performance this year in India. If you look at Latin America, Latin America did well, with the exception of Brazil, and we continue to expect weakness in Brazil this year, but the rest of Latin America has grown quite nicely, and so we're getting good growth out of that. We think EMA is going to be okay as we move forward. And we're projecting Russia to be soft. And when you add all of that up, you get to our guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could I guess talk to the longer-term outlook. I know when you originally did the CareFusion deal, you had talked about CareFusion being about a 3%, maybe 4% growth company. Sounds like it's coming in a little bit better with the cost synergies, talking about like bottom line growth being more around that 10%. It sounds like things are going better on the cost synergies. Certainly the legacy BD business is doing much better. How should we just think about sustaining the growth? Would you let the higher cost synergies kind of flow through? Would you think about reinvesting those? Or just looking to do more acquisitions to kind of further fuel the top line growth?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me start on the top line. And if I go back to the beginning, what we said was that CareFusion was about a 3.5% grower. BD was growing at about 5%, and our long-term goal was to get CareFusion up to about the 5%. And that would come through both the geographic expansion and new product opportunity as we synergized with CareFusion across the medication management process. And that is still the strategy. And you're right, the base business in both CareFusion and BD is performing well. And we had a strong quarter. It was about 4% underlying, I think Tom was trying to tell me.","Thomas Polen - President, BD Preanalytical Systems","Correct. And we expect CareFusion, like you said, historically, about 3.5%. We expect them to be about 4% in 2016.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right, this year. Yes. 4% this year. Long term, we'd like to get them to 5% is what we said.","Thomas Polen - President, BD Preanalytical Systems","Right.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That is still our goal, and we still have work to do to get there. But we are pleased at where we are at. Now, in terms of letting this all \u2013 how we think about this, Chris has laid out what the financial characteristics are going to be for the next couple years. What Chris has said in the long term was 5% and 10%. And we haven't come off that. Chris may want to add some color to that, but that implies that we will be investing for the future and also returning value to the shareholders. So, Chris, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Right, so the only other thing I would add is, as you think about 2017 and 2018, you have that base model of 5% on the top and 10% on the bottom, but then you do get some incremental pickup from the synergies. And as I answered earlier, we see that incremental amount per year to be about $40 million, then annualizing it for the following year. And so if you run that math, you pick up a couple of percentage points on the bottom, on top of that 10%. So that's the way to think about it.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So you'd be inclined to let that fall through to the bottom line for shareholders and then kind of think about it growing more traditionally 5% to 10%, 5% and 10% thereafter?","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Yeah, I think once you get out and you're past the synergies, you kind of go back to that base model.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Past 2018.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Yeah, past 2018.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, perfect. And then just on BD Simplist, are we getting to the point where that's sort of breakeven, or is that still dilutive overall to the P&L?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","BD Simplist is still dilutive at this point in time. It did grow. It's still not all that big. We still haven't gotten the approvals on the two drugs that we have been talking about for some time. Tom, is there any update on those two drugs in the pipeline?","Thomas Polen - President, BD Preanalytical Systems","Hi, Kristen, this is Tom.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Tom.","Thomas Polen - President, BD Preanalytical Systems","I think as we've shared in the past, we've been realigning our portfolio. We are on track for the next two launches in the high-alert drugs; hydromorphone and heparin we do expect to launch in FY 2016. And so as we add those to morphine, which is our current high-risk drug that's doing very well in the marketplace, we expect those sales to continue to accelerate, so.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Kristen, thanks for the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a question for you on genomics in general. Can you kind of just talk about what the longer-term plan is here? Are you looking to add additional assets? Or are you looking to add things in things like bioinformatics or kind go deeper in next-gen sequencing? Just talk about what the overall strategy looks like in genomics at this point. Thanks.","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President and President - Life Sciences Segment","Hi, Brian, this is Linda. So, over the long term, we're focused on building a leading genomics position in next-generation sequencing, from sample preparation to sample collection to sequencer ready. So it'll be platforms that are ubiquitous and can be used with any next-generation sequencer. So today those platforms involve our PAXgene sample collection and stabilization products. They involve our library preparation platforms from GenCell, and of course now the combination of our BD flow cytometry with Cellular Research's molecular indexing technology. So all of these in combination, again, we think we will have technologies that allow researchers and clinicians as we move to the clinic, more scalable, high-quality, efficient, and cost-effective. So you'll see us continue to build franchises in that whole upfront sample collection process.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Brian, certainly we will continue to look for assets in the space. We're very excited about the Cellular Research deal that we just concluded, because we think it is such a great fit with the flow cytometry business, and really does give researchers a new process and a better way of understanding cells. I mentioned in my remarks, you can look at the cell surface markers and you can look at the DNA. And this is where we're really enabling that for the first time. So it's pretty exciting. So Linda will continue to build that business.","Thanks for your question, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","A couple questions. First off, Chris, the reclass from SSG&A to cost of goods. Should we think about that as a recurring charge, or is this more one-time in nature? And then, secondly, I guess, kind of question on the pricing assumption, the flat to slightly negative for the coming year. I guess could you give us a little more color into some of the underlying assumptions there, given that it generally kind of outperformed on an incremental basis this year? Thanks.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Sure. So, the accounting adjustment. There's nothing unusual; when you put two companies together, you do see sometimes a difference in the way certain expenses are accounted for. So the adjustment kind of brought costs from SSG&A, mostly related to things like quality and up into cost of goods sold. So it doesn't affect the bottom line, it's just within the P&L itself. When you look at our chart 17 and we talk about the guidance, we've kind of done the comparable basis for you. So there's two things going on when we adjust for comparable basis. One is these accounting adjustments. The other is the fact that CareFusion had a half a year before us. So their percentages were different. So we wanted to put it on an apples-to-apples basis, and chart 17 does that. So if you look at, for example, SSG&A or gross profit on chart 17, what we're showing in 2015 actual on a comparable basis is equivalent on an apples-to-apples basis with our 2016 guidance.","I forgot what your second question was.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Second question was -","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Oh, pricing. Pricing, I'm sorry.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's all right.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","So pricing, the way to think about that is over the last couple of years, essentially pricing has been relatively flat. Last year it was down slightly in 2014. This year, it's relatively flat. And so that's really indicative of the guidance that we're going forward with. Flat to slightly down. So it's very consistent with what we've seen over the last two years.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is coming from Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. First on R&D, R&D spend increased notably sequentially, and on an absolute and percentage of sales basis. Would you be willing to share if there are areas where you are proportionally directing more money that we should be thinking about as we look forward and how we think about this in the context of you driving synergies over the next few years? And then my second question is really a \u2013 I guess, really just clarification on guidance. Why did you assume $1.13 versus the current spot rate of $1.09 for the euro, and would you be willing to quantify what the assumption is for new product contributions that are factored into revenue growth? Thank you","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Doug, first, this is Vince. Listen, in terms of R&D, there's nothing unusual going on in R&D at all. We're not shifting funding or anything, and we haven't changed our outlook in terms of 6% of sales. So there's just some timing going on in projects. So nothing to really report there. And, Chris, on the $1.13?","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Yeah, the $1.13 is the last-30-day average; it's actually the last-90-day average, too. The euro was at $1.13 about 10 days ago. So there's been a lot of volatility. We've set our budget up at the $1.13. What I would point to, the fact that as we look forward, the euro really had a big impact in the current year, going from the $1.26, for example, in the first quarter, down to $1.13. And that was the biggest impact on FX in the current year. As we look forward to next year, that $1.16 down to the low $1.10 to $1.13 is much less of an impact going forward than some of the other currencies that we pointed to. So if you looked at our prepared remarks, we point to things like the Brazilian real, as well as the Canadian dollar. Those are huge drivers going forward into the 2016 guidance. We did decide we didn't want to mark-to-market, for example, on a euro basis, and we're comfortable with the guidance we gave, given the full basket of FX currencies.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question is coming from Rick Weiss of Stifel.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Vince. A couple questions. First, just a general question. Vince, you said early on in your comments that you're increasingly confident about delivering end-to-end solutions. Just curious, what's that mean exactly? What's giving you more confidence? Are you seeing larger contract system wins? Is that what's driving that statement, or just how do we think about that?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, so if I start on the Medication Management side of things, as we have proceeded with the integration, including the product lines, the work that Tom and his team have done with Cato and CRISI is actually expanding the solution set there, and that seems to be well-received by the customer base.","I mentioned also in my prepared remarks that the Pyxis Mini, we're in the process of launching that. And we see that as very important as integrated delivery networks start to think about how they coordinate care across the entire network. So we see ourselves doing quite well from a product standpoint to support that solution going forward. And the more conversations Tom and I have with the customer base, that seems to be the right strategy. So that was the reason behind my remark on the Medication side.","On the Diagnostics and Life Science side of the business, Linda can speak to this a little bit more, I'll ask her to in a second. But the ramp-up that we are seeing in Kiestra is quite strong. And so a full automation solution on the microbiology side is really coming along, and we've also added to that with Bruker. So, Linda, you might want to mention how we did with Kiestra, especially in the U.S. this year, and how that's ramping.","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President and President - Life Sciences Segment","Sure. Thanks. So as Vince mentioned a total solution. And if you look at the microbiology lab today, many of the labs look like they looked 50 years ago. So the opportunity with Kiestra and the opportunity to automate that lab from sample in to full now with our connectivity to MALDI's ID system, and our AST solution, you really see a full solution. So we saw great traction. One of our key growth drivers in the fourth quarter was BD Kiestra. Great traction in Western Europe, but also and very exciting for us is traction we're seeing in now China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Africa. And we ended the year with a significant number of new orders for the U.S. market. So this really is a tremendous opportunity for us.","And then just maybe one other solution I'll speak about on the Life Sciences side, a great growth driver for us with some research and the research market is the high-parameter research solution that we're offering now in combination with our high-parameter flow cytometers, with our X-30 and X-50, but also our Sirigen platform, so really enabling activity at the cell level an understanding that that has never existed before.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Rick, just to add to that and take it up to a different level here, at the 50,000-foot level, the informatics capability as we understand it now and the way we can leverage that capability across the company, not just on the Medication Management side, but we believe also into the Life Science side, we think is going to be a real enabler of solutions going forward. Now, we're not going to get into detail about that today, but as we evolve that strategy, that's something we'll be talking to you about as we go forward.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Matt Taylor of Barclays bank.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted just to delve into a couple things a little bit deeper that you hadn't talked about earlier on the call. One, I think people definitely focus on emerging markets. And I know you talked a little bit about macro in Brazil. I guess I want to understand what are the macro factors that you're talking about? Is it currency? Are you seeing flagging demand? Could you characterize that a little bit more in more detail?","And then I guess in terms of your EM sales, can you talk a little bit about just visibility in terms of working with distributor partners and how you're able to really see the end market demand versus what you're selling into?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So in terms of Brazil, what we were referring to really is the timing of tenders in Brazil. So that's related to government funding and how aggressively they ramp that up. And so we generally have a good sense of what the timing of those tenders would be as we put together our budget. And so my remarks reflected that knowledge base from the team down in Brazil and also what they're seeing in the other countries in Latin America, where they see government funding continuing to ramp up and a continued build of those systems. And so that's the macroeconomic factors that I'm talking about. It's mostly government funding.","Now, if you go over to China, it's a situation where the government is continuing to build out the healthcare system. It is growing somewhat slower, a couple percentage points slower, than it was in the past. And we've reflected that our guidance. It also reflects what we mentioned last quarter and this quarter, which was a slowdown of action on diagnostic instrumentation tenders. And that is driven by a desire of the hospitals not to get audited as part of the anticorruption process that's going on there. Doesn't mean the hospital did anything wrong. It's an added burden on the hospital, and if they can avoid that in the short run, they would like to do that. We've taken all that into account as we guide.","Now, in terms of working with our distributors, we work with them very closely on what their inventory levels are. We have our own sales force calling on the accounts. So we have a view to the pipeline. We do not leave that to the distribution community. So those are the factors that we look at as we take this all into account.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","I would just add that we feel real good about the China growth. If you look at this year over 15% and next year low to mid-teens, that's really strong growth, continues to be strong growth and outpaces our peers from a growth standpoint.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we continue to out-index our peers in emerging markets by a substantial amount, too. And of course it's become so big, even though, if you take something like China, where the growth rate has come down, the actual absolute number is still about where it was. So it's still a big impact and a big growth driver. And if I look out over the long term, we still see a very long ramp there.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Hello. Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","This is (1:02:18) filling in for Derik. I had a couple of questions quick. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the Diagnostic volumes outside of the United States and competition in Dx in general and also if you could quantify your revenue exposure to Brazil.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we haven't broken out Brazil any time in the past, so I don't think we will do that. All I would say is, as I was mentioning, that we've taken that softness into account and that the rest of Latin America has become a much bigger piece of Latin America.","Chris, anything you can add to that?","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Just to put it in perspective, though, if you look at China, one thing we have said is a 2% decline in China, for example, in their growth rate is only worth a 0.1 point of growth on the BD level. And Brazil is much smaller than China. So just to put things in perspective.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's good. Linda, why don't you talk about Diagnostics?","Linda Tharby - Executive Vice President and President - Life Sciences Segment","Yeah, just in terms of overall Diagnostic volumes in emerging markets, we continue to see strong growth in those areas, driven primarily by our BACTEC business, SurePath. We also see strong double digit growth in TB. So continuing to see increases in rollout of our platforms in all of our emerging markets.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is coming from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter. So maybe a first question on the guidance. So if I look at the operating margin improvements, at the midpoint it looks like about 50 bps. So that's about a $65 million uplift to your EBITDA. You had legacy, as a standalone BDX, you had margin improvements. And I think CFN, they had their annual margin improvement targets. So I'm just trying to think \u2013 and plus, you add in about the synergies, it feels like at the midpoint, it should be slightly better, the absolute dollar increase in EBITDA. So I'm wondering if you could sort of help us walk through? Especially given that pricing is kind of flattish.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Yeah, so just \u2013 there's a lot of ins and outs because of the fact that CareFusion had lower operating margins for the first half of last year. And so if you look at that, we're giving guidance of 21% to 22% versus the 20.7% last year. That's about 130 to 150 basis points of underlying growth, and we mentioned that in the script. And you have about 40 basis points of FX headwinds in there. So we feel good about the fact that we're driving that operating margin improvement, both next year and gross profit. So you can see that we're up year over year on the GP line. Again, overcoming about 40 basis points of FX. So about 50 basis points of improvement operationally, and we're continuing the SSG&A performance with another 30 to 40 basis points of operating margin improvement.","Now, if you look at SSG&A, if you went back to a combined basis in 2014, you're looking at like 25.7% of revenue. And we're now looking at that down over 100 basis points. So we obviously got a lot of synergies in year on the SSG&A line, and we're doing better on top of that going into next year. So the combination of all of those things point to the increase that we had. And if you look back at the chart that we had, chart 16, you can see that the accretion we talked about being 22% versus the high teens. But the thing that I would point to is that, excluding FX, we're driving $8.73 to $8.80 in terms of EPS on an FXN, neutral, basis. So really doing extremely well on the operation accretion. We've got the tax rate efficiencies kicking in and overcoming that FX headwinds, which are significant with about 5% headwinds from FX.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, Chris. So just one quick follow-up on the synergies. Raised their total targets to $3.25 to $3.50. Does that include I guess \u2013 legacy CF, then, had about 100 bips of annual expansion. Does that include or exclude \u2013 which was about $75 million by my math over a three-year period. And, I guess, Bill Kozy, congratulations to you. A long, successful career. And he was leading the charge on the integrations, and now with him sort of in there transitioning, I'm curious who's going to lead the integration now.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","So as Vince said, that would be me. And I've been working hand in hand with Bill over the last year. And now we're down to the execution phases, as we said. We've seen those synergies, the traction on those, our ability to use shared service centers, some of the end-to-end process improvements that we have, some of the plans that we have in place on manufacturing. So those are well under way, and hopefully in good hands as Bill retires. So we feel real good about our look forward","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In terms of your math, Chris, he was asking about the 100 basis points that CareFusion had in their plan.","Christopher R. Reidy - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Administration","Oh, sure. So, as we've said from the beginning, Vijay, that our synergies are truly incremental. So you can see what we did on slide 16, that those synergies are on top of the 9% to 10% that we would've normally driven on the BD side. And as we said from the beginning, CareFusion had indicated operating margin improvements that we haircutted from 100 to down to about 70 basis points. And what we're driving in these $3.25 to $3.50 are on top of those underlying improvements that they would have done on their own anyway. And so it really, truly is incremental.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Vijay, just one other point on the integration. So think about as Bill transitions, Bill is transitioning the manufacturing operations side. He's been working with Steve Sichak, of course, who runs all the reloco and all that. Success is getting it into that process, getting it into the business, and executing on it. And what we were indicating is we're already doing that with the six plants that we started. So we put it into our normal process.","The other big bucket is the G&A side, and of course who's been driving that but Chris. So we're well aligned on this. Bill has done just an absolutely fantastic job. And I can tell you, he won't go out the door until he gets this thing buttoned up, because that's just his nature. But, anyway, thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Today's final question is coming from the line of Jon Groberg of UBS.","Harris Iqbal - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. This is actually Harris on behalf of Jon. Appreciate the question. So first one, can you talk about the impact of recent initiatives to accelerate the Pyxis installation process? I think \u2013 I know you mentioned recently putting into place the Lean Six Sigma team, so maybe any update on the impact of these moves and how backlog is now trending?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure, Tom Polen can take that as soon as he turns on his mic.","Thomas Polen - President, BD Preanalytical Systems","Hi, Harris, this is Tom. So, as we have discussed, as you said, we've been working on the process improvements. We're quite pleased at the progress that we've been making there. We are seeing that process improve over the last six months in particular. And so we still have more work to do, but we have been applying some of our operational systems and Lean approaches to make that better. And we will be continuing that over the balance of FY 2016. What I would say, as well, is that while we're improving the installation process, we are continuing to see very strong demand for customers for ES. So we do not expect any change in that going forward.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn to floor back over to Vince Forlenza for any closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So I would like to thank all of you for your participation today on the call. I look forward to reporting on FY 2016. And, once again, I would like to thank all of the BD associates around the globe for their tremendous work in 2015. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through August 13, 2019, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 1475284. I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question and answer segment.","Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Lori. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us to review our third fiscal quarter results. As we have referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make Forward-Looking Statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Reconciliations to the GAAP measures that include the detail of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the appendix of the investor relations slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","As a reminder to provide additional revenue visibility, we will speak to our fiscal 2019 third quarter revenue results and fiscal 2019 revenue guidance on a comparable currency neutral basis. The comparable basis includes BD and Bard in the current and prior year periods, and excludes intercompany revenues and revenues associated with divestitures among other adjustments.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, Executive Vice President and President of the Interventional segment; and Patrick Kaltenbach, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vince Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. At BD, our strategy is driven by our purpose advancing the world of health. Our results this quarter demonstrate that our strategy is working and our core remains strong. Our progress with Bard is enabling us to deliver even more impactful comprehensive solutions for our customers.","Turning to Slide 5 and our third quarter highlights. Our third quarter performance was strong, revenue growth reflects the plan back half acceleration that we have been discussing with you throughout the year. As expected, growth was broad-based and we drove mid-single-digit growth in all three segments.","Third quarter EPS was also in-line with our expectations and our results through the first nine-months of the fiscal year or right on-track. As we approach the final year of the deal model, we continue to successfully integrate Bard as evidenced by our sustained top-line momentum, cadence of new product launches and progress towards our cost and revenue synergy capture.","We are also pleased with the level of engagement across the organization, as our associates are highly motivated by a common purpose. Looking forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2019, we expect the momentum from the third quarter to continue and are reaffirming our full fiscal year 2019 revenue and EPS guidance.","I will now turn things over to Chris for more detailed discussion of our third quarter fiscal performance and our fiscal year 2019 guidance.","Christopher Reidy","Thanks, Vince and good morning everyone. Moving on to Slide 7, I will review our third quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights. Third quarter revenues grew 5.7% on a comparable currency neutral basis.","As Vince mentioned, our strong third quarter revenue growth was broad-based and is a strong indicator of the health of the business. As we have discussed previously, there are a number of drivers across our segments that gave us confidence in our planned second half acceleration.","I will provide more color on the third quarter revenue growth in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and geography.","EPS is also in-line with our previously communicated expectations for the quarter. Despite significant FX headwinds in the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS at $3.08 crossing the $3 per share mark for the first time since closing the Bard acquisition. On a currency neutral basis, EPS grew 14.8%.","We also continue to delever during the third quarter, paying down approximately $450 million of debt. Gross leverage was 3.7 times as of June 30th and we remain on-track to achieve our commitment to delever to below three times over three years.","Moving on to Slide 8. I will review our medical segment revenue growth. BD Medical\u2019s third quarter revenues increased 6%. As expected performance in the medical segment was driven by continued momentum and share gains in Medication Management Solutions and strength and pharmaceutical systems.","In addition, growth and medication delivery solutions normalized as anticipated and was driven by our leading vascular access portfolio, which also reflects our revenue synergy investments. Growth in Diabetes Care was aligned with our expectations driven by strength in emerging markets.","Now turning to Slide 9. In the BD Life Sciences segment. Revenues increased 5.4% in the third quarter, with all three business units delivering strong growth of 5% plus. As anticipated performance in the Life Sciences segment was mainly driven by strengthen our molecular platforms in diagnostic systems with continued double-digit growth and BD MAX, as well as our microbiology solutions for IDAST, including our Phoenix panels.","In Biosciences we saw strong growth and research reagents and in research instruments sales in the U.S.. Growth in pre-analytical systems was driven by strong demand in emerging markets.","Turning to Slide 10. And the BD Interventional segment, third quarter revenues increased 5.2% reflecting the diversity of the portfolio. As anticipated BDI's results include a reduction of approximately 50% in plan DCB related sales in the quarter.","Excluding the DCB impact BDI segment revenues would have grown over 7%. Revenues and Peripheral Intervention grew in the low-single-digits in the third quarter. Excluding the DCB impact, revenue growth would have been in the high-single-digits.","Our WavelinQ, Covera and Venovo products continue to perform extremely well. Third quarter revenue growth and surgery reflects strong performance and biosurgery in the U.S., as Progel sales continue to ramp and double-digit growth and infection prevention and biosurgery in Europe, where we continue to see the benefits from our revenue synergy investments.","Revenue growth in urology and critical care continues to be driven by new product innovation in acute urology, as well as continued strength in our home care and targeted temperature management businesses.","Now moving to Slide 11 and our Geographic Revenues for the third quarter. Growth in developed markets was driven by strong performance in the medical and interventional segments in the U.S. and strength in Europe in the pharmaceutical systems, MMS and surgery units. Revenue growth in emerging markets was driven by broad-based double-digit growth in China and EMEA. We expect to continue double-digit growth in China for the full fiscal year.","Turning to Slide 12, which recaps the third quarter income statement. As discussed, revenues grew 5.7% in the quarter on a comparable basis. And moving down the P&L, gross profit grew 2.4% year-over-year, excluding the impact of currency as our continuous improvement and cost synergy initiatives were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable mix.","The mix impact was driven by strong revenue performance in the quarter, in products with lower relative gross margin profiles, as well as lower DCB sales, which as you know have a margin profile above the company average.","The mix impact mostly reflects timing within the year and we are maintaining our full-year gross profit margin guidance. As we continue to anticipate accelerated revenue growth, continuous improvement and synergy capture to drive strong Q4 margins as FX headwinds abate.","SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 24.7%. SSG&A grew at a pace slower than sales, which reflects our discipline spending as well as continued achievement of Brad costs synergies. R&D as a percentage of revenue was 5.6%. For the full fiscal year, we will invest approximately $1 billion in R&D, which reflects our continued commitment to drive innovation.","Operating margin of 25.4% was in-line with our expectations, as pressure in gross profits was mitigated by favorite ability on operating expenses. Our tax rate in the quarter was 12.8%, which is below our full-year guidance range due to the timing of discrete items. We had anticipated these items would occur throughout the fiscal year, and as such, these items are already reflected in our full-year guidance range.","As expected, we paid preferred dividends of $38 million in the quarter. As we have been discussing, the preferred shares are not included in the shares outstanding calculation. As previously discussed, adjusted earnings per share of $3.08 grew 5.8% versus the prior year and 14.8% on a currency neutral basis.","Now turning to Slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the third quarter. Gross profit margin was 55.6% in the quarter, the decline in gross margin was driven primarily by unfavorable currency and mix as previously discussed.","Operating margin was 25.4% in the quarter. On a performance basis, operating margin was flat as the decline in gross margin was offset by operating expenses leverage as previously discussed. Currency had a negative impact of 120 basis points on operating margin.","Now moving on to Slide 15, in our full fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance. As we discussed, our third quarter performance was strong and in-line with our expectations for accelerated revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year.","We expect continued momentum across our businesses and regions in the fourth quarter. As a result, we have reaffirmed our total Company and segment level revenue guidance for fiscal year 2019 as well as our expectations for growth in developed and emerging markets and China.","Moving on to Slide 16, we have also reaffirmed our full fiscal year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance. Our fiscal 2019 EPS growth expectations continue to reflect strong underlying performance driven by revenue growth and solid operating performance. All-in, we expected to deliver adjusted EPS at 11.65 to 11.75.","Turning to Slide 17, in our detailed P&L guidance. We have updated our expectations for interest other net to approximately $450 million to reflect proactive measures we have taken to lower interest expense. The balance of our P&L guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2019 remain unchanged.","We also continue to expect to achieve approximately $100 million in cost synergies in fiscal year 2019, and we are on-track to fully realize $300 million in annualized cost synergies over the three year deal period. We feel good about the momentum we have across our businesses and we are very confident that we will deliver on our commitments in fiscal year 2019 and beyond.","Now I would like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our product portfolio.","Vincent Forlenza","Thank you, Chris. Turning to Slide 19 in our planned product launches by segment. As we had been discussing with you, we have a very robust pipeline across the Company. There are a number of things we are excited about. I will touch on just a few recent launches here.","Starting with the BD medical segments. In May, we launched the BD Pyxis ES System version 1.6, which brings software enhancements achieved through upgrades to the core ES software, as well as through system integration of three technologies. BD Pyxis ES Refrigerator, BD Pyxis Track and Deliver and BD HealthSight Data Manager.","These enhancements improve clinical workflow efficiency, pharmacy flexibility and end-to-end medication safety. Regarding our health site platform, feedback from customers continues to be very positive and we are gaining traction across our applications.","Before we move on to our Life Science segment, I would like to discuss the Type 2 insulin Patch Pump. As we discussed on our call last quarter, the feedback we received from the FDA was more comprehensive than we had anticipated.","Based on this feedback and given the intricacies of this product category, we have decided to withdraw our FDA application and have engaged a third-party R&D partner with expertise in this space, while we work through our strategic options. As a result, our previous timeline has been extended and we will provide you with additional information as we make progress.","Moving on to the BD Life Science segment. We are excited by the recent launch of BD COR, our new high throughput molecular diagnostics platform aimed at providing automation of molecular testing in core and other large centralized labs.","Early customer interest and placement of our BD COR units are exceeding our expectations. We also continue to see strong growth on the BD MAX platform supported by the commercial success of recently introduced assays such as the BT MAX Vaginal Panel, as well as our Enteric Panel suite.","In addition, we have seen success with our Phoenix M50 IDAST instrument along with our recently launched CPO Detect assay. Pre-analytical systems continues to benefit from capacity investments in our UltraTouch push button blood collection sets. UltraTouch has been very well received by our customers and is driving continued conversion from conventional solutions.","Within Biosciences, we continue to see strong performance in our FACSymphony, high parameter instruments and flow reagents, as well as the BD Rhapsody Ab6 single-cell multi-omics solution that improves RNA and protein analysis.","In addition, our FACSLyric clinical instrument continues to do well and when combined with the recently launched FACSDuet automated sample prep instrument provides a solution for clinical laboratories to improve the accuracy and repeatability of their tests.","Within the BD Interventional segment, we are excited that we recently launched OptiFix AT an articulating fixation device for laparoscopic and robotic compatible use. And Phasix ST OVHR, which is a mesh designed specifically for open hernia repairs, that leverages our existing Phasix technology and a newly developed positioning system.","In addition our WavelinQ Endovascular AV Fistula System, as well as our Venovo and Covera products that launched earlier this year, as part of our stent product category all continue to see positive momentum in the market.","Regarding our FDA, PMA submission for Lutonix below the knee, as you are all aware, we have been working with the FDA in a collaborative review process. Subsequent to the FDA Advisory Committee meeting on paclitaxel, the statutory review time for our BTK PMA submission concluded, and the FDA notified us that our PMA was not approvable in its current form.","While this determination was based on the clinical evidence provided to-date, we continue to review collaborate and align with the FDA on the path forward regarding our submission, including the need to potentially provide additional clinical data.","As a result, the approval process timeline has extended out from our previous expectations and we no longer expect approval this calendar year. We will keep you informed as we work with the FDA and make further progress.","Before I move on, I would like to speak for a moment about our commitment to sustainability, which is a key component of our strategy. We are pleased to have recently published our FY 2018 sustainability report, which provides an update on our progress towards achieving our 2020 sustainability goals. These goals provide the framework for how we manage and make an impact on the most relevant social and environmental issues for our Company.","We are pleased with the progress we have made towards our 2020 goals and believe there are opportunities ahead to make a real difference as we work to address global challenges such as climate change, and anti microbial resistance.","In addition, we received several acknowledgments in 2018, including CR magazines 100 Best Corporate Citizen list and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, Best Places to Work for LGBTQ equality. More recently, we were proud to have been named as one of the 2019 Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion by Disability Inn. These awards highlight the success of our business, our responsibility to the environment, our commitment to inclusion and diversity and our ethical standards.","Looking forward, we now have a broader, more impactful portfolio and will continue to refine our sustainability strategy and set new ambitious goals that will not only ensure our resilience over the long-term, but also consider the expectations of our shareholders around and stakeholders around the world.","In the appendix of today's presentation, we have again included a slide that provides you with some more details on our sustainability initiatives. We hope you will find this information useful in understanding BD\u2019s commitment to this important topic.","Moving on to Slide 20, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. We delivered strong revenue growth in the third quarter in-line with our planned second half acceleration. Growth was broad base across the businesses and regions, which reflects the breadth and diversity of our portfolio. The integration of Bard is on-track and we are confident in our ability to achieve our cost and revenue synergy commitments.","Looking forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2019, we expect our momentum to continue and have reaffirmed our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. In summary, we are confident that our core remains strong. Our progress with Bard is enabling us to deliver even more impactful comprehensive solutions for our customers.","Thank you and we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Barclays.","KristenStewart","Hey good morning everybody.","VincentForlenza","Good morning Kristen.","ChristopherReidy","KristenStewart","So I guess, just want to kind of start off with just kind of longer term expectations. I can appreciate that you guys probably don't want to give any specific color around 2020 and guidance in that respect. But having into the call I think 2020 outlook was definitely one of investor's top concerns and given the update on Lutonix below the knee and it not being approvable I think that is only to kind of increase the concerns on the street.","So I was wondering, if you could just maybe help provide your thoughts on puts and takes for how we should think about fiscal year 2020. I know that you had talked about the deal model being in kind of mid-teens growth. Obviously, there has been some changes with the Lutonix, but also Gore royalty is just how should we think about that in the year ahead and the puts and takes? Thanks.","VinceForlenza","So Kristen, thanks very much for the question. I have to say. We are not surprised to get the question on surprises, you have to write off if that. But let's get it on the table. We are making good progress and 2020 is what I want you to know and everyone to know. We are making good progress on the budget. We are a little early on, we are not finished yet. But with knowing that we had a Gore royalty going away, we started this process earlier.","And I feel really good about the process that we are running and the progress we are making there. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Chris, he is going to give you a little more detail. We are not going to completely guide today. But we will give you a good sense of the progress we are making.","ChristopherReidy","Sure. Thank Vince and good morning Kristen. You know you are right, it's too early to give a level of precision to guidance for the next year, there will be some things that we are watching. But what I would say is that the message essentially remains the same as last quarter with the one exception being BTK.","But if you think about it on the revenue side, we still expect to drive 5% to 6% growth for 2020. Despite the DCB status quo and the BTK delay, so we will still be able to drive that 5% to 6%. And then on EPS, at worse the BTK impact even if we don't have it for the full-year is about 1%. And we would intend to mitigate as much of that as possible.","A little bit of pressure on FX, but we will watch that. But despite all of this, barring anything that unforeseen changes from here. We are very confident in our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth next year.","Where we are in that double-digit will depend on things that transpire between the next couple of months. So, but we feel good with that floor of double-digits. And we will see where BTK plays out where FX goes. But everything else is pretty consistent with what we have said before.","VinceForlenza","So all-in-all good progress, and maybe I will just ask Simon to comment. Simon you know, you are having some really good performance on some new products that give us this confidence on the 5% to 6%. So maybe you want to talk about some of the other products that are off setting some of these things in the DCB area.","SimonCampion","Sure Vice. So I think Chris already on the statements mentioned Venovo and Covera and WavelinQ within the PI business. And I'm sure you will have seen the recent Trump - on kidney disease which will only serve to help the visibility of this ailment.","And another great quarter in end stage renal disease domestically and internationally. I think also very significantly to the BDI segment, is our performance globally, as we begin to leverage the scale of BD, particularly in areas where or Bard was only condensing its investment profile.","So, for example, biosurgery and infection prevention in Europe had a tremendous quarter. And that was driven by the investments that we made as part of the acquisition. And urology continues to perform terrifically well, driven by home care internationally and new products domestically. And we foresee that the great progress continuing in all three businesses within BDI.","VinceForlenza","So thanks, Simon. The bottom line of what Simon is saying is we are right on the deal models and mixing new products is a little different. We didn't expect the DCB situation. But as Simon just detailed for you there is a whole series of other new products, including in urology that is going quite well. So that is enabling us to hold that guidance range. So thanks, Kristen, for the. We appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","DavidLewis","Good morning just two quick once for me. One for Chris and one for Simon. Chris just thinking about the fourth quarter, you obviously maintain 25%, 26% margins, but it sort of implies 28% fourth quarter margins to get to the midpoint. So should we think about the low end of the range for the year on margins and how do you get that 2.5 point step up?","And same question on growth Chris, you talked about acceleration into the fourth quarter. But it's a pretty significant momentum step up into the fourth quarter just to get to the low end of the five to six. So maybe your confidence top and bottom for the fourth quarter?","And just a quick one for Simon. Post the panel and now with the BTK update. Have you made any commercial decisions about the DCB commercial organization in terms of a size, is it right size to the opportunity, and then the level of growth? Thank so much guys.","ChristopherReidy","Sure I will start. So clearly, we have been saying that the revenue is going to accelerate in the second half of the year. You saw that starting to happen in Q3, we see that accelerating even further in Q4. Again, it's the continuous strength in UCC and surgery, the MMS momentum that we have.","MDS is accelerating and strong growth in biosciences and DS which is essentially across the business. So we have strong confidence in that. And then on operating margins, we do see acceleration in the operating margins in the fourth quarter. Don't forget we don't have the FX drag that goes away in the quarter.","We continue to see revenue synergies - cost synergies and CI continuing to build. And again, FX abates there. So we have a lot of confidence and being able to get solidly within that 25% to 26% range that we gave guidance on. Simon.","SimonCampion","Hi, David it's Simon. So certainly we have been preparing for all eventualities with respect to the DCBs and BTK as well. While we won't provide you any details here, I think it's important to recognize that the territory managers for example wouldn't prefer intervention that business, they sell far more than DCBs.","And we have seen your positive uptake in stents and other areas. So to begin to affect those, I think would be not a great move. But obviously as part of this process, we have sought to offset as much of this as possible without impacting the commercial performance of the organizations.","VincentForlenza","And we are still waiting to see where the FDA comes out, the course on labeling changes and it\u2019s the letter to physicians. So we will stay tuned for how that works out. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","RobertHopkins","Yes, thank you and good morning.","VincentForlenza","Good morning Bob.","RobertHopkins","Just a lot of questions one could ask. But I can't help but just one more on paclitaxel. Just curious if you could elaborate, just in however you can on kind of what you heard from FDA after the panel meeting. Do you have a sense at this point, whether you think you might need a whole new trial or just longer term data or any incremental senses as to what you heard from there would be helpful.","VincentForlenza","You are asking on BTK.","RobertHopkins","Yes.","VincentForlenza","Yes, that is what I thought.","SimonCampion","On BTK, well, Bob its Simon. I don't think we would provide the specific information here. We did provide the six month data and interim 12-month data in the PMA that we filed. And we continue to cooperate and work with FDA as we work through this.","But to provide any specifics about it, I think would confer a competitive advantage on others and I'm low to do that. So it remains a very active PMA, our teams are collaborating with FDA and we expect to have face-to-face meetings here with them in the not too distant future.","VincentForlenza","To really nail down what that data requirement will be. And we have more data to bring to the table too. So we continue to work on it. Thanks for the question Bob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan.","RobbieMarcus","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk about your strategy around M&A in general. You are down at three, seven times leverage, we saw you not wait until you got all the way to your target last time with the Bard deal. Just how you are thinking about where to add, what to add valuations in the space?","And then also, if you could just touch on maybe your thoughts on M&A specifically in diabetes. This is an area, I think back to the last Analysts Day. There was a long list of product innovations you were hoping to bring to market. I don't think it probably turned out as positive as you hoped. Just your thoughts on diabetes and your plans for the future there? Thanks a lot.","VincentForlenza","Yes, sure. And happy to answer the question. First, just a little bit of a correction. We did hit our deleverage target on the CareFusion deal before we did the Bard deal. And listen your are very politic in the way you have rest of the question. So no problem at all. But anyway, so we are really focused on meeting our leverage target as we go forward.","Now, what we have been saying and remain committed to is that, must do plug-in M&A is an important part of the strategy. And as we put the deal model together we made allowance for that and you have seen us do stuff like WavelinQ, because it's an important part of the growth strategy. You should expect, over the next year that we will continue doing that, as we move forward towards deleveraging and getting down below three times.","And then, as we look forward, we have tremendous capability in terms of our ability to do M&A. But, we are not a serial acquirer, we are a strategically driven Company. And you should expect us to be thinking about plugging M&A and then looking at the dividends and share repurchase as we move forward.","So, Chris, anything else you want to add to that?","ChristopherReidy","I would just point you back to the presentation, I made at your conference back in January, Robbie, where we talked about future cash flow considerations and the bottom line of that is we throw up a lot of cash. We happened to be using it to pay down $6 billion of debt, but at the same time, when that is done, which is, within the next year, we will have a lot of cash to allocate.","And we started getting some sense of that, we will be talking more about that as we move on. But again, it gets back to what Vince said is, we are not going to let it build up in the balance sheet, we are going to be more active in tuck-in M&A on a strategic level across the whole portfolio and likely to start going back to share buybacks, once we start building up the cash balances and have gotten down to that three times leverage.","And we made that correction, because we are very proud about the fact that we live up to our commitments, we committed that we would get down to three times leverage in the CareFusion deal. And we did that before moving into the Bard transaction and we are going to get down to the three times leverage this time as well.","VincentForlenza","So, as Chris said, plug-in M&A across the entire portfolio and that could include diabetes, obviously, any other business here. In the short run, we remained committed to the Patch Pump. You heard the comment that we have taken on a development partner for doing that and we will continue to work on that as the number one priority as well as investing in the core of that business where we see some nice opportunities. But thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.","VijayKumar","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I have a housekeeping questions first. One on in Q4, the imply at the lower end of the 5% or 6% of the annual rate and you are going to place Q4 6% organic, where is the acceleration coming from just given the tougher comps, if you can walk us through that. And the second on 3Q, the MDR regulation, incremental cost, is that sort of an ongoing implementation costs, are we annualizing during the Q4? Thank you.","ChristopherReidy","Yes. So it was a little hard to hear you, Vijay, but at the same time, I think I got it. You were looking for a little bit more on Q4 revenue and we are not talking about accelerating much more from the five to seven. It's a little bit and, I went through before where we are seeing strength in some of the new products that we have brought to market.","Venovo to Covera, WavelinQ are very helpful, continued strength in UCC. We are seeing great momentum in MMS, as you saw from the results this quarter. MDS is accelerating as we expected it to and we see strong growth in biosciences and diagnostic systems.","Don't forget, we have some revenue synergies that kick in towards the back end of this year, particularly in the fourth quarter. So that is where we are seeing it come from. And I think, I talked about the margins, gross profit. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw some one-time kind of timing items that go away in the fourth quarter and rebound.","Not to mention FX, not being a headwind, both on gross profit and operating margin. We see CI and synergies ramping. So we are very comfortable with the direction and very similar message to what I said last quarter, you saw that moving that direction and the third quarter and we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter.","VincentForlenza","So Vijay, the only thing I would add to that is the emerging markets growth is going to continue to be strong. I mentioned already that in China, we were double-digits, we expect to be double-digits for the rest of the year. We have a great business there, a great team there and a strong partnership with the Ministry of Health. That is all going extremely well. We don't expect this environment with tariffs on retail products and stuff to be impacting that business.","So we expect that to do double-digits for the entire year. And feel good about that. We feel good about the rest of Asia. And of course, EMEA, you saw, it was very strong this quarter. We expect that to continue too. So there is a lot of drivers both in the business side and from the geography side.","ChristopherReidy","I think just for clarity, I would add two other points, Vijay. We do expect lower interest other to be about 450 million, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. And then I would expect tax to be closer to the middle of the range. There is a lot of intricacies and tax, but you saw it was lower in this quarter at 12.8%. That will rebound upwards in the fourth quarter, putting us right towards the middle of the guidance range that we gave.","VincentForlenza","Thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.","LarryBiegelsen","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Just one on Lutonix, one on China. So on Lutonix there have been a lot of questions on BTK. But my question is on the current indications and kind of what you are seeing since the FDA panel and your expectation once the updated FDA guidance comes out?","And just Vince, I heard your comments on China and your confidence there. But there we are getting questions from investors about potential backlash in China against U.S. products given all the rhetoric here. Maybe you could help us understand why you are confident in that growth continuing and why some of this noise won't have any impact domestically? Thanks for taking the question.","VincentForlenza","Yes. Sure. I will handle that. And then Simon can handle the intricacies of what is going on DCBs. So on China, as I was mentioning just a minute ago, our experience through this whole situation with what is going on with trade has been that they have been keeping very separate what is happening in healthcare versus what is happening on the trade side.","And I think that reflects number one, a strategic priority to continue to develop the health care system in this environment. And that is what we hear from the Ministry of Health and in fact, more recently over the past six months. We have had conversations, where they have explicitly told us that. So that is the first part of it.","The second part of it is, we had our team in here and the China Healthcare System is now better funded than it was a year ago or three years ago. And so there is some positive momentum going on in China, as the rest of the economy slows down that I think is important to them.","And then thirdly, we are really well positioned with the portfolio and the organizations that we have in China and it's not just the fact of our commercial organization. But it's what we do in terms of investing in China.","We have four plants in China, we continue to invest behind that, we continue to invest in innovation for China as well. And I know Tom is excited about the portfolio, he is been working very closely with John DeFord and our team in Asia.","So, we have built a partnership over 25-years there. And so we do think that different aspects of the environment will be difficult, and we are ready for that. But we also expect that with what we have done to fully invest in China and not just a commercial organization, we are very, very well positioned there. And that is what we hear and Tom has got another one or two things he would like to add.","ThomasPolen","Larry, this is Tom, good morning. Maybe just one small thing to add to Vince's good overview there is that those investments that we have made over the last 25-years, particularly in that localized, highly automated manufacturing, today the majority of the high volume disposable medical devices that we sell in China, we make in China locally.","So we are actually importing, relatively low percentage, particularly of our high volume disposable devices, where there can be local competition, we are actually behaving as a local in that. Employing local associates, acquiring raw materials locally, et cetera, and engaging in those local communities.","So much more on the some of the unique areas where there is actually not a local competition. In area such as BD,BDS, et cetera or BDI, where we would be doing importing and we are actually moving somewhat of that manufacturing into China as well.","VincentForlenza","Yes. Okay, so Simon on DCBs and the intricacies there.","SimonCampion","So good morning Larry it's Simon. So, I think, as you obviously know the panel happened in June and I think industry really did put the best foot forward here and in a collaborative nature. I think many of the main physicians that spoke was speaking on behalf of the role of paclitaxel, not only within PAD, but also these are paclitaxel in other areas and not seeing a signal associated with that.","And everyone continues to work with FDA, as they look to refine their due doctor letter. What we have seen is approximately 50% reduction, I think we communicate that on the last call, it has remained at about that point in the last quarter and barring any unforeseen upsized I think we should expect that to continue as we roll forward here.","But once again, DCBs are just about 1% of the total BDX business as Chris has spoken to and I have spoken to with new products in PI with new products in surgery that are just launched and with the outstanding performance and funnel within urology. I think we are well placed to offset as much of the headwinds as we can moving forward.","LarryBiegelsen","Thanks, guys.","VincentForlenza","Sure, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","WilliamQuirk","Great. Thanks, good morning everyone.","VincentForlenza","Hey Bill.","WilliamQuirk","A couple of questions for Chris. Just, can you maybe just elaborate on the lower interest expense. Doesn't like should be additives to earnings for the full-year. So I'm just trying to figure out where the offset is, just given that the overall earnings guidance didn't change? And then secondly, would you care to elaborate on, I guess the durability of the BD MAX growth you have seen several very strong quarters now? Thank you.","ChristopherReidy","Sure. So you already saw some of the interest reduction in the third quarter. And that was actually used to offset the additional pressure, we saw about $0.05 of pressure more than we expected to in FX. We thought it would be about $0.20, it was more like $0.25 of pressure. So you have already seen some of that and that is why I pointed you to the fact that the tax rate goes back up in the fourth quarter to get to the middle of the range for the year.","It's now 13.3 year-to-date through the third quarter and we expect it to be closer to the 15% for the year. So obviously, that is an offset that you see and it was much lower. So when you put all that together and you model, I think you get back to right where we are. And there is no question that the FX has put pressure, it was real in the third quarter. But we are holding our range for the year despite that pressure.","VincentForlenza","Okay. Patrick.","PatrickKaltenbach","Let me comment quickly on the BD MAX. And as we said in the quarters before, we saw growth north of 20% and again, this quarter it was north of 20% and it's driven by the strong access we have the Enteric Panel to NDP Panel et cetera. So we are pretty confident that this has a long runway, building out more panels on BD MAX. And, again, there is strong demand, and we have pretty high growth in the business.","VincentForlenza","Patrick, anything you want to add on BD COR, I mentioned it as one of the new product launches, maybe a little more color on that.","PatrickKaltenbach","Yes. So we just launched BD COR in Europe. And we are really, really happy with the initial demand we are seeing and interest, we are seeing from our customers in Europe. It's still early days, because we have just one assay so far on it, but we are building out the panel. And we think, we have a very competitive platform on hand that will drive the future growth within our business here.","And we will have the same as I said, we have from BD MAX report and BD COR build out a complete platform approach. So we can cover both the acute and the COR lab. So it has a very strong driver for business.","VincentForlenza","Okay thanks Patrick. And thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise of Stifel.","FrederickWise","Hi good morning Vince and hi Chris how are you doing?","VincentForlenza","Good morning, we are doing great.","FrederickWise","One quick one and one guidance. And just Vince, as always, I'm curious to hear your thoughts about the politics and med tech tax. I always like to hear your thoughts like that. But I would like to ask a guidance question. I think you are making it abundantly clear and for multiple reasons why fourth quarter - fiscal fourth quarter is going to look good and accelerated and sort of sounds like a minimum look a lot like the growth that we saw in the fiscal third quarter.","But you do have your dramatically most challenging comp of the year. Maybe help us understand how you had hit the upper end or get towards the upper end of guidance. What has to happen and it would seem to me, to get to that full-year guidance more toward 6% you would have to post an upward single-digit fourth quarter. Is that remotely possible or are there some variables that I'm not understanding. Any color would be much appreciated.","VincentForlenza","We have provided guidance in the past calls that because of DCB, because of the flu season as it played out, those are the biggest drivers that we would be towards the lower end of our guidance range of five to six in spite of those pressures. So the guidance for Q4 really implies the low end of that 5% to 6% range.","So, as you have just mentioned, it would take a real blow out to get up to the top, but the businesses are performing strongly. But as you said, with the content that makes it really difficult.","ChristopherReidy","Yes, I mean, we feel really good about the fact that the businesses are delivering well. We talked about BDI and the performance in this quarter with would have been well over 6% less for the DCB impact. And as I said even with the DCB impact and the potential BTK impact, we feel strongly about the ability to drive 5% to 6% next year as well.","So we are feeling good about that momentum. In order to get the high ends of the range, we would have had to have a blowout flu season and because we know that was a tough compare against last year's flu season and DCB was incredible.","VincentForlenza","Yes. Tom.","ThomasPolen","Frederick, this is Tom good morning. Maybe just one other comments that to add there. You mentioned the comp being last year's Q4 and you are right, as Chris mentioned, we feel really good about the momentum from Q3 going into Q4 and one of the biggest comp area is last year I believe was in MMS we saw very strong growth.","And I think one of the things I'm surprised you haven't got the question of a really strong number in MMS this quarter, as well, which is reflecting the continued momentum that we see in that business. And unless Alberto has any other comments to add there. But I think we are continue to be pleased at growing significantly above market in the MMS business, which we expected to continue. So.","AlbertoMas","Yes, very good quarter for MMS clearly growing 9% plus, and it just reflects an ongoing momentum for this business. Yes we have been favorably impacted by some timing of installations, like here we - be on the last side in the pump side. But that will normalize overtime.","We had a very strong quarter last year in Q4 we will jump over that and we won\u2019t grow up to 9% growth rate clearly, but we are expecting good performance given the high quarter. And the drivers are the ones that we had mentioned in the past in terms of our core platforms into Alaris, Pyxis.","The health side analytics to this really driving the integrated platform approach to the - and interoperability where we already have 475 sites live. And it just shows that momentum and that acceptance by the market of what we are offering as an integrated platform.","VinceForlenza","Yes, the business is performing great, really, really well. Thanks Alberto. And thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter of SVB Leerink.","RichardNewitter","Hi, thanks for the questions. I have two here. One on molecular, the double-digit growth trend is very strong. You also had some competitive and continue to put up strong double-digit growth rate. I guess my question here is how much of the performance and the momentum in that business is something happening in terms of improvement, the underlying market versus share? And then the second question would just be on drug-coated balloons, I would love to just hear following the FDA panel, what are your customers and doctors saying in terms of what it\u2019s going to take to kind of either get back to levels, or close to the levels of utilization and implementation where they were pre-panel and the study. And where do they think that level is? It's half of what it used to be. What are your customers saying with respect to that view post panel? Thanks.","VincentForlenza","Alright. So let's do molecular first, and then we will come back to DCB.","PatrickKaltenbach","Thanks Richard for the question. So on molecular, as you said, our growth is pretty strong, not only driven by BD MAX. But it's probably one of the big contributors there. If you look at our growth very competitive market growth. I would say clearly indicates that we are taking some share right now.","Given the strong growth that we have, and we are again confident on our, in our assays that they are hitting the right market segments and it's also - if you look for example on Enteric, we are not using multiplex as is we are using a more target approach and that is also in terms of reimbursement model very beneficial for us. So I would say definitely points to taking market share for us.","VincentForlenza","Okay. Simon on DCB.","SimonCampion","So with respect to DCBs. I think the FDA needs to come out with a statement to - and says that the benefits outweigh the risks in summary for the market to begin to begin to rebound. I think our customers feel like their hands are tied right now with the Dear Dr. Letter from March 15th and that is reflected in the current 50% there about a decline in business, not just with us, but with others too.","So I think in one sentence, benefits need to outweigh the risks and the benchmark for recovery profile is if you reflect back on drug eluting stents in the coronary system, you can see the recovery profile that they experience over prolonged period of time.","VincentForlenza","Yes, which took a few years, right Sam to come back.","SimonCampion","Which took a few years. But we saw the way to see what the contents of this letter holds for us. And more importantly, for the patients that we serve. These remains the same way then patients that we serve will not have the treatment options available to the scale it was before the Dear Dr. Letter.","VincentForlenza","So just to answer that a little bit. This is probably not a black and white situation. There is a lot of degrees of gray and what the FDA can say here and so we don't know exactly where that will come out.","Simon mentioned before industry has given a lot of input, we expect to KLLs are also giving input on that. And we think very shortly, we will get an updated letter, the FDA, I should say will be coming forth with an updated letter in terms of exactly what Simon was talking about.","So we are waiting to see where that comes out. And I would agree with Simon, industry more so the healthcare providers have made some great arguments as to why this product is important for patients. And so we will see how that plays out over the next couple of days. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Matt Taylor of UBS.","MatthewTaylor","Hi, thanks for taking the question. So I just had a clarification question on your commentary on DCBs and next year at synergy. So it sounds like when you are talking about being able to grow 5% to 6%. That is not predicated on any real snap back in the core DCB business, is that correct? And then also, when you reiterated the Bard revenue synergies, you are right on-track, there is no major impact or un-surmountable impact from DCBs. Is that right?","ChristopherReidy","Yes. So you are right. As we think about 2020, we are assuming that 50% holds through 2020. So no snap back in that. Okay. On the synergies, the cost synergies were right on target. We did mention that, we will do $100 million this year. And we are well on our way to 300. I think from a revenue synergies we are on-track as well. So.","ThomasPolen","So Matt, this is Tom, just to give a little bit more color on the revenue synergy. So we are seeing the three areas that we have shared before, we are seeing very good momentum across both the vascular access area, we brought the Bard pick and midline business in and integrated with our catheter team.","I would say in the last two quarters, we are really seeing an increase in the number of competitive conversions, which was exactly our strategy. And that gives us confidence going forward and that continuing to the fuel performance, particularly in the MDS business, so you see that now in the back half of this year, going into next year.","We are seeing the benefits in our surgery business. You are seeing some of that play out actually this quarter, that the investments that we made in the combined Biosurgery and chloro prep infection prevention salesforce in Europe. We are seeing Biosurgery and infection prevention now growing strong double-digits in Europe because of those synergy investments that we have made.","And then, of course, the third area of just geographic expansion in markets, particularly beyond China that Bart had invested in significantly, we are seeing strong growth in BDI in those other geographies as well. And so, we feel very confident our revenue synergies being on-track for this year and continuing that momentum in 2020.","MatthewTaylor","Okay. And then just one follow up, it sounds like the BD COR product could be a really interesting drivers. You have had some comments on it today, but they are a little general. Could you talk a little bit more about how big you think that product could be overtime as it builds on your successes with MAX?","PatrickKaltenbach","Yes, I can take that. Look at again , current revenues are still, it's early days, right. We are ramping the product. We are just ramping it in Europe with the HPV panel on it. As I said, this is for as a revenue driver in 202,1 2022. I think we will see lots of revenue contributions coming from this platform, when we also have it available worldwide.","We think it's a very attractive platform, given the automation capabilities it has, especially also taking care of the pre-analytical step within the platform. So we think we will see a very nice revenue contribution and growth contribution in our diagnostic services business. And in the years 2021 and 2022. This year, it's definitely - making a huge contribution.","VinceForlenza","Okay. Right. Thanks. Thanks, Patrick.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Josh Jennings of Cowen.","JoshuaJennings","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two questions. First on the peripheral business, just in terms of attempting to leverage the salesforce even more on the DCB pullback. I was wondering about your views on the need for an atherectomy platform. I think prior to the acquisition, there was a rumblings that Bard had a system in development in the pipeline and just wanted to hear is that still the case within back to its pipeline?","And secondarily, just wanted to hear some of the thoughts on the hernia businesses, Phasix seems to be doing very well. There is some controversy around synthetic non-receivable mash. And just wanted to hear your views on the market and in Phasix positioning? Thanks for taking the questions.","SimonCampion","So its Simon here. I wouldn't comment specifically in what is in our NPD funnel until we are ready to actually give a commercial launch date. As you know, PI plays and in every category within the PAD space, with the exception of atherectomy. So it's obviously something we keep a close eye on internally and externally. But Company further on that I wouldn't do so.","And then with respect hernia, at long last, I can stop referring to the hurricane, because Q3 so the last comp again versus the hurricane that happened actually two years ago. So we had a very strong underlying quarter in Q3. We continue to grow above the market. And your Phasix performance with our context of Bard business continue to do really well.","We have just released three-year data on Phasix, which continue to do really well. We just released another version of Phasix. As Vince mentioned, Phasix ST OVHR, which incorporates a new positioning system. And that is off to a great start.","And again, we just recently released a new articulating fixation system that thus far has got tremendous feedback from our customers. So hernia continues to do very well and we continue to look for other ways that we can leverage that sales in team that we have domestically and internationally. So we should expect to see that continue in that vein.","VinceForlenza","Okay Josh, thanks for those questions.","End ofQ&A","Operator","Thank you. I will now return the call to Vincent Forlenza for any closing comments.","Vincent Forlenza","Okay. So let me wrap this up. A couple of thoughts, our revenues were strong across all the businesses and regions in-line with the second half plan acceleration we are very excited about that. We expect our momentum to continue and have reaffirmed our fiscal year 2019 revenue and EPS guidance. And as we approach the final year at the Bard deal model, I'm confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitments, and create more value for our customers or patients and our shareholders.","Once again, thank you for your questions. We look forward to updating you again around this exciting business that we have built. Thanks very much.","Christopher Reidy","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"3235":["Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) F1Q 2013 Earnings Call February  5, 2013  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Monique Dolecki","Vincent A.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through February 12, 2013, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at (800) 585-8367 for domestic calls and (404) 537-3406 for international calls, using conference ID 87420149. [Operator Instructions] Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin your conference.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to [ph] first fiscal quarter results. As we reference in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our first fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filing.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Suky Upadhyay, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller and acting Chief Financial Officer; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Polen, President of Diagnostic Systems.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As we stated in our press release, we're off to a good start this year, and we're pleased with our performance in the first fiscal quarter. Overall, revenues and EPS were solid. At the end of December, we completed the acquisition of Safety Syringes, Inc. or SSI. SSI specializes in the development of anti-needlestick devices for prefilled syringes and will be reported in our Pharmaceutical Systems business unit within BD Medical's -- BD's Medical segment.","Growth in the first quarter was driven by our Medical and Diagnostic segments. Revenue growth was partially aided by an early flu season and favorable comparisons to the prior year period. In our Bioscience segment, we saw solid growth, which was driven by improved instrument placements in the U.S., as well as favorable comparisons to last year.","We also saw strong continued growth in international Safety sales and emerging markets. As we've been discussing with you for some time now, we have spent the past 2 years making significant strategic investments in our business in the backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment.  When we provided our full year guidance in November, we expected to see solid revenue growth, margin expansion and underlying double-digit earnings growth, excluding the medical device tax. Our underlying business performance for the first quarter demonstrates that our strategy is delivering results and gives us the confidence to raise the bottom end of both our revenue and EPS guidance ranges. Suky will provide more details on our fiscal year 2013 outlook later in his remarks.","On Slide 5, we've outlined our first quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. The total company revenues were solid, increasing by 5.2%. Fully diluted EPS came in at $1.35, growing at 15.8% over the prior year.","Now I'd like to turn things over to Suky for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter financial performance.","Suketu Upadhyay","Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by discussing the key financial highlights for the first quarter. As Vince just stated, our results were ahead of our expectations, with Medical and Diagnostics driving solid growth for the company. This quarter, we also saw an improvement in our Biosciences segment. After normalizing for the flu, favorable comparisons and acquisitions, our first quarter underlying revenue grew at the upper end of our previous guidance range.","As a reminder, when we talk about our acquisitions this year, we are referring to KIESTRA, Sirigen and SSI. Accuri and Carmel Pharma have annualized and will now be included in our base going forward.","In the quarter, we saw strong gross margin expansion of 200 basis points, which led to improved operating margin expansion of 220 basis points. We are on track to meet our goal of about 50 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion for the fiscal year.","Additionally, during the quarter, we completed about $300 million of our $500 million share repurchase plan for FY 2013. As Vince also mentioned, our first quarter results gives us the confidence to raise the bottom end of our currency-neutral revenue and EPS guidance ranges. Given a stronger euro, we're also raising our reported revenue and EPS outlook while also tightening the range. I'll provide more details around our outlook later in the call.","Now let's move on to Slide 8 where I will review our revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. As I just mentioned, revenue growth was 5.2% for the total company, which included about 50 basis points of growth due to an early flu season. Pricing erosion was about 70 basis points, which is slightly better than our full year estimate of about 100 basis points.","BD Medical's first quarter revenues increased 5.1%. The growth in this segment was primarily driven by Diabetes Care at 9.1%. This reflects continued strong sales of pen needles, which include our Nano and PentaPoint products. We also saw benefit from a favorable comparison [ph] to the prior year, which was negatively impacted by softer international sales.","Our Medical Surgical growth was 3.9%, led by emerging markets and international Safety sales including our PhaSeal product. Pharmaceutical Systems growth was 4% in the quarter. As we mentioned earlier, we recently closed on SSI at the end of December, and that will be reported within the Pharmaceutical Systems unit going forward.","BD Diagnostics first quarter revenues increased 6.1%. The segment's growth was primarily driven by international expansion, a favorable comparison to the prior year period in the Preanalytical Systems unit and an early flu season.","BD Biosciences revenue growth was 3.3% versus the prior year period due to solid instrument placements in the U.S. and from a favorable comparison to the last year. The prior year period was negatively impacted by reduced U.S. research funding and lower demand for high-end instruments. Overall, we still see uncertainty in this segment with the government continuing to work through NIH funding specifics for the fiscal year. We remain cautious about near-term growth expectations for this segment.","Moving to Slide 9, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter. Overall, we saw stability in the U.S. and continued strength in international sales. BD's reported U.S. revenues increased 3% versus the prior year. Growth in our Medical segment was 2.6%. Growth in the Diagnostic segments was 2.9%, and U.S. Biosciences growth was about 5.3%. International revenues grew 7% with strong growth coming from Medical and Diagnostics segments. On a currency-neutral basis, the Medical segment grew 7.1%, Diagnostics grew 9.4%, and Biosciences grew 2.4%. BD Biosciences international growth was lower than historical averages due to ordering patterns in certain geographies. We saw strong growth in emerging markets across all 3 segments, while the Medical and Diagnostics segments also benefited from strong sales of safety-engineered products.","Moving to global Safety on Slide 10. Currency-neutral sales increased 5.9% and grew to $511 million in the quarter. Revenues in the U.S. were about flat. International sales grew 14.3% on a currency-neutral basis, with Western Europe and emerging markets both growing double digits. Medical Safety sales grew 6%, which benefited from our PhaSeal product. Diagnostics growth was 5.7%, driven by a range of safety-engineered products.","On Slide 11, I will review our revenue growth in the first quarter. Our reported growth rate increased 3.7%. Performance contributed 5.2% [indiscernible] by 1.5% of unfavorable currency translation. Acquisitions contributed about 10 basis points of growth.","Moving to Slide 12. We experienced a 210 basis point expansion in gross margin versus the prior year. Gross profit improvement was primarily driven by our ReLoCo programs and favorable raw material pricing. In addition, gross profit was benefited by some onetime items that we do not expect to repeat in the remainder of the year. These items include a larger-than-expected favorable foreign currency translation, as well as certain continuous improvement initiatives. We expect gross margins to be within our full year guidance range that we provided in November, which is between 51.5% and 51.7%.","Slide 13 recaps the first quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. As I just mentioned, first quarter revenue growth increased by 5.2%, and gross profit increased by 210 basis points.","Moving down the income statement, SSG&A increased about 4%, primarily due to increased investments in emerging markets, acquisitions and EVEREST spending. R&D increased 5.5%, which is in line with our expectations. Our operating income increased 13.6% due to solid revenue growth and improved gross margin profile and SSG growing slower than sales.","Our tax rate was higher in the quarter versus the prior year primarily due to some discrete tax expenses within the quarter. In addition, there were some onetime benefits in the prior year period. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be in line with the previous guidance range of 24.3% to 24.5%. This range accounts for the reenactment of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. These items resulted in earnings per share of $1.35, which is nearly a 16% increase versus the prior year.","Turning to Slide 14. Based on our first quarter results, we are raising the bottom end of our previously communicated guidance range for revenue and EPS growth. On a reported basis, given the strength of the euro, we are accelerating the top end of our reported guidance range by 100 basis points and EPS by 150 basis points. This assumes a euro exchange rate of $1.32 for the rest of the year. All other P&L guidance components remain unchanged from what we provided on our year-end call. I will speak to the slide on a currency-neutral basis.","In this revised outlook, which contemplates a stable macroeconomic environment, we now expect revenue growth of about 4% to 4.5%, which is broadly in line with our view of underlying growth for the first quarter. Within the segments, we expect both the Medical and Diagnostics segments to grow between 4% to 5% for the year. With the recent improvement in Biosciences sales, we now expect revenue growth of 1% to 2% for fiscal year 2013. This assumes about a 3% reduction in the NIH budget. If the budget cut is furthered, we expect growth to be more [indiscernible] original guidance of about 1%. We are raising the bottom end of our EPS guidance range to 7.5% to 8%. Excluding the medical device tax, we expect currency-neutral EPS to grow 10.5% to 11%. This contemplates 50 basis points of operating margin expansion.","I would like to provide a little bit more color on our expectations for the second quarter. We expect second quarter revenues to grow about 4% versus 5.2% in the first quarter. At this time, the second quarter is not expected to benefit materially from flu sales. In addition, the second quarter revenue growth will also be unfavorably impacted by the timing of orders in our Pharmaceutical Systems unit.","Also, as we've been talking about for some time now, we will have the negative impact of the medical device tax in the second quarter along with some increases in SSG&A due to timing. Due to the items I just mentioned, we expect earnings per share for the second quarter to be at or slightly below our first quarter earnings per share of $1.35.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide a more detailed update on our performance in emerging markets and progress against our key initiatives.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thanks, Suky. Moving on to Slide 16, we continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, which accounted for approximately 24% of our total revenues in the first quarter. Emerging market revenues grew 12.7% currency neutral over the prior year. We had been making significant incremental investments in emerging markets, which have sustained our strong growth and have delivered a rapid payback. We saw double-digit growth in a number of key markets, with China growing at about 24% currency neutral. We are very pleased with Safety revenue growth in emerging markets, which was up about 20% over the prior year.","Now moving on to Slide 17, we see the program and product launches in our Medical and Biosciences segments. As I mentioned earlier, we recently closed on our acquisition of SSI. This enhances the safety offering in our Medical segment.","In Biosciences segment, we have 2 [ph] analyzers for CD4 [ph] testing, which we have been talking about for some time now. We expect our FACSPresto analyzer to launch at the end of fiscal year 2014. Our FACSClearCount analyzer launch timing has been restated due to other investment priorities. We now expect this to launch in fiscal year 2015.","On Slide 18, you will see the various product launches in Diagnostics. This past quarter, we were approved for the RSV test on our Veritor point-of-care device. So far, we have placed several thousand Veritor devices and, given the early flu season this year, we experienced accelerated demand for this product.","On the MAX platform, we currently have over 15 assays in our pipeline in the areas of health care-associated infections, STDs, women's health, enteric and respiratory infections and cancer. We've built up a nice pipeline of orders and expect sales to ramp up in the latter part of our fiscal year. Of course, we will continue to update you as we make progress on our pipeline initiatives.","On Slide 19, before we open the call to questions, I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our discussion today. First, we're pleased with our solid start to fiscal year 2013. We continued delivering on our commitment of improved performance. Second, as we're starting to see notable results across the P&L as a result of our investment cycle, we're experiencing solid revenue growth, driving margin expansion and delivering a higher quality of earnings. Third, we will continue to look for strategic acquisitions and continue our investments in R&D, new products and emerging markets, as well as our operating efficiency programs. Finally, we're positive about our outlook for the balance of this fiscal year, and we are committed to delivering 4% to 4.5% currency-neutral revenue growth and about 10.5% to 11% EPS growth, excluding the device tax and impact of foreign currency.","Through the hard work and dedication of everyone here at BD, we're continuing to deliver value to our customers and shareholders worldwide. Thank you, and we'll now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted just to see if you could help us parse through some of the moving pieces here in the first quarter, both on the revenue line and through the P&L. I know in your prepared remarks, Suky, you thought that the flu added, I think you said about 50 basis points to growth this quarter. But as you look across the businesses, there do appear to be a few trends here that look more sustainable than what you're suggesting, most notably the churn in Biosciences. The comps there remain easy and get easier throughout the year. BD MAX is obviously in its early stages. It continues to ramp up. And then you are still seeing a positive return on the emerging markets piece. So maybe if you could tick through those on the top line about why those wouldn't continue through the balance of the year because it doesn't look like it's reflected in your guidance. And then on the P&L, you referenced currency, the onetime item this quarter. But if you look how things progressed throughout the year, it actually looks like currency turns into a tailwind as we pace through the rest of fiscal '13. And that sounds like it would actually be an increasing benefit. So maybe you can just help us with those factors.","Suketu Upadhyay","Sure. So from a top line perspective, we did see a very good quarter, and we saw some, what I'll consider, durable gains in some of our businesses. We're seeing some very strong underlying growth in emerging markets, in Safety sales, and it's quite good to see a return to growth in U.S. Biosciences. But as we did mention, we did benefit from about 50 basis points of an early flu season. That flu season and those level of sales were contemplated in our full year guidance. We expected those to happen in the second quarter, and they actually came through in the first quarter. So that was probably one of the biggest moving pieces as to why we think our top line will moderate going forward. Also in the first quarter, we benefited from what we'll consider very easy comparisons to the first quarter of last year. So once you neutralize those 2 items, we had a small amount of acquisition growth in the quarter, we think we're somewhere in that 4% to 4.5%, which is the top end of our range that we previously provided. That's giving us the confidence. So if you think about our full year guidance last year, 3.5% to 4.5%, we reserved the bottom end for some macroeconomic uncertainties. Those uncertainties are still out there, but again, the fundamentals and underlying business give us the confidence to raise the bottom end.","Vincent A. Forlenza","David, in the -- so I agree with everything that Suky said, and a lot of things did go well within the quarter. And we are seeing strong underlying business performance in emerging markets, in Safety. Biosciences, we are assuming some degradation in the budget, maybe a 3% impact or so. So we have -- we did see a nice return with customers buying higher-end instruments. We're a little conservative maybe there in terms of go forward. We'll have to see actually what happens in Biosciences. The other thing that I'd just point out to you on this quarter was that in Diagnostics, we had a very good quarter for PAS, the specimen collection business. The impact of MAX is really going to be felt more in the second half of the year because those are reagent rentals and we have to get customers up and going, and we're just really now starting to ship against a sizable pipeline. So it was more PAS in the quarter than it was Diagnostics, though other elements of Diagnostics went very well, too. So we are encouraged. It's still early in the year, though.","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. And on your question, David, around foreign currency, you're correct. We do see a tailwind versus our previous assumption and primarily around the euro. So previously we guided at a full year rate of about $1.27. We've now got an assumption of about $1.32, which translates to $1.33 for the remaining 3 quarters. This translates to about a 4% benefit. So when you take that against the top line, it's worth about $80 million, and that's completely reflected in our new reported growth acceleration of about 100 basis points on the top line and 150 on EPS. There's some moving parts in other parts of foreign currency, the yen is weakening, but those unfavorable impacts are being offset by strengthening across the peso, rupee and a few other smaller currencies. So really it's about the euro, and as I said, we've baked that into our reported guidance going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could maybe -- you'd talk about BD MAX and maybe just give us a little bit more color, just kind of how things are progressing and to what extent you expect that to contribute just to Diagnostics for the year.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure, Tom will talk to that.","Tom Polen","Yes. This is Tom Polen. So we are continuing -- as Vince mentioned, we're continuing to be pleased with early customer excitement and demand around the BD MAX. We have built a backlog of orders and are shipping against that, as Vince mentioned. Also, as he said, we do expect it to take several quarters. We're into the latter part of this year to see that ramp, and that remains part of our outlook for the balance of this year but remain very positive on MAX and continue to get that feedback from our customers.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Tom, how do you feel about the pipeline maybe as well?","Tom Polen","Yes, pipeline...","Vincent A. Forlenza","In terms of assays.","Tom Polen","Sure. Pipeline continues to progress as we've communicated previously. Of course, we do remain very focused on menu expansion, and our third IVD assay in the U.S., Cdiff, remains under FDA review, and we're still expecting a launch on that later this quarter, Q2.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Perfect. And then, Vince, I guess just a big picture question for you. Any changes in terms of how you guys are looking at M&A for the outlook for the year?","Vincent A. Forlenza","No, we're still really focused on doing plug-in acquisitions. I think that we're getting more confident as we do more of them, and we continue to improve our process. We're pleased with the progress of the deals that are now annualized into our base, and we feel pretty good about the ones that are -- the new ones that we did, the last 3. So we're staying on that strategy for the time being.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just maybe one quick financial question for Suky, maybe a quick follow-up for Tom. Suky, just first of all, gross margins, it was the strongest quarter in maybe 3 or 4 years. I appreciate there was an FX tailwind there, but you were sort of willing to say that you're comfortable with the upper end of constant-currency guidance. I wonder if you can talk about the sustainability of margin improvement, both gross and operating. And is it too early in the year to get comfortable with sort of the upper end of your operating expansion comfort for fiscal '13?","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes, so great question, David. So first, from a gross margin perspective, it's not uncommon in our business to see lumpiness throughout the year. In fact, if you look back at 2012, between the high and low point on gross margin, there's about a 150 basis point spread. So we think we're at the high point for the year on gross margin. We do expect it to normalize for the remainder of the year. We do think we're confidently at the upper end of that gross profit range that we provided, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of about 50 to -- excuse me, 40 to 50 basis points of gross margin improvement year-over-year. Again, we're going to see some down quarters coming off of this quarter because of some onetime benefits. From an operating margin perspective, again, as we talked about in November, our 50 basis points of underlying growth is primarily driven by gross margin. So as I talked about gross margin, you could basically translate that to operating income.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Perfect. Very helpful. And then, Tom, you talked a lot about the Diagnostic pipeline, but I don't think there's been a dramatic amount of sizing commentary. And I think about a couple of specific products. Cdiff, obviously in the U.S., but I think people really haven't pushed you on international. The women's health diagnostic franchise really starts to come together heading into next year. So could you just give us a sense of, if you think about Cdiff or the women's health diagnostic franchise in '14, what type of size opportunity here do you think you're chasing?","Tom Polen","Yes, this is Tom Polen. We have not commented specifically on the size internationally versus U.S. on that. What I would comment perhaps on the women's health is, as we've shared, our Viper LT platform is scheduled to launch x U.S. at the very end of this fiscal year. That does remain on track. We actually have started to install the first Viper LTs x U.S. as part of our clinical trial. That clinical trial is actually enrolling patients, running samples right now, preparing for the launch of HPV x U.S. So we do recognize that, with that launch of our HPV at the end of the year, combined with the launch of our Totalys front-end automation system at the -- on the psychology side of women's health, we will be in a very strong position, we believe, going into FY '14 around the women's [ph] portfolio. In terms of the U.S., Cdiff [indiscernible] does [ph]. Maybe just the only thing I would comment on is we do believe that continues to remain an overall attractive market. It's growing strong double digits as a market overall and remains relatively still underconverted from EIA to molecular, right? Still under 25% of the market is converted to molecular, and so we see that having a positive growth outlook going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Wood with Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So Vince or Suky, obviously, the buyback in the first quarter well ahead of the $500 million pace for the year. Just like your perspective on what's the -- what holds back a greater amount of buyback this year? Is it M&A, pipeline? Or is it foreign cash repatriation? Just give us a sense of how you meter in the capital deployment the next couple of quarters.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So Suky will take that question, but it's really a balance of all those things. But Suky?","Suketu Upadhyay","That's right. So we're still committed to the $500 million of share repurchases for the full year. As Vince quite rightly said, it's a balance. We try to take into consideration our U.S., x U.S. cash position but also maintain enough flexibility to take advantage of strategic M&A, other investments, et cetera.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I want to just get a little more detail from Tom on the Diagnostics side. Last quarter, there was some weakness in the women's health side. It looks like it didn't take place this quarter. So Tom, can you just give us more detail on TriPath, molecular *GeneOhm and just give us some underlying trends there?","Tom Polen","Sure. Sure, Amit. This is Tom Polen. Specific on molecular and women's health, so molecular was flat to slightly positive growth in the quarter driven by STD testing. That's a combination of our STD business, GeneOhm and MAX that I just commented on. If you think about women's health, women's health was down in the low single digits this past quarter driven by negative U.S. growth, which was partially offset by continued strong double-digit growth internationally. And that's been a trend that we've reported for the last several quarters. The extension of Pap intervals in the U.S. really driving that decline in the U.S. market while expanding access to cervical cancer screening and conversion from conventional to LBC internationally is driving that double-digit growth in the rest of world.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just to follow up on the Biosciences, any other color you can provide, Vince, on instrument demand, why you saw that pick up in the quarter?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, we think that -- and Bill can comment further on this. What happened was that customers finally could not postpone their research any longer and that they had money set aside. They kind of came to terms with what their staffing was going to be and started to spend. And maybe you're getting more comfortable about the outlook from the -- where sequestration was going to be and kind of boxing that in. And Bill, I think maybe on the pharma side, too, we saw some good performance. Maybe you want to comment on that.","William A. Kozy","Sure. The impact, the favorable impact, which Vince referenced earlier, was really in the high end analyzer. We had Aria placements and LSR II placements perk up a little bit in the quarter. And then as we had, I think, projected prior, continued strong growth coming out of Accuri. So the combination of those high-end sorters, analyzers and Accuri moved our instrument growth back to a little bit healthier level than we experienced at any time in FY '12.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes, and it really was U.S. as well, too.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Kim here. Question on EU Safety. That was a strong number in the quarter. I think you said up double digits. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in Europe in terms of health care providers starting to come into compliance with Safety mandates?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So yes, we can, and really, we're seeing the pickup more in Northern Europe than Southern Europe at this point in time. So we were about 10% or so in Western Europe, not driven by Southern but by the Northern piece. So they're moving on the law, is basically what happens.","Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Yes. And remind me the deadline on that? Isn't it by the end of this fiscal year that they're supposed to be...","Vincent A. Forlenza","It was May. It's May.","Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","May. Okay, okay. And just a follow-up on the gross margin. I know we've had a couple of questions on that this morning, but in terms of the FX benefit in the quarter to your gross margin, is it right, I'm remembering from past years that oftentimes you'll see almost a timing benefit as you mark your hedges to market in a given quarter? So that, did we see some of that here in the quarter? And so that would be, I guess, the reason why, even though FX going forward remains more favorable for you guys, you're not looking for as much of it on the gross margin line?","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes, that's exactly it. It has to do -- it's multivariable, very complex but has to do with where -- what region product has produced that, when it's produced, what rate it's used opposite, when it goes into inventory and is released in an inventory and what region it comes out and what FX rate it comes out at. So that's one of the reasons that's driving the favorable FX in the quarter. Again, we expect that to neutralize for the full year. If that assumption changes, we'll update you throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. Maybe first on the U.S. Safety. Vince, it's -- if I'm looking at it correctly, U.S. Safety flat, one of the weaker quarters we've seen in some time. Just help us understand what the drivers were there. Maybe as part of that, you could talk about -- give us a little more color on the significance or potential significance of the Safety Syringe acquisition, how it's going to contribute and the timing of products, et cetera.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure, I'll let Bill talk to both of those, but really, U.S. Safety has been, I think, low single digits for a while. So this is not really a big change in U.S. Safety characteristics. Of course, we did have PhaSeal come into the product mix, but when you pull that out, it's been pretty flat single digit. Bill, you want to talk to SSI?","William A. Kozy","Sure. SSI -- this is Bill Kozy, Rick. SSI pulls us into this passive safety syringe market, particularly focused on the prefill side, and gives us a chance to really expand our product array with our -- particularly our big pharma customers, who are showing a little increased interest in safety platforms going forward. So you're familiar with the existing product that we had, which was not passive. This rounds us out on the other side and gets us into that new space. And we've got a reasonable amount of strategic interest on our part but as well as our big pharma customers. So we're enthused about bringing that into the BD portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Talk about [ph] guidance. Guidance.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And when do you think you're going to see some products there, Bill, approved?","William A. Kozy","No, those products are already on the market. That is not a start-up scenario. It's a small revenue-based business but already with a customer base and a pipeline of potential new customers, which we're inheriting and pursuing.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. One other quick one on China, up 24%, Vince, obviously outstanding. Just maybe update us on where you are with your investments and buildout there. What do you -- what's your focus over the next 12 months or so? And I assume you -- we can expect that 20% plus kind of growth to continue.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So I like your [ph] editorial comment. But listen, we're very pleased with the results there, and it's across the board, across Medical. It's across PAS. It's Diagnostics, and Biosciences is doing well. So we built the basic infrastructure. We're now moving into what I would call mid-tier markets in China, expanding our [indiscernible] and our distribution partnerships. So I think we've built a strong foundation. We do think that there is a lot of runway to go in China, and we continue to see the government investing even as the economy slows down somewhat. So we are encouraged, and we think we've built a strong organization.","Suketu Upadhyay","Rick, just one thing to close out on the Safety piece around the U.S. We did see a soft quarter, but for the full year, we expect to be somewhere in about the 4% to 5% range in the U.S. and as Bill mentioned, primarily driven by the SSI acquisition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Last quarter, I think you guys had talked about pricing in general and wanting to be prudent there. But this quarter, you saw it a little bit better, down I think you said 70 basis points versus kind of the 100 you guys were expecting. Is there anything that -- well, first of all, why is -- why are you expecting still down 100 basis points? Are there things there that are going to flow through in back half of the year there? And kind of then going to the gross margin question again. If pricing is a little bit better, it would seem that there's potential upside on the gross margin side.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So pricing was a little bit better in the first quarter. You're right. We haven't gone back and changed the guidance on pricing yet. We're still watching Europe, in particular, to see what will happen there. So we'll revisit it at the end of the second quarter, but you're right. We're off to a little better start than we thought.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Is there any particular area where you're seeing price benefit that you didn't expect?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Are there areas where we're seeing price benefits? We didn't see the price decreases that we thought we might see, not -- it's not a pricing increase so much.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then a quick follow-up for Tom just on the Cdiff delays. Is there anything to read into that? Or is that just a normal FDA dialogue? Are they looking for additional data or anything on that?","Tom Polen","Brian, this is Tom. Nothing unusual, just normal process, and we have provided any additional information and our active discussion with them, but we'd consider this routine.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So Vince, can you maybe -- you mentioned the strength in Preanalytical. Can you maybe just talk on the Diagnostics? I mean maybe you can just talk a little bit about what thought drove that. And maybe -- I haven't really heard any comments, kind of just your latest thoughts on just general utilization trends in more of the developed markets. And then for Tom, just a quick question, given the strength in flu, what you expect microbiology to grow for the year.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. So 2 pieces on PAS. One is they continue to do, as they have the last couple of quarters, very well in emerging markets. And as health care gets built out, of course, we're starting to see more laboratory testing. And that has accelerated over, I would say, the last 6 months or so. So we feel very good about their international strategy. U.S. was more timing and easier comparison. And we saw this last year where it was a little lumpy in the first half of the year. We're seeing the same thing this year. Part of the reason Suky gave the guidance he gave on the second quarter was, we thought PAS was a little bit hot in the first quarter and that it would normalize. But overall, the business is performing well. So that was that. In terms of utilization, I think we're basically still saying pretty stable, not getting worse. We're continuing to see softness because of this move to a larger interval in the U.S. for the TriPath business. Otherwise, I would call it stable. Tom?","Tom Polen","Yes. And this Tom Polen, just following up on your question regarding microbiology growth. So we have not historically commented on outlook on microbiology growth specifically, but what I will say is that we are seeing some favorable growth in that area driven by new products. Specifically, as Vince mentioned earlier, Veritor is off to a very good start. We're now at about 4,000 placements roughly on the Veritor platform. Obviously, that increased base combined with an early flu season has really benefited that launch, specifically. And as we've commented on in the past, our acquisition of KIESTRA and really the -- that solution as it comes to helping our customers improve lab efficiency and deliver faster time to result is also going very well. And we expect continued strong performance in both of those areas through the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. Vince, you mentioned emerging markets continue to do well, and that's been a trend that we've seen over the last couple quarters. It's also -- I think you said in your prepared comments that it's a relatively low-risk investment for you guys, and you're clearly seeing the results. I guess the question, the first question is, is there opportunity to do more in terms of investment than you have been doing? And could we see that begin to perhaps accelerate further over the next year or so? And then secondly, on the Safety deadline of May in Europe, what do you think happens when we approach that date? Do we -- do you really expect the countries to comply with that? And I guess what I'm really asking is, given just the austerity issues, particularly in Southern Europe, could we see actually some countries, Spain, Italy, et cetera, perhaps not fully complying with the deadline?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So it's the latter, which is we think we'll see a continuation of the trend that we're seeing, which is Northern Europe moving ahead, Southern Europe lagging and not moving ahead aggressively in Safety. In terms of emerging markets, we think we have it paced right because, in addition to the fact that we're adding people, there is a very large training component to what we do as we bring on sales force, as we sell value. If we were just going aggressively for share and not really trying to optimize the value of what we're selling, we could probably go faster. And then there's a whole piece of distributor management that we're putting in place. And lastly, very important to us is compliance. And we don't want to get ahead of ourselves from a compliance standpoint and making sure that we really have the organization trained up. Having said all that, if we think there's an opportunity to go faster, because these do pay back in about 12 months or so, 12 to 18 months at the outside, we would certainly look at that.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just sneak in one other one. I think, Suky, you talked about raw materials. How should we -- and the favorable comp. How should we think about raw material costs as you guys think about that going through the year?","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes, sure. So raw materials in the quarter from a GP impact were about 40 bps, and that's primarily if you think about what we were talking about last year, we saw in the first quarter a really big headwind on raw materials. So we're benefiting, one, from underlying improved pricing on raw materials but also partly due to a favorable comp. As we think about the full year, we're looking about 20 basis points of gross margin improvement. We are seeing a slight tick up in crude prices quite recently. But as we've talked about before [indiscernible] anywhere 3- to 9-month lag on how those crude prices translate into resin prices. But overall, the upside that we see in raw materials is included in our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Palmer with CLSA.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Another follow-up here, Vince, on emerging markets. You're obviously seeing a great performance there and with 20% of -- more than 20% of sales, you're at the top of your peer group. So my question is, do you still need to make significant investments going forward to continue that growth trajectory? And maybe putting it another way, at what point do you really get to harvest the bolus of these investments and drive the margins?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So we are getting strong performance on the top line and the bottom line from our investments. If you look at profitability across the company, emerging markets is close to the company average once you normalize for R&D. So as I said, they pay back fairly rapidly, but we believe we're still early on in terms of having coverage across all of the segments that we need to be present in and building up our infrastructure. So it's a rolling thing. What we don't get is aggressive operating income leverage, but we get operating income growth is the way to think about it. Bill, do you want to add anything to that?","William A. Kozy","This is Bill Kozy. The only thing I'd add is that to the investment theme, we have formalized our game plan for R&D investment targeted at emerging markets, and we're just in the start-up mode of placing R&D capabilities in the Asia-Pacific rim. We'll give you some more color on that, but to your good question about how are we thinking about making sure that we can back up that higher growth expectations going forward off a bigger base, this localized R&D competency is something we're enthused about.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","That was very helpful. And if I could just sneak a follow-up in here on Diabetes, very strong quarter. Could you maybe just talk about the underlying dynamics there and how sustainable that growth is?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Bill can talk to that.","William A. Kozy","Sure. We continue to see really strong pen needle demand and think about the strategy in the business focused on a couple of things. Number one, we really had tried and I told a couple of years ago, we're going to roll out a series of 5 major new products that were designed to contribute both on volume capture, but as well as to improve our price. Because of the timing here in the first quarter, you're seeing the benefits of PentaPoint, Nano, Pearl, the safety pen needle, as really the examples really starting to impact that growth rate. We admit that the first quarter was a little bit hot, but we're just comfortable that the new products are allowing us to compete effectively all around the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First off, I guess on Diabetes, I guess kind of building off the last question, another solid performance out of that. We did, of course, learn that LifeScan has recently launched its own pen needles in the U.S. It does kind of mark the first material competitor against you guys domestically. So could you talk a little bit about your response here or perhaps how to best position the portfolio to hold them off?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure, Bill will address that.","William A. Kozy","Sure, this is Bill Kozy. We are aware of the launch and are particularly focused on the U.S. as we understand it at this point in time. So as you would expect us, our sales and marketing plan and our programmatic response to that is in place. As I just mentioned, we feel good about the number of new products that we have launched in the U.S. market and as well as the customer acceptance of those new products. So you'll see us take, I think, an assertive position, of course, to try and defend the competitive position we've gained over the last 5 years and to work with both our diabetes patient, as well as our channel to do the best we can to defend our position.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, got it. And then just one last one for me, just one for Tom on Veritor. Tom, can you give us any estimate? Obviously, the launch is going pretty well here, but can you give us any estimate in terms of perhaps what type of share you've picked up or, given the units out in the field, maybe how we should think about that trending over the next year or so?","Tom Polen","Sure. This is Tom. We don't comment on share specifically, but what I can say, as I mentioned, the -- as you think about Veritor, of the 4,000 roughly placements that we've made to date, the majority of those are going into the physician office, which is a new market for us, right? We've traditionally had rapid tests only CLIA moderately complex for the hospital market. Veritor is a CLIA-waived product, our first ever CLIA_waived product. So a large number of those are new markets for us. The other thing I would say is that the growth that we're getting with Veritor today is driven primarily by flu, as Vince mentioned. We recently, we've launched RSV. We do have Strep A under active FDA review right now, and we are expecting that to launch later on in the quarter. In Q2, we expect approval there. Of course, Strep will help provide a bit less seasonality to the product as well as that tends to be a condition which can occur at different times than just flu itself. So overall, we're very pleased with the progress of Veritor and expect continued progress moving forward.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes. So it's a small amount of share because we're right in the beginning of this right now. We're just really starting to ramp up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","This is Eric filling in for Peter. So on the BD Bioscience, I know you had said that customers really couldn't put off purchasing instruments anymore. But have they actually changed their outlook? Has it improved any since maybe 3 months ago?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So I would say there's less uncertainty than there was 3 or 6 months ago, and that -- the head of the NIH has been doing conference calls with the industry, with the customer base, talking about his expectation in terms of how he sees things going forward. So I think that people are beginning to understand what the future is going to look like in terms of funding, not exactly but over a smaller range. And I think that helped the market in terms of moving ahead. And so we'll see if that plays out or not, but that's what I see is different from where we were 6 months ago.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And then on the Diabetes business, do you have any exposure to the Medicare competitive bidding program that's out there now?","Vincent A. Forlenza","No. It's not durable medical supplies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a follow-up on BD MAX. I want to be clear that I understand what you feel the gating factors there are for the launch. And then as we start to see it ramp in the second half, do you view that as a linear ramp? Or are there going to multiple inflection points over time as you add assays or you get critical mass behind the product?","Tom Polen","So Matt, this is Tom Polen. Just to answer your question, we expect there will be -- there are certainly going to be reflection points as we have series of assay launches, right? The launch of any platform like this is highly dependent upon menu expansion, which is an area that we're very, very focused on. So today, we have GBS and MRSA as approved products in the U.S., as I mentioned before. Cdiff is under active FDA review, and then we have a series of assays which are expected to launch in early FY '14, including enteric bacterial assay and GC\/CT Trich assay among those. So we are, as Vince mentioned earlier, shipping now against a nice backlog that we've built. We are seeing positive customer demands and are expecting to see that ramp in the second half of the year.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So the next big event really is Cdiff for us, and that's an important one.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And can I just ask in terms of the year-over-year basis point change in the gross margins, could you parse out each of the factors this quarter that bridge you from last year to this year in terms of the puts and takes on the improvement?","Suketu Upadhyay","Sure. Yes.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure, Suky will do it.","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. So versus the first quarter of 2012, overall 210 basis point increased, 90 [ph] driven by foreign currency. We talked a little bit about that based on Kim's question earlier. So I'll really talk more to the underlying drivers, which were about 120 basis points of improvement year-over-year. So resins, this year, we talked a little bit about, accounted for about 40 of that basis points. ReLoCo, again, we're still firm on $40 million to $50 million of incremental benefit in FY '13. That accounted for about 60 [ph] basis points, and then we had other continuous improvement and other benefits that were worth about 50 basis points. So those are, by and large, the biggest moving pieces. We also had price erosion of about 30 basis points, but again, it's more than offset by some of those more fundamental underlying gains.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So a lot of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to do a couple of housekeeping questions. Realizing that it varies from quarter-to-quarter, what's your expectation for full year net interest income expense?","Suketu Upadhyay","Sure. So interest income expense -- just a minute. Let me...","Vincent A. Forlenza","As we look it up.","Suketu Upadhyay","So interest income, we expect for the full year to be at about $25 million to $30 million. Interest expense, we expect to be somewhere around $130 million to $140 million for the full year.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just to make sure that I got this correctly, on the M&A contribution that you're implying for 2013, it seems to be between 50 and 100 basis points of top line contribution for M&A.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Year.","Suketu Upadhyay","For the year, that's right.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","For the year, yes, yes, yes.","Suketu Upadhyay","All right.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm sorry?","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. 50.","Vincent A. Forlenza","50 for the year.","Suketu Upadhyay","[indiscernible] the quarter, 50 for the year.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Which is the last 3, remember. The others have annualized.","Operator","Your next question","[Audio Gap]","Unknown Analyst","For Suky, I guess my first question is for you. But with that in mind, I guess I have another bridge question. You increased EPS by, I think it's about $0.095 at the midpoint for the year. Could you just bridge how much of that is better than Q1 results, changes in thoughts on FX, increases in expectations for the balance of the year and\/or any other dynamics that came into play in adjusting guidance?","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. So primarily that $0.08 relates wholly to FX on the reported line. So if you think about -- I talked about the euro improvements of the 4% versus our previous guidance. That translates to about $80 million for the full year from a revenue perspective. Internationally, about 25% of that drops to net income. If you take that across our shares, average shares outstanding, you get to about $0.08 for the full year, which is what we've taken our guidance up on the midpoint.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So almost solely FX driven at this point.","Suketu Upadhyay","That's right.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then I guess a high-level Biosciences question. This was clearly the best quarter you guys have had in a while. Over the last several quarters, you've talked about funding challenges as a headwind. I think that being said, it's fair to say you guys performed a bit worse than a lot of the bioscience peers for several quarters again. Last year, you divested Labware. You put up a really great quarter. So it seems like it's a good time to ask, how are you feeling about your competitive positioning? And specifically, as you think about your portfolio, is it where it needs to be right now? And how important a role would M&A potentially play in augmenting this portfolio versus really enhancing organic efforts to drive growth?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So in terms of Biosciences and competitive position, we feel very good about the core business and its competitive position. I think we feel better about it than we did 6 months ago now, with the acquisition of Sirigen and the technology and product array that, that brings in the reagent space. So we feel very good about the core flow business. If I look at BD AB, which is a small piece of it, it's still very embryonic for us. And it's under $100 million. It's making progress. It has a long way to go. So still much to do in that piece. You would expect that, as across the entire company, we'll continue to look for plug-in acquisitions. We don't feel the need to do something real large in that space. We think we have adjacencies that we can move into and build out very nicely in the bioscience space as funding comes back into this space. And we think that has to happen over the long run.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Newitter with Leerink Swann.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just maybe on emerging markets in China. I know we've touched upon it a little bit. Clearly, you guys have been a little bit earlier than your peers, and you have a head start there. But just we've been hearing about a number of companies within the sector targeting the mid-tier. And I was just wondering if you could talk about your competitive advantages there, what dynamics you're seeing play out as companies get more aggressive on that focus segment of the market.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So the competitive advantage is going to be different by product area. I'll let Bill comment on what we're doing in the Medical side of things [indiscernible] nice [indiscernible] please start there, and we can talk about the rest of it in a bit [ph] .","William A. Kozy","Sure. Just a couple of quick ones. We, right now, have got a little over 500 people trained and in the field, and we think that's one source of potential advantage. Number two, we have ramped up our Medical production, making products in China for China. We think that's another source of advantage. We've significantly expanded our capabilities to sell the Diagnostics products, and I may ask Tom to talk about that in just a second. And we've done the exact same thing down the Biosciences side. So we're at a stage where we've got sales competence across all 3 segments. We've got reasonable scale established in the Tier 1 market. And as we've historically done, we try and get that capability established before we move into the more challenging segments, which is the reason we're now pushing the button to move to the next tier. We think we're at a stage both in field sales, product supply and, by the way, internal infrastructure in China to be able to go after that segment in a very definitive way. Let me ask Tom to comment on the Diagnostics.","Tom Polen","I would just echo Bill's -- this is Tom -- echo Bill's comments. We have made some significant investments in channel and Diagnostics really over the last 24 months. The other thing is I think that as we look at really offering our solutions in China and other emerging markets, really making sure that we're very careful on what products we are focused on and are launching there. So for example, for us, we recognize that emerging drug resistance is an important issue to the health care system in China, and we're specifically focused on launching our products that help combat that issue in those markets. So I would say it's -- that's building relationships with clinicians and key opinion leaders and experts in very deep ways, as we're combating issues which are very important to them that make us a partner not only now but give it some legs going forward as other competitors may enter the space.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Just to add to that, in addition to the [indiscernible] also focuses that were just mentioned, we do a lot of work on clinical knowledge transfer and training of our customer base. And in fact, we have signed 3 different memorandum of understanding with the Chinese government on infection control. So this is not just about product for us. This is about bringing knowledge. And lastly, we've had a very nice innovation story going wrapped into that knowledge transfer as we develop products on the Medical side, in particular in infusion therapy, for the Chinese market. And as Bill mentioned, not only were they made for that marketplace, but they're produced there. So we have an excellent cost base. So we feel pretty good about our position, and we're gaining share.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just on the flu, you had mentioned that the timing was a little different. I just wanted to double check on that, that you had anticipated, I guess, previously about a 50 basis point impact. I guess it sounded like it was more of a 2Q event versus 1Q?","Vincent A. Forlenza","That's right. We expected it in Q2. It came more in Q1, which is a little unusual. Mostly, it comes in Q2. So you hit the nail on the head.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you maybe just break out where you saw that benefit? How much of it was within Medical relative to Diagnostic?","Vincent A. Forlenza","We really -- there's no way for us to actually quantify that, Kristen, because it's just general demand as people going into hospitals. The primary benefit, of course, we see in Diagnostics. We see it in the flu testing categories, and we do see it somewhat in BACTEC sales, bottle sales, because once you see the elderly in the hospital, there will be other infections and those sorts of things that happen along with it. So it's more in Diagnostics than any other place [ph] .","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, I think you had mentioned that ReLoCo savings are on track to be around $40 million to $50 million for the year. Is EVEREST spending still tracking, I guess, in line with your expectations? And should we look at that as kind of plateau-ing this year and perhaps going down next year? Or how should we just frame that?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So EVEREST for the year, we expect to be tracking along with our guidance. And Suky?","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. So we talked about $10 million increase year-over-year into 2013, and as we've said, this will be the plateau. We don't expect a major tailwind into '14 as the depreciation then kicks in. And then you're absolutely right, Kristen. On ReLoCo, it's $40 million to $50 million. That's the incremental portion year-over-year. So I just wanted to make sure that, that was clear as well.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes. It's right on target.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And emerging market investment still around $40 million this year as well?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Emerging markets, yes.","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes, correct.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes, you got it.","Operator","That was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for any closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Thank you for your participation on our call this morning. We had strong business and product performance along with excellent performance in emerging markets. We are very happy to see the ReLoCo benefits really kicking in from a cost-reduction standpoint and our efficiency programs moving forward. And lastly, we're continuing on the strategy of our plug-in acquisitions and deploying our capital, and we really look forward to updating you on the year next quarter. So thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, this does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."],"3480":["Becton, Dickinson & Co.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through May 12, 2016, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at 800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 83710101.","I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment. Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique N. Dolecki - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our second fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A section of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release including the financial schedule is posted on the bd.com website.","As a reminder, until we annualize the acquisition of CareFusion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we will speak to our revenue results on a comparable currency-neutral basis, which includes BD and CareFusion in the current and prior year periods. We believe this provides additional visibility into the new BD.","The comparable current period revenues are adjusted to exclude a small impact related to a purchase accounting adjustment to record CareFusion's deferred revenues at fair value as of the acquisition date.","In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance.","Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedule, in our press release or the Appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical Segment and Linda Tharby, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences Segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As we stated in our press release, we are very pleased with our second quarter growth profile. Our results this quarter highlight our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio, with both segments contributing to revenue growth. We continue to drive strong underlying margin expansion through the achievement of operational efficiencies and continuous improvements, coupled with the positive impact of cost synergies.","As many of you already know, in March, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of the closing of CareFusion, and we are extremely proud of our achievements over the past year. We have been acutely focused on the integration and a significant amount of work driven by the integration teams across the businesses.","In terms of talent retention, we have a strong team that's in place that's comprised of both legacy CareFusion and legacy BD associates. They've been helping drive the company to our next phase of growth as a combined entity. In terms of our customers, we are becoming increasingly more relevant, as they're looking for providers that can really help them improve the quality, efficiency and safety of processes. We have made good progress on this front 12 months post close and feedback from our customers has been extremely positive.","Also, we have been actively working to create new growth opportunities for CareFusion products and expanding their global reach by leveraging BD's global infrastructure. We are well into the registration process with dozens of products across multiple geographies. I will provide more details on this later in the presentation.","Lastly, we are seeing strong productivity as we are over-delivering on our initial cost synergy capture commitments. As you already know, we've increased our total cost synergy target by about $100 million over the deal's horizon. We are clearly advancing our strategy to improve medication management. The value we bring to customers around the world has become increasingly evident as we make progress integrating these two great companies.","We're also pleased to inform you that the annual strategic review of our portfolio is now complete. In March, we announced BD and Apax Partners, a private equity firm, will form a joint venture with Respiratory Solutions business. Apax will establish and stand up a newco, enabling more strategic focus and investment to build a leading global respiratory company.","And more recently, we announced the divestiture of our vertebral augmentation solutions business. This product line was not aligned with our strategy and we believe it can see more robust investment in growth under a different owner. The completion of our current strategic review process enables the company to remain focused on the areas, we believe, are high-growth and aligned with our core capabilities.","In addition, during our last call, we let you know about our intent to reinvest the savings from the suspension of the medical device tax that went into effect in January. Since that time, we have already allocated increased R&D dollars to highly strategic initiatives. Not only will this help to fund \u2013 drive future growth for the company, but it will also enable better outcomes for our customers and their patients.","Looking forward to the total year, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our fiscal 2016 currency-neutral revenue and EPS guidance. We are also increasing our adjusted guidance to reflect lower currency headwinds due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and other currencies.","Moving to slide five, I will review our second quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company revenues grew 5.3% or 5.2% on a combined organic basis. Adjusted EPS of $2.18 was ahead of our expectations, as the quarter benefited in part from some timing within the year.","Now, I'd like to turn things over to Chris, for a more detailed discussion of our second quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to a very solid second quarter results. Total second quarter revenues of approximately $3.1 billion grew 5.3% on a comparable basis or 5.2% on a combined organic basis. This was slightly ahead of our expectations as the quarter benefited by about 50 basis points from the timing of revenues which occurred earlier than expected. I'll discuss this as I take you through the business results.","BD Medical's second quarter revenues increased 6.1%, reflecting solid growth across the segment. Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 4%, which reflects strength in infusion therapy, safety engineered products and infection prevention.","Medication Management Solutions revenues grew 6%, driven by strong dispensing capital installation. ES demand was strong in the quarter driven by several large customer conversions, and we saw a positive impact from our efforts to simplify the installation process. We also saw solid growth in the infusion business where we continue to expand our leadership position.","Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.6%, driven by pen needles and syringes. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 11% reflects the strong growth in SAIS. Performance in this business also reflected the favorable timing of customer orders that occurred one quarter earlier than we initially anticipated. Respiratory Solutions revenues increased 10.9%, reflecting the timing of capital placements, which similarly benefited the quarter, as the placements were expected to occur later in the fiscal year.","BD Life Sciences' second quarter revenues increased 3.4%, driven by solid growth in pre-analytical systems and diagnostic systems units. Preanalytical Systems growth of 5.7% was driven by safety engineered products in the U.S. and solid growth in Europe and emerging markets. Diagnostic Systems growth of 4.6% was a result of strong growth in core microbiology, including ID\/AST and BD MAX assays. Growth was also aided in part by an increase in flu activity in the U.S. While the flu season is still mild in comparison to the prior year, the timing of the late flu season had a positive benefit year-over-year in the quarter of 10 basis points.","Biosciences revenues were about flat when compared with last year's second quarter. Strong double-digit growth in the U.S. was driven by continued increased demand for high-parameter instruments and growth in the research reagents. This was offset by a 7% decline in Europe due to a difficult comparison related to timing of orders in the prior year. In addition, growth was negatively impacted by clinical tender delays in Africa associated with our HIV monitoring business related to the World Health Organization guidelines.","Moving to slide eight, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the second quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. revenues increased 5.7%. This was primarily driven by strength in Medication Management Solutions, Medication and Procedural Solutions, Biosciences and Diagnostics and was aided in part by the aforementioned timing of revenues.","BD Medical's performance reflects strong dispensing capital installations and solid growth in the infusion business, as well as strength in infection prevention and interventional specialties.","BD Life Sciences growth reflects continued strong performance in the Biosciences business, driven by demand for high-parameter research instruments and reagent sales. Diagnostic Systems had strong growth in microbiology, including Kiestra and blood culture, BD MAX, as well as the benefit from the increase in flu activity during the quarter.","Moving onto international, revenues grew 4.8%. This is below our normal growth rate and primarily reflects the aforementioned clinical tender delays in Africa. I'll provide more details on this in a moment.","The Medical segment grew 6.9%. This reflects solid performance in Medication and Procedural Solutions, driven by sales of safety engineered products, particularly in China, and strong dispensing installations in Medication Management Solutions. Growth was aided in part by the aforementioned timing of customer ordering patterns and capital placements.","The Life Sciences segment grew 1.4%. This reflects strong growth in Preanalytical Systems in Western Europe and Asia Pacific, and strong growth in Western Europe and Latin America in Diagnostic Systems driven by core microbiology. This was partially offset by the aforementioned tender delays in Africa and a difficult comparison in Europe in Biosciences.","On slide nine, emerging market revenues grew 5.1% currency-neutral, with developed markets growing 5.3%. The second quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects solid growth in China and Latin America, partially offset by a decline in EMEA. China growth for the second quarter was 9.4%.","Double-digit revenue growth in our Medical segment was driven by continued strong demand for consumables across all of our businesses in the segment. Within our Life Sciences segment, strength in Preanalytical Systems was offset by the slowdown of capital spending in Diagnostic Systems as communicated on our call last quarter.","For the total year, we continue to expect China to grow in the low double-digit range.","We now expect total emerging markets to grow in the high single-digit range compared to our previous guidance of 9% to 10% growth. This is offset by stronger performance in developed markets growing between 4% and 4.5% for the second half of the year.","Our revised guidance for emerging markets reflects the aforementioned impact in Africa to our Biosciences unit from the WHO guidelines. In addition, since we last provided guidance in February, the government of Saudi Arabia announced the new austerity measures, which affect the healthcare industry. This has begun to impact our business in that particular region and we saw a small impact in the second quarter.","We view the situation in Saudi Arabia as temporary, though the timing of reversal may not occur within this fiscal year. Our new guidance range contemplates emerging markets growing between 10% and 12% for the second half of the year.","Moving to global safety on slide 10, currency-neutral sales increased 6.7%. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 4.5% and international sales also grew 9.9% currency-neutral, with continued strength in Europe, as compliance with safety legislation continues. Safety revenues grew 15.6% in emerging markets. Medical safety sales grew 8%, primarily driven by safety catheters. Life Sciences safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4.6% in the quarter.","Slide 11 recaps the second quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 5.3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Pricing was slightly positive in the quarter.","Moving down the P&L, I will focus on the comparable basis figures, which include CareFusion's results from the prior year, in order to give a better indication of our performance. Gross profit improved by 7.9%. I'll provide more color on gross profit on the next slide when we look at the underlying performance and the impact of currency.","SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.5%. We are very pleased with the leverage we're getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture.","R&D as a percentage of revenue was 5.9%. Our expenditures in the quarter were slightly lower than our full year expectation of 6% to 6.5% of revenues due to the timing of spending. We continue to invest in new products and innovation and expect to further reinvest the benefit from the medical device tax suspension in the back half of the year.","Operating income grew 24.8% reflecting strong P&L leverage. In addition, as we've previously discussed, there were a number of items that negatively impacted operating margin in the prior year in the CareFusion business. I'll address the underlying growth and operating profit in more detail on the next slide.","Our tax rate declined 70 basis points to 20.6%, below our full year expectation of 21% to 22% as the quarter included some timing benefits. As Vince discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $2.18 which is a 44.7% increase versus the prior year. This reflects our solid growth profile and strong underlying margin expansion.","In addition, growth benefited from the timing of revenues earlier in the year than expected as well as timing within the year related to R&D expenditures and tax as we just discussed.","Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the second quarter presented on a comparable basis. Strong gross profit margin performance of 170 basis points was primarily driven by robust operational performance and continuous improvement initiatives and to a lesser extent from favorable raw material prices.","Strong operating margin performance of 370 basis points was primarily driven by gross margin expansion, combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies and the positive impact of cost synergies. In addition, timing of R&D expenses and the benefit of the medical device tax suspension aided operating margin in the quarter.","Also you will recall several items drove lower second quarter operating margin for CareFusion in the prior year. Currency had a slightly negative impact on both gross profit margin and operating margins.","Moving onto slide 14, since we provided guidance in February, the U.S. dollar has weakened against the euro and other currencies. As a result, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance by 2 percentage points or $0.13 from a range of $8.37 to $8.44 to a range of $8.50 to $8.57. We are maintaining our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance of $9.01 to $9.08, as we expect the second quarter tax timing to reverse and R&D spend to ramp over the back half of the year, which includes reinvestment of the medical device tax.","We remain extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments.","Turning to slide 15, I'd like to walk you through the additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. In summary, we continue to expect comparable organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis, with the back half of the year growing between 5.5% and 6.5%. This contemplates the third quarter growth rate to be slightly lower than our full year guidance range and the fourth quarter to be well above the full year guidance range.","On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 21.5% and 22%, which reflects the currency headwind of about 300 basis points, an improvement from our prior guidance of about 450 basis points of currency headwinds.","The U.S. dollar has weakened against the euro and most currencies since we last provided guidance in February. While our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.13 for the rest of the year, which is better than the actual rates in the second half of last year, we see some remaining FX headwinds over the second half as non-euro currencies remain unfavorable year-over-year.","We continue to expect growth of 4.5% to 5% in BD Medical and 4% to 4.5% in our Life Sciences segment. Based on our current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be about flat for the year. Beyond revenue and EPS, all other P&L guidance from February remains unchanged.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince who'll provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Chris. Moving onto slide 17 and our updates on new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations.","Starting with new product innovation, within our Life Sciences business, our Preanalytical Systems business launched two new products this quarter. The UltraTouch Push Button Blood Collection Sets will deliver significant improvements in patient outcomes and lab efficiency. The BD Barricor tubes use gel free technology, which significantly improves sample quality and lab turnaround time. The initial market feedback on both these products has been extremely positive.","In our Biosciences business, as evidenced by our U.S. growth rate this quarter, we've seen very positive market uptake of our high-parameter instrumentation, the FACSymphony X-50 and X-20. In our genomics business, we anticipate launching our GenCell CLiC library preparation platform and our FACSseq cell sorter designed specifically for genomics applications later this fiscal year.","Within strategic and business initiatives, as we discussed earlier, we have completed our current portfolio review having recently announced the Respiratory Solutions joint venture and sale of the vertebral augmentation solutions business. We remain focused on the areas we believe are high-growth and aligned with our core capabilities.","We've also made progress with our product registrations having successfully registered more than 50 CareFusion products in over 20 countries. In addition, we have submitted registrations and are awaiting approval for an additional 25 products. This is consistent with our plans to achieve revenue synergies and we remain on track for them to begin to materialize in fiscal year 2017.","And in the areas of partnerships and collaborations, we remain excited for the launch of our infusion sets, which we expect will move to broad commercial release with Medtronic in early fiscal year 2017. We believe this product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery by significantly reducing flow interruptions, simplify the users' experience and increase the patients' overall satisfaction with insulin pumping.","We recently entered into a strategic partnership with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and will play a part in the Institute's vision of reducing cancer to a manageable disease. Support from the Parker Institute will help us advance our new cell sorter program, while bringing our high-parameter cell analysis solutions to these researchers, as they work to discover the next breakthrough in Cancer Immunotherapy. As you can see, we are executing on our strategy and continue to have strong opportunities there to drive growth and innovation. We look forward to updating you as we continue to make progress.","Moving on to our business update on slide 18, we continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the second quarter, and we made progress with our back-office functions and with harmonizing our IT infrastructure. We remain on track to achieve our FY 2016 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2018.","Contributing to our operational efficiencies is the benefit of sustained lower oil prices on raw material costs as we discussed earlier. The consistent solid performance of our businesses, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture, is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion we achieved last year, we expect another 170 basis points to 190 basis points of expansion this fiscal year.","Now, I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid second quarter. Both segments performed well and our performance highlights the benefits of our diverse portfolio, both from a product and geographic standpoint. Second, we have made significant progress on the acquisition of CareFusion. The value we can bring to customers around the world has become increasingly evident as we integrate these two great companies. Third, we have taken steps to optimize our portfolio. In doing so, we are positioning ourselves in higher growth areas which are aligned with our core capabilities. By taking these actions, we are delivering the most value to our customers.","Finally, we are confident in our outlook for the full fiscal year. We're maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance and raising our adjusted EPS. We believe we are well-positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to our customers and shareholders. I look to the future with optimism.","Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions Thank you. Your first question is coming from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning, David.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Vince, two questions for you, one for you and one for Chris. I guess, the first one is the theme that you're showing the last several quarters is one that the whole device industry is showing this quarter, which is this polarization between better U.S. performance and slightly softer ex-U.S. performance, specifically emerging markets. Talk to us about how much of this, in your mind, is the quarter or just the trend that BD has been seeing for several quarters. And what's driving that strength in the U.S. in your opinion?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well, I think there's a couple of things driving the strength in the U.S. Number one is, I think you have seen a stabilization in the U.S. marketplace in terms of healthcare and I think there's a benefit out there from the people that do have healthcare coverage, especially the expansion of Medicaid.","But the other thing that you are seeing is that our businesses are performing quite well. You heard us talk about in the Biosciences business, the launch of those new products. We have a whole series of new products coming out, and I mentioned and specifically the high-parameter work that's going on. So yeah, that showed up in this quarter right now, but that's going to continue as we move through the year.","You also saw good performance in Diagnostics, because we're getting some traction, blood culture and Kiestra, that is moving forward, Kiestra moving forward in the U.S., and then good performance across the Medical businesses where we're improving our competitive position in MMS. And so, you see all of that coming together.","Europe, I think, once again, I think has stabilized. And this really \u2013 of course, you have to drop out the CareFusion factors, but there was negative timing in Biosciences, but you've got the same product launches that are occurring there. And quite frankly, Japan is performing better for us as well.","Now, on the other side of the coin, the situation in China seems to have stabilized. We're seeing good performance on the medical device side of the business. And the situation really hasn't changed all that much on Diagnostics on the capital side, but it had stabilized. And so, we're getting good growth in China. We didn't mention it. We continue to get good growth in India. We're getting good growth in Latin America. There were some one-time events this quarter, which you heard in terms of Africa and Saudi Arabia. And Saudi Arabia is more of an impact in the back half of the year. So yes, this is slightly less in emerging market share, but the mix is quite good.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, and congratulations on the quarter. Let me start if we went back a quarter and the Street was concerned about the performance in the fiscal first quarter, revenues grew 1.8% organic and the Street was worried just about the ability to see the acceleration. Now, we're three months later, and you grew 5.3% organic this quarter, so essentially, what you said would happen happened.","Can you just talk a little bit as you go into the back half of the year? I just want to make sure I understand the commentary on the cadence of the quarters. I know the comp in some different respects in the fourth quarter is easier than the third quarter. I just want to understand just the commentary relative to third quarter being a bit below the full year guidance and the fourth quarter being materially above. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, Mike. I'll have Chris walk you through that, because there's some complications here. You got to go back to last year to understand what was happening, but Chris will walk you through.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, so the best way to \u2013 the key to understanding the second half growth trajectory is really to focus on the absolute dollars of revenue that we're achieving this year versus last year. We're actually up against a tough comparison in the third quarter, because in terms of absolute dollars, that was our highest quarter last year. So you got to really look at those absolute dollars.","Looking at growth rates is a little misleading, because the growth rate last year was negative in CareFusion in the third quarter, but that was more about the comparative prior year, but the absolute dollars are the grow over.","And then, as you model out the year, based on the guidance that we just gave you in terms of growth rates for the third quarter and fourth quarter, you'll see steadily improving sequential revenue dollars for all four quarters this year. So we really feel good about the trajectory, particularly on a sequential basis this year. It's all about the compared to last year revenue dollars.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Mike, if you think about it, there were two events at CareFusion, two different compensation events that caused the pattern to be highly fluctuate with the first quarter being very high, the third quarter being very high, and then we had the flu. So you got to go back and look at those absolute numbers as Chris was saying. And then, you'll see that our growth this year, actually, as we look at the whole year, is actually quite smooth, but the growth rates jump around because of that.","Thanks for your question, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, and good morning, everybody.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, David.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Vincent, I wanted to follow up on your commentary regarding some of the registrations that you're getting outside of the U.S. I guess, firstly, could you maybe give us a little bit more flavor on what those products are, which businesses those fit in, and then, how we should start to evaluate the impact on a go-forward basis?","And then, for Chris, can you maybe help us understand why, given the change in currency, there's not a positive impact on the margin profile? Looks like you've just flowed the dollars right down to EPS at the corporate margin guidance that you previously provided, so why wouldn't we see an uplift in profitability associated with the change in rates?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So let me ask Tom to comment first. I mean we'll give you more transparency in terms of the sales and sales impact next year, but why don't you talk to the products that are getting registered and which geographies we're talking about?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Hi, David. This is Tom. So as Vince mentioned before, we registered more than 50 products over 20 countries, got about 25 additional registrations submitted and awaiting approval. Essentially, all of those products fall within either MPS or MMS, the two businesses that came from legacy CareFusion, and the majority of those products are actually within MPS, so think disposables.","And this is right in line with what we had talked about over the last several quarters that, as we think about the first products that would be able to help drive incremental revenue growth, it would be things like infusion sets, ChloraPrep, the consumables that fit very well with BD's traditional sales channels and market approaches and presence in the marketplaces. And those are the products that we focused on getting registrations for first.","So I would say we're seeing some early signs of success, as we've been launching these products, which is very consistent with our plans to achieve revenue synergies and really remain on track to start seeing them materialize more in 2017, but we do see sales now, and obviously, on a company the size of BD and a segment of Medical, we'll see those start showing up more materially as we roll into 2017, but they have started. And I would just say that, obviously, we're going to continue those product registration work, we're continuing the sales and marketing investments to support those initiatives, but overall, we're on track.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And to your second question, David, we did still see a little bit of a drag in the second quarter on both the gross profit 10 basis points of currency drag and 30 basis points on operating margin and the dynamic there is a couple of things.","One is, although the euro hasn't improved, the non-euro currencies, year-over-year, are still providing a bit of a drag and then, secondly, and probably, more importantly, is the phenomenon of the profit and inventory that we've talked about in the past. So didn't quite catch up in the second quarter, certainly, not much of a drag, and it's starting to level off. And that in my prepared remarks was the commentary for the second half of the year, it doesn't really turn positive because of that phenomenon, but it certainly lightens up in terms of headwinds.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, good morning. I guess, for Tom, would you mind talking a little bit about infusion pump sort of the growth, the competitive landscape, kind of where you think you're going for the year, and then, also as alluded to in the prepared comments, it sounds like the installation process for MedStation ES is improving. I know there've been a number of software tweaks for that ES system over the past couple of years, and just also want to understand if you're kind of getting to a point where that system is now stable.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Sure, Larry. This is Tom. So let me start off with the good Pyxis question, and then, I'll address infusion pumps. So we are actually quite pleased with the progress that we're making on Pyxis. We actually just released another new version of the software, which we think really makes some very significant progress, and actually, addresses \u2013 will make a big step forward in terms of installation efficiency.","So as we've shared in the past, we were really focused on improving the installation process. We've shared that there was a quite large backlog at the time of the acquisition. And to really address that backlog, we need to improve the installation efficiency process and we've been working on that applying some of our lean expertise, as well as making some adjustments in the software that would automate a lot of that and simplify the workload in the field.","So we're seeing a lot of those efforts come to fruition. We did have very strong placements in Q2 that was part of the driver of MMS growth. We continue to see strong demand for the Pyxis ES platform and we're equally looking forward to continued strong growth in the second half of the year in that as Vince alluded to earlier.","So on the infusion side, we also are very pleased with the growth that we saw in the quarter here and have similar expectations for the back half of the year. As you know, we are the market leader in that space. We've continued to strengthen our position over the last several years. We expect to continue to strengthen our position in the market by about the same amount this year, as we have over the last couple of years.","We do see customers continue to select the BD Alaris pumps in an incremental way, really based on that interoperability and the power of one to be able to do all of their infusion needs across both large-volume infusions, syringes and narcotics, all in one product, the only item that can do that.","So we're happy there. I would point out as well that as you look at our safety sales, particularly in the U.S., that was largely driven by growth in some of the connectors that are associated with our dedicated sets in the infusion category, and that's really a reflection of that strong performance in that infusion category and that renewing consumable stream that comes as we place pumps incrementally.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co","Great. Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Bill.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co","Good morning, everyone.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co","Vince, you and the team have done a really nice job in terms of executing on some of the identified cost synergy opportunities with CareFusion. Can you talk a little bit about the pace of identifying new opportunities, either in terms of additional cost synergies or on the revenue side, and obviously, you alluded to some of the products and registration?","And then, secondly, just on China, looks like based on the numbers we're going to need about some sort of teens acceleration, easier comps, but can you just elaborate on that? Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, okay. So I'll ask Chris to talk about the cost synergies.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So just a reminder that we raise the cost synergies fairly...","(38:14-38:50)","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please standby, the conference will resume momentarily.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Is anybody able to hear us?","Operator","Yes, we can hear you now.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Go ahead.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. So let me start again to that question. So in terms of cost synergies, we did, I would remind you, improve cost synergies fairly recently up to the $325 million to $350 million and that was identification of some new synergies from our recent or our original model. I would also remind you that we increased the overall synergies from the standpoint of the tax rate improvements that we saw that we originally didn't contemplate, and that's another 3% accretion that we had mentioned.","Really, when you think about the synergies, we get initial synergies of duplicate public company costs, and then, you move into the integration of systems and infrastructure, and we've gotten good traction on that and that led to the last increase and then, towards the end are the more difficult synergies to get, which are the distribution centers and manufacturing plants, and we actually saw some good initial improvements in that area or traction in that area that led to our last increase.","So we really feel great about what we're driving. All in, all in, it's significantly higher than our original expectations, particularly when you add the tax synergy. You see this year the EPS quarter-over-quarter was over 44%, I think, is an indication of that. So we really feel good about our ability to drive those synergies and executing on those synergies.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And then, for China, growth is going to be driven by the Medical side of the company. And there are multiple businesses on the Medical side that are doing well in China. And then, in addition, there were several million dollars of inventory that came out of the chain last year. So there is a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter. But Tom, do you want to comment on any of the product lines?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I think as you said, we see the consumables across the board are holding in strong. And we do have, again, while it may not be overly material for the company, China is one of the lead markets in which we launched some of those new products from CareFusion into them. We're seeing some good traction in some of those items, particularly as we think about connectors and some of the oncology products coming out from CareFusion.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And we don't talk about it much, but we also have launched flush in China so that's another piece that has been growing quite nicely for us.","Operator","And thank you. Your next question is from Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Vince. Hi, Chris.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hi, Rick.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess, I'll ask sort of a two-part question. Maybe first big picture, Vince, maybe you can talk a little bit about your latest thoughts, evolving thoughts on capital deployment. You're through the post CareFusion portfolio review, maybe what's next and what you're thinking about?","And maybe just one for Chris, on operating margin expansion, you've addressed a little bit, but this acceleration in operating margin expansion can't go on forever. How do we think about the \u2013 not for guidance, but how do we think about fiscal 2017 and beyond, what's possible in terms of further operating margin expansion, just directionally? Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. That's fine. I'll start out and you guys get really good at your single questions. So the two-part is really fantastic. Let me just say from a capital deployment standpoint, of course, short run, we're still working to get down to the three times leverage and we're making excellent progress there.","And so, in the short run, we still have the flexibility to do plug-in acquisitions. And then, as we have been stating, we're going to be really strategy-driven, and we challenge both segments to look at their strategies and as we look at our ability to provide solutions to the marketplace and have a broader impact, that's what's going to drive our strategy. It'll be a mix of both internal development and continued looking on the upside and we'll be very balanced there. But ultimately, it's about strategic impact plus value creation for shareholders and that's how we're thinking about it. Chris?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","On the margins, Rick, to your point, the second quarter was really rich margin performance on operating margins 370 basis points, that was driven again by the very strong gross profit margin, which is really going around operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, a little bit of benefit from raw material prices, as we talked in the past from oil, but then on the operating side, SSG&A really reflective of hitting on the synergies.","It was a little bit of an easier compare in the second quarter because of the operating margin challenges in CareFusion in that quarter last year. So you won't expect 370 basis points. In fact, we expect about 170 basis points to 190 basis points for the year on the operating margin basis. I'd remind you that's on top of 100 basis points of margin improvement last year, so really improving the margins as you point out.","As we think about going forward, as we execute on synergies, you would expect to see above normal, so we usually think 40 basis points to 50 basis points of margin improvement. You're going to get more of that as we execute on the synergies in 2017 and 2018. You would also get a little bit of a lift from the fact that as we exit Respiratory which had challenging margins, you get a little bit of a lift.","So not to give guidance on 2017, but you're absolutely right, directionally, we're going to see improved margins going forward in 2017 and 2018. And then, as you start lapping those synergies, I think somewhere beyond that, you start going back to that 40 basis points to 50 basis points. That's a few years out.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is coming from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, another long single question, but you've done a number of portfolio reviews lately with Respiratory and the Simplist portfolio. Could you sort of talk about \u2013 this is a 2017 organic revenue growth question and sort of like what the impact of all these moving parts are on it, and do you still feel good about a 4% to 5% longer term organic revenue growth rate for the company?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, when we did the deal and we discussed what our revenue aspirations were, we said legacy BD was growing at around 5% and that CareFusion was about 3.5%, and our goal was to bring the entire company up to about 5%. I think we're making excellent progress. I think you see the performance of the CareFusion businesses is quite strong. I think that the portfolio moves that we have made have been the right ones. So that still is our goal and I think we're making excellent progress.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jon Groberg of UBS.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hi, Jon.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Congratulations \u2013 can you hear me, (46:23) congratulations on a good quarter. So can I ask you just a timing question on a few items? I guess, one, the infusion set, do you have kind of a specific launch for that, because this is the diabetes infusion set, and then, on the BD Simplist in the Respiratory, I guess, when exactly do you expect all those to close, and if you have any updated views on the EPS and that kind of impact from an EPS (46:51) standpoint for those initiatives? Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, so Tom can talk to those things, but Respiratory, I think we're expecting to close at the end of this fiscal year. And then...","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Simplist is closed.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Simplist is done.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Simplist is closed. And as we shared in the past, on Simplist, we don't expect any impact on sales from that at all. It was small and the other opportunities will make up for that.","In terms of the infusion set launch, as Vince mentioned, we expect broad commercialization in early FY 2017. We are tracking towards by the end of this fiscal year, within this fiscal year, we will be doing a limited launch and we talked about this in the past in which Medtronic will start providing the product to a set group of patients so that they can really understand the user insight at another level before they do the full-scale launch.","And so, we're moving forward preparing to ship out the first product for that limited scale launch, in the back half of this fiscal year. That will occur. And then, it would open up for a full commercial launch we expect at the start of FY 2017.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And this is Chris. The only other thing I'd add is, as we said with the Respiratory announcement, the impact is 2017. Because it closes at the end of our fiscal year, there's no impact to 2016. But for 2017, it's $0.10 to $0.14.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On R&D, it did step down sequentially. You said that, obviously, you're going to get the benefit of the device tax and reinvest that. But can you talk a little bit more specifically about the priorities within R&D? Is it about accelerating kind of current projects? Is it really putting that money to work at new projects? And any specific areas of focus that you would like to focus on with those dollars? Thanks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, sure, Brian, and thanks for the question. First off, in this quarter, there was some timing in the R&D spending that we knew was going to happen. And of course, that timing, that money is going to get spent. And I'm talking before the medical device tax in the back half of the year. It's timing of things like clinical trials and whatnot.","But in addition, the money that is being spent on the medical device tax is being spent in both segments, and it is a combination of some new things that we are doing. But mostly, it's current strategies where we are accelerating those strategies, where we had platforms where we could push them faster, and part of that which is a bit new for us is moving to informatics side of things quicker. So you can think of major platforms going faster, and then, informatics piece on top of that, both sides of the company.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is kind of like an innings question. What innings are you in for two parts of your business that we frequently talk about? For Pyxis, do you have \u2013 just can you update us on where you are with the kind of the opportunity there to kind of get upgrades for that product cycle? And then the second innings question, just the \u2013 in your cytology business, your liquid-based Pap testing, can you just tell us what the trend is there? Are we kind of through the interval expansion impact mostly at this point? And just comment on any pricing or volume trends for that business. Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. Let's start with the Pap first, and Linda can talk to you about that.","Linda Tharby - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. So good morning. So if you look at the liquid cytology business in the U.S., as you mentioned, we're really starting to see a flattening of that business. So the interval testing, we think, we're mostly through.","Outside the U.S., we're actually seeing strong double-digit performance. And then the entire platform, both in the U.S. and ex-U.S., is being helped by the total automation we're doing across both our focal point and our Totalys system, so complete control of the sample from collection through the result. So that's driving a lot of growth both in the U.S. and ex-U.S. for us.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks, Linda. Okay.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And on Pyxis ES, we're \u2013 about 25% of our base business has been converted over to ES. And so, we continue to see strong demand there, and we still do have generally quite a wide runway ahead.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. So I don't have a multi-part question, but I do have two questions, one for Chris and one for Tom. The good news is I think they're quick follow-ups.","So for Chris, you reiterated full year revenue guidance. You reduced expectations for emerging market growth. That would seemingly imply there's a positive offset for developed market growth. I believe this change in mix should benefit operating margin. It doesn't seem like your guidance reflects that margin mix dynamic. Am I wrong? And if not, why?","And then, the second question is for Tom. Regarding your plans for the 25 or so additional CareFusion product registrations, what's the timeline for those? And can you walk us through why those products take a bit longer to get registered? I'm just trying to get a better handle on the profile of those products versus the first 50 that are close to or have been registered? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Chris?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, just you're not wrong, but at this point in the year, the impact that it has is still within the range of guidance that we gave. So we had a fairly broad range and it's still in that range. So arguably, it's the higher end of the range.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. And Tom?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And Doug, this is Tom. So the 25 is not a kind of a straightforward answer. In fact, it's really a combination of just think about, of course, we couldn't submit all files simultaneously, so it just takes time to work through those. So think about those just being ones that we submitted more recently and didn't work through certain regulatory processes.","In other cases, it's a combination of there are even certain countries that have longer registrations. China has longer registration processes than most of Europe, as an example, and then, the other one is that certain product categories. So ChloraPrep, for example, is registered as a drug in many markets, particularly, let's say, Latin America. It's registered as a drug. Those typically sit in the regulatory process longer than medical devices. So it's kind of a combination of those three items, not one thing specific and not unexpected at all. It's right in line with our projections.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","You have to pull together the data for these files, and so, certain product lines that may not have done that kind of clinical trial work for China, so we had to do some pre-work to get them into the file. That's all that is. Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Congrats on a nice beat.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Vijay.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Just maybe one housekeeping question on the guidance, Chris. You beat the quarter pretty handily $0.16 and it looks like FX came in better by 150 bps, but the overall guidance sort of up $0.13 by the midpoint. Just want to make sure sort of \u2013 is that a little bit of conservatism on the part of management just because FX has been moving all over the place when you think about, I mean, trying to put the Q in context of FX improving in the back half? Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure, Vijay. So what I'd say is you really have to look at the EPS guidance in two buckets. One is the FXN side and then the FX impact. So what we did is we did flow through everything on the FX impact and that was the $0.13.","On an FXN basis, you're right, we were up around $0.14 to $0.16, but we see that as timing and the timing buckets are the medical device tax spending which we know where we want to spend it, but because of the timing, don't forget, it happened in January, and we couldn't ramp that quickly.","So that past quarter, we really got a lift from that, but we fully intend to spend that in the back half of the year. Then you had timing on the tax rate, so the tax rate was lower than our 21% to 22% and that's just lumpy throughout the year. We expect that to fall back within the rest of the year. So you had that piece.","And then, we had the pull forward of some of the revenues from the third quarter to the second quarter and the impact of that. So all of that accounts for the bulk of that $0.14 to $0.16 on an FXN basis. The other thing I'd point out is we actually raised the FXN EPS guidance last quarter by $0.28. It was lost from the standpoint that, at that point, FX was getting worse across the world and it offset that, but the FXN was raised prior. So you really got to think about it in those two buckets.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is coming from Matt Taylor of Barclays.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. I wanted to see if you could touch on a couple of kind of interesting projects that you've talked about in the last couple of quarters. One is the solutions that you're bringing in with the swap of the Simplist business, and then, the other is the diabetes partnership with Medtronic. Could you talk a little bit about those opportunities and maybe help us quantify the upside there?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So Tom will address those. Tom, you want to start with diabetes?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. This is Tom. So we haven't specifically sized the opportunity on infusion sets, but I think as we said all year, we're expecting to get the product into some early-stage release in a controlled patient group this fiscal year, and then, really see more of the impact in the Diabetes Care business in FY 2017, that remains unchanged.","So we remain very excited about that opportunity, and so, of course, our first venture outside of the pen needles and syringes for the Diabetes Care business moving into a fast-growing market with the market leader, Medtronic, and we're I think equally excited about the product technology and what it can do to help patients and the partnership and what the power of us working together can do to make an impact there.","So if you think about solutions, as we, of course, shared before, we have announced the solutions partnership with Fresenius. We are looking at launching that, not necessarily now in Q4 of 2016, but more in early FY 2017, just based on regulatory approval timelines there, but that does continue to move forward. And again, we've not shared a specific number there, but we said it would certainly make up for any reduction in BD Rx sales that we had planned over the coming horizon and that remains right on track.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. I'll now turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for any closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much for your participation on the call today. It was a real pleasure to talk about a very solid quarter and to raise our EPS guidance. It was also a pleasure to talk about the progress we're making on the CareFusion integration and progress with those businesses, the synergies, the teams in place, and then lastly, the strategic partnerships that we're doing including the Parker Institute relationship, the new products that are being launched.","We didn't spend a lot of time on the Life Science business today. There weren't that many questions, but with BD MAX, with Kiestra, all of these things happening over there; very, very exciting, and of course, new products on the Medical side.","So thank you very much for your time, and we look forward to updating you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"3367":["Becton, Dickinson and (NYSE:BDX) Q4 2014 Earnings Call November  4, 2014  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Monique Dolecki - ","Vincent A.

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded. It will be available for replay through November 11, 2014, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at (800) 585-8367 for domestic calls and (404) 537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 14009656.","[Operator Instructions] Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth fiscal quarter results.","As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our fourth fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Administration; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, Segment President; Linda Tharby, Segment President; and Alberto Mas, President of Diagnostic Systems.","At this time, we would like to announce some leadership changes, which took place on October 1. Beginning in fiscal year 2015, we will organize BD into a 2-segment structure, which consists of a Medical and Life Sciences segment. Tom Polen has been promoted to the role of Segment President for BD Medical. This segment is comprised of the Medical Surgical Systems, Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care business units. Linda Tharby has been promoted to the role of Segment President for our Life Sciences segment. This segment is comprised of the Preanalytical Systems, Diagnostic Systems and Biosciences business units.","In their new roles, Linda and Tom will continue to report to Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. For the purposes of today's call, Tom will answer any questions related to Medical, and Linda will answer any questions related to Life Sciences.","As we stated in our press release, earnings per share were impacted by some onetime charges this quarter. Further information about these charges and other adjustments in the current and prior year can be found in the additional reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. For the purposes of our conference call today, we will refer to adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding these charges.","The medical device tax in the first quarter of this fiscal year 2014 was $14 million or $0.05 per share. In certain circumstances, we will also exclude the medical device tax from our results. Please note that all fiscal year 2015 guidance provided is on a BD standalone basis. As we move closer to our anticipated closing of the CareFusion acquisition, we will provide more explicit guidance on the pro forma financials for the combined company.","We would also like to remind everyone that going forward, adjusted EPS will also exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. When we refer to EPS in our remarks, unless otherwise noted, we are referring to adjusted cash EPS.","Also, guidance will be provided for Diagnostics and Biosciences for fiscal year 2015. However, beyond 2015, our guidance will reflect our new structure.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss the company's performance, I would like to comment briefly on the organizational changes Monique just walked you through.","Last November, we had announced the promotions of Linda and Tom to Group President, as well as several other leadership changes. Over the past year, we have continued to bolster our leadership structure to help ensure our future success and continued development of our senior leaders. This new structure is more reflective of the company's strategy and increased focus on growth as we develop more impactful solutions for our customers.","The change to a 2-segment structure will also enable us to seek strategic synergies across our portfolio, with the CareFusion business being reported within our Medical segment once the transaction is completed. We are extremely pleased to have Tom and Linda in their new roles as they help lead the company through our next phase of growth.","Turning to Slide 4, I would like to highlight some key achievements in fiscal year 2014. First, our strategy of investing and innovating for growth continues to deliver results as evidenced by our strong finish to the year.","Revenue growth was a -- was robust at 5.2%, which includes 20 basis points of growth from acquisitions. Our core remains strong, and our product pipeline continues to drive growth across the portfolio with new products as a percentage of revenue going from 13% to about 15% over the past year.","Second, we have continued to strategically invest in higher-growth emerging markets. We made an incremental investment of $40 million in fiscal year 2014. Emerging markets grew over 12% and continued to be a key driver of growth for the company. We have one of the highest percentages of sales in emerging markets in our peer group at about 25% of total revenue.","And third, we have continued to refine our operating effectiveness and efficiency initiatives, which continue to drive underlying margin expansion. Our ReLoCo program has benefited us incrementally by more than $30 million this year. We remain focused on these programs and also on efficient utilization of our global shared service centers and end-to-end process improvement opportunities.","Fourth, we completed our 42nd consecutive year of dividend increases and also repurchased $400 million in shares through our share repurchase program, which highlights our effective deployment of capital.","Finally, we have built a strong foundation for continued growth. We continue to proactively adapt to today's dynamic health care environment by transitioning from a product-focused company to a customer-focused provider of health care solutions.","Our announced acquisition of CareFusion helps us significantly accelerate that strategy. The powerful combination of the 2 companies will further enable us to deliver end-to-end solutions that increase efficiencies, reduce medication errors and improve patient safety in both hospitals and pharmacies.","Moving to Slide 5, you will see the guidance for fiscal year 2015 on a currency-neutral basis. For fiscal year 2015, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% based on our current view of the environment.","Of course, we have contemplated a number of factors that could bring us above or below that range including pricing, a stronger or weaker flu season than expected, product launches, emerging market growth, macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the Affordable Care Act.","On the bottom line, we will continue to drive high-quality earnings growth. For fiscal year 2015, we expect adjusted EPS growth to be between 8% and 9%. When excluding the unfavorable impact of the suspension of our share repurchase program, EPS growth would be between 9% and 10%.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris, who will walk you through our financial performance in the fourth quarter, along with additional details about our fiscal year 2015 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin on Slide 7 by discussing the key highlights for the fourth quarter, which I'll speak to on a currency-neutral basis.","We are pleased with our fourth quarter results. Solid revenue growth of 4.6% was driven by our Medical and Diagnostics segment. As we anticipated and communicated on our last call, pricing declined about 50 basis points in the quarter, bringing the total year pricing impact to about flat.","Biosciences growth was impacted by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year, as we expected. We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets and international safety sales. We also experienced a tax rate benefit in the quarter, which was offset by unfavorable currency.","This quarter, we recorded EPS pretax charges totaling $46 million or $0.15 per share, which primarily consisted of a workforce reduction charge as a result of operational restructuring activities. Adjusted EPS growth in the quarter was strong at 13%.","On Slide 8, I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenue growth was 4.6% for the total company. BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased 6.1%. Growth in this segment was driven by good performance in all 3 business units.","Medical Surgical Systems' growth was 4.7%, with continued strength in emerging markets and international safety sales. Growth in Diabetes Care was 8.1%. This reflects the continued strength of pen needle sales and a favorable comparison to the prior year. Pharmaceutical Systems' growth of 7% was favorably impacted by ordering patterns.","For the total year, the Medical segment grew 6.3%, which was aided by a nonannualized acquisition. This contributed about 30 basis points, bringing organic growth to 6.0%.","BD Diagnostics' fourth quarter revenues increased 4.2%. The segment's growth was driven by solid sales of Preanalytical Systems' safety-engineered products and solid growth in Diagnostic Systems. Diagnostic Systems benefited from strong sales in microbiology and continued progress with our KIESTRA rollout.","For the total year, the Diagnostics segment grew 3.3%. BD Biosciences' revenue growth was about flat in the quarter, which was impacted by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year. You may recall last year, we had a particularly strong fourth quarter related to timing in Western Europe and Japan's stimulus revenues. For the total year, the Biosciences segment grew 5.5%.","Moving to Slide 9, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis. BD's reported U.S. revenues increased 2.3% versus the prior year. We continue to view the hospital environment in the U.S. as stable. Revenue in our U.S. Medical segment increased by 3.4%. Strong growth in Diabetes Care was driven by pen needle revenues, which include our BD Nano and BD AutoShield Duo product. Growth was also aided, in part, by a favorable prior year comparison, as previously mentioned.","U.S. Diagnostics' results were flat for the quarter. This reflects solid growth in Preanalytical Systems and strong growth in microbiology. This was offset by continued softness in Women's Health and Cancer due to extended cervical cancer screening intervals. We also continued to experience U.S. share losses in our ProbeTec business, which is consistent with what we've communicated the past 2 quarters. U.S. Biosciences' revenues grew 4.4%, driven by solid reagent and instrument growth.","Moving on to international. We continue to see strong growth. Revenues grew 6.2%, driven by solid growth in Medical and Diagnostics, both of which grew 7.8%. Both segments experienced strong growth in emerging markets and international safety sales. Biosciences declined 1.8%. This was due to the aforementioned prior year comparison, primarily due to timing in Western Europe. For the total year, U.S. revenues grew 1.9%, and international revenues grew 7.6%.","On Slide 10, emerging market revenues grew 13.2%, currency-neutral, and accounted for over 26% of our total revenues. This strong performance was driven by growth in Medical and Diagnostics. China revenues grew by 21.4%, and safety sales in emerging markets grew by 18.6%. We saw a double-digit growth across all emerging markets in the fourth quarter and for the total year.","As we continue to build our infrastructure and focus on localized R&D, it is evident that our investments in emerging markets continue to drive robust growth for the company.","Moving to global safety on Slide 11. Currency-neutral sales increased 5.5% and grew to $566 million in the quarter. Revenues in the U.S. declined about 0.8%, which was impacted by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year. International safety sales grew 13.7%. Medical safety sales grew 6.4%, while Diagnostics grew 4.6%, driven by a range of safety-engineered products. For the total year, safety revenue grew 6.6%, currency-neutral, driven by strong international growth of 12.3%.","Turning to Slide 12. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of about 80 basis points on our gross profit margin in the quarter, which was higher than our expectations.","On a performance basis, margin expansion was driven by positive contributions from ReLoCo, continuous improvement and pension. These contributions were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of mix, pricing, start-up-related costs and raw materials.","Slide 13 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. Since we've already discussed revenue and gross profit, I'll move down the income statement to SSG&A.","As a percentage of sales, SSG&A decreased in the quarter. This was driven by sustained cost containment, a favorable comparison to the prior period's legal expenses and favorable pension benefit.","R&D was 6.0% of sales in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in new products and platforms. Operating income grew 10.1%, driven by solid revenue and gross profit growth, coupled with better leverage in SSG&A.","Our tax rate improved 280 basis points over the prior year, which was largely contemplated in our guidance. The improvement was due to favorable geographic mix. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.68 or an increase of 13%.","Turning to Slide 14, I'd like to walk you through our expected revenue guidance for the full fiscal year 2015.","In summary, we expect revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. From a timing perspective, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth in the first quarter to be below the low end of this range due to an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period.","On a reported basis, revenue growth is expected to be between 2% and 2.5%, reflecting an FX headwind of 200 to 250 basis points. This assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange ratio of $1.27. At current spot rates, all major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar are down about 8% versus the first quarter of 2014. We expect this unfavorable impact to be most acute in the first quarter with a headwind greater than 250 basis points. We expect the currency impact to moderate through the rest of the year.","Moving on to the segments. We expect BD Medical to grow between 4.5% to 5%. This is a slightly lower growth profile than we experienced in fiscal year 2014 due to share gains and a benefit from the SSI acquisition.","We expect our Life Sciences segment to grow about 4.5%. And within Life Sciences, we expect Diagnostics to grow between 4% to 4.5% and Biosciences to grow about 4.5% to 5%.","Our acquisitions have annualized and will be included in our base going forward. This excludes our 2 most recently closed acquisitions, which are not expected to contribute materially to revenue in fiscal year 2015.","We expect revenue growth to continue to be driven by new product launches in all 3 of our segments, continued growth of safety-engineered devices and emerging markets. We anticipate emerging market growth in fiscal year 2015 to be broadly in line with 2014 growth. The growth drivers I just mentioned will be partially offset by the expected unfavorable impact of pricing pressure. Based on our current view of the environment, we expect pricing to normalize at about 30 to 40 basis points of pressure for the year.","Now moving on to Slide 15. There are a number of moving parts that impact earnings per share in fiscal year 2015. For modeling purposes and to ensure consistency, I'd like to provide more color on EPS guidance.","When we announced the CareFusion acquisition, we informed you that we would be moving to an adjusted cash EPS basis to increase transparency into our underlying business performance. Going forward, that means that we will add back the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles to adjusted earnings per share.","For fiscal year 2014, this changed our adjusted EPS from $6.25 to $6.50, which is ratable across all 4 quarters. For fiscal year 2015, we expect to grow earnings by about 9% to 10% on an underlying basis. This is very consistent with the earnings growth profile we have communicated for some time. The unfavorable impact of the suspension of our share repurchase program is worth about 100 basis points, bringing earnings growth to 8% to 9%. Assuming current spot rates, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency is about 400 basis points, bringing adjusted earnings growth to 4% to 5%.","From a timing perspective, the impact of unfavorable currency will be most acute in the first quarter, similar to revenue. In the first quarter, we expect EPS to be about flat when compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2014.","For the first half of the year, we expect currency-neutral earnings growth to track slightly below our guided range of 8% to 9%.","Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to walk through our additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2015. As a reminder, all fiscal year 2015 guidance will exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.","We expect gross profit margin to be approximately 52%. Performance improvements are largely offset by negative currency translation, pricing pressure and pension. Our ReLoCo cost savings program is expected to deliver savings broadly in line with benefits experienced in fiscal year 2014. SSG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be about 25%.","Our guidance also reflects continued investments in emerging markets, as well as costs related to new product launches. We expect our R&D investment to be in line with fiscal year 2014 at about 6% of revenues. We continue to invest in new products and platforms, including incremental R&D investments in emerging markets.","As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 20.5% and 21% of revenues. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve by about 40 to 50 basis points. This also excludes pension headwinds, which equal approximately half of the margin expansion.","We expect our tax rate to be between 21.5% and 22.5% as we continue to see improvement from geographic mix. For fiscal year 2015, we anticipate our average fully diluted share count to be broadly in line with fiscal year 2014.","Cash flow is expected to remain strong with operating cash flow of about $1.85 billion in fiscal year 2015. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $625 million. Our guidance also contemplates the GenCell acquisition, which does not materially impact earnings.","With respect to our anticipated CareFusion acquisition, things are progressing according to plan, and we do not have any updates to the financial parameters we've described when we announced the deal last month.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Chris. Before I review our pipeline, I would like to take a moment to provide a quick integration update on the CareFusion acquisition and make a few remarks about our recent acquisition of GenCell. While we announced the -- we just announced the CareFusion acquisition 1 month ago, our planning efforts are in line with where we expected to be and are off to a great start.","I've had the opportunity to visit CareFusion's headquarters and have met with a number of the CareFusion associates. As we spend more time together, I feel even more confident that the complementary nature of our 2 companies will make for a successful integration.","As we shared with you on our investor conference call on October 6, Bill Kozy is leading this integration effort. Our integration team is in place, which includes key members from BD and CareFusion. There has been a great deal of planning, hard work and activity in a short period of time. In a sizable acquisition like this, the success of the integration is of critical importance, and we will continue to keep you updated as we move forward.","We are also underway with the integration activities of our latest acquisition in the Life Science area with our acquisition of GenCell. GenCell is a small biotech company that has developed proprietary technology to address key biological analysis protocols for library preparation for Next Generation Sequencing and genotyping applications. These technologies automate library preparation workflow, making it more efficient, reliable and less costly to perform.","Next Generation Sequencing is a fast-growing space that represents a great opportunity for BD. As the NGS market moves to the clinic, BD is well positioned with relevant experience in bringing products from research to clinical markets, preanalytical sample collection and sample preparation in Diagnostic Systems. BD will combine this experience with GenCell's proprietary technology to meet unmet needs with upfront NGS workflow.","Moving on to Slide 18. We have been discussing our robust pipeline for some time now. And in fiscal year 2014, there were a number of product launches. I will not review them in detail, but they are highlighted on Slides 18 and 19. We are committed to the successful ramp-up of these products, while we also look to the future and continue to expand our portfolio.","Moving on to Slide 20. We have some new product launches that we would like to share with you. We are very excited about a new product in the insulin infusion set category, which we -- which you have heard us talk about for some time now. This new product introduction is the result of the work we have been doing together with the Juveniles -- Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. The BD infusion set is aimed at improving the consistency of insulin delivery for the users of durable infusion pumps, which aligns with the clinical goal of tight glycemic control and avoiding hyperglycemic episodes. We expect FDA clearance for this product in the second half of fiscal year 2015. We will update you on the product launch timing as we continue to make progress.","For BD Simplist, we recently received FDA approval of midazolam. As we shared with you recently, BD Simplist requires a change in clinical processes, and uptake has been slower than expected. Those who have converted are pleased with the product.","We have taken actions to reprioritize our portfolio to focus on drugs where a ready-to-use prefilled syringe is most valued by our customers, specifically those with the highest risk of medication errors or those used in the urgent care setting. The next 2 drugs meeting those criteria are hydromorphone and heparin, both expected to launch in 2016. We will continue to keep you updated as our launches progress.","In Biosciences, we recently launched in Europe the first component of our BD OneFlow Solution for clinical reagents. This reagent and standardized instrument solution provides powerful analysis capabilities to improve efficiency, accuracy and objectivity in leukemia and lymphoma diagnosis.","We also recently launched 3 new BD Horizon dyes and will be anticipating launching several more dyes in 2015. Our novel BD Horizon dyes, based on Sirigen technology, are used by external researchers to perform complex multi-color analysis and have increased the number of parameters or colors by which single cells can be analyzed using flow cytometry.","In fiscal year 2015, we expect to launch the X-14 research instrument to deliver high-performance multi-color analysis with a compact footprint and a unique optical configurations to enable use of traditional or the novel BD Horizon Brilliant reagent portfolio for a wide variety of research applications.","We are also looking forward to the launch of our BD FACSVia instrument. The FACSVia is based on the Accuri platform and is a low-cost, easy-to-use instrument for clinical applications. We're targeting this launch primarily for emerging markets, with an initial focus on China.","On Slide 21, you can see the anticipated products in our Diagnostics business. On the BD MAX, we will be building upon the solid base of our novel assay launches in 2014, such as MRSA XT and our Enteric Panels. Our enteric strategy for 2015 includes assays for parasites as well as extended bacterial and viral testing. The availability of rapid molecular tests in these areas represents a significant improvement to the current testing methods available today, and we are confident that this will bring meaningful benefits to our customers.","Our GC\/CT assay is expected to launch in Europe in the third quarter of this year. This is a test that we currently have on our BD Viper instrument, which will now be available for our BD MAX customers as well.","We are expecting the full launch of the BD Totalys system in our Women's Health and Cancer area. This front-end automation system for screening cervical cancer has already been well received in Europe this year, and we look forward to its launch in the U.S.","As you can see, we continue to have strong opportunities in our pipeline, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you as we make progress throughout the year.","Before I summarize the presentation and open up this call for questions, I'd like to take a moment to address the Ebola epidemic. We have been working with a number of foundations to provide essential medical supplies and support and have donated about $850,000 to date in cash and products. We have provided Safety Syringes, Vacutainer tubes, E-Z Care and Scrub products and the BD Insyte Autoguard with blood control to train -- and also to train and equip health care workers.","With the recent launch of the Total Nucleic Acid kits on the BD MAX, the Diagnostics team has been working closely with multiple organizations to develop fully automated diagnostic tests for Ebola detection. Our molecular scientists and global partners are actively pursuing a fast, accurate and fully automated molecular detection solution that would fit in with the needs of the developing world, which is most impacted by the disease. We will continue to use our clinical knowledge and expertise to assist in this outbreak and fulfill our mission and purpose of helping all people live healthy lives.","On Slide 22, before we open the call to questions, I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today.","First, we are pleased with our strong fiscal year 2014 results. We have exceeded our financial and operating goals for this year, which delivered strong financial results and continued operating efficiencies.","Second, our core remains strong. Our investments drove robust revenue growth of 5.2%, and we continue to deliver high-quality double-digit earnings growth of 11.4% this fiscal year. We expect to deliver a similar growth profile in fiscal year 2015 with top line growth of 4.5% to 5% and earnings growth of 8% to 9%. We're pleased with the financial performance we continue to deliver and believe we have built a strong foundation for future growth.","Third, we continue to evolve and remain dedicated to becoming a customer-focused provider of health care solutions. We are excited about the acquisition of CareFusion and look forward to updating you as we continue to make progress. The powerful combination of these 2 companies will significantly accelerate our strategy.","Finally, we continue to deliver superior health care products to our customers and value to our shareholders. We look forward to 2015 with enthusiasm and confidence.","Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I want to start with the guidance. It looks like the -- if I look at your FY '15 guidance versus consensus, the underlying picture's the same, but the principal difference is the impact from FX looks like it's a little bit more than The Street was modeling. And obviously, The Street was still assuming a share count. So when we think about the base off of which we add in CareFusion, any additional comments you want to make? I mean, you said at the time of the CareFusion acquisition, double-digit EPS accretion in year 1. Anything else we should be thinking about just to get our models more in line with your comments today?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So Mike, it's Vince. It was really difficult to understand what you were saying. What I picked up was that the guidance for 2015 was broadly in line on an FX-neutral basis. And so underlying, it was pretty much, I think, what you would have expected, most people would have expected, but also some people did not have the share -- cessation of the share repurchase in their estimates. So that was the first point. The second point was you were asking us, was there any update to the acquisition guidance that we're giving at all? There really isn't, but I'll ask Chris if there's anything else he'd like to say on that.","Christopher R. Reidy","I'd like to say a couple of things, Mike. You're absolutely right that there was a mixed bag out there, a lot of moving parts, apples and oranges in terms of looking forward on '15, not the least of which is moving to a cash EPS. So I think this chart that we -- we've put up, Slide 15, was an attempt to kind of walk through that so we're all on the same page. So we got you the cash EPS. What we wanted to show is the underlying performance is very strong and consistent with what we've done over the last few years, and what we have as a goal is the 9% to 10%. We do get an impact of the fact that we're suspending the share buybacks in anticipation of the CareFusion deal of about 1%, and then the other is the headwinds from foreign currency. And we went into some detail to kind of give you not only the sense for the year, but how much of that impact is in the first quarter. So hopefully, that gets everybody on the same page. In terms of going forward on CareFusion, we'll provide much more clarity on that as we approach the deal and the deal close. And really nothing to update from what we talked about upon the announcement of the deal of the significant low-teens kind of accretion and the performance from an ROIC standpoint, et cetera. So really just a reiteration of that. Nothing new to report. We'll certainly keep everyone up-to-date as the deal progresses.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. If I can follow up with one other question. And hopefully, the connection's fine here. We've had companies report different data points on the emerging markets this quarter. Your performance was strong, but we've had companies talk about Brazil not really growing this quarter. And that's as much outside of health care as in. And then there's been a number of reports about China slowing outside of health care. Are you seeing either of those end markets slow in your business? Any reason for concern that you're seeing?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So Mike, this is Vince. No, we haven't seen emerging markets slowing down, and that's across-the-board in our product categories. So it appears to us that even though there's some macroeconomic factors out there in those marketplaces, for our categories and kind of fundamentals, the governments are still investing in health care, and we saw a strong performance across-the-board, not just in China, but in all geographies. But thanks for those questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to start with one question, Vince, to follow-up on your pipeline discussion at the end of the call, and most specifically on the BD Rx side of the business. I think you did give us a number of updates about key new products coming in the 2016 time frame. But maybe you can just sort of help give us a broader update on that franchise, how things are going with respect to gaining traction with group purchasing organizations and where you are sort of in developing an appropriate-sized product bag to make yourselves more competitive with the bigger players.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. So as I mentioned in my remarks, it has been going slower, number one, and we have started to get some traction in the last quarter. But it's really fundamental to us to reorient that product line towards products that are really -- it's where safety errors, drug errors are much more important from a safety aspect. And I mentioned that we'll have 2 drugs coming out in 2016, which have those characteristics. So we're on a ramp that is slower than we thought. So we don't believe we're going to hit those initial targets in the time frame that we were talking about a couple of years ago. But we remain committed to the business. Anything else you would want to say from a portfolio standpoint, Tom?","Tom Polen","David, this is Tom. I think, Vince, the only thing I can add is that -- to your question, David, we actually have put BD Rx successfully to a number of the large GPO agreements, so we do have that in place. We have 4 drugs launched today. As you think about -- really one of those fits that high-risk, high-value molecule, that's morphine. And as Vince mentioned earlier, the next 2 that fit that high need in a prefilled format are launching in 2016. So we'll continue to keep you updated as those progress.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can I ask a financial follow-up question?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So maybe just looking at the guidance just on cash flow for fiscal 2015, and maybe, Chris, you could sort of comment on what looked to be a very significant step-up in CapEx in the fourth quarter. It looks like almost it's a doubling of where the run rate has been on a quarterly basis. And then what sort of drives the -- what's driving the CapEx side and what's driving the $100 million increase in free cash flow guidance for fiscal '15?","Christopher R. Reidy","Sure. So the CapEx situation, as we had talked about a few times last year, we're looking at spending more capital internationally, and some of that is going into our plants within China, for example. And so a lot of that hits -- it's a lumpy kind of thing, and we knew it would be and we kind of expected it to hit in the fourth quarter. So we weren't surprised by that. And so we came in about where we expected to for the year. We have ramped that up again next year and pretty much for the same reason, a little bit more in the way of international spending, which we think is prudent and certainly is resulting in good returns. In terms of operating cash flow, really it's the total income flowing down through the operating cash flow. Sometimes that gets a little lumpy, as you know, in terms of timing of payments, et cetera, and the working capital. But as we look out next year, we see most of that flowing through, and everything else kind of staying neutral. So you get the benefit of that going up in the total cash flow.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rick Wise of Stifel.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, U.S. Medical, can you give us a little more color? U.S. Medical seemed a bit soft. I mean, I guess that's U.S. Safety. Any more color on what's happening there? I mean, it sounds like you see the environment as stable. Just remind us again what's happening there -- happened there in the fourth quarter and what may or may not change in the year ahead.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Tom Polen will do that for you, Rick.","Tom Polen","Rick, this is Tom. So as you said, as we've mentioned before, the U.S. market we do view as mature from a Safety perspective, but we also view it as stable. One of the things to note is that, in addition, the U.S. Safety sales in the quarter did reflect a small regional reclassification of certain sales related to the Safety Syringe acquisition. And so with that reclass, actually growth was slightly positive for the quarter in the Medical segment. And due to this change, our U.S. Safety growth rate may be just a little bit lighter for the next couple of quarters, with a corresponding uptick in international as that reclassification annualizes.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. And Vince, some of your recent public comments on G&A, you basically said, I think publicly, that x the China investment and EVEREST, that G&A is coming down and you're starting to see it come down. You used language like that, if I'm quoting you accurately. Just remind us, where are you with those investments. And just specifically on China, do you have to keep spending the $40 million per year to drive the growth we're seeing? Does that come to an end at some point? Just any more color there would be helpful.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. So Rick, that's 2 pieces. One is overall G&A has been coming down as a percent of sales as we move processes into shared service centers around the globe, and we believe we have much more to do in that area, number one. Number two, as we look at synergies with CareFusion, we'll be taking an all-in company look at that from an end-to-end business process standpoint. So more work to be done there and more opportunity. Now in terms of investments in emerging markets, it's more the investment in the sales and marketing side. There is some investment in G&A, but less going into G&A, more going into coverage build as we build into Tier 2 in China, and we continue to expand coverage in other geographies. In this plan, Rick, for 2015, we continue to have a significant investment in emerging markets to drive top line growth. So it's not so much G&A as it is the sales and marketing side.","Operator","Your next question is coming from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","Scott Alan Lange","This is actually Scott Lange in for David Lewis. Just 2 quick ones for me. First, Vince or Bill, you've now had the chance to spend some more time with CareFusion management and delve a little deeper into the integration planning. Can you share your updated thoughts around the fit of Infection Prevention? And also the ventilation business and whether that's a priority, longer term, for the pro forma company?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So I'll take that one. We're still very early on in terms of looking at the portfolio. What I've said is that we will go through the same kind of strategic review we go through all of our product lines, number one. Number two, we'd be looking to see if we can develop leading positions with those product lines. And then based on that, we'll decide exactly where we're going to invest our money. And that work will go on over the next few months and will crystallize where we're going to come out, but it would be premature to say anything past that. We have seen some very exciting opportunities in those businesses. So we'll get back to you later as we clarify both strategically and financially on the deal.","Scott Alan Lange","Fair enough. Can you also comment a little bit on share dynamics within Diagnostics, in particular in the molecular space? And also, give us some color as to why restructure the operations now versus later on down the line?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So I'll take the second half of the question, and then I'll ask Linda and Alberto to comment specifically about Diagnostics and Life Sciences. So the work that we started was about a year ago to look at more solutions for the customer, and we started around individual businesses. You saw that in microbiology with the acquisition of KIESTRA, and you've seen how successful we have been with that plug-in acquisition. Linda's role on the Life Science side started with 2 of the 3 businesses, and the idea was to begin the work on what strategies can we develop more broadly around solutions, leveraging across the segment. We have not restructured the segment nor restructured those businesses. But this is more of a strategic thrust, looking at how we work across businesses and strategies that cross -- that can cross those businesses. And Linda started that work a year ago, and we will accelerate that work. Some of that work resulted in the acquisition of GenCell. So that's that piece. If we come to what's happening in Molecular, Linda, I'll ask you to make a first comment, and maybe Alberto will fill in some details.","Linda M. Tharby","Sure. So thanks, Linda here. So first on the Molecular side, just broadly. As we've reported, we continue to see some share loss relative to our ProbeTec business; and also in our Women's Health and Cancer, also affected by the interval testing. We also, though, on a share gain, are doing very well with our core micro business, with our flu business and also increased placements on our MAX systems. Alberto, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.","Alberto Mas","No, I think that's where -- we're seeing most of the share loss in the ProbeTec business, as you mentioned. On some older platforms, we're seeing some much more modest share erosion in some of the MRSA. But with the new assay in MRSA XT, we think that we can actually regain the momentum backwards. And also with our enteric launches and -- we think that we can build that momentum. But we're growing the other categories in MAX. So we're actually very happy with the momentum that we're actually getting with the platform.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Alberto, you might want to comment on where we stand with that one big account that we lost, which has been the majority of the share loss.","Alberto Mas","That's on the CT\/GC side, and it's -- we expect a little bit more of -- it's mostly behind us, is the good news.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes.","Alberto Mas","So that's going to be annualized into -- going into next year. There's still a little bit still left in the first quarter, but to a much lesser extent this year. And after that, we're basically done and annualized.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So year-on-year, we're starting to see the growth rate in that business go up when you net all that together, right?","Alberto Mas","Correct.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to go back, Chris, on the comments you'd made on the operating margin side. Can you maybe just go back and parse out how much of the operating margin movement is related to FX and pension? And then, what the kind of core expansion is for '15 relative to what you saw in '14?","Christopher R. Reidy","Sure. So let's start, Kristen, with '14. '14 was basically about 70 basis points of underlying margin expansion, which was in line with what our expectations were. But as we had said throughout last year, we actually had a pension tailwind last year based on where the interest rates were as of the beginning of last year. So that accounted for about half of that. And then on a -- on a kind of a reported basis, including FX, you had about 70 basis points of FX pressure. And then just to complete the dots there, you also had additional 20 of the medical device tax, which flowed into the first quarter. So essentially the way to think about that is 70 basis points underlying and offset essentially by FX, and then a little bit of pressure down of 20 basis points for Medical device. As we look at '15, we're looking at the underlying margin expansion being 40 to 50 basis points. But as you probably know, pension flips the other way and the interest rates go the other way. And about half of that 40 to 50 will be pension headwinds going forward. We get a little bit of pressure from FX and not quite as much on the margin basis, as you saw this year. So probably 20 basis points or thereabouts of pressure from FX in the operating margin going forward.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So the pension amount is not included within the 40 to 50. So it's 40 to 50 underlying.","Christopher R. Reidy","That's right.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then pension takes that down about half?","Christopher R. Reidy","About half, exactly. So kind of a flip to the story in '14.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Perfect. And then just in terms of CareFusion, I know there's been a lot of discussion out there on their aspirations for operating margin improvement. So I think they've quantified about 100 basis points here. Can you maybe just help us understand what you've said related to the acquisition with the incremental cost synergies and some of the margin expansion that you may be looking towards that may perhaps double count if -- some people are looking at their targets?","Christopher R. Reidy","Sure. Yes, thanks. So what we had said when we made the announcement is that there would be $250 million of synergies, as you know. Now when we were looking at the pricing and what we would be interested in paying for CareFusion, we did our own modeling. We actually did baseline that at around 70 basis points of margin improvement, which is, quite frankly, still pretty high-stepping to get to 70 basis points, and a lot has to happen. So that's the way we valued it, and the $250 million was incremental to that. If you were modeling 100 basis points a year for the next 3 years, you should think maybe $200 million on top of the 100 basis points. So there is about a $50 million overlap on some of the things that we think are more likely to be done as we -- through synergies than would have been able to be done on a standalone basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First question, just hoping some additional details on the Diabetes franchise. I'm just trying to get a little better handle on the background from the underlying growth, and just talk to us a little bit about the sustainability here.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Tom Polen can take that. You saw it was another strong quarter for Diabetes Care. Tom?","Tom Polen","Bill, this is Tom. As you mentioned, overall a strong year for diabetes, driven, as Vince mentioned before, by new product launches, specifically the Nano Pen Needle, which continues to have very strong adoption around the world. I think in regards to your question around underlying growth, obviously in Q4, we did have a very strong quarter at 8.1%. Q4 was favorably impacted by a prior year comparison, and we do believe that, that growth rate is a little bit above the underlying growth of the business. And so we think back in perspective of the Medical segment growth in '15 guidance being in that 4.5% to 5%, we certainly see Diabetes Care on the upper side of that as one of the higher-growth businesses within the segment. And we see that sustaining going forward, which is maybe not at that rate that you're seeing in Q4 due to some onetime activity there.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then just thinking about the flu season. Obviously, the Southern Hemisphere has been going through or went through a pretty severe one. There's some expectations here that we're going to see that ramp up this year as well. Certainly, we've seen some companies suggest that we've seen a little bit of stocking of product ahead of kind of the traditional season. So I'd be just curious what you guys are thinking about the flu season here for this coming year or kind of what's dialed into guidance, et cetera.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Alberto will take that one for you.","Alberto Mas","So our assumption is based on a normal flu season, that's what's incorporated into our numbers. Having said that, we are seeing some early stocking. You're right. But right now, we're not taking -- we're not assuming the assumption that this will -- that this eventually will filter through the system. And we're still assuming that, overall, it's going to be a normal flu season. If it's above that, obviously we'll communicate that at that point.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Your initial growth guidance range for the year is a little bit more narrow than we've seen from you guys. Last couple of years, you've guided to a broader range. This year, it's a little bit tighter. Just wondering if that is indicative of more confidence in the outlook, better visibility heading into fiscal '15 or something along those lines.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So I would say probably better visibility, and we've had a couple of years of a more stable environment. So that kind of gave us the confidence to narrow the range, nothing more than that at this point in time.","Christopher R. Reidy","We narrowed the range last year fairly quickly. I think right at the end of the first quarter, we narrowed it pretty closely. So not that different.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And years ago, when we saw big changes in oil prices, we used to talk about related fluctuations in resin prices and how that might impact your margin outlook. Over the years, you've clearly made pretty significant efforts to mitigate this impact. I just wanted to make sure that there isn't any potential for margin benefit associated with this dynamic heading into fiscal '15.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So there's 2 different things going on. One is the price of oil is coming down, and of course, we would see that as a good thing. But there is not the capacity in the resin market to let all of that flow through. In fact, there was a problem at one of the plants. There was a fire at one of the suppliers. So capacity is tight. So we are not forecasting that flowing through for the time being. That could change over time. But right now, we don't have any visibility to that.","Christopher R. Reidy","And you do get a little bit of a lift in terms of shipping prices, or whatever, from vendors as oil prices go down, and that's already baked in.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Vince or Chris, in terms of the debt related to the CareFusion deal, are you able to lock that in, those debt terms in earlier rather than later at all? And when would you expect to complete or start the financing or the funding for that?","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes, the answer is you can. As you know, the interest rates ticked down a bit fortuitously, and so we were able to take the opportunity to lock in some of that appropriately. And so we did take the opportunity to do that. We're in the process of rolling that out right now in terms of when we would actually do the financing. As we get greater visibility to different things like HSR, that type of thing, we'll have more confidence. But clearly, you want to do that in advance of the closing as you're gaining confidence in terms of the -- when the timing, more than anything else, of the close from an HSR standpoint. So you would see us do that in advance, particularly to take advantage of the rate environment.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And secondly, in terms of the restructuring or workforce reduction, what should we anticipate for the payback for that action to be in '15?","Christopher R. Reidy","It's in the guidance, and so some of that does flow through. Maybe a 1\/4 of that amount would flow through because of the amount, the severance payment and the like.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Weinstein of William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A question on the infusion set launch. It looks like it's a little bit ahead of where the guidance was for the launch. Can you talk about what changed there? And also can you comment a little bit on the market opportunity and how fast you expect to penetrate this?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So it's very close to what we were thinking, Brian. So nothing significant changed. We're making good progress on getting the manufacturing equipment installed and whatnot, that's probably the biggest thing. But Tom, anything else that you would say on that?","Tom Polen","No, I think we'll obviously continue to update, post approval, more information on our launch timing. We're certainly, Brian, we're very excited about the -- this is a logical adjacency to our core diabetes pen and syringe business and add another growth driver to that organization. And we do see the opportunity to take that product both direct and through partnerships, and I think that's all we'd comment on at this point in time.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, Chris, can you comment a little bit about FX exposure by currency and kind of update us on that? And then typically we had thought about 30% to 40% of your top line exposure kind of falling through to the bottom line, given the fact that you're not doing any hedging. Has that changed at all?","Christopher R. Reidy","Sure. So the impact that you will see -- because clearly everyone knows that the euro is down comparatively with all of last year, all of '14 for the most part. In fact, we pegged this at $1.27, it's down even a tick from that. And -- but then you also see weakness in the Japanese yen year-over-year. The Brazilian real is weak. The Canadian dollar is weaker. So all of those things, as I said my prepared remarks, they were significantly down, particularly in the first quarter. And so that's why the impact in the first quarter is greater on the bottom line than the 400 basis points we said for the year. It's really impacting the first quarter. In terms of the other way to think about it, it's difficult to give any kind of direction on that because, as you know, we have the profit and inventory impact, and we've talked a lot about that. If you remember in the first quarter of last year, it was kind of hitting us. And so it's hard to give any particular guidance around how much drops to the bottom. It depends on an awful lot of different factors. So it's hard to model, is probably what I'm saying, because of the profit and the inventory piece.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar of ISI Group.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I think most of my questions have been asked. I had a couple of follow-ups. One I guess, Chris, you were mentioning on the deal closure timing. So apart from HSR, is there -- are there any other regulatory approvals that we need to be aware of, which could cause some uncertainty around the closure timing?","Christopher R. Reidy","Well, it is the HSR and Europe, the equivalent in Europe would be the other. So those would be the most variable. And then obviously, you have the SEC review. We'll be filing the S-4 shortly, very shortly, and then that kind of starts the clock on their review. And which the hope is that the 2 of them come together nicely, but it is very variable. So we'll update you more on that as things progress.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then one follow-up on the guidance front. When you look at your Life Science segment, really I thought the growth assumptions out there were better than expectation. I mean, particularly on Bioscience. Is this all new product driven? Or can you talk about sort of what's really driving growth in the Biosciences?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So in Biosciences, you saw some really nice bounce back last year in the high-end instrumentation and some good performance with the Sirigen dyes as well. So you have that as the fundamental. And I think, Linda, we're forecasting that to continue to improve, and you have some new products that you're launching.","Linda M. Tharby","Yes. So thanks, Vince. So across the board in our Life Sciences business, first of all, you saw we see increased stability in both U.S. and Europe in terms of the funding environment, and then very strong performance in our emerging markets business. So as Vince commented on, our Life Science research reagents, very strong performance, upside in clinical or instrument base and also our AB business. So across the board, seeing some nice growth. We expect, again, 4.5% to 5% heading into next year, which is pretty much what we saw this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I had 2 questions on the gross margin. If you look at fiscal 4Q, it came in 70 basis points below our forecast. Now I'm just wondering, did the gross margin come in below your forecast as well? And I know pricing wasn't a big hit, and I was wondering if you can give us any put and takes and any additional color. And then as my follow-up, I think you may have -- hopefully, I wrote this down correctly, you're guiding to a 52% gross margin for fiscal '15, which is an improvement over fiscal -- just over fiscal 4Q. And if I wrote this down correctly, what are some of the improvements and drivers of the better gross margin for next year?","Christopher R. Reidy","Okay. So let me take a shot at that. For the fourth quarter, it came in pretty much upon our expectations. So we had been talking about the drag from pricing in the fourth quarter all year long. So that hit about where we expected. The only thing that I would say, it was probably about a 10 basis points more FX drag than we had anticipated, so that was the biggest difference from what our expectations are. And then I'm trying to think of what your other question was. Oh, the -- in terms of going forward, margin guidance, take a look at the chart that we took you through on Chart 16, because we reset on an adjusted cash EPS basis. And so the full year gross profit margin for fiscal 2014 was 51.2%, but then adjusted on a cash EPS basis kind of new foundation, that's 52%, and our guidance was about 52% as well. Now we actually get a little bit of a lift from operational improvements, the traditional things, ReLoCo and continuous improvement. But we also said that we have some unfavorable pricing in '15 and some pension headwinds as well, and the combination of those things get you at about 52%. So hopefully that gets you there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Ravi Misra - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","This is Ravi in for Rich. Just a question on the Ebola and potential government spending. Is there any of that built into the Biosciences guidance? Or are you considering any potential spending allocation increases there in that segment?","Vincent A. Forlenza","No, we have not built that in -- we don't have any direct visibility to any program that we could put in at this point in time. As we said, we are doing some work with partners on some diagnostic test development, but we don't think it's a big opportunity at this point.","Ravi Misra - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Great. And then sort of maybe the last one is a little bit more on GenCell, trying to understand the company's longer-term aspirations in Next-Gen Sequencing.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Linda can talk to that.","Linda M. Tharby","So thanks. Very excited about the acquisition of GenCell. Really if you think about the company, GenCell and then the NGS space, we really see a big movement now occurring from the research to the clinical space. And as we looked at overall NGS and an upfront sample and library prep, the fact that this takes upwards of 2 days to occur today is just too long if we bring it to the clinic. So GenCell really provided us the opportunity to get into that library prep space and really consolidate the workflow, automation, scalable throughput. So a lot of advantages we see here. And then as you think longer term about BD's position in the space, thinking about the work we do today with QIAGEN on our sample collection side and being able to expand upon that right through to the work we do in Diagnostics. As this moves to infectious disease, we see a lot of opportunities to provide BD skills combined with the technology of GenCell over the long term.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So this is a very targeted play that Linda was talking about. We're not talking about going into sequencing. This is really leveraging, as Linda was mentioning, capability we have that comes out in Molecular Diagnostics and sample processing, PAS, also in sample collection and sample processing that we have had a joint venture, that's what Linda was mentioning. For a number of years now, that has been growing quite nicely. So it's a sample processing, laboratory prep, automation, leveraging the skills we have down at DS. So it's all of that together, but in a very targeted way.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A lot of my questions have been answered, but I just want to clarify something. On your guidance for '15, does this include anticipated financing for the CareFusion acquisition in your interest expense? I guess, can you give us some clarity on sort of like your net interest income or interest expense guide?","Christopher R. Reidy","Sure. No, it doesn't anticipate any additional financing for CareFusion. We wouldn't know the timing, et cetera. So it's not in there.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the -- even on an adjusted fiscal '14 basis, your -- even in '15, your tax rate's down pretty significantly next year. How sustainable is that? And can you remind us on the combined tax rate that you're looking at for BD and CareFusion?","Christopher R. Reidy","Sure. So as you've seen over the last 3 or 4 years, we've made very good progress on the effective tax rate, bringing it down from somewhere north of 28% to this current range. You saw a good performance. We've done a lot in terms of building out legal entities internationally and putting structures in place. So you continue to see the benefit of that flowing through the rate as well. And as we think about the combination with CareFusion, I think as I mentioned when we had that call, that we just took their tax rate and our rate combined. We didn't evaluate it or we didn't include any synergies. What we did include is the tax yields from the financing, the debt that we had. So that was in the neighborhood of 50 to 100 basis points. Hard to calculate because there's a lot of moving parts, so we gave you the number. But longer term, we do see an opportunity to get some synergies and to put some of their revenues into our structure. And as we drive their revenues internationally, you'll see some benefit of that as well. But that's more blocking and tackling that needs to occur over the first couple of years and will bear fruit going forward. So continued sustainability of the ability to get the rate down. I think I've talked about the fact that when we look at our peer group, they tend to be still better than where we are. We're getting closer, but that's stuff that is basic blocking and tackling that we've been putting in place for years, and we're now seeing the fruit of that each and every year. One thing that I would mention about next year is that we do have the potential for the R&D tax credit to be reenacted. And so the way to think about that is if it does happen, the low end of our range would be more likely. And if it doesn't, we'll be above that, but it does contemplate the potential for that to occur as well. I guess my answer was too long.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Massaro of Canaccord Genuity.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Maybe a question for Alberto. Could you please update us on the installed base of the BD Veritor, maybe discuss the competitive environment dynamics? And are you guys planning any additional investments in the technology, I'm thinking maybe cloud-based solutions or the like?","Alberto Mas","Yes. So our -- we estimate our installed base at the end of the quarter to be around 14,000 units. So that's where we are on that. And yes, we are working on our next-generation Veritor that will have connectivity associated with it. So yes, we are working on that, in addition to other assays as well.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes. Okay. Thanks very much, Mark.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And maybe just a quick follow-up. What is the timing of CT\/GC on BD MAX?","Alberto Mas","So as mentioned the -- in Europe, we're -- it's filed, so we're waiting for the approval that we're estimating around Q3. That's when we estimate the approval in Europe.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Right. And then for the U.S.?","Alberto Mas","For the U.S., we're working on a next-generation assay that will be more into '16, and we'll update when we have a little bit more visibility on the date.","Operator","With that, I will turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Okay. So thank you very much for your participation today. It was a pleasure to update you on a strong performance in 2014 and some strong guidance for 2015. We will be updating you on progress with the CareFusion acquisition as that gets closer, and we look forward to doing that and talking to you soon. Thank you very much.","Christopher R.

It will be available for replay through August 7, 2014, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at (800) 585-8367 for domestic calls and area code (404) 537-3406 for international calls, using confirmation number 69111053. [Operator Instructions]","Beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin.","Monique Dolecki","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third fiscal quarter results.","As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","Current quarter results include a pretax charge within R&D of $9 million, or $0.03 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, relating to program asset write-offs and obligations. For the purposes of our conference call today, we will refer to adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding this charge, and other items detailed in the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Administration; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, Group President; Linda Tharby, Group President; and Alberto Mas, Vice President of Diagnostic Systems.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. As we stated in our press release, we were pleased with our solid performance this quarter. As you already know, there have been a number of changes in the marketplace in which we compete, but we are operating in a very dynamic health care environment. Our consistent performance demonstrates that our strategy remains sound.","Moving on to our quarterly results. We achieved record revenues this quarter, and EPS growth was solid, as we expected. We saw strong core product growth, coupled with our recent acquisitions, which are overall performing in line with our expectations.","Revenue growth in the third quarter was once again driven by our Medical and Biosciences segments. Diagnostics international growth was partially offset by continued challenges in the U.S. We saw continued strong international Safety and emerging market sales, and they remain key growth drivers for the company. Based on our third quarter and year-to-date results, we feel confident in our previously communicated revenue and EPS guidance ranges. We will review our guidance for the full year in more detail shortly.","On Slide 5, we've outlined our third quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company revenues were solid, increasing by 4.6%. Fully diluted adjusted EPS came in at $1.68, which grew 7.8% in the quarter.","Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our third quarter financial performance.","Christopher R. Reidy","Thanks, Vince. Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by discussing the key financial highlights for the third quarter.","As Vince just mentioned, revenue growth was driven by both core products and acquisitions performing in line with our expectations, with all segments contributing to growth. The quarter was impacted by the reversal of some favorable timing matters from the first half of the year, as we anticipated and shared with you earlier in the year. Pricing was about flat for the quarter.","We also completed an additional $187 million of our share repurchase plan, bringing our year-to-date total repurchases to $400 million. As we continue to focus on new products and innovation, we remain disciplined as we evaluate our portfolio.","In our reported results this quarter, you will see a pretax charge of $9 million, or $0.03 diluted earnings per share, resulting from our decision to end the continuous glucose monitoring program, or CGM. We have reallocated those resources to other areas of our Diabetes Care portfolio, in addition to our broader R&D efforts.","Overall, we are pleased with our results, and we are on track to deliver on our commitment of 4.5% to 5% revenue growth and 11% to an 11.5% EPS growth for the full fiscal year.","On Slide 8, I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. Third quarter revenue growth was 4.6% for the total company. BD Medical third quarter revenues increased 4.7%. Growth in this segment was primarily driven by strong sales in our Medical Surgical Systems unit, which grew 6%. We saw a continued strength in emerging markets and international Safety sales.","Revenue growth in Diabetes Care was 3.6%. This reflects continued strength of pen needles, partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period and the timing of the tender order. We expect growth in this unit to normalize in the fourth quarter.","Pharmaceutical Systems growth was 3.4%, which reflects the reversal of a favorable timing of orders that occurred in the first half of the year. This is in line with our expectations and consistent with our communications on prior earnings calls.","BD Diagnostics third quarter revenues increased 3.7%. The segment's growth was driven by strong sales in our Preanalytical Systems unit. Growth in Diagnostic Systems was impacted by continued softness in U.S. Women's Health and Cancer.","BD Biosciences revenues increased 6.6%, driven by solid instrument placements, new platforms and continued stability in the research spending environment in the U.S. Growth was also aided by a favorable comparison to the prior year.","Now moving on to Slide 9. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the third quarter. BD's reported U.S. revenues increased 2.8% versus the prior year. We view the environment in the U.S. as stable.","Revenue on our U.S. Medical segment increased by 4.4%, driven by strong growth in Pharmaceutical Systems and solid growth in Medical Surgical Systems. The Diabetes Care unit was impacted by the previously aforementioned difficult comparisons with the prior year period.","Revenues in U.S. Diagnostics declined by 0.2%. This reflects continued softness in Women's Health and Cancer due to extended cervical cancer screening intervals and U.S. share losses, partially offset by solid growth in Preanalytical Systems.","U.S. Biosciences revenue increased 5.1% due to solid instrument placements, reagent growth and a favorable comparison to the prior year.","Moving on to international revenues grew 6% currency neutral, driven by growth in all 3 segments. Medical segment grew 5% and Diagnostics grew 7.3%. Growth in both segments was driven by emerging markets and international Safety sales. The Biosciences segment grew 7.4%, reflecting strong growth in Western Europe and a favorable comparison to the prior year.","On Slide 10, we continued to see strong growth in emerging markets, which accounts -- accounted for approximately 25% of our total revenue. Emerging market revenues grew 8.9% currency neutral over the prior year, bringing our year-to-date growth to 12%. Slightly slower emerging growth this quarter reflects an unfavorable comparison to the prior year in Latin America. Growth is expected to normalize in the fourth quarter.","As expected and discussed on our last call, revenues in China have returned to a more normalized growth rate, coming in this quarter at 20.9%. Sales of safety-engineered products in emerging markets grew 18%.","Moving to global Safety on Slide 11. Currency-neutral sales increased 6.1% and grew to $569 million in the quarter. Revenues in the U.S. grew 1.2%. International sales grew 12.4%, driven by good performance in Western Europe, Asia and Latin America. Medical Safety sales grew 6.6%, driven by a range of safety-engineered products. Diagnostics growth was 5.7% in the quarter. Both segments experienced strong international growth, particularly in emerging markets.","Turning to Slide 12. Gross margin performance in the quarter reflects benefits from ReLoCo, continuous improvement and favorable pension expenses. These items were more than offset by a mix, raw material and start-up costs. Currency had a favorable impact on gross profit by about 10 basis points.","For the total year, we are reducing our gross profit guidance to between 51.2% to 51.4%. This is largely due to the cost to remediate quality issues, including an incremental investment in our manufacturing processes within the Pharmaceutical Systems business that impacts the second half of the year. Additionally, we are seeing continued margin pressures associated with the challenges in our Diagnostic Systems business.","Slide 13 recaps the third quarter income statement and highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. As we discussed, revenues were in line and gross profit came in slightly below our expectations.","SSG&A increased 3.4%. R&D increased 5.4% as we continued to invest in new products. Operating income grew 4.7%, impacted by a lower gross profit in the quarter.","Our tax rate declined by 50 basis points, reflecting the benefits of favorable geographic mix. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $1.68, which represents a 7.8% increase over the prior year. All of these items were in line with our expectations.","Slide 14 recaps the adjusted year-to-date income statement and highlights our foreign currency-neutral results. I'll not review this slide in detail, but I would like to note our year-to-date operating income growth of 7%. Excluding the incremental impact of the medical device tax in the first quarter, underlying operating income growth was 8.2%. Also, despite our lower gross profit expectations for the year, we are still on track to deliver about 70 to 80 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion for the year. As a reminder, about half of the margin expense is the result of favorable pension expenses. All other P&L guidance remains in line with our previously communicated ranges.","Slide 15 illustrates our revenue guidance by segment. We expect revenue growth for the total company to be between 4.5% to 5%. For the BD Medical and BD Biosciences segments, we expect growth to be at the upper end and Diagnostics to be at the lower end of our previously communicated ranges. This assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of about $1.37.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you, Chris. Moving on to Slide 17, I would like to review the program and product launches. As we remain focused on new products and innovation, we're very pleased with the progress we've made. This year, we expect new products to account for approximately 16% of total revenue.","In the Medical segment, we are continuing to make progress on our BD Simplist line of prefilled generic injectables. We currently have 4 drugs approved by the FDA, and we have applied for 4 additional drug approvals. We are continuing to focus on the commercial launch of Morphine, which was approved a few months ago. As we have been sharing with you, we continue to expect that this new initiative will take time to gain traction in the marketplace.","In our Bioscience segment, we continue the launch of our BD FACSPresto. FACSPresto is a portable instrument which is used to stage and monitor HIV\/AIDS patients by analyzing their CD4 and hemoglobin levels. This innovative instrument was created with resource-limited settings in mind, and it can be easily transported to meet customer needs in rural areas.","We are also excited about our Sirigen dye portfolio, which has been making news in the flow cytometry community for its capabilities. We have launched 3 dyes throughout this year, and we plan to launch 3 more before the end of the year.","Turning to Slide 18, you will see the various product launches in Diagnostics. On the BD MAX, our worldwide Enteric Bacteria launch is now underway, with the U.S. launch this quarter. Our Enteric Parasite assay has also launched this quarter in Europe. These unique assays combined our core microbiology and molecular competencies for a novel and rapid approach to enteric testing.","Finally, we are pleased with our new GC\/CT test has been approved on the BD Viper LT platform, in both the USA and Europe. This assay and platform combination will provide midsized testing facilities with the ability to use this smaller, efficient instrument with improved assay functionality. This is the second test approved on the Viper LT, joining BD's CE marked Onclarity HPV Assay with genotyping capabilities. As always, we will continue to update you on the progress as we are -- that we're making with our various pipeline opportunities.","On Slide 19, before we open the call to questions, I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, we are pleased with our solid performance in the third quarter and year-to-date. Second, our consistent performance demonstrates that our strategy remains sound in this dynamic health care environment. Third, we're seeking the continued success with our key growth drivers of geographic expansion, new products and acquisitions, which are overall performing in line with our expectations. Finally, we are pleased to reaffirm our guidance for fiscal year 2014. We believe we are positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to our customers and shareholders. Thank you.","We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Rick Wise of Stifel.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Let me start off with just a bigger-picture question. I hate to quibble about yet another excellent quarter. This was a slightly smaller beat in recent quarters. Chris highlighted a couple of the moving parts there. But just broadly, anything we should appreciate about the quarter and the environment in a bigger-picture sense? And Chris, given the healthy divisional performance with Medical, Diagnostic, Biosciences all at or above your fiscal '14 guidance year-to-date, why wouldn't they do better if they've outperformed 3 quarters in a row through the fiscal year?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So Rick, I'll take the environmental piece then Chris will get into the guidance a little bit. But we had a long discussion here about do we see anything really changing significantly globally, and the answer to that is no. We see the environment primarily as stable and not a whole heck of a lot of change. We know other people have talked about maybe some increased volume coming from the ACA. We don't think we've seen that yet. So -- and the same is true in emerging markets. We see consistency in emerging markets. Obviously, there's always some moving pieces with some of these tenders, but nothing significant in the environment. Chris, you want to add...","Christopher R. Reidy","Right. And Rick, yes, you're absolutely right, we are doing better in...","Vincent A. Forlenza","[indiscernible] mic.","Christopher R. Reidy","It is on.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, okay, fine.","Christopher R. Reidy","We are doing better in the Medical and Biosciences business. We're coming down slightly on Diagnostics. If you do the math, that kind of takes you to the high end of the 4.5% to 5% range, and we thought that the range was tight enough at this point in the year. But you're absolutely right. If you do the math, you're a little bit better on BDX in the midpoint of the range.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. And just a follow-up question. If the -- you talked about the \"difficult U.S. diagnostic environment.\" Maybe a little more color on that. And does the expanding BD MAX and Viper menu help stem the difficult environment or ward off that you've been talking about? Or are these secular changes as opposed to company specific? Just help us understand that a little more.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So to that point, first just one more comment on the guidance. Keep in mind, as we go into the fourth quarter, that we had that large performance with Biosciences, and that was really driven by Japan and the stimulus. So you have a very tough compare there. So that all also figures. In terms of Diagnostics, would you like to comment, Alberto, on what's happening in the U.S. marketplace.","Alberto Mas","Yes, I think the launches that happened this quarter in Enteric, as Vince mentioned, in Bacterial and Parasite in Europe, will give us momentum to continue growth, as expected, in the MAX platform. So I think that would -- definitely will be -- but most of the -- again, the international growth is solid. Our core growth is very solid. And what we're seeing, as we've been saying for a while now, the headwinds are more in the U.S. in Women's Health in terms of the interval testing, some account losses because some of our overall platforms are aging. But fundamentally, we're not seeing any, as Vince reiterated, any huge changes. We just have to execute on our strategy.","Vincent A. Forlenza","And we think we're up to about 70% conversion on the intervals now. But thanks for your questions, Rick.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Vince, it's nice to have you back. It wasn't the same without you last quarter.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Thank you for the [indiscernible].","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So 2 questions, one strategic and one very specific for Chris. So Vince, if we go back to last -- I think if we go back 10 years and think about your diabetes initiatives, specifically the ones to expand your diabetic reach, we talk about the strip and meter business with Nova Biomed and, obviously, the CG mass initiative you announced this morning. So you clearly want to get bigger in diabetes, but some of these partnership models, to be frank, haven't really worked well for the company. So do you think in light of some of these partnership models these last 5 to 10 years, your view on how to get bigger in diabetes changes at all? You've got a lot of reach but not enough products, and these partnerships aren't working. So a very directed question there, and I had one quick follow-up.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. So I don't think it's an issue of it being a partnership model. I think that specifically, right now, this was an issue of technology that we had brought into the company a long time ago. The fact that we partnered on the development of it was really not the issue. The issue was did the technology work or not. And when we got into some human testing, we saw some issues. And so there was a technological failure. It had nothing to do with the partnerships. But we think that the partnerships we've put in place with the JDRF are very important, and we've very enthused with the partnerships that we have on the infusion area. So I certainly wouldn't draw that conclusion. Where I would agree with you is that we're working hard to expand the product portfolio, and this gave us the opportunity to reinforce some of the other programs in Diabetes Care. So I think we're optimistic about the other programs, and we'll be moving ahead.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. You think you're any more likely, Vince, to pursue M&A in diabetes? Is this more likely externally? Or are you still comfortable internally you can grow the portfolio?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, we're still comfortable internally we can grow the portfolio, and we're making good progress on our other programs. But like -- each one of our businesses are challenged with developing solutions for the customer, okay? Whether it's Diabetes Care or Diagnostics or MedSurg, yes, you've seen what we've done across the portfolio. Diabetes Care would also fall under that blueprint. Chris?","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Just last quick one for me. Chris, just the gross margin guidance change for the year, obviously not very dramatic. But the outset for that wasn't clear to me. Is it likely that you offset that pressure through SG&A or more through R&D?","Christopher R. Reidy","It's actually a little bit of both. We're running -- if you look at where we are year-to-date and with the slight improvement on revenue that we were talking about, holding the SG&A line about where we expect it is giving us a little bit more leverage in the fourth quarter. R&D is a favorable compare in the fourth quarter. And I'll remind you that on SG&A, last year we had legal expenses related to RTI in the fourth quarter. So there's a little bit of an easy compare in the fourth quarter as well. The combination of all those factors gets you down to the 7% of operating margin improvement.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Okay. Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the Diabetes business. Can you maybe just talk through, I guess, where exactly you are with some of these other opportunities? I know you talked about the Infusion. That's just -- what would be the expected timeline by which you may have some new announcements to make within Diabetes?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So Bill Kozy will take that question. Bill?","William A. Kozy","Yes, we're focused on the portfolio on Diabetes on 2 programs. First is the insulin infusion. And we're not ready yet to talk about the exact time, but it's certainly within the business planning window here over the next 24 to 36 months that we expect to make significant progress on insulin infusion. And then as we've mentioned before, we are looking at, right now organically, internally, at type 2 opportunities within the -- for insulin delivery. And it's really just too early for us to start talking about that, but those are -- in terms of portfolio management, those are the 2 priorities in that R&D development cycle with Diabetes Care.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted just to come back to the pipeline a little bit. I know, Vince, in your prepared remarks you did you walk through some of the milestones with respect to product launches, both in the U.S. and elsewhere. But very specifically, as you look at maybe BD Diagnostic Systems and then also the BD Rx business, when do you think we can see some of the initiatives in each of those segment lines start to overwhelm some of the macro pressures that you're facing in each of those categories? And how long, really -- how long do you think it takes to build scale there?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Well, let's start with Diagnostics. We expect that this interval issue is -- we're up to about 70% conversion. It's hard to say exactly how much more we have left in that, but we've been thinking it's more than a year before the rest gets converted. I don't know if it tops out at 80%, where we might fall. In terms of ramping up the growth rate, we expect as we move forward into next year and whatnot, it -- this business will be improving. We're excited about what we have going on with KIESTRA. And with these new launches that we talked about with the enteric assays, it's going to give us more traction. The last other key piece, of course, is going to be the BD Viper and getting traction outside the U.S., both on chlamydia and HPV. Alberto, do you want to add anything more to that?","Alberto Mas","I think the only thing that I'll add is that the account loss that we've been talking in last quarters will be played out mostly this fiscal year, a little bit still in the future but mostly in this fiscal year. So that will make it easier from a growth perspective.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes, and that's why I was thinking that when you look at those product launches and you think about annualizing that, you'll start improving forward in that. Now BD Rx. Tom?","Tom Polen","Right. This Tom. I think, as Vince mentioned before, we have 4 drugs approved by the FDA and have applied for 4 additional drug approvals. Well, at this point, we're really focused on the commercial launch of the Morphine as that's our most important drug approval so far. So once we make some progress with the Morphine launch, we'll have more information to share with you on our outlook going forward. Again, as we've previously said on prior calls, this is still a relatively new initiative for us, and it's going to take some time for us to see traction on these products in the marketplace. It's not a fast version product, yes.","Vincent A. Forlenza","It's going to take a few more months for us to understand where we're really at with Morphine. We see that as a [indiscernible].","Tom Polen","And we'll circle back, yes.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Okay?","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar of ISI Group.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So maybe one -- first, a big-picture question for you. And, I mean, Diagnostics, right, you can see the environment changing, a lot of consolidation going. And clearly, you guys have seen the effect, just given the compare of landscape. Do you feel like you guys are at scale within this unit? Or do you feel like you need to add particular platforms just given what some of your competitors like Roche, Danaher, some of the large guys, what they're planning, right? So I'm just trying to think in this changing health care landscape how do you feel about your Diagnostic positioning.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So we actually feel pretty good about our Diagnostic positioning. We don't think there's a lot of crossover, for example, in terms of applying hematology, applying microbiology. We think it's a much more potent strategy to have a complete solution like we had put together in the infectious disease, microbiology area, where we now have total lab automation. What we think we have to do is execute on the programs that we have in place and continue to drive in those segments. We have a lot of pieces like the previous questioner asked. David asked about when is it going take you -- how long is it going to take to get to scale? We have to implement on the assays and the menus that we have talked about and get approval through the FDA. And we're working to get Totalys approved, for example, right now. So it's building out those complete solutions before even getting broader in Diagnostics. It's more the strategic priority.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Robert Justin Marcus - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is actually Robbie Marcus in for Mike. Maybe just ask the first question. You put up another good quarter in Safety products, really good outside the U.S., just 1% growth in the U.S. Can you talk about what kind of runway you see there, both in the U.S. and o U.S.? and how much longer can this good growth last for?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. Tom Polen will answer that question.","Tom Polen","This is Tom. So Safety continues to really remain largely in line with what we've discussed in the past. We see the U.S., acute care market in particular, is -- it already is highly converted, and so we're not expecting any significant trajectory change there going forward and it is mature. The U.S. is -- or the EU is continuing to actively convert, and we see emerging markets at still quite an early stage. Just maybe a little bit more perspective on that. The EU is just under about 50% converted for catheters and about 15% converted for injection devices. And we continue to see really positive market response to the new legislation, with strong growth in both Safety catheters and injection across the majority of the Western European market. I guess it's still early, and we're seeing some really promising signs of broadening Safety implementation and potential in Southern Europe. And certainly, the rate of conversions varies by country there. Maybe just a comment on emerging markets, Safety there continues to go well, as you just mentioned, and we're growing double digits really led by Asia and Latin America in emerging markets. Again, it's still early. We're seeing good progress. We're seeing continued interest in partnering in a number of emerging countries who are really committed to the safety of their health care workers. So I think x U.S., we see a good runway ahead still.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Weinstein of William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just want to follow up on kind of a question that was just asked a little while ago. And that is, given the struggle that you've had in Diagnostics, it would seem to me that it would make sense to continue to invest heavily in some R&D there in specifically places where you have an advantage like in micro where there's new ID products coming out and direct-from-patient products that are beginning to emerge in micro. Can you comment specifically about that -- those types of projects within micro? And then are there areas within Diagnostics that you think might be interesting for additional investments?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes, sure. Alberto Mas will talk to that. Alberto?","Alberto Mas","So it's -- definitely, our core credibility market is in our microbiology franchise that we've built over many, many years. We're very credible there, and we base our strategies on that. And we are definitely watching the radar screen in terms of any technologies and capabilities that we need to add to that portfolio, including all the Directed detection that you mentioned is definitely on the radar screen, and we'll be monitoring that space in -- over time and within our -- on microbiology.","Vincent A. Forlenza","This is Vince. We'll continue to invest in our molecular platforms as well as, obviously, as -- rapid detection methods. We have the partnership with Bruker [ph]. So we are really focused in this area. And as Alberto said, it will be a matter of internal and external kind of plug-in thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So could you talk a little bit about the HPV program? I mean, that's another market where HPV pricing has obviously been coming under pressure. I guess -- and specifically, pressure driven by your major competitor in the CT and G market. Can you talk about how you're pricing that product and sort of your expectations for when that is approved in the U.S., where you'll price it? And I guess how do you see the HPV\/AIDS business, the molecular business, synergizing with what you currently have with your opportunities for bundling and gaining some share back?","Vincent A. Forlenza","So we wouldn't get into the specifics of how we price the product. We would certainly price it competitively. We think we have a good cost position on this product. So we will have flexibility, and we think we can be very competitive with the HPV product. And we don't think about so much as bundling as we do about complete solutions for the customer, total automation, a complete menu and providing more value for the customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Groberg of Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So maybe just a couple of clarifications. First, on gross margin. Chris, would you mind -- I think pricing seemed like it's actually coming in better than you anticipated at the beginning of the year. So can you maybe just give me -- just help us understand exactly again why gross margin is going to be a little lighter than you expected? And then on the launch of the new CT\/GC product, I'm just curious, you had that day. You mentioned, Alberto, the loss in the U.S. Is there any way for you with this new launch -- are you going to -- aggressively trying to gain back that market share? Or -- I'm just -- I'm trying to think how you're going to go about in the U.S. with the launch in CT\/GC, if it's just about stabilizing your share or if you're able to think about more aggressively going after regaining markets that you've had in the past.","Christopher R. Reidy","Sure. Let me start with the pricing and gross profit comment. As we've been saying all year on our pricing focus, the fourth quarter is where we expect to see some negative pressures. Having said that, Q3 was slightly favorable to our expectations, and year-to-date pricing is slightly favorable. So as we now look at, we would anticipate that we'll finish the year flat to slightly negative on pricing, which is a little bit of a lift. And to your point, that drives a little bit of a lift in gross profit. But going back to gross profit, the way to probably think about is for the full year, we're anticipating, consistent with our original guidance, that the drag from FX would be about 60 basis points. Now originally, we said that we thought we could offset that operationally with a positive 60 basis points, and that was driven by the ReLoCo effort, pensions and continuous improvement. Now we expect that to be flat to up 20 basis points operationally. And the impact was the continued pressure from Diagnostic Systems. We brought that revenue guidance down. And that certainly has a mix issue, so that's dragging us down a bit. And as we talked about in our remarks, the remediation of the quality issue on -- in Pharm Systems and the related spend on improving the manufacturing processes puts pressure on it. But the bottom line is we still expect on an operational basis to be flat or slightly up 20 basis points, and the margins are in that 51.2% to 51.4% kind of range. So still very solid margins with a potential for a little bit of lift year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes. Two questions for me. First off, just on emerging markets, guys. It did slow down here in the quarter. I would love some additional color there, particularly considering that we are heading into what looks like probably the most difficult comp here in the fourth quarter.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So in emerging markets, we had strong performance, but there was a timing issue in Latin America on a tender. And that was really the issue. Otherwise, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, China bounced back to where we expected it to be. And overall, we were pleased with the performance with that.","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes, the big thing was Latin America. The year-over-year compare in Latin America was difficult because last year's third quarter was up over 18% in Latin America, and that's the timing of tenders that hit last year that didn't repeat. So that was the big driver. And Vince said China's back up over 20%. We're seeing good, double-digit growth in EMEA. India is very solid. And we are seeing some other timing of tenders in other parts, but we expect that to bounce back to more normalized growth rates going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to start with a question on Sirigen and then just as a quick one on Women's Health. So on Sirigen, you noted the launch of 3 new dyes, plans to launch 3 more by year end. I believe there's also a couple of new lasers available. In combination, this allows for flow cytometry customers to perform higher parameter analysis on existing traditional flow cytometers, which also, importantly, allows customers to subsequently store up the cells if they so choose. So it does seem like you're moving towards a completely competitively unique value proposition with the addition of these dyes and lasers. With all that in mind, how many more dyes are expected in 2015? And how would you describe the demand for higher parameter analysis given some of the bioinformatics hurdles that exist in flow cytometry? And then quickly on Women's Health, would you be willing to quantify the year-over-year impact of intervals versus the loss of the account? And you did indicate the vast majority of the burden associated with the account loss is expected to be incurred by the end of the fiscal year. When does that negative base effect get annualized? Is that really in the second half of next fiscal year where the account loss becomes less of a headwind?","Vincent A. Forlenza","Sure. So I'm going to move you into the flow cytometry marketing group. You really stated the value proposition very well, but I'll turn that to Linda.","Linda Tharby","Thanks so much for the question. So as you noted, doing multiparameter analysis in flow cytometry is becoming more and more important. So very excited about the opportunity to bring together, as you mentioned, both the improved colored parameter on our flow cytometers with the Sirigen platform. So we did discuss that we intend to repeat the performance that you saw in Q4 that we saw in terms of new launches of dyes that we saw in Q3, which is 3. I can't speak on a go-forward basis, but you would expect us to continue to roll out many new dyes and many new SKUs related to our Sirigen platform. It's really helping to power both the traditional immunology and also some expansion into single-cell parameter analysis in the broader area of genomics. So very excited about that.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Alberto, are you going to pick up the other piece?","Alberto Mas","Yes. In terms of the -- our SurePath business, we estimate that about 2\/3 of the impact is driven by interval extension and 1\/3, more or less, off from an account loss perspective. Just to put it into perspective as well, the performance of the quarter, if you normalize for the big account loss that we've been referencing, would have been 3.9%. So I want to put that into context as well. And this will normalize in the first half of next year.","Vincent A. Forlenza","3.9% positive.","Alberto Mas","3.9% positive, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Newitter of Leerink.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Vincent, if I could just ask a quick big picture and then just a follow-on, if you have time. The sort of the bigger picture, just we're seeing more consolidation, particularly across the medical device landscape. But elsewhere in health care, scale is increasingly becoming a topic of focus. I'd love to just hear your thoughts on where within your businesses you think scale actually has a significant advantage, if at all. And if you can comment on your view just of the consolidating landscape that we're seeing and where Becton stands today.","Vincent A. Forlenza","So we're not a believer in scale for scale's sake. Our strategy is really focused on creating complete solutions for the customer and driving value that way. We think that, that aligns much more with the basic customer needs and how buying processes are evolving. So we really think strategically around each one of these business units and how they can build out solutions. And if you look at how we might work across business units to create more complete solutions, it's a second element of our strategy that we are developing. All of that lines up with -- more with our plug-in M&A strategy. And so that's really the core of what we're trying to do. And certainly, there are people who are playing this out differently in terms of just more and more breadth, but that's not what we're attempting.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, just a follow-up on the gross margin. I understand the issue that you're facing here in the near term and the offset being lower SG&A. But as you look at the gross margin going forward, what specifically can you do to address some of the pressures that you're facing? For example, as you look at ReLoCo, is there a little bit more from ReLoCo that you can extract? And then second, on the ACA and volumes, Vince, I understand that you said you didn't see much of a benefit here in the quarter. But I would imagine hospital volumes and physicians are just going to pick up and momentum's going to grow from the ACA. So does this benefit your U.S. business over the next 6 to 12 months?","Christopher R. Reidy","I'll start on the gross profit margins. I think if you look at the performance that we would have had excluding these 2 pressures, which are focused on in-year pressures, we would have had 60 basis points of improvement. ReLoCo has been very successful for us. It's -- we're still seeing benefits from that this year of around $30 million. And initially, it was a bit larger, but we're still seeing some benefits from that. So without giving guidance on gross profit margin for future years, which we will do on the next call, I don't think you should view this kind of pressure as having a significant impact on our ability to drive margin growth, either at the gross profit or at the operating margin going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Taylor of Barclays.","Daniel Sollof - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's actually Dan in for Matt. I just had a follow-up on SG&A. It came in better than we're expecting it. It's actually lower than it's been for a while. So I just wanted to ask, is there -- was there anything like deferral of spend, at least on a percentage of sales basis that, like, helped this quarter? Is this like a base where we can kind of, like, further leverage off of? I'm just kind of curious for some more color there.","Vincent A. Forlenza","Yes, the best way to look at SG&A, I think, is for the year-to-date, and I think that's a pretty good indicator of where we'll be going forward. You're right, we're seeing some positives. We'll actually see a little bit more of a positive in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, with the easy compare. But we are seeing leverage in the SG&A line. So that's positive.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, on the operating margin outlook, I know that you had mentioned half of the expansion this year is coming from favorable pension. Just how should we think about -- that the opportunities for margin expansion? You commented on gross margins seemingly having a runway for expansion, but you did also mention quality spending. How long does that last? And are you still kind of more in the investment spend area for emerging markets as well?","Christopher R. Reidy","Well, we are investing in emerging markets. We're continuing to do that, as we have said. So we have that investment. We are making the investment this year. And we're just in the middle of our budgeting process, so how much of that extends into future years is still a question. Right now, it's a focus in-year more than anything else, but we'll give more color on that going forward. And so overall, we are making the right investments. We're investing in R&D but at the same time being very focused on reducing SG&A and improving the gross profit line, as we said, through ReLoCo. So there's a lot of levers that we're pulling while still making sure we're making the right investment that makes sense to drive future revenue growth and drive both. And we think we have evidence that we've been able to do that consistently to drive additional margin growth. Last year, it was 25%. And this year, 70% to 80%, with about half coming from pension. But again, continuous improvement in driving additional margin. So we'll talk more about that as we give guidance for next year on that as well.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","A follow-up. I'm just thinking about microbiology, guys. You've been in a nice position here relative to your principal competitor having some manufacturing challenges over the better part of the last year. Supposedly, this is going to be rectified here roughly by the end of this year. So how are you thinking about that competitive dynamic and just the franchise in general?","Vincent A. Forlenza","I think in terms of microbiology, we feel very good about the product line that we've put together. Alberto, would you like to comment further?","Alberto Mas","Yes, we definitely have had a strong quarter, especially in our BACTEC blood culture business that also was -- began to pick up in the last quarter. But we're seeing very, very healthy growth rates in that part of the business for sure.","Vincent A. Forlenza","All right. Well, thank you very much. Are there any more questions, operator?","Operator","There are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Vince Forlenza for closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza","I want to thank all of you for joining us today. It was a pleasure updating you on the quarter. We look forward to getting back with you next quarter and providing you with our guidance going forward. But we're very pleased with the strong results, and thank you for your attention.

It will be available for replay through August 9, 2018, on the Investors page of the bd.com website or by phone at 1-800-585-8367 for domestic calls and area code 404-537-3406 for international calls using confirmation number 278 8137. I would like to inform all parties that your lines have been placed in a listen only mode until the question-and-answer segment.","And beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin your conference.","Monique N. Dolecki - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.","During today's call we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.","As previously disclosed in April 2018, the company divested its remaining interest in the Vyaire Medical joint venture. The company received gross cash proceeds of approximately $435 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $308 million.","In addition, in the third quarter the company recorded an $81 million non-cash charge to write down the carrying value of intangible assets related to the retiring of the BD CLiC system within our Biosciences business.","We have redeployed select resources within our Biosciences business to allow us to better focus our genomic strategy on continued innovation and immunology research. These items, along with the details of purchase accounting and other adjustments, can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.","As a reminder, our third quarter P&L results reflect the new BD, which includes the results of C.R. Bard for the full quarter. To provide additional revenue visibility into the new BD, we will speak to our revenue results and fiscal 2018 revenue guidance on a comparable currency neutral basis. The comparable basis includes BD and Bard in the current and prior year periods and excludes the revenues associated with our soft tissue core needle biopsy and Aspira drainage product lines that were divested in February.","Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, President; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 4. At BD, our strategy is driven by our purpose: Advancing the world of health. As we stated in our press release, our strong performance this quarter demonstrates that our strategy is working.","As I take a step back, I'm extremely proud of what our organization has been able to do so far. This is our second quarter together with Bard. And not only are we delivering on our financial commitments, but we have also demonstrated how nimble we can be as an organization, while executing concurrently on two transformational acquisitions.","Our core remains strong, and we are getting positive customer feedback and traction with our expanded portfolio and complete solutions, further solidifying our leadership position in Medtech. As I look ahead, I'm increasingly confident that we will continue to deliver even more impactful comprehensive solutions for our customers.","Turning now to slide 5 and our third quarter highlights. We're very pleased with our continued strong performance as the new BD. In our third fiscal quarter \u2013 our second quarter as a combined company \u2013 revenue growth was driven by mid-single digit performance across the Medical, Life Sciences, and Interventional segments. As we expected, third quarter margins were strong. Margin expansion was driven by the achievement of operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, coupled with the positive impact of cost synergies.","We're also pleased with the progress the integration teams are making. In June, we brought together the new BD leadership team for our strategic planning process. And it was exciting to see our organizations come together as one to discuss our innovation agenda and how our combined solutions can make an even bigger difference in the lives of patients around the world.","Our executive team includes a diverse mix of leaders from both legacy organizations, as well as the broader Medtech and Pharma industry.","Yesterday, we appointed Simon Campion as President of our Interventional segment, effective September 4. Simon is a proven leader with deep global experience, a demonstrated focus on results, and unique insight and breadth across the industry and the Interventional segment, having been part of three of the four legacy Bard businesses.","For the past five years, Simon has led the Surgery business, formally the Davol division, and we're confident he's well-suited to drive the segment's innovation agenda and ensure we deliver our integration related revenue and cost synergies.","We also recently appointed John DeFord as Chief Technology Officer to lead all BD R&D initiatives for the company and Betty Larson as our Chief Human Resource Officer to advance our organizational culture, capabilities, and talent agenda for the new BD.","Simon, John, and Betty join Sam Khichi on our management team. Sam is also a legacy Bard leader and has been our General Counsel since the close of the acquisition. Linda Tharby has moved into an important new commercial role focused on improving the customer experience across all of BD.","Beyond these leadership appointments, we are also making progress with our portfolio. In early July, we were excited to announce the acquisition of TVA Medical, a privately held company that develops minimally invasive vascular access solutions for patients with end stage renal disease, or ESRD, requiring hemodialysis.","As many of you already know, this was our first tuck-in product acquisition since the Bard transaction. The addition of TVA Medical very much aligns with our M&A strategy and focus on innovations that meet clinical needs, deliver value to health systems, and improve patient","lives.","Also while we're on the topic of new product innovation, we were delighted to see last week that the U.S. House of Representatives voted to permanently repeal the medical device tax. The Senate vote is expected later this year. The continuation of this relief is extremely important to BD as well as the patients, providers, and research communities we serve.","In summary, we're very pleased with our year-to-date performance. We continue to be impressed with the underlying momentum in both the BD and Bard businesses and anticipate an acceleration in the fourth quarter.","And as a result, we are raising our fiscal 2018 revenue guidance. We are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance, as we were already anticipating a very strong EPS growth in the fourth quarter. and we expect our increased revenue outlook will be offset by a reduced benefit from foreign currency, along with some other items which Chris will discuss later in his comments.","We remain confident in our plan for the new BD and are committed to achieving our fiscal 2018 and 2019 accretion targets.","So now I'll turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our third quarter financial performance and our fiscal year 2018 guidance.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to slide 7, I'll review our third quarter revenue and EPS results as well as key financial highlights.","As Vince mentioned, our performance as the new BD continues to be strong. Third quarter revenue growth was in line with our expectations and was driven by strong mid-single digit growth across all three segments.","On a comparable basis, revenues grew 5.5%. Our strong revenue performance includes a pricing decline of about 40 basis points in the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, pricing declined 35 basis points. I'll provide more color on revenue growth in the quarter in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and by geography.","Adjusted EPS of $2.91 grew 18.3% or 11% on a currency neutral basis. Growth was driven by strong performance from both the legacy BD and Bard businesses. Despite the more recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, FX was again a tailwind this quarter.","All in, we continue to be very pleased with our performance as a combined entity. In addition to strong year-to-date revenue growth of 5.8% on an underlying basis, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter, which I'll speak to when I discuss our updated guidance.","Before we move on, I'll also point out that as of June 30 our gross leverage ratio declined to 4.2 times, reflecting the paydown of approximately $400 million of debt. We are on target to achieve our commitment to deleverage to below 3 times over three years.","Now moving on to slide 8, I'll review our Medical segment revenue growth on a comparable currency neutral basis. BD Medical third quarter revenues increased 5.7%. Revenues in Medication Delivery Solutions, or MDS, grew 5.8% in the third quarter, driven by strength in vascular access and vascular care.","Revenues in Medication Management Solutions, or MMS, grew 8.3%. As a reminder, at the end of the second fiscal quarter we reached the one-year anniversary of the change in the U.S. dispensing business model. As we anticipated and communicated to you last year, the financial impact of this change lasted four quarters and is now behind us.","Customer response has been overwhelmingly positive to the successful transformation, as evidenced by the continued strong adoption of Pyxis ES in the quarter. Beyond dispensing, growth in MMS in the third quarter was also driven by strong performance in infusion.","Diabetes Care revenues grew 2.4%, driven by growth in pen needles in the U.S., partially offset by the timing of tenders in emerging markets that occurred in the second quarter as previously communicated. Year-to-date, Diabetes Care grew 3.4%.","Revenues in Pharmaceutical Systems grew 3.8%. Results for the third quarter were impacted by the timing of customer orders. Year-to-date, Pharmaceutical Systems grew 5.2%.","Now turning to slide 9 and the BD Life Sciences segment. Third quarter revenues increased 5.6% with strong performance across the segment.","Revenues in Diagnostic Systems grew 5% in the quarter. Performance was driven by core microbiology and continued growth in our BD MAX molecular platform.","Preanalytical Systems growth of 5.2% was driven by global strength in core products.","Biosciences revenues grew 6.8% in the quarter, driven by performance in research reagents and advanced bioprocessing, as well as growth in newer instruments, such as the FACSMelody and FACSLyric.","Turning to slide 10 and the BD Interventional segment. Third quarter revenues increased 5.1%. Year-to-date, revenues grew 4.9%, or 6.1% on an underlying basis, adjusted for the impact of the hurricane in Puerto Rico in our first fiscal quarter.","Revenues in Peripheral Intervention grew 8.1% in the quarter. Performance reflects strength in drug-coated balloons, driven by the AV indication and strong international growth in biopsy products, particularly in China.","Growth of 1.7% in Surgery reflects strong international growth in infection prevention, partially offset by a continued hold on Progel that adversely impacted growth in Surgery in the quarter by approximately 170 basis points. We remain on track to relaunch Progel by the end of this calendar year.","Urology & Critical Care revenues grew 5.6% in the quarter, driven by strong performance in our acute care Urology portfolio.","Moving on to slide 11. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the third quarter on a comparable, currency neutral basis.","U.S. revenues grew 5.9% in the third quarter. Performance was strong across the Medical and Life Sciences segments. Within the BD Interventional segment in the U.S., strong performance in Peripheral Intervention and Urology & Critical Care units was partially offset by a decline in the Surgery unit that was driven by the continued hold on Progel as previously mentioned.","Moving on to International, revenues grew 5.1% in the third quarter. Growth was driven by strong performance in the Life Sciences and Interventional segments. Growth in the Medical segment outside the U.S. reflects strong performance in the MDS and MMS units. Slower growth in the Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems units outside the U.S. reflects the timing of orders as previously discussed.","Developed Markets revenues grew 4.6% in the third quarter. Growth in Developed Markets was driven by strong performance in the U.S. as previously discussed and strength in Europe in the Surgery, MMS, and MDS units.","Third quarter Emerging Markets revenues grew 10.5%. Revenues in China grew 13.2%, driven by strong double digit growth in the Life Sciences and Interventional segments. In addition, revenues in Latin America grew in the high single digits.","Now turning to slide 12, which recaps the third quarter income statement. As discussed, revenues were in line with our expectations, growing 5.5% in the quarter. Moving down the P&L, as we expected, gross profit improved during the quarter, increasing 46.2% year-over-year.","Gross profit margin was a strong 58%. I'll provide additional details on gross profit in just a moment.","SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 25.2%, which reflects Bard's higher SSG&A spend profile, partially offset by the achievement of synergies.","R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6%, which reflects our continued commitment to invest in innovation.","Operating margin increased 260 basis points or 180 basis points on a currency neutral basis. We continue to deliver significant operating margin expansion, which reflects strong P&L leverage as the new BD.","Our tax rate was 18% in the quarter, which is in line with our full year guidance range. And as expected, we paid preferred dividends of $38 million in the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, the preferred shares are not included in the shares outstanding calculation.","In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.91, which is an 18.3% increase versus the prior year or 11% on a currency neutral basis.","Now turning to slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the third quarter. As expected, gross profit margin was a strong 58% in the third quarter. On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by 340 basis points. This reflects the inclusion of Bard's more robust gross margin profile as well as our continuous improvement initiatives and cost synergies.","These items were partially offset by headwinds from raw materials such as resins. Currency had a positive impact of 70 basis points on gross profit margin.","Operating margin grew 260 basis points in the quarter or 180 basis points on a currency neutral basis. This was driven by gross margin improvement, partially offset by the higher combined company SSG&A profile, as previously discussed.","I'll take you through our fiscal 2018 guidance over the next several slides. But while we're discussing margins, I'd like to point out that we're well on our way towards delivering significant margin expansion of 200 basis points to 250 basis points this fiscal year on a currency neutral basis.","Moving on to slide 15 and our full fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance. For the total company, based on strong performance across our businesses, we are increasing our revenue guidance. We now expect revenue growth to be above the high end of our previous guidance ranges with total company revenue growth of over 5.5% on a comparable currency neutral basis.","This represents strong growth of over 6% on an underlying basis, excluding the estimated impact from the U.S. dispensing change and the hurricane in our first fiscal quarter. As a reminder, this also includes approximately 25 basis points of benefit from this year's severe flu season.","We are also increasing our Medical and Life Sciences segment revenue guidance. We now expect both segments to grow above the high end of our previous guidance ranges with growth in the Medical segment of over 5% and growth in the Life Science segment of over 6%. We are also reaffirming our guidance of 5.5% to 6.5% growth in the Interventional segment.","We continue to expect revenue growth to be driven by recent product launches across all three segments and strength in both developed and emerging markets.","Our updated revenue guidance reflects developed market growth of over 4.5% in fiscal 2018 or over 5% excluding the estimated 50 basis points impact from the U.S. dispensing change and the hurricane.","In Emerging Markets, we continue to expect low-double digit growth, driven by a diversified base with mid-teens growth in China and strength in EMA and Latin America.","Now moving on to slide 16 and our full fiscal year 2018 EPS guidance. We continue to expect strong earnings performance in fiscal 2018 and are narrowing our EPS guidance. As there are a number of moving parts that impact earnings per share in fiscal year 2018, for modeling purposes and to ensure consistency I'd like to provide more color on EPS guidance.","Starting on the left of the chart with our guidance as of last earnings call in May. We expected currency neutral EPS growth of approximately 12%, driven by strong growth in operating income. This represented 14% to 15% growth on an underlying basis, excluding headwinds of 2% to 3% from the U.S. dispensing change. We also expected currency would provide an approximate 4% tailwind to earnings growth in fiscal 2018, which is now a smaller benefit than we initially anticipated.","Moving to the right half of the slide in our updated guidance, you will see that the impact of our increased revenue guidance is expected to be largely offset by a reduced currency benefit as I just mentioned. In addition, we also have an impact from the acquisition of TVA Medical.","Our FX assumptions assume a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.17, down from $1.23 at the time of our May guidance. As a result, we are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to a range of $10.95 to $11.05, which represents growth of approximately 15.5% to 16.5%.","We continue to expect the Bard acquisition to deliver low single digit accretion in fiscal year 2018 and high single digit accretion in fiscal year 2019. We are committed to fully realizing $300 million in annualized cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2020.","Turning to slide 17. I'd like to walk you through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2018. As a reminder, this guidance includes the results of Bard as of January 1, 2018, which is the beginning of our second fiscal quarter.","On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be over 31.5%, which is above the high end of our previous guidance range. This reflects a currency tailwind of approximately 250 basis points.","For fiscal year 2018, we continue to anticipate our adjusted average fully diluted share count to be approximately 261 million shares. For modeling purposes, I'd like to remind you that net income reflects the deduction of approximately $114 million of preferred dividends. The preferred shares are excluded from the adjusted diluted shares outstanding.","Beyond revenues and EPS, all other P&L guidance from May remains unchanged.","In summary, I'm really excited about our continued strong momentum as the new BD. And I'm confident that we'll deliver on our commitments in fiscal year 2018 and beyond.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thank you, Chris, and moving on to slide 19. As we have been discussing with you, our integration of CareFusion is largely complete. We have already achieved our cost synergy commitment of $350 million and are on track to realize our revenue synergy commitment.","At the same time, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're very pleased with the progress we are making with the Bard integration. As previously communicated, we have started to realize our year one cost savings and remain confident in achieving our target of approximately $300 million in annualized savings by fiscal year 2020.","We're also continuing to make progress with our investment in revenue synergies that we discussed with you previously. We recently completed cross-training of the sales force in MDS, where we brought together the BD and Bard vascular access portfolios. And we have also trained and activated the new surgical sales hires in Europe that we discussed with you last quarter. We look forward to sharing future updates with you as we make additional progress across our initiatives.","Turning to slide 20 and our planned product launches by segment. Starting with our Medical segment, recently we released the first BD-branded Alaris PC unit and large volume pump. This is the first new pump enhancement in more than 10 years.","The BD Alaris offers customers three key areas of value. First, customers will see improved quality and reliability through enhanced connectivity and cybersecurity. They will also benefit from clinical enhancements, such as a new alarm and loading features and various clinical efficiencies. Additionally, this new pump is helping us to continue to expand enterprise interoperability through the BD HealthSight platform.","So far, we've been very pleased with the customer adoption. And feedback has been positive.","With respect to our type 2 patch pump for diabetes, we remain on track for our initial limited launch in late FY 2019. We have completed multiple clinical trials, which have allowed us to gather insights that are critical as we prepare for our initial limited launch and beyond.","Our production preparedness continues to be on schedule to support the expected commercial demand. And we anticipate submitting our regulatory approvals for the U.S. and EU later this year. We continue to be excited about bringing this differentiated solution to the market for people living with type 2 diabetes.","In our Life Science segment, we have seen continued strong performance on our BD MAX platform, driven by Enterics CT\/GT (sic) [Enteric CT\/GC] (26:19), as well as the recently launched MAX Vaginal Panel. We have seen strong customer adoption of our Vaginal Panel, a unique assay capable of directly detecting the three most common infections known to cause vaginitis. In addition, we will be expanding the assay menu further with the launch of MAX TV assay in the coming months.","We also continue to expand our digital capabilities in support of our BD Kiestra lab automation solutions platform with instrument cup connectivity through our Synapsys informatics software. We have also released Synapsys version 2.1 in the U.S., which expands the ability of the software to establish secure connectivity across multiple instruments.","Moving on to the Interventional segment. As I discussed in my opening remarks, we recently acquired TVA Medical. The addition of TVA Medical expands our leading ESRD access portfolio with a new technology that will further improve our ability to serve physicians and their patients by providing a minimally invasive nonsurgical option for creating critical AV fistulas for hemodialysis procedures.","Both BD and Bard have a rich history of commercializing innovative technologies. And we will leverage that skill set and our leading position in the ESRD access space to bring this new technology to our customers and their patients. We are currently in the process of training our sales reps and clinical teams and started hiring some additional salespeople in preparation for a Q1 fiscal 2019 launch in the U.S.","In addition, we recently launched the Echo 2, our next generation positioning system within our hernia business. Echo 2 is a technology that works very well on robotics in laparoscopic surgery and expands our Echo first generation technology.","As you can see, we have a very rich pipeline of new products across our businesses. And we look forward to sharing additional updates with you along the way.","Before I move on, I would like to speak for a moment about our commitment to sustainability, which is a key component of our strategy. We're pleased to have recently published an update on our progress towards achieving our 2020 sustainability goals. These goals provide the framework for how we manage and make an impact on the most relevant social and environmental issues for our company.","We remain focused on supporting priority health needs that are aligned with the UN Sustainability Goals (sic) [UN Sustainable Development Goals] (29:04), or SDGs. And we contribute to the SDGs through our collaboration with the public and nonprofit sectors across the four key areas that comprise our 2020 goals, innovation, access, efficiency, and empowerment.","We just recently joined PEPFAR to celebrate their 15th year anniversary and the global impact they've had on 14 million men, women, and children with HIV AIDS. Building strong health systems is essential for control of the HIV AIDS epidemic. And BD is proud to be in the 11th year of its public\/private partnership with PEPFAR, which focuses on strengthening laboratories and improving clinical practice in several countries across sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.","As much as BD has been able to affect positive change in health care for the past 120 years, we continue to strengthen our ability and leadership in our industry. With this leadership comes even greater responsibility. Our integration with Bard will bring a renewed look at our key sustainability issues and goals. And we will communicate more about how sustainability at BD will evolve in future reports. We look forward to our progress with you along the way.","We have also included a slide in the appendix of today's presentation that provides you with some details on our sustainability initiatives. We hope you find the information useful in understanding BD's commitment to this important topic.","Now before I move on to my summary, I would like to thank Bill Tozzi for his great work in running the Interventional segment on an interim basis, while continuing his work as leading the integration. Thanks very much, Bill. We really appreciate it, and so do our shareholders and all of our associates.","Moving on to slide 21, I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today.","First, our strong performance year to date reflects our early progress and momentum as the new BD. Our core remains strong. And our expanded portfolio and complete solutions have further solidified our leadership position in Medtech. This is evidenced by our financial performance across businesses and regions.","Second, the integration of Bard is off to a strong start, and we have key leaders in place. We're confident in achieving our costs synergy and accretion commitments.","Third, we have increased our revenue guidance and narrowed our EPS guidance as a result of our strong year-to-date performance and our expectation for acceleration in the fourth quarter.","Lastly, I have increasing confidence in our outlook as we move forward as the new BD. We will continue to deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers and value to shareholders around the world.","Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for your questions Our first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Maybe one for Vince and then one for Tom. Vince, just want to focus on guidance into next quarter. So guidance for the year are very solid. Fourth quarter sort of implies acceleration to sort of 6.5% organic by our math. So are there any just sudden like momentum deceleration this quarter and some acceleration built into next quarter? Any timing issues that you sort of talk about as you roll into this quarter and to next quarter? And really just want to get you to express your confidence in getting to that next quarter number.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So I'd start out by saying, I'm very confident in our next quarter number. And yes, there were some things in this quarter, some timing issues in this quarter that did affect us. And I'll point them out to you.","So number one of course was in the Surgery business, where you've got Progel in that comparison costing us about 25 basis points. Then we have about 25 basis points of Pharm Systems timing. We expect Pharm Systems to be very strong in the fourth quarter.","And we expect in the Surgery business that you're going to see an acceleration in the Surgery business also in the fourth quarter. There was a little bit of kind of channel dynamics going on there in terms of the hurricane and what not. We see that reversing itself in the fourth quarter. And then timing of diabetes tenders, so that's about another 10 basis points.","So if you do the math on all of that, you're basically at about a 6%, maybe 6.1% underlying. So we actually feel better about this quarter than you would look at it at first pass.","But moving on to the next quarter, we feel quite good across all three of the businesses. First, the pipeline that we're seeing in MMS, and strength in both the Pyxis product line, drug administration, and of course on the pump side, too. I mentioned in my remarks the first advancement on the pump side in 10 years. And I mentioned that we're seeing very strong adoption there. Feeling good about that business.","I think on the Life Science side, I mentioned BD MAX but also Kiestra is \u2013 we're going to see strong growth in Kiestra in the fourth quarter. So we got really good visibility. And then you saw Biosciences doing quite well, expect that continuation.","So if I go through each one of the businesses, we're looking good across all three segments. So I feel very good about kind of this guidance that we're giving you at going beyond the top end of the range. Chris has got a couple of other comments he'd like.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. The only thing I would add is that Pharm Systems and MMS, MMS grew 8.3% this quarter. But we expect both Pharm Systems and MMS to be double digits in the fourth quarter.","And I would correct one thing, David, that you said. By our math, the fourth quarter implication is over 7% to get to our guidance range. So we feel really good about the revenue and the acceleration into the fourth quarter and the guidance range that we've put out.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful and very clear, guys. And then to Tom or Vince, just thinking about the Interventional business. Growth last quarter, 7.8%, to 5.1% this quarter, a little bit of a deceleration. That's the one business \u2013 every outlook was raised; that's the one business where you did not raise outlook. Anything you'd call out in how you're feeling about the core Bard growth here? Thanks so much.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Tom will take that.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hey, good morning, David. This is Tom. So we feel very good about the overall core Bard business growth. So as you saw, we had 5.1%, or 5.7% excluding Progel...","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","...for the overall segment, which is right in line with the overall guidance we've given for the year, the 5.5% to 6.5%, and we're 6.1% year to date. So right in the middle of the range. Again, we feel good about that.","Obviously quite strong performance out of the Peripheral Interventional (sic) [Intervention] (36:35) business. We continue to see well north of 25% growth in DCBs, driven by that AV fistula launch that we've been talking about. Oncology also doing extremely well.","On the Urology\/Critical Care side, we see very good growth, 5.6% for the quarter, which is quite strong for that business, driven really by the global acute Urology portfolio, as well as some timing on the temperature management business. But overall, that's been doing very well as well.","And then obviously on Surgery as Vince mentioned, it was a 1.7% in the quarter, or a 3.5% excluding Progel. And we expect some rebound to that as we go into Q4 with some timing as people had kind of balanced inventory pickup in the prior quarter with this quarter, as they're stabilizing post-hurricane. But we expect that to start really stabilizing on a go forward basis as we go into Q4.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I would just add as well that if you looked at things on a legacy basis, legacy Bard, our full year guidance would imply about 7% growth. And legacy BD nearly 6% growth, and that's at the high end of the range as we would've anticipated. So good momentum.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks for the questions, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Congratulations on a really nice quarter here and thanks for taking my questions. So maybe I'll start off on that guidance question once. A really strong Q4. And it looks like most of this was strength in underlying business. Right? And I think most of us, the question is when you look at FY 2019, how should we be thinking about underlying trends in some of the business segments? Right? Are there any areas where you see some new products gaining momentum? Or any areas where comps might be an issue? Just any color on 2019 I think would be helpful.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well, I think you've got to look at 2018 and how we're doing across the entire company. It's very difficult for me to point to anything specifically.","I think I just walked through good momentum across all three of the segments at the top line. That's the way I'm thinking about that.","From a demand side, if I think about it from a regional standpoint, I think all the regions are doing well, whether it's Asia. We haven't talked about China yet, but China had a good quarter. Asia has done well. Latin America is doing well. Europe is strong. You're seeing strong momentum in both, in the developed markets.","So it's difficult for me to call out anything in particular at this point in time. I'll refine that obviously when we get to our guidance. But I think you should look at the strength this year and use that as the basis.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. I would just add that we do obviously have a little bit of a headwind from the flu, because that was such a strong season for us. But we also have a little bit of a tailwind compare from the hurricane, which is a little bit smaller than that headwind, but roughly offset one another.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","That's helpful, Chris. And just maybe one on margin. I think back, when you look back at when the Bard deal was announced, we had expected 500 basis points to 600 basis points of margin expansion. Given where we are in the cycle now, close to 300 bps of margin expansion, when you look at 2019 and 2020, we're still expecting 250 basis points to 300 basis points of margin expansion. One, is that correct?","And second, when you think about your comments on FX benefiting margins this year, now how should we think about the interplay between FX and synergies for 2019? Thank you.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So you're absolutely right. We are delivering on the first piece of the margin improvement. Really the deal model assumptions that we laid out don't change. And so we're right in line with that, we're executing on that and delivering in 2018. And we would expect 2019 to be in line, as you laid that out. So that 500 basis points of improvement is what we had laid out. And we're delivering on that.","If you look at the results this year, we were getting some benefit from FX. But it was above and beyond. So we delivered 410 basis points this quarter, for example, 340 basis points underlying and the rest coming from FX. So that's kind of like the icing on the cake was the FX piece.","Going forward, obviously, we won't get that tailwind from FX. We'll have to watch the dollar, the euro, and some other currencies to see. So it might be a slight headwind going forward. We'll see how that plays out.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thank you, guys.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Vijay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello. Thanks very much for taking the question. Just wanted to address a couple quick things. First, and this is really big picture, but I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the global trade rhetoric that's going on over the last couple of months today? And how BD is positioned relative to what you know today about the numbers that are out there? Just I think a little bit of an update there would be welcome. Thank you.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So I'll start out and maybe Chris will want to add a few things. Of course we, like everyone, are concerned about the global trade rhetoric of course, especially with China. Things with Europe seems to be calming down a bit.","Tariffs for us this year are not material. It's a small number. It'll be a little bit of a headwind going into next year, as long as we stay where we are in terms of what's happening with China. Do you want to add anything else?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. So just to be specific on that. In the fourth quarter, we got about $0.01 of impact from the tariffs as enacted now. And that's typically some electronic parts particularly related to our MMS and Biosciences businesses. So really de minimis, but about $0.01.","That annualizes next year, so I think $0.04 next year or thereabouts, but not particularly meaningful. As it relates now, if you look at the next set of rounds, I think it's about the same. And we'll see if that happens at all. And they \u2013 constantly changing, so we'll watch that. But not particularly significant.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Bob, this is Tom. Just maybe to add to the events in Chris's comments.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Just one other thing to consider is we've had a very systematic strategy over the last couple years to migrate manufacturing for China in China. And so today over 50% of the BD Medical products that we sell in China are manufactured in China. That obviously is a (43:51) to the tariff.","We've been doing that now in the Life Science. We've been very purposely moving products into China for China there. And we're now, as part of our integration work with Bard, we got a number of products already started under way to transition manufacturing again for China in China. So we see that as probably a position that we're maybe more advantaged than other companies within the sector that position us well from a tariff perspective.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","It gives us a very balanced global network with a lot of manufacturing in the U.S. but very balanced around the globe.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Very helpful. And then just quickly I wanted to kind of come back to something that a couple of people have asked about. But if you're commenting on exiting the year at over 7% growth, which is obviously very robust. And I know it's a little early to be talking about this.","But just if you could at least talk qualitatively about the sustainability? Does that strength exiting the year suggest that there may be a little bit of upside to the kind of the LRP that you guys have been talking about? Or just a bunch of things coming together particularly in that fourth quarter? So it's really a question on sustainability.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I'll let you.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. I think we feel really good about the way we're exiting the year. But I think there is some timing that we talked about that shows up in the fourth quarter. So it's early to be talking about next year at this point. But we feel like we're going in with strong momentum and executing on the range that we talked about at the time of the deal model. So more to come.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. Just hoping you could talk a little bit more about U.S. surgical volume trend. Kind of curious what you saw in the quarter and what's baked into the guidance for the rest of the year? And the reason I ask is, it does look like across the industry things have gotten a little bit better. But maybe not to the degree you would hope for, given seasonality and just economic backdrop here. So be interested in your take on that dynamic.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. I'll just make an overall comment first and then I'll turn it over to Tom. But I don't think we've seen any real change in the surgical dynamics broadly across the product line, the legacy BD piece or the Bard piece, other than the little bit of confusion from the hurricane, which is kind of clouding things.","But, Tom, is there anything else you want to add?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Vince, I think you said it well.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Helpful. And then just a follow-up on the gross margin dynamic, just to continue on that topic. It'd be helpful if you could maybe deconstruct a little bit more some of the key drivers of improvement. You said to us you had multiple factors at play here. Trying to figure out which of those are likely to sustain on a sort of normalized basis if we put aside FX.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So we obviously get a nice lift from the mix with the Bard gross margins. And so that's about 300 basis points this particular quarter. For example, we had 100 basis points of improvement from synergies. And that was partially offset by headwinds from raw materials, about 30 bps, mostly resins, and pricing was about 20 bps thereabouts.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One on Bard, one on some new \u2013 some products.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So first on Bard. Any update on revenue synergies and tax synergies and timing and maybe just qualitatively the potential benefit? And then I had one follow-up.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Tom will talk about the revenue synergies. I think we're feeling pretty good. Tom?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Hi, Larry. This is Tom. So we do continue to expect revenue synergies are going to be measurable starting in FY 2019 and larger than the CareFusion revenue synergies as we've shared in the past. More to come on specifically what those dollars are. I think we've always hinted that that would come as we give FY 2019 revenue guidance. And we expect that that's still the exact timing that we're on.","But maybe the other things I could add is we've shared already that we're investing about $15 million this year towards revenue synergies. Most of that falling in SSG&A expenses as we're ramping up our efforts in a few areas, and those are around vascular access. So driving synergies across that broadened portfolio of PICCs, mid-lines, and catheters.","And then that other major area is in Surgery, particularly the U.S. and Europe, where there was opportunities to double down the channel to leverage the biosurgery and the infection prevention platform.","So those investments are rolling out. Actually Q3 was kind of the peak of those investments. Q4 will continue at a similar rate and then continue to roll into 2020. But we are seeing positive momentum.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","The only other thing I would add is that we have piloted the vascular access value proposition in a few accounts. And the response from the accounts has been excellent. We just saw that in the last couple of weeks. So we think we're on the right track here.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And, Chris, on the tax synergies? And just I'll ask the product question. So Lutonix BTK, still file by year-end 2018? Any update on the data presentation?","And just lastly, TVA, the opportunity seems underappreciated to me. Any color on how big that could be? Thanks for taking the questions.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So I'll go with the tax rate first, and then I'll pass it over to Tom. It's still a little bit early on the tax synergies. And the reason for that, first of all, it's complicated. But it's, secondly, complicated by tax reform. And so there's a lot of folks that are helping us dive through that as we speak. So more to come in the future on that.","I think we feel good about where the tax rate is now. We're looking at the low end of our range, so in that 17% kind of range of \u2013 the original range we gave was 17% to 19%. So we're looking pretty good from that standpoint.","The one other point that I'd remind people is you do get a bit of a grow over next year, because of the tax on foreign earnings from tax reform kicks in next year. So we're getting a little benefit this year. And it erodes a little bit next year. But we're pretty confident that we can offset that. So just something to think about. And Tom.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So, Larry, this is Tom on BTK and TVA. So BTK is right on track with what we had shared historically. We are right now finishing the six-month follow-up and preparing the submission of the PMA in Q1 of 2019. That's 100% on track. And we expect to be able to talk about the BTK data, just as we've shared before probably at the beginning of the calendar year in some scientific forums.","On TVA, I think you're 100% right on. We're really excited about that technology. If you've seen the current methods for creating a fistula and the invasiveness of the surgery versus the minimally invasive nature and what that looks like and the time to having a mature fistula, it's a radical difference versus the current state of care. And so that gives us really the \u2013 what we think is going to be an early lead in minimally invasive vascular access solutions for patients with end-stage renal disease. It's really a disruptive innovation that we do think presents a significant opportunity for BD PI [Peripheral Intervention] and is really going to just further add to our full range of solutions for supporting IV access for patients undergoing hemodialysis.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","The other exciting thing about this is it enables the creation of new fistula sites.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Two.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","And so two sites. So from a patient standpoint, this is extremely important. So as Tom was saying, we agree with you that this is a real opportunity to convert the current procedures.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","I would just add our sales teams are being trained now and we're planning for a launch in Q1.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Vince, I was hoping you could talk about your Emerging Markets growth. 15% to 20% of the business, still growing pretty strong double digits there. How much of that is from the addition of the Bard business? How did Bard do versus Becton? And any color on the sustainability there?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. And so I would say it was very much where we expected it to be. So kind of if you backed up underlying Bard and underlying BD, we're very much in line with historical trends.","China I think was around \u2013 all-in, around 13% or so. And the BD and Bard pieces were pretty much in line with what we expected.","For me, the big bounce back has been in EMA year to date doing quite well. And then very good growth in Latin America. So I would say that from a revenue synergy standpoint, we're really in very, very early days. We're only two quarters into this, just training folks on that. So you're not seeing the revenue synergy piece of that yet. That's to come.","Now the one place we're moving ahead that's not Emerging Markets, as Tom mentioned of course, is in Europe. We do have the sales force now in place on the Surgery side of things. So just getting started there basically this quarter. So more to come next year on revenue synergies.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. And, Robbie, this is Chris. I would add when you think about Emerging Markets growth, I would say Bard adds about 2% to Emerging Markets, which is in line with what we would've expected.","Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Maybe as a follow-up for Tom, on the type 2 diabetes patch pump and the cannula, the infusion set with Medtronic. These are two that have significant potential. Can you give us any more in terms of the go-to-market strategy with the type 2 pump? Any details around the product or how it compares to some of the other patch pumps out there? And is there any ability or willingness to take this into the type 1 market? Thanks.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay. Okay. Robbie. This is Tom. So for Swatch, we continue to be very excited about the potential of that product. And we continue to make good progress. We are progressing our clinical trials as we had shared in the past, including the \u2013 we've just completed the analysis of an in-human insulin fusion trial. And that went exactly to plan for us. It was very positive response from patients on its ease of use and overall performance.","So right now we're actually preparing to start-up our next in-home safety trial, again using insulin. And we're making good progress overall, gearing up our manufacturing. We've moved that to our Ireland location, where that's going to be the permanent manufacturing location. And we're building our commercial plans at this point in time.","So it has been designed specifically for type 2 patients, both from a feature set and extreme ease-of-use. Right? What really differentiates this product from other types of patch pumps we think are the extreme simplicity of the user interface on the digital side and on the hardware side.","And so that we've designed to not necessarily have all the bells and whistles that someone with type 1 would want, but that's also allowed us to have a cost position that is very specifically targeted for type 2 patients. So think about a cost position that's much more at parity with pen therapy than a significant premium that's typically associated with pump therapy. And that's one of the core value propositions that we hear a lot of excitement from payers on as well. So...","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So this is Alberto. I just wanted to complement the fact that we are really advancing very well. Our production preparedness is on track. And we'll be ready to go with a good ramp up for the product from a production perspective. And that we are expecting to submit our submission for type 2 patch pump later this year, around that time.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","So and going towards type 1 would make no sense, as Tom said, with the features that we have. And that's key actually to the regulatory strategy that we have, that this is focused on type 2 patients.","But longer term, think about this as maybe with other drugs for the home, not in the short run, but that's where there's possible market expansion. We're already talking to pharma companies about that.","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. I would just add so we do have of course our Pharmaceutical Systems business, which does take devices from other business units and applies them for other disease states by selling those to other pharma companies. And so we have signed our first deals on a B2B basis with that product. And we think there's more opportunities there ahead.","So we really see an opportunity to leverage the platform, not only through our Diabetes Care business, but also through our Pharmaceutical Systems business unit, where we have relationships with essentially all of the top pharma companies.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks for your questions.","Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning, Doug.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","I want to ask a pricing question of Chris. But before we get there, a couple pump questions, different types of pumps.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","So, Tom, maybe as a follow-up to just that last question. On the diabetes side, would you ever consider collaborating with a CGM company to automate insulin dependent \u2013 I'm sorry, insulin delivery in intensively managed patients who potentially could be using your pump?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, Doug, this is Tom. So yes, we would over time certainly look at CGM being integrated into the algorithms and collaborating with those types of organizations. Yes.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Okay. Thank you for that. And then on the new Alaris pump, just want to talk about the sales strategy there. Is this largely replacing existing BD units? Or do you think with this you can get even more aggressive targeting competitive conversions? You've done an excellent job gaining share. I'm just wondering if this actually positions you even better?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah, Doug, let me turn that over to Alberto Mas, who has obviously taken over the Medical.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Okay. Yeah. That would be great.","Alberto Mas - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","It certainly positions us better with the customer, because there's an enhanced connectivity, cybersecurity, alarms, and so on. So the features are more advanced.","Where we're seeing most of our gains, if you like, in the marketplace is when we put together our complete portfolio around the \u2013 our HealthSight capabilities in data and analytics. And together \u2013 when we put together our Alaris platform together with our Pyxis and from dispensing all the way to med management.","The other driver here is interoperability. It's a very important component of our strategy. We think that we're ahead from that perspective from the competition. And we have a track record of actually getting it implemented, which is a key component of interoperability.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Okay. Thank you for that, Alberto. And, Chris, just last one on pricing. You guys have done a great job over the last few years maintaining price. It does look like you've come under a little more pressure recently. I'm just wondering if there's anything more to talk about there? And looking ahead, how do we think about tariffs in the context of pricing moving forward?","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Sure. So I would say that it's pretty much in line with what we expected. We went into this year, we mentioned we expected to see pressure. And we're seeing a little bit of pressure, so tens of basis points. And it's pretty consistent.","We're taking some price in certain areas as you know. And in other areas we're bringing the pricing down. So not unlike what we've been doing over the last few years, and we've been holding that fairly steady. So it's very consistent with where we were.","And as it relates to tariffs, it's very small for us. So we don't see any implication on pricing at this point.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Good morning.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Morning.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So, Vince, you highlighted the TVA medical transaction.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","How should we think about the pacing of capital deployment for additional M&A activity as compared to that reduction?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. Sure. So number one, we are focused on debt reduction and meeting our commitment to get down to three times. And so \u2013 and we're on track to so far. So we're feeling good about that.","But as we did our modeling and our planning, we didn't make allowance for tuck-in acquisitions. And just as we did under CareFusion, we did a few of them. When we tightened the screening and said, they have to be must-dos strategically. And of course we always have rigid criteria.","But you should expect that we will continue to do plug-in acquisitions. But also at the same time meet those deleveraging goals. And that's on track so far.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. I feel really good about the fact that we're at 4.2 times already and also did very a very exciting acquisition like TVA and were able to do both. And it goes back to what Vince said, as we had planned to leave some room, because we knew we didn't want to be out of the tuck-in acquisition business. And so we were able to accomplish both.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Very good. And then, Tom, circling back to an earlier question, can you help us think a little bit about how you're thinking about the TVA Medical contribution here following the 1Q launch?","Thomas Polen - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Hey, Bill. This is Tom. So I don't think we certainly are giving any guidance by product line by quarter. But we would expect \u2013 obviously it's a new market that we're going to have to develop. And we think it'll over time become a meaningful contributor to the Peripheral Intervention business. But we don't comment much more than that by product line.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Just remember the old adage that this is a company built on singles. And so just keep that in perspective.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thanks, Chris.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. This is Jaime on for Rich. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just following up kind of on capital deployment and M&A landscapes.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes.","Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC","Kind of what (1:03:43) about size-wise for any potential tuck-ins? And (1:03:47) are you most focused on for areas where you feel that it would benefit from such a deal?","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Well, these are smaller transactions. You saw at TVA is kind of, they got the technology developed, they got an FDA approval. It wasn't a science project. It was a complete product. And in the Interventional segment, you see a lot of that.","If you look back over our history, you saw us buying companies that were in the $50 million range. That sort of stuff. Smaller things is generally what we are talking about.","A good example is FlowJo, a small software company. It enhances the growth rate. It's another single like Chris was saying. But really rounded out our solutions portfolio over there. Those kind of things is what we're talking about here.","Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up. I know you guys are commenting on how the Bard acquisition is going on track and progressing very well. Just a question that I had there. Is there any changes that have surprised you kind of either to the positive or negative since the deal has closed? If you could share any color there.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yeah. That's a good question. I think the interesting thing is that I don't think there has been any significant surprises in terms of when we step back and look at the fundamental assumptions that we had driving the acquisition, starting on the strategy side and how these things fit together.","And then on the financial side, if there's been an upside it is how similar the cultures have been and how quickly the teams have come together. I'm delighted, as I mentioned in my remarks, to have several members now on my leadership team out of Bard. Not that I didn't think they were great people ahead of time. But the way this has come together, as I mentioned, from a cultural standpoint has been really good. So that has been fine.","I think the differences between CareFusion and this one, CareFusion was put together through acquisition. It had a bunch of different cultures. And so we had to integrate a bunch of different cultures. And then you were integrating actually a bunch of different businesses.","With Bard, it's one culture. Those run very decentralized. And so the integration challenge, the complexity in that integration challenge comes from the differences in the business units and the business systems across them.","And of course, so that's just a different way of having opportunity and getting at the opportunities across the two businesses. But pretty much, that's it. Very happy with the way the integration is going. And thanks for the question.","Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Forlenza for closing remarks.","Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Yes. Thank you very much for your participation. Just some final comments.","As you saw in the quarter, the core BD performance is very strong and we see acceleration in the fourth quarter. I just mentioned that the Bard integration, the synergy capture, the base business performance is also right on track. Very, very happy about that.","This year has been a very challenging year because of the amount of things that we have had on our plate. Integrating two businesses, as I said. We're in great shape on CareFusion, pretty much done with that. The Bard piece is going well.","But of course we threw on top of that the hurricane and having to deal with that across both organizations. And I'm really proud of the way people have stepped up to those challenges.","And at the end of the day, this is an organization that's come together quite nicely, that's working extremely hard to meet our own expectations and your expectations. So thank you very much.","Christopher R. Reidy - Becton, Dickinson & Co.","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."]}}
