Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Finnis.","Amanda Finnis","Thank you, Hanna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2014 combined conference call for NextEra Energy and for NextEra Energy Partners.","With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company.","Moray will provide an overview and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward- looking statements, if any of our key assumptions are correct or because of other factors discussed in today\u2019s release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Today\u2019s presentation also references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to information contained in the slides accompanying today\u2019s presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.","Moray Dewhurst","Thank you, Amanda, and good morning everyone. NextEra Energy had a very good third quarter with strong performance at both FPL and Energy Resources. At Florida Power & Light, earnings per share increased approximately 6% over the prior year comparable quarter, driven roughly equally by our continued commitment of new capital to the business and by growth in wholesale power sales.","Operationally, our performance was strong despite a challenging period of summer weather, as our investments in our transmission and distribution network are helping us deliver improvements in our system reliability.","We continue to make good progress on the third of three generation modernization projects, at Port Everglades, which remains on track to achieve commercial operation in mid-2016. Our gas reserves petition advanced through the regulatory process and we expect the Public Service Commission to consider the matter in early December, which we expect will permit a decision either late this year or early next year.","Also during the quarter, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision to approve our 2012 rate case settlement. The court\u2019s order comprehensively rejected all the arguments raised by The Office of Public Counsel and made it very clear that, as long as the PSC follows appropriate procedures, as it did in 2012, it has wide latitude to determine whether a settlement agreement is in the public interest, taking account of all the prevailing facts and circumstances.","We believe this is a very positive development that will encourage and support our efforts to negotiate future settlement agreements that, like the 2012 agreement have new and innovative elements in them.","Energy Resources had an outstanding quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased roughly 16% over the prior year comparable quarter, primarily as a result of additional investments in our contracted renewables business, and the business enjoyed great success in terms of new renewables origination activity, signing contracts for a total of approximately 445 megawatts of new wind and solar projects. Beyond this, we see strong prospects for signing another 600 to 800 megawatts by the end of the year. It was an excellent quarter for new origination activity, with very strong near-term prospects.","At NextEra Energy Partners, operational performance during the quarter was solid and cash available for distribution was in line with our expectations. Yesterday, the NEP Board declared an initial quarterly distribution of $18.75 per common unit or $0.75 per common unit on an annualized basis.","And just as important, we have made excellent progress around key decisions that will affect the future growth prospects for NEP. The Conflicts Committee of the NEP Board composed of independent directors reached agreement with the sponsor to acquire two additional assets from the Energy Resources portfolio.","And more generally, we completed the first phase of our ongoing analysis of future growth, and concluded that it is in the interests of both the shareholders of NEE and the LP unitholders of NEP to undertake a short-term acceleration of the NEP growth profile, while still preserving the expectation of continued long-term growth in the 12% to 15% per year range for many years to come.","I will provide more details on each of these later in the call. Overall, we are very pleased with our progress this quarter.","Now let\u2019s look at the results for FPL. For the third quarter of 2014, FPL reported net income of $462 million or $1.05 per share, up $0.06 per share year-over-year.","Continued investment in the business and an expansion of wholesale operations were the two principal drivers of growth. FPL\u2019s capital expenditures were approximately $670 million in the quarter, and we expect our full-year capital investments to be roughly $3.1 billion. Regulatory capital employed grew 5.2% over the same quarter last year.","Our principal current generation initiative is the Port Everglades Energy Center, which will deliver fuel efficiency savings and emissions reductions to our customers when it enters service in 2016. This approximately $1 billion project remains on schedule and on budget.","We are also focused on investing in our transmission and distribution network to improve its resilience during severe weather such as hurricanes, as well as to provide increased reliability to our customers on a daily basis.","As I mentioned earlier, this year presented one of the more challenging periods of summer weather, and what we are seeing in terms of our ability to improve our already outstanding reliability is encouraging. Comparing against years that have had similarly challenging weather, we estimate that the reliability of our network measured in terms of system unavailability, has improved by 10% to 15%. This means fewer minutes of interruption for our customers and lower outage repair costs for the company.","Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes for the 12 months ended September 2014 will be approximately 11.4%. As you may recall from prior quarters, this includes the impact of transition costs associated with our enterprise-wide productivity initiative, Project Momentum, incurred late last year.","The impact of the 2013 transition costs will roll-off our reported regulatory ROE, as we move through the year, since the regulatory ROE is measured on a 12-month trailing basis. Absent these costs, regulatory ROE would have been 11.5%, and this remains our target for the full-year 2014.","As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a pre-determined regulatory ROE for each 12-month trailing period, in this case the 11.5% that I previously mentioned, excluding special charges, such as the Project Momentum transition costs.","During the third quarter, we reversed all $131 million of reserve amortization that we had taken this year through June. The need for reserve amortization is generally the lowest in the third quarter, since the third quarter is typically our strongest in terms of revenue, and our non-fuel O&M expenses in the third quarter of this year were actually lower than in the third quarter of 2013, reflecting the excellent results of our productivity improvement initiative, Project Momentum.","Relative to our expectations at the time we first discussed Project Momentum in the spring of 2013, we are seeing earlier delivery of results and likely greater overall savings. Incidentally, our ability to shift focus to a comprehensive multiyear effort like this is just one example of the benefits that will flow to customers over time from a settlement agreement like our 2012 rate agreement.","During the fourth quarter, we expect to further reduce the amount of reserve amortization by reversing some of the amortization that was taken in 2013, the first year of the settlement agreement. As a reminder, we utilized $155 million of reserve amortization during 2013. Assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we expect to be able to reverse a third to a half of that amount in the fourth quarter.","The economic recovery in Florida remains solid. A focused effort of the state\u2019s leadership on economic development along with a consistent improvement in the business climate has helped to drive growth in employment. The number of jobs in Florida as of September was up 206,000 compared to a year earlier, an increase of 2.7%. Nearly 700,000 jobs have now been added since the bottom of the downturn in 2009.","Florida\u2019s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in September was 6.1%, down 0.8 percentage points from a year ago. As an indicator of new construction, new building permits remain at healthy levels, albeit lower than their recent peak. The Case-Shiller Index in South Florida shows home prices up 10% from the prior year and mortgage delinquency rates continue to decline.","Turning now to our customer and usage metrics. FPL\u2019s average number of customers in the third quarter increased by 82,000 or 1.8%, with an estimated impact on sales of 1.2%. Similar to prior quarters, the estimated impact on sales is slightly lower than the customer count growth, because the remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by our smart meter program continues to account for a portion of that customer growth, and these new customers are disproportionately low usage and residential.","We began deploying the remote connect and disconnect switches in the third quarter of 2013, and were fully deployed by the end of the fourth quarter. Consequently, we expect the growth in customer count year-over-year to revert in coming quarters to an underlying rate of about 1.3% to 1.5% percent or 60,000 to 70,000 customer additions annually.","Overall usage per customer grew by 1.9%, of which, weather accounted for roughly 0.8%. Weather normalized usage per customer increased 1.1% compared to the same quarter last year. This was a very strong rebound from the year-over-year decline in the second quarter, but as we have often said, this measure can be volatile on a quarterly basis. Through the period of the rate agreement, our expectations of underlying usage growth are unchanged at approximately 0.5% per year.","The average number of inactive accounts in September declined 20.8% from the prior year and the percent of inactive accounts is now at a level well below the 20-year average. As of September, the 12-month average of low usage customers fell to 8.0%, down from 8.3% in September 2013.","Before leaving FPL, let me update you on the two capital initiatives that we discussed in the spring of last year, that have been pushed back a bit. First, we are continuing to monitor the actual emissions profile of our peaking units in Broward County. Based on the results of this testing, we will determine what the most cost-effective upgrade path will be for our customers. We continue to expect the need to modernize and upgrade these assets, but the exact size and scope of the project remains uncertain. Construction is not likely to start before 2016.","Second, since completing our first 110 megawatts of solar in Florida, we have been working hard to identify ways in which we can cost-effectively introduce more solar capacity into our system. Distributed solar, especially residential, remains extremely high cost relative to our efficient generation fleet, and will only serve to drive up customer rates if pursued in any quantity.","Even utility-scale solar, which is by far the most cost-efficient way of adding renewable energy in our service territory, is not yet at a stage to be generally cost-effective across our entire service territory. However, we have continued to work to identify specific opportunities and now believe we can bring forward three roughly 75 megawatt solar PV projects that can take advantage of the 2016 ITC window, leverage available land, transmission capacity, as well as prior permitting and development work, and that will prove cost-effective for our customers.","We expect to bring these projects into service in 2016. Moreover, we continue to believe that with reasonably foreseeable continued improvements in solar economics, there could be greater potential for utility-scale solar by the end of the decade.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2014 GAAP earnings of $204 million or $0.46 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $231 million or $0.52 per share.","Before reviewing the details, let me provide a reminder about the interrelationship between Energy Resources and NEP. As you know, the launch of NEP closed on July 1. Energy Resources will continue to consolidate NEP for accounting purposes, but beginning with this quarter, you will see a deduction for income representing NEP LP unitholders\u2019 interests in NEP\u2019s results.","Energy Resources\u2019 adjusted EPS increased by $0.07 per share year-over-year. The contribution from new wind and solar additions placed into service during or after the third quarter of 2013 was $0.09 per share and this continued growth in our contracted renewables business was the primary driver of Energy Resources\u2019 growth.","Our customer supply and trading business had a modest positive increase in contribution of $0.03 per share, driven mostly by favorable summer results in retail and wholesale full requirements. A mild summer is typically favorable for these parts of the portfolio.","Wind resource came in at roughly 95% of the long-term average, which was roughly comparable to last year, and the existing asset portfolio added 1$0.01 per share overall. Offsetting these gains was a $0.03 per share decline in contribution from our gas infrastructure business, due to increased depreciation expense, primarily related to higher depletion rates. All other factors reduced results by $0.03 cents per share.","For the full-year, we continue to expect to elect CITCs on roughly 265 megawatts for our Mountain View solar project and the portions of Genesis and Desert Sunlight solar projects that are expected to enter service in 2014. This equates to roughly $60 million in adjusted earnings, down from roughly $70 million in 2013 on 280 megawatts of solar projects.","As I mentioned earlier, the team has driven significant growth in our portfolio of contracted renewables opportunities. Let me spend a bit of time now on where each program now stands.","Our total 2013 to 2016 U.S. solar program is now roughly 1,400 megawatts. This includes roughly 304 megawatts newly added to the backlog since the last call, and is approximately 300 megawatts better than the high-end of our expectations at the time of the March 2013 Investor Conference.","All of these new projects are expected to be in operation by the end of 2016. There are also a number of other projects that we continue to pursue, and we now believe that our total 2013 to 2016 U.S. solar program could be 1,600 to 1,800 megawatts.","Turning to our wind programs, our U.S. development program for 2013 to 2015 is now nearly 1,900 megawatts. This includes 91 megawatts newly added to the backlog since the last call. Based on everything we see at the moment, we now believe our total 2013 to 2015 U.S. wind program, could exceed our previously stated range of up to 2,500 megawatts.","In Canada, we added a new approximately 50 megawatt project to the backlog, which we expect to enter operations in 2016. Since the last call, we brought into service roughly 75 megawatts of solar, 199 megawatts of U.S. wind and 133 megawatts of Canadian wind, a total of over 400 megawatts.","Not only are these very attractive assets in their own right, but we also believe that we have unlocked the potential to better highlight their value by isolating a portion of the portfolio and making the cash flows visible to investors through the creation of NEP.","Let me now review the highlights for NEP. During the third quarter, NEP\u2019s initial portfolio delivered cash available for distribution or CAFD of $27 million, which was in line with our expectations. Full financial results will be available when we file the 10-Q. The assets operated well and wind and solar resource were near normal.","Overall, there is nothing at this time that causes us to change the expectations that we have previously shared for these assets for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2015.","As I mentioned earlier, NEP has entered into agreements to expand its portfolio through two project acquisitions from NextEra Energy. The first of these is Palo Duro, an approximately 250 megawatt wind project in Texas that will sell 100% of its output under a 20-year PPA. It is expected to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Palo Duro is not part of the ROFO portfolio. We expect to earn PTCs on the project and to enter into a differential partnership or tax equity structure that we expect will make the project very attractive to NEP investors. In essence, we expect our tax equity partners to make a portion of their contributions to the project through ongoing payments in exchange for receiving PTCs. We expect this to result in an overall project cash flow profile that fits the NEP model.","The second acquisition is Shafter, a 20 megawatt solar project in California that will sell 100% of its output under a 20-year PPA. It is expected to enter service in the second quarter of \u201815 and is a part of the ROFO portfolio.","NEP expects to acquire both projects in the first quarter of 2015 for total consideration of approximately $291 million, plus the assumption of approximately $250 million in tax equity financing, which is expected to close in December for Palo Duro, and subject to working capital adjustments.","The $150 million of primary proceeds retained from the IPO will support a portion of the acquisition. The remaining consideration of roughly $141 million will be financed in the short-term through the utilization of NEP\u2019s revolving credit facility, in addition to cash on hand at the time of the transactions. Since the revolver is not expected to be utilized for longer-term capital requirements, we expect to replace this interim financing with equity and potentially incremental project debt at some point in 2015.","NEP expects the impact of these acquisitions to increase 2015 adjusted EBITDA and CAFD by roughly $60 million to $70 million and $15 million to $25 million respectively, and to increase the annual run rate of adjusted EBITDA and CAFD by roughly $65 million to $75 million and $20 million to $30 million respectively.","We expect additional acquisition opportunities to become available as well, and I will talk more in a moment about our current thoughts on overall expected growth.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2014, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $660 million or $1.50 per share. NextEra Energy\u2019s 2014 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $688 million and $1.55 respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2013.","The development of both Sabal Trail Transmission pipeline and Florida Southeast Connection pipeline continue to progress well through their respective processes. Florida Southeast Connection filed its FERC certificate application in September 2014, and Sabal Trail continues to refine the route with the expectation to file its FERC certificate application in November 2014. Both projects expect FERC authorization by year-end 2015 to support commercial operation by mid-2017.","During the quarter, we completed the formation of our Mountain Valley Pipeline joint-venture with EQT Corporation. In addition, the joint-venture completed a binding open season for the roughly 300 mile natural gas pipeline designed to connect the Marcellus and Utica shales with markets in the Southeast region of the U.S., in order to support growing demand and improvements in reliability.","After concluding the open season, the project has secured approximately 2 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments. Based on our expected ownership share, the expected size of our capital opportunity is approximately $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion. Both companies have received Board approval to move ahead with the project.","Looking ahead at NextEra Energy, we continue to expect full-year EPS to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.35 and this range includes the negative impact of about $0.15 associated with the launch of NEP that we discussed in the second quarter earnings release.","Having completed a closer review of the 2015 outlook, we now see a range of $5.40 to $5.70 as being reasonable. We expect to see a few cents of drag associated with the combination of the accelerated transfer of assets to NEP, which I will discuss further in a moment, as well as higher capital spending associated with the more rapid evolution of the Energy Resources\u2019 backlog.","The accelerated transfers would give us more equity than we need to maintain our target credit metrics, other things being equal. And we can utilize this extra equity to support the additional CapEx without recourse to the equity markets. These effects are reflected in the $5.40 to $5.70 range.","In the slides accompanying today\u2019s presentation, we have also provided new disclosure for our expectations for the Energy Resources portfolio, focusing on our expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash flow for 2015. Please note that this view of 2015 does not yet reflect the impact of the anticipated accelerated growth at NEP.","For 2016, we are maintaining our current expectations of $5.50 to $6.00 for the moment, and we expect to be able to provide an update with the fourth quarter earnings release in January. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.","Starting in 2016, we expect to see reflected in GAAP income the effects of asset transfers to NEP. Because of the subordination provisions governing NEE\u2019s LP unit, gains on these transfers are currently deferred until one year after NEP pays distributions at a level of $1.13, corresponding to the high splits in the IDR structure. At that point, we expect to start amortizing any gains from sales of assets to NEP over the life of the assets.","Looking beyond 2016, while we are not yet in a position to provide a specific numerical range for earnings, it is clear from the development of our capital deployment initiatives, that we are well positioned to sustain our strong growth profile.","We expect to be able to sustain the 5% to 7% per year growth in EPS off a 2014 base, at least through 2018, assuming all our capital initiatives continue along their current path. In addition, everything we see suggests that our operating cash flow will continue to grow more rapidly than EPS during this period, and we expect average growth of operating cash flow in the 8% to 10% per year range through 2018.","With the proposed acceleration in the growth of NEP, which I will detail in a moment, we should also see the IDR cash flow stream at NEE grow rapidly, so that by 2018 this could amount to somewhere between $75 million and $100 million per year. This is included in our overall expectations of cash flow growth.","Turning now to NEP. We expect the initial portfolio to deliver roughly $270 million to $280 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first 12 months, yielding cash available for distribution or CAFD of nearly $85million to $95 million.","For the full-year 2015, taking into account all the asset acquisitions we are now contemplating, we expect the NEP portfolio to generate adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $440 million and CAFD of $100 million to $120 million. This would support a distribution level at an annualized rate of $1.125, which corresponds to the upper tier of the IDR splits by the end of 2015 or possibly slightly earlier.","Again, the disclosure in the appendix does not yet reflect the impact of this acceleration of growth at NEP, since we have not yet determined the specific projects that will be made available to NEP. We expect to update our disclosure when a more specific plan is in place.","After 2015, we currently see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions, as being a reasonable range of expectations for at least the next five years.","Let me now spend a moment explaining our logic for accelerating the short-term growth of NEP, and why we think it will be good both for NEP LP unitholders, and for NextEra shareholders.","We have spent the last few weeks examining in more detail different scenarios for NEP acquisitions of Energy Resources\u2019 projects. We\u2019ve also spent considerable time asking questions of our investors and considering their input. While we retain accountability for our decisions, we recognize that many investors have been thinking about the same issues and we value the input we have received.","We recognize that, other things equal, if there is value to be created by transferring an asset to NEP, in general, it will be better to do so earlier rather than later, subject to the project being sufficiently far along in development and construction to fit the NEP competitive model. At the same time, NEP\u2019s competitive positioning is strongly supported by the long runway of growth that it can reasonably expect to offer investors, given the large portfolio of Energy Resources projects that it can hope to acquire.","As we have studied in the portfolio more closely and considered how it may evolve, we have come to the conclusion that we can support a short-term acceleration of growth, while still preserving reasonable expectations of growth in the 12% to 15% per year range for several years thereafter.","We think this profile is more attractive to NEP investors than simply continuing the 12% to 15% growth rate and maintaining more assets in the Energy Resources portfolio for a longer period of time.","Two factors in particular have changed, since we launched NEP. First, as we\u2019ve discussed, we\u2019ve been working on a tax equity structure that we now think will enable us to make some projects available to NEP, earlier than we had previously expected. And of course, the Palo Duro project discussed earlier is an example of this.","Second, again as discussed earlier, the development pipeline and backlog at Energy Resources have continued to evolve in a very positive fashion over the last few months, and nothing has changed our view that the longer term prospects for renewables development in the U.S., particularly with the prospect of EPA regulation of carbon dioxide emissions are very favorable. These factors in our judgment support an acceleration of NEP growth.","From an NEP LP unitholder\u2019s perspective, there are two other secondary factors that also support this proposed shift. First, investors have noted that NEP currently offers limited liquidity simply because of its size, and accelerating the growth in the short-term should improve liquidity. And, second, although the initial portfolio is broad and diverse, accelerating the growth will enable the portfolio to become broader and more diversified, which again should be a positive for NEP investors.","Finally from a NextEra Energy shareholder perspective, accelerating the growth of NEP will also mean that the upper tier of the IDR splits will be reached more rapidly than we had originally thought. While this doesn\u2019t change the fundamental value proposition, we think it will serve to highlight a portion of the NEE value proposition, which perhaps today is not widely recognized among NEE investors. We estimate that the IDR cash flow stream could be worth $5 to $10 per share later in the decade.","For all these reasons, we have concluded that accelerating the growth of NEP over the next twelve months or so, while still retaining reasonable expectations of sustained growth in the 12% 15% per year range for several years thereafter, makes sense for both sets of investors.","At this point, we are not prepared to discuss the specific assets that NEP expects to acquire, as we are still working through the details. However, this accelerated growth profile is still likely to be dominated by the same kinds of high-quality, long-term contracted renewables projects that characterize the initial portfolio. Longer term it may well make sense to broaden the NEP portfolio into new asset classes, but for the short-term, we believe continuing to focus primarily on renewables projects makes sense.","To sum up, both NEE and NEP had excellent quarters. Current performance is strong, the outlook at least through 2016 is highly visible, and we continue to believe that we have some of the best long-term growth prospects in our industry. All this is supported by a very strong financial position, which we expect to maintain. Our fundamentals are excellent and our growth initiatives continue to evolve in a very positive fashion.","With that, we will now open the line for questions. Since this is a combined conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners, it will be helpful if you can be clear which entity you are referring to in your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning.","Moray Dewhurst","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Moray, I wanted to explore the PTC structure that you outlined, that could permit perhaps more assets to be dropped down to NEP earlier than we had expected. Can you generally speak to that \u2013 you mentioned some of the assets could be eligible. Is this something we should be thinking as fairly broadly eligible for your assets with PTCs or is it a more limited field of assets? Just trying to, sort of, generally get a feel for how significant this structure is.","Moray Dewhurst","Sure. I guess the first point to be made is it applies to new projects going forward, so anything that\u2019s already in the portfolio either has a structure against it or probably is very far along in its 10-year window of eligibility and it wouldn\u2019t make sense for us to go back to some of those, but potentially for all PTC projects going forward, subject to available market capacity, this could be applicable.","Now when I say available market capacity, the tax equity market is a relatively specialized part of the overall capital excess possibilities that we have available to us. And the capacity of that can vary from year-to-year. So depending upon just how much capacity there is, we determine really how much we can do in any particular year, but I think it could be quite broadly applicable going forward.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s helpful. And then, just looking at the wind business, obviously you\u2019ve had some great progress in terms of additional contracts, and it looks like the outlook is positive for additional contracts. Could you speak broadly to which parts \u2013 within the U.S., which part of the U.S., which regions look most attractive in terms of growth, is it more the upper Midwest, more Texas or which parts of the country are you and your colleagues seeing the most opportunities in?","Moray Dewhurst","Sure. I would ask Armando to offer a few more \u2013 a little more color, but broadly speaking our development efforts have been and will continue to be concentrated on the best wind resource areas because that drives the best economics, and that tends to be all up and down in the middle part of the country, but Amanda can speak more specifically to some of the areas we\u2019re focused on.","Armando Pimentel","Sure. I think it\u2019s \u2013 number one, it\u2019s the middle part of the country. I call it the Midwest, but I\u2019m not a geography teacher when I talk about the Midwest, it\u2019s a very broad section, starting up in the Dakotas, going all the way down to the Texas region, including a little bit of Colorado, but I would include the Northeast in that. So it\u2019s a wide area. We\u2019ve developed very well in the area in the past and we continue to do well.","I think what you\u2019ll see as some of the newer projects come forward that we do have now some projects actually out in California, some wind projects that are starting to make sense. And we continue to look at the Canadian development for new projects. And just this past quarter, we\u2019re able to sign another 50 megawatt PPA.","Moray Dewhurst","Yes, Stephen just to add on. We have traditionally not focused a great deal of effort on the Northeast and the East Coast and that continues to be the case. The development challenges are greater, our projects tend to be smaller and the wind resource tends to be weaker. So the overall economics get much more challenging. So we tend to go where the economics are most favorable.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you very much.","Moray Dewhurst","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Moray Dewhurst","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","It\u2019s very good job with the pipeline additions on the renewable side at NEER. Can you maybe talk a little more, A, on the wind side, if you\u2019re going to qualify for the PTCs, or if you need an extension on PTCs to hit the upper end of the new guidance range? And then, on the solar additions, kind of, what markets you\u2019re seeing better opportunity, or you\u2019re even to add more significant backlog?","Moray Dewhurst","Sure. Again, I\u2019ll ask Armando to comment.","Armando Pimentel","All right. Good morning, Dan. Everything that we announced today on the wind side and including the potential to go over the high-end of the range would be built in 2015 or by the end of 2015. And we feel very comfortable that they would all qualify for the production tax credits.","Interestingly enough, I\u2019d say over the last two to three months, we\u2019ve started to get into discussions with some customers that are looking for 2016 wind. Now obviously those contracts, if we sign them with those customers, would be PTC contingent, but everything that we talked about today would be built by the end of 2015 and would qualify for the PTC.","In terms of solar, I\u2019d say it\u2019s just about everywhere. We\u2019re seeing good activity all the way from the south, and from the south, I would mean anywhere from Texas, all the way really to the Southeast United States, but we\u2019re also seeing interest really because of the improvement in economics that the reduction in the panel prices, the reduction in the balance of plant, we\u2019re seeing interest all the way up to the Canadian border, which is a positive.","The contracts that we announced today, we announced I think roughly 304 megawatts of new projects. Those projects span from California, all the way to the Southeast United States.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, very good. And then, Moray, on the 375 megawatts projects at the utility. Can you remind us, how those will go into rates, or how you guys will get recovery on those in the midst of the four year deal you have in place?","Moray Dewhurst","We would not be looking for any adjustment to the rate agreement. So we will live with the base rates that we have in place.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, very good. Thank you, guys.","Moray Dewhurst","Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll take our question from Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hi Moray, how are you?","Moray Dewhurst","Good morning Steve.","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Just the first question and I\u2019m not sure if you can answer this now, but you mentioned the 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth but 8% to 10% long-term cash flow growth. Could you maybe give us some sense or if Jim\u2019s there, when you\u2019re thinking about dividend policy, are you going to focus more on earnings growth or cash flow growth?","Moray Dewhurst","If you recall how we got to \u2013 the logic that got us to the current target 55% payout ratio, it was fundamentally based on a shift in portfolio mix. So with the portfolio shifting to a higher concentration of regulated and long-term contracted assets, we felt that that supported and justified slightly higher payout ratio than we have had in the past. If you carry that logic forward, while the same trend continues from 2014 on, it\u2019s sort of really at a slower pace.","So at this point, I don\u2019t see a particular logic for recommending a change in that payout ratio with one possible exception, which I\u2019ll come back to in a minute, but assuming that we go on that obviously means, dividend growth roughly in line with EPS growth.","The exception that I have noted on a couple of occasions is, should we at some point in the future get to a position where our capital deployment opportunity set starts to slow down, then the rapid growth in the cash flows would quickly move us into a free cash flow positive position.","And if you saw that being a sustained phenomenon for multiple years, then in that circumstance, I think we would be inclined to recommend an increase in the payout ratio. So I think those are kind of the two broad policy things that keep in mind. Obviously, we are always sensitive to the overall dividend position and how it compares with other companies we are competing for capital against, so we will always be taking that into account but from a policy perspective those were the two points I will make.","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. And then I guess, a question, maybe this is for Jim, just historically while you\u2019ve talked about the 5% to 7% growth, and Jim has said it several times, he would be disappointed if he didn\u2019t hit the upper end of that, is that still the view? And just with all these kind of different moving parts, it seems like you\u2019re executing really well on the growth investment. Is that going to show up into what kind of you\u2019ve said on getting to the higher end?","Jim Robo","Yes, Steve. I will continue to say that I\u2019ll be disappointed if we don\u2019t in \u201816 earned at the top end of the range at $6, and we\u2019ll be giving an update on that \u201816 guidance in January, as Moray said earlier on the call.","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. One last quick thing on the Florida solar, and you might have answered this, but how would those projects work, would you just do them and sell the utility under just the current rates, or would you look for like the solar clause [ph] or something of that sort?","Moray Dewhurst","No. It would be recovered within the current base rates. Obviously we want to make sure that they are those cost effective solution for our customers, we\u2019re pretty close on that. We think that we can demonstrate that\u2019s the case, because these are kind of specific projects where we\u2019ve already done a lot of work and they happen to be in a particular locations work from a transmission perspective.","So if we can do that, we would expect to go ahead and construct them and demonstrate that, net-net they are a good deal for customers from a total build perspective, in which case, they should roll into base rates going forward.","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Hi, good morning.","Moray Dewhurst","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","So just following up on the latest NEP GP guidance. The $200 million that was depicted for the end of the decade, is that consistent with the 12% to 15%, and to the extent to which it is, can you give us a sense for dropdown assumptions etcetera, that would be baked in?","Moray Dewhurst","Julien, I\u2019m not quite sure I followed the question. Today, we talked about $75 million to $100 million around the 2018 time. If you carry the growth forward a couple of more years, yes, I think you can reasonably see getting to the $200 million a year level. I believe that was the number that I mentioned in speech I gave at Platts the other day. So it\u2019s really just an extension of the growth profile.","As I said in the prepared remarks, we are right now really working through one of the specific asset that it makes most sense to make available to NEP for the short-term acceleration, but the longer-term growth profile and expectations are continue to be supported by all the projects in the Energy Resources\u2019 portfolio that we talked about in the past, including potentially contracted fossil assets and including potentially pipeline projects.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","In order to be more specific, what about the dropdown multiples that you\u2019re thinking about broadly, is it still kind of in that 9% to 11% range?","Moray Dewhurst","As a broad generalization, yes. Although one of the things that I\u2019ve observed as we\u2019ve gone through these first transactions is that EBITDA multiple and not necessarily a very good metric for thinking about dropdown valuation, because the profile of the projects can be quite different and it depends if you have a project where you have, CITC for example, whether it\u2019s pre or post the tax effect.","But we haven\u2019t really changed our view of the long-term valuation, which as I said on several occasions is going to depend upon the individual project first and foremost.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Got you. And then secondly, you\u2019ve talked about disproportionate cash flow growth. Obviously some discussions are laid around large utility acquisitions. What are you thinking about use of cash flow structurally, is the business orienting towards more resources-like businesses, or are we talking about more utility growth in the future, be it outside of FPL or within it etcetera?","Moray Dewhurst","Well, as this actually implicit in the part of my answer to Steve\u2019s question earlier, both sides of the house continue to have very strong growth prospects. And so as we go forward, the balance is remaining roughly equal. We still continue to become a little bit more regulated and long-term contracted, but not greatly so over the next few years. And so we will continue to pursue the opportunities that we see in the existing portfolio as much as we can.","In terms of third-party acquisitions or corporate large deal acquisitions, as we\u2019ve said before, we are in principal open to the possibility. We don\u2019t need to do a big deal. We continue to be very successful. We\u2019re going to be very disciplined if we do look at anything, but it\u2019s not fundamental to our strategy.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Got you. And then just a quick clarification to Dan\u2019s last question on the solar PV side, while you might not be filing for it in the immediate sense, once you are through the current stay out, those would indeed roll into base rates?","Moray Dewhurst","Sure, I would. Assuming that they indeed act to reduce total customer builds over the long-term then they would roll in the rate base and they\u2019d be reflected in our filings in 2016 assuming we file as we expect to in 2016 and for what revenue rates would go into effect in 2017.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Great. Excellent, thank you","Moray Dewhurst","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Shar Pourreza with Citigroup.","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup","Good morning everyone.","Moray Dewhurst","Good morning.","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup","Just on the solar in Florida. When you mentioned it\u2019s the most cost-effective solution for the rate payers, are you referring to the projects being at retail rate parity, or are we talking more an LCOE reaching like a natural gas high heat rate peaking asset. So can you just maybe comment on what you mean by cost-effective?","Moray Dewhurst","Sure. The way to think about cost-effective is for these projects is to think of them in the context of a constantly evolving integrated resource plan. So solar in Florida obviously has energy value, it also has capacity value based on its coincidence or degree of coincidence with the load curve. So essentially what we do is in the IRP, we plug in different combinations or potential future generation and figure out on a present value basis, which of those are cheaper for our customers.","And so if we can get to the stage where, as we think we now can with these three specific projects, we can introduce them into the mix and have the overall present value as seen through the customers eyes lower. That\u2019s a good thing for our customers and something that we want to go ahead with.","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup","Got you. And then, with the latest solar projects you\u2019ve added to your pipeline, and then maybe comments that the solar to become very economical at the end of the decade. Can you just maybe talk about the current LCOE trend versus a higher heat rate peaking asset, or are you \u2013 with and without the investment tax credit?","Moray Dewhurst","I can try, but it\u2019s very hard to think about LCOE, because you really need to think, as I\u2019ve just described for the FPL situation, in how these assets work into an integrated system. So you\u2019re really not, or you shouldn\u2019t compare assets side-by-side. That would maybe be appropriate if you were thinking about building new system from scratch, but in our case we\u2019re talking about introducing new capacity into an existing system.","With that as a caveat however, I would say that we are getting to the stage where potentially by the end of the decade, assuming that we revert to the 10% ITC that\u2019s embedded part of the tax code, that in many regions of the southern part of the country, we could see something that is competitive on an energy basis with combined cycle unit. Whether or not that makes it fully competitive on an integrated basis, then depends upon capacity value and shape of the load curve and a whole variety of other things in the region that we\u2019re talking about","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup","Got you. That\u2019s very helpful actually. And then just lastly, on the rate basing of the E&P reserves. Is there any potential in how large this could be relative to what FPL\u2019s gas needs are?","Moray Dewhurst","I think for the next few years, we\u2019re going to be limited more by sort of the pragmatic factors than theoretical long-term potential. So in theory, if we could get to 30%, 40%, 50% of the gas burn, I think that would be a very attractive proposition from a customer perspective, but I think it\u2019s going to take us time to get there. I think first of all, we\u2019ve got to get the initial deal approved and up and running and show that, that works as we anticipate it will. And then, I think we want to build on that at a moderate pace, and demonstrate that the overall strategy is effective.","I think the other factor that could be limiting here is simply the available opportunity set. FPL is looking for something a little bit different in gas reserves than where the general market is, and by that, I mean FPL is really obviously focused on dry gas. And a lot of the places that are being pursued out there tend towards the wetter or oilier spectrum. So there may be some limitations just driven by the availability of sets.","So all of that is in my mind says that I think we have realistic odds of scaling the thing up to the point where within the next few years, we can commit several hundred million dollars of capital each year into it, beyond that, it\u2019s too far for us to look right now.","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks. Good morning.","Moray Dewhurst","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","So, sorry to beat a dead horse on the regulated utility side, but just following up on the solar question. Presumably, you\u2019re making headroom in under current base rates through the continued improvement in costs under Project Momentum, such that you would still expect to be able to earn inside the ROE range, until you roll these into base rates?","Moray Dewhurst","Yes, that\u2019s generally true, not just at these assets, but more generally infrastructure CapEx that needs to be recovered under the current \u2013 in terms of the current base rate agreement. Our ability to invest, for example, in our reliability initiatives is conditional upon our ability to manage the O&M effectively. So the fact that we\u2019ve been very effective there, and as I said in the prepared remarks, ahead of where we expected to be in the sense creates more headroom to allow us to deploy capital.","Now that capital still needs to be productive from a customers\u2019 viewpoint, either increasing reliability or as we just discussed with respect to the solar units, improving the long-term cost-effectiveness of the system, but assuming it is, then from an investor perspective, we can sort of afford to accommodate it within the terms of the current settlement agreement.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Great. Two more questions, one on accounting. You mentioned that the accounting treatment for dropdowns would be to amortize those gains starting 12 months after the initial drop, and over the life of the \u2013 over what\u2019s the time again, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t recall the last piece.","Moray Dewhurst","Yes, let me just repeat that. In the structuring of NEP, because of the presence of IDRs, we have subordinated our LP interest. Those subordination provisions go away one year after we have sustained the high \u2013 the LP distribution corresponding to the high level of the splits.","Until that time, from an accounting perspective, we defer all the accounting gains that are recorded on the transfer of assets from energy resources to NEP. So once we clear that one year period, then we can start amortizing those gains.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","And those gains would be amortized over what period?","Moray Dewhurst","Over the life of the assets.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. And we would expect those to run through NextEra Energy Resources\u2019 ongoing earnings?","Moray Dewhurst","Correct.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Right. And so you get the cash in, and you\u2019re doing the drop. You amortize the gain over starting the year out over the life of the asset?","Moray Dewhurst","We are subject to the \u2013 well, the technical description that I gave, going forward, it would then be the case, but then for subsequent projects, you would be getting the cash and starting to realize the gain simultaneously.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Got you. Great. One final question for Armando. We talked a bit last time we saw you about the opportunity for storage as a growth investment at NEER, California has this RFP going on. Can you talk about whether or not storage is in fact, a piece of the growth opportunity at NEER, and if so, what is the magnitude and when might we start seeing those investments?","Armando Pimentel","I think it is. I think I\u2019ve been pretty consistent in saying that at least my expectations for storage investments to become a significant part of our CapEx spending at NEER is really towards the later part of the decade. I mean there are \u2013 as you mentioned there are opportunities in California, opportunities in Hawaii, opportunities in New York, and actually there are some smaller opportunities in PJM.","We are looking at and playing in all of those markets, but I would not expect in the near-term through 2016, even if we\u2019re significantly successful for the CapEx to be very meaningful in terms of what it adds to earnings.","Having said that, the team that we have put together, I think is a good team, and I continue to believe that towards the later part of this decade, we will be able to make some significant investments.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Thank you, gentlemen.","Moray Dewhurst","I think we have time for one more.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Good morning.","Moray Dewhurst","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Just to recap a little bit here on the NEP accelerated growth and maintaining the long-term growth outlook as well. Is that basically being driven by just a more robust outlook in terms of the opportunities for renewable development or \u2013 I just wanted to clarify as to what \u2013 just making sure that I understand exactly how you\u2019re able to accelerate the growth in the near-term, and maintain long-term growth. Is that what\u2019s driving it?","Moray Dewhurst","Yes, I mean the underpinning of it obviously are long-term expectations for the evolution of the Energy Resources\u2019 portfolio because that\u2019s the principal source of the projects that create the opportunity set for NextEra Energy Partners. So we\u2019re feeling very good about that. We\u2019ve had great success this quarter in the relatively short-term or the long-term fundamentals that clearly for us to be very encouraging. So that\u2019s kind of a fundamental driver.","Then assuming that you can get comfortable with a long-term growth expectation for the opportunities set, then the next question is, what\u2019s the right sort of shape to the growth profile, and clearly we\u2019ve recognized that, other things equal, meaning as long as you can sustain a long period of good growth, by good I mean 12% to 15%, then it\u2019s better to have more earlier rather than later. And then if you couple that with recognition that with this tax equity structure, we may have some assets that previously we would have thought about as not being available for 10 years, now being eligible earlier. It makes sense to get those transferred when we can.","So there is more opportunity, particularly in the short-term, and hence acceleration in the short-term at least was to make a lot of sense.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. I just want to make sure I understood that. Then with respect to Slide 20, and the new investment \u2013 now I realize things have changed. You have changed things a little bit here. Provide a lot more information, but it does look like the new investment line has dropped a bit, obviously we have NEP on the top part there. Is there anything that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, could you elaborate a little bit more about what\u2019s changed in new investment, other than the allocation to NEP in that slide?","Moray Dewhurst","It\u2019s going to be difficult for me to do that on the call.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay.","Moray Dewhurst","Let me just couple of caveat. That Slide 20, it does have some differences from the part, what I call gross margin hedged chart. So it\u2019s very difficult to compare those directly. Among other things, we have in the new disclosure, we have allocated into the adjusted EBITDA across the various lines the G&A that we have supporting that respective elements that the business that we didn\u2019t have before. So all those were intended to be a little bit lower.","One of the things that is on our list to do, is now to go back and compare these pieces and understand precisely why is some of the line items might look a little bit different. I would say there is no major change to the 2015 numbers. Most of the developments that we\u2019ve seen in the last quarter will tend to affect \u201816 and \u201817 much more.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay, great. And then just finally, weather versus normal. I\u2019m sorry if I missed this. What has it been year-to-date, the impact of weather versus normal?","Moray Dewhurst","On Energy Resources year-to-date on the wind side is a little above leverage, the quarter was a little bit below average. Solar has been about on.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","And the utility? Has it been big at all [ph]?","Moray Dewhurst","No, it\u2019s been in average year overall. The challenges we\u2019ve had here in Florida have been associated much more with heavy rainfall and thunderstorms and lightening, but in terms of average cooling degree days, it\u2019s not been greatly different. Now recognize of course, that all of that gets absorbed by pluses or minuses and simple as depreciation and amortization at FPL. So it doesn\u2019t have a direct immediate ROE impact.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Right. Okay. Thanks so much.","Moray Dewhurst","Okay. Well, thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

As you all know, for some months now we've been assessing the possibility of forming a so-called yieldco. After extensive analysis and careful thought, we've made the judgment that it is in the best interest of our shareholders for us to take the next step in this process. And on April 4, we've filed confidentially with the SEC a draft S-1 registration statement, which would allow us to move forward with a yieldco structure following the SEC review process and subject to market conditions.","Unfortunately, having given you this information, we're now very restricted from offering you the additional information that I know you will all be looking for.","As you may know, there is a concern that conveying the information about the yieldco at this time might be construed by the SEC as a prohibited offer of securities under the SEC rules, which in turn could lead to delays in our ability to move forward with the transaction.","Accordingly, we've concluded that it would be best to wait until after the S-1 is public before providing more detail. Thus, we'll not be able to discuss with you today such matters as the exact projects or megawatts involved over time or the financial performance of the assets that we expect to make available for purchase by the yieldco, or many other things that I know you will have questions about.","Further, while it is our present intention to move forward with this transaction, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to execute successfully on terms that we believe will create long-term value for our shareholders, which remains our objective. We will continue to work diligently to ensure that we remain focused on this fundamental goal.","While there is much that we cannot discuss at this stage, there are a few points that I can make. First, we've previously said that we would want to be sure that the introduction of the yieldco structure would not be negative to credit since our credit position is an important underpinning of our competitive strategy. The fact that we are moving forward obviously implies that we've developed comfort that this objective is achievable, while the principal control on this will be the integration of the yieldco into our overall financing plan in such a way that our credit metrics are maintained or strengthened.","We will also be sensitive to the impact on our portfolio mix going forward. We expect to continue to place emphasis on developing new high-quality contracted projects at Energy Resources. Our view with the credit impact of our proposed transaction is based not only on our own assessment but also on our discussions with the rating agencies.","Second, we have also previously stated that one area of focus for us would be to ensure as close an alignment of interest is possible between our existing shareholders and investors in the yieldco vehicle. We believe we've developed a suitable structure to support the same, and I look forward to sharing details with you at a later date.","Third, many of you have previously heard me say that an area of concern for us would be the cost and other implications on ongoing reporting and compliance obligations for 2 publicly traded entities. We now feel comfortable that we will be able to manage these effectively. And while they will undoubtedly be extra costs, we did not believe they will detract meaningfully from our ability to create value for NextEra Energy shareholders through the transaction.","Finally, let me reiterate that while our decisions are based on extensive analysis and careful consideration, in the end we're making judgments about future value creation, and there can be no guarantee we're correct. With these comments aside, I'm also pleased to be able to tell you that we had an excellent first quarter overall notwithstanding some challenges associated with the harsh winter in the Northeast, and we're off to a good start for the year.","I'll now turn the call over to Moray to fill you in on the details.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. As Jim said, we had an excellent first quarter overall. Our financial and operating performance was very strong, and we continued to make good progress on our capital projects and other strategic initiatives consistent with the strategies we discussed in our investor conference over a year ago.","We continue to believe we are well positioned to deliver against the financial expectations we shared with you out through the 2016 time frame.","At Florida Power & Light, we continue to drive value for our customers through low bills, high reliability and excellent customer service, and for our shareholders through strong earnings growth. For the fifth year in a row, our typical residential customer bills are the lowest in the state, and are currently about 25% below the national average.","Our major capital projects remain on track, and I'm pleased to note that the second of our 3 generation modernization projects at Riviera Beach entered service just after the end of the first quarter, about 2 months earlier than originally anticipated, and slightly below the cost estimates submitted to the PSC in 2008.","Construction has begun on the Port Everglades modernization, which we expect to come on line in mid-2016.","During the quarter, we invested another $1 billion of capital in FPL, consistent with our strategy of steadily improving the long-term value we offer our customers.","At Energy Resources, our development and construction programs remain on track, and our backlog of contracted renewables projects continues to develop with the PPA for roughly 250 megawatts of U.S. wind signed since the last call.","Increased contributions from our contracted renewables portfolio continue to drive earnings growth. The extreme market conditions in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, particularly during January, caused parts of our customer supply business to underperform, but this impact turned out to be less than we had expected, and was offset by other favorable impacts, many of which were driven by the same factors that caused the underperformance in customer supply. Overall, we were pleased with the quarter.","Now let's look at the results for FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For the first quarter of 2014, FPL reported net income of $347 million or $0.79 per share, up $0.11 per share year-over-year. We continue to focus on deploying capital productively in ways that have long-term benefits to customers.","As I mentioned, FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion in the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be roughly $3.3 billion. Regulatory capital employed grew 6.7% over the same quarter last year, which combined with an increasing profitability resulted in very strong net income growth.","Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes is estimated to be 11.22% for the 12 months ended March 2014. This includes the impact of the Project Momentum transition cost incurred late last year. You will recall the Project Momentum is our enterprise-wide productivity initiative that we started last year. Absent these costs, regulatory ROE would have been 11.5%. As a reminder, the impact of the 2013 transition costs will roll off our reported regulatory ROE as we move through the year since the regulatory ROE is measured on a 12 month trailing basis.","Based on the progress we've made this -- excuse me -- made thus far in our cost position, the continued improvement in the Florida economy, our current capital investment program, and the amount of reserve amortization were taken to date, we are now comfortable targeting regulatory ROE at 11.5% for the full year 2014.","As we noted last quarter, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each 12-month trailing period. In this case, the 11.5% that I just mentioned, excluding special charges, such as the Project Momentum transition costs.","We utilized $125 million of reserved amortization during the quarter in order to achieve this predetermined ROE. As we mentioned before, we always expect to use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year than the second half given the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses. In fact, over the remainder of the year, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we would expect to reverse the reserve amortization taken in the first quarter and end the year with a balance roughly equal to where we started or possibly even a little better.","Looking beyond 2014, we believe that our reserve balance when combined with our weather-normalized sales growth forecast of 1.5% to 2% per year, and our current O&M expectations, as well as a commitment of a full-year total of roughly $7 billion in infrastructure CapEx, will allow us to support regulatory ROEs in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% for the remaining period of the current rate agreement.","Furthermore, we expect that we can do this while keeping typical residential customer bills the lowest in the state and among the lowest in the country and improving on our already excellent reliability in customer service records. If we are successful in meeting our expectations, by 2016 we will have further improved our already outstanding customer value proposition and will be well positioned for 2017 and beyond.","The Florida economy continues to strengthen, and since 2010, most of the indicators we track continue to improve, particularly in the areas of job growth, business expansion and businesses that have relocated into the state. This is due in part to a focused effort of the state on economic development, and an overall improvement in the business climate, including reductions in taxes benefiting businesses and individual taxpayers alike.","The state's relative economic position compared with the U.S. overall has improved significantly since 2010. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in March was 6.3%, down 1.4 percentage points from a year ago. The number of jobs in Florida was up 225,100, an increase of 3% compared to a year earlier, and March was the 44th consecutive month with a positive job growth in Florida following more than 3 years of job losses. Nationally, the number of jobs was up 1.7% over the year. Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since April 2012. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth, and more than 550,000 private sector jobs have been added since December 2010.","The housing market in Florida also continues to show signs of resiliency. As the accompanying chart shows, new building permits have dropped from their recent peak, although they remained at a healthy level, and mortgage delinquency rates continue to decline.","The Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 16% from the prior year. Other positive economic data across the state include continued improvement in retail taxable sales, as well as bankruptcies declining on an annual basis. Overall, Florida's economy continues to progress well.","FPL's customer metrics showed solid improvement this quarter. Underlying usage per customer increased 0.4% compared to the same quarter last year, which is consistent with our long-term expectation of approximately 0.5% per year, net of the impact of efficiency and conservation programs at least through the period of the rate agreement. However, as we've often pointed out, usage growth tends to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter.","Another encouraging development during the quarter was a decrease in the percentage of low usage customers, the 12-month average of the low-usage percentage has fallen to 8.1%, its lowest level since May 2007. The number of inactive accounts has also continued to decline, reaching its lowest level since April 2004.","During the first quarter, we also saw the largest average increase in customers since late 2007, with approximately 87,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2013, representing an increase of 1.9%. However, roughly 0.9% of the increase can be attributed to the rollout of our remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by our smart meter program that we highlighted last year. As a reminder, these new customers, which are disproportionately low-usage and residential, have a lower impact on our sales. We estimate that customer growth accounted for about 1.1% of the increase in sales during the quarter. Good usage and customer growth combined with a favorable year-over-year weather effect of 2.9% to yield overall retail sales growth of 4.4%.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2014 GAAP earnings of $86 million or $0.20 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $211 million or $0.48 per share. During the quarter, we reversed our prior decision to sell off fossil assets in Maine. As a reminder, the Maine fossil assets are a combined 796 megawatts of oil-fired power plants operating within the NEPOOL market.","In last year's first quarter call, we announced plans to adjust our portfolio by selling these assets, and we conducted a competitive bid process during the fall and winter. However, the bids we received were not consistent with our view of the fundamental value of the assets, and recent developments in regional market conditions have reinforced this assessment. While these assets are not called upon to run frequently, they do play an important role in supporting the reliability of the electric system, and this has real economic value. Accordingly, we have decided to retain these assets as an integral part of our New England portfolio.","As a result of our decision to retain these assets, we have recognized an after-tax gain of $12 million during the quarter based on the current estimated fair value of the fossil assets, and we have reclassified from discontinued operations to income from continuing operations the after-tax loss recorded during the first quarter of last year. The gain in 2014 and the loss in 2013 are both excluded from adjusted earnings. The financial impact from operations of these assets for both periods is included in both GAAP and adjusted results.","Energy Resources' adjusted EPS contribution increased $0.06 from the prior year comparable quarter. New wind and solar investments added $0.06 per share, reflecting continued strong contributions from growth in our contract and renewables portfolio. Across the balance of the portfolio, the aggregate of other impacts was flat. However, because there were individually significant ups and downs and some of the elements were interrelated, let me provide a few more details.","As discussed earlier in the call, our results suffered from the adverse effect of extreme winter volatility on our full requirements business in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. This negative effect on the full requirements portfolio was much larger than the positive impacts on other parts of the customer supply and trading portfolio, and the overall contribution from all these businesses was down $0.11 per share. Despite this challenge, and in some cases, as a result of the same extreme market conditions, there were opportunities in other parts of the portfolio. Contributions from existing assets increased $0.14 per share, including $0.05 from existing wind assets net of PTC roll-off as a result of favorable generation. The same weather system that drove the challenging market conditions in the Northeast also resulted in above average wind resource from many of our wind sites. The same market conditions also meant that the contribution from our Maine Fossil assets increased $0.03. Finally, there were a number of smaller favorable impact across other parts of the portfolio that collectively added up to $0.06.","Increased corporate G&A and other costs contributed negative $0.04 for the year-over-year change, including share dilution of negative $0.02. All other effects were minor as reflected on the accompanying slide.","For the full year, we expect to elect CITCs on roughly 265 megawatts from our Mountain View Solar project and the portions of Genesis and Desert Sunlight solar project that are expected to enter service in 2014. This equates to roughly $60 million in adjusted earnings, down from roughly $70 million in 2013 on 280 megawatts of solar projects.","The Energy Resources team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities.","In Canada, we continue to expect the 466 megawatts in our backlog to enter service by the end of 2015 with the majority expected to come into service in 2014.","Our contracted U.S. solar backlog remains on track. And during the quarter, we brought roughly 170 -- 165 megawatts of solar into service with the commissioning of Mountain View, the balance of Genesis and partial commissioning of Desert Sunlight. We continue to expect to bring the remaining roughly 650 megawatts of our backlog into service by the end of 2016. In addition to our existing contracted backlog, we continue to pursue additional solar opportunities, including possibly 1 large 250 megawatt project, and a development pipeline of smaller 10- to 40-megawatt projects.","Turning to our U.S. wind program, we commissioned roughly 75 megawatts during the first quarter. Additionally, the team recently signed a PPA for roughly 250-megawatt project, which is expected to come into service in 2015, bringing our total contracted U.S. wind development program for 2013 through 2015 to approximately 1,675 megawatts. Based on everything we see at the moment, we continue to believe our total 2013 to 2015 U.S. wind program could be 2,000 to 2,500 megawatts.","Turning now with the consolidated results, for the first quarter of 2014, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $430 million or $0.98 per share. NextEra Energy's 2014 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $557 million and $1.26, respectively.","Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other Segment were down $0.03 per share compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to consolidating tax adjustments.","As we noted last quarter, financial results and project updates for the pipeline projects will be reported as part of our Corporate & Other business segment. Both pipeline projects, Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection, continue to progress well through their respective development processes, and we expect to submit necessary filings with FERC later this year. We expect to receive FERC approval sometime in 2015, and we expect the projects to be in service by mid-2017.","Spectra Energy Partners, majority owner of Sabal Trail Transmission, continues to meet the effort to market additional available capacity on the upstream pipeline to potential shippers, and detail siting and environmental activities are under way on both pipelines.","At this point early in the year we're very pleased with our progress. Our first quarter results ended up being a little better than we had expected, but we see nothing to cause us to change our view for the full year. Second quarter comparisons will be challenged by the fact that Seabrook has an outage this year, but we expect the second half of the year to show solid growth supporting a full year 2014 adjusted earnings per share range of $5.05 to $5.45. In the appendix, we provide a number of sensitivities around our 2014 expectations.","Looking ahead to 2016, we see nothing that would change the range of earnings expectations we provided during March 2013 for 2016. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2016 to be in the range of $5.50 to $6, which is consistent with EPS growth at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off a 2012 base. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.","And with that, we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to ask just quickly if you could -- I know you can't comment specifically on the yieldco, but as you think about your broader renewables commitment, how does this change your view on what is possible from a development perspective? And I suppose could you address that both from the utility scale and from a smaller scale perspective on solar and wind?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, as Jim said in the prepared remarks, we are limited in what we can say. All I can really say is that we continue to believe that we will see long-term growth in demand for renewables in this country. We continue to believe that we will be well positioned to compete to gain a share of that demand, and that demand will be seen both on the wind and the solar side varied by geography, but beyond that I really can't go.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Excellent. And I suppose just in thinking about what is within the context of eligible, is it fair to say that your prior comments still apply?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Again, I can't really say anything more than we've said to date.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough, just trying to get that out there. And then just secondly, as you look at the expectation for double tier, we've heard -- I suppose a little bit on the PTC expansion. What are your thoughts? What are you seeing out there in the market as a result of that? Does that mean that clients potentially are pushing out their desire to lock up contracts given the potential for the extension? How has that changed the dynamics as best you see it?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I'll ask Armando to offer some more details. But just generally, I would say there continues to be good interest. We're in active dialogue with a number of customers. But as always, the uncertainty about the extension of the PTC does play in. So at this point, I think there is very good odds that we will see another extension in the PTC. But obviously, the uncertainty does affect how that plays out in the marketplace. Armando?","Armando Pimentel","I don't have anything to add to that one.","Operator","And we'll go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to just talk about the growth in solar and from a strategic point of view how you think about the approach. We're seeing more distributed solar done both residential and commercial. And there the economics you really under net metering rules, there is potentially very good margin in the sense of -- as solar installation costs drop you're able to arbitrage most of the utility bill, whereas in large solar projects its often still done under RFP and somewhat competitive in that regard. How do you think about the growth in solar in terms of, take for example in commercial solar? Do you see potentially going down market in a sense of smaller projects over time? Or do you think you'll likely remain fairly a large-scale in terms of as you think about solar?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, Steven, we're certainly going to continue to have a concentration on large-scale solar projects. As I think you know we have had now for some time a relatively small development effort in the distributed C&I space. So we do think that there will be some opportunities there. But I guess the main comment that I would make on this subject is that in sort of broad strategy terms, we want to try and be aligned with what we perceive to be the long-term fundamentals of economics, and even with -- regardless of how prices are coming down, we continue to see the fundamental economics of larger-scale solar projects dominating those of small-scale solar projects, particularly the very small-scale solar projects such as residential rooftop. So we recognize that there is a market opportunity for some folks, driven by, I would say, specific market rules, but we are a little leery when those market rules really don't match up with the underlying economics. So for the long-term, we want our development activity to be aligned with the fundamentals of the economics.","James L. Robo","I would just add, Steven, this is Jim, that I think it's really dangerous to assume that from a rate design standpoint across utilities across the country that they're not going to very aggressively address the fact that there is a effectively a net metering subsidy in non-solar rooftop. Residential solar rooftop users are effectively paying the grid costs of the solar rooftop users through -- as a result of the net metering subsidy. I think it's very dangerous to assume that utilities aren't going to aggressively address that through rate design over the next several years.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Excellent color and very fair point. Understood. And just in Florida, as we look, we've seen a lot of potential legislative activity on solar. Are there any things in particular we should be most focused on as we watch? It's honestly hard to tell the noise from the substance in terms of just the variety of potential legislative activity. Any further color you can add on solar legislative activity in Florida?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I'll ask Eric to comment specifically, but what's going on in Florida here, at least from our perspective, is that we believe there are some opportunities to introduce more solar into the system, and we want to come forward with proposals that are the most economic for our customers. But on the political, Eric, do you have any thoughts?","Eric E. Silagy","What I would add is that the -- this week is the last week of the legislative session for 2014. So it's going to end on Friday. There's no pending legislation with regards to any type of solar or renewables at this point. And as Moray said, we're exploring opportunities where it makes economic sense. But there has being a real focus by the legislative body to make sure that primarily power prices stay affordable and customers have the lowest bills possible.","Operator","And we'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just -- I'm sorry, if I missed this. Did you guys -- or can you guys say when the S-1 the public one will be filed?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, the timing obviously depends upon the SEC review process. I would hope that we would be talking a matter of several weeks rather than several months.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then just to make sure the -- just wanted to follow-up on the merchant -- the main merchant stuff and the change reversal. Are you guys -- has there been any strategic change with respect to merchant exposure strategically because of changes in the market or anything? Or is this just simply because of this 1 asset that you're being offered and what have you?","Moray P. Dewhurst","It's really specific to the asset. And also, to be fair, how the asset fits into our portfolio. It has a distribution of outcomes that is not at all symmetrical, but it -- when it does well it offsets other parts of the portfolio that may not be doing so well. But it was fundamentally a question of the value that we were receiving in the bids wasn't consistent with our view in the fundamentals. And obviously the fundamentals of that market has strengthened a little bit relative to this time last year when we originally made the decision to put it up for sale.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But there's been no change in your move to more contracted and what-have-you assets, is that correct?","Moray P. Dewhurst","That's correct. In terms of new development activities, you're going to see pretty much everything we do will continue to be in contracted space.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally on the weather impact, I just wasn't clear on a normalized earnings basis. What the -- I saw the $0.11 that was negative and I saw the 2.9% sales growth. I just wasn't clear about what -- and I'm sorry if I missed it -- what the net-net sort of weather impact was for the quarter on a U.S. basis?","Moray P. Dewhurst","You really can't look at the net weather impact for us as an enterprise. You have to look at the 2 businesses separately. Because they're accounting for the rate agreement, the weather impact at FPL is absorbed into the overall calculation and effectively is adjusted out by the use of surplus depreciation, because we are effectively managing to the predetermined ROE. So it has a longer-term impact, but it doesn't have a direct impact in the short-term. On the Energy Resources side, wind -- on a year-over-year basis, wind resource contributed about $0.09, so $0.09 up versus the year. So the pure resource component was about $0.09.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Versus the $0.11 negative, right?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. Okay. To be fair, I mean, not all of the $0.09 can directly be attributed to the weather, but associated with $0.11, if you understand what I mean.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman from Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","First, just wanted to ask on the utility. The -- so just wanted to understand, the 11.5% ROE is what you expect to earn within the guidance for this year, and it's just a matter of how much is kind of -- the amortization was around to kind of get you to that and the more you can do, yes.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, that's a fair characterization. So for this year, we will be at 11.5%. And as I've said in the prepared remarks, looking forward, based on where we are at the moment, we think, we can continue to be in the upper half of the 9.5% to 11.5% allowed range.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And on the SEC process, maybe you could just make sure we understand the way the private filings work. So you file it, we don't know when you filed it, we don't know when it will come out. But once it comes out publicly, that's a fully amended ready to go S-1? So we could see kind of the end game?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No, we've said that we filed on -- the confidential version on April 4. So now we're in the review process. Obviously, it depends upon the degree of the SEC's review and the comments that come from that and our responses to that, so it's a variable time. But at some point, we will be -- we hope through with that process and then the filing will become public.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","But it is the only public once we're at a final version that will actually be used on the transaction or --","James L. Robo","Steve, this is Jim. If it does become public ultimately and market conditions are there and we move forward, all versions of -- the first S-1 that we filed and then the final S-1 that gets filed will all be available and public, so everything will be available.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First on FPL, just want to make sure I understand on the regulatory ROE. You're basically assuming that you're not going to take any during the course of 2014 because what you took in the first quarter you'll just reverse out gradually during the rest of the year?","Moray P. Dewhurst","That's correct, broadly speaking. Depends what the summer weather is.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Totally understood. Second, what's your latest thought about timing of next rate case?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, first of all, just to remind everybody, the current rate agreement goes through the end of 2016. Clearly, we are aiming strategically to put ourselves in a position for whatever comes beyond that, whether it's a formal rate case or whether it's another rate agreement to continue to track record of delivering value to the customers. In that vein, I would simply blend out that project momentum is a very important part of our ability to be in a good position come the end of '16 to continue to offer both customers and shareholders a very attractive value proposition. Beyond that, it's still only the early part of 2014.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. I was just trying to think of the longer-term scenario of -- do you have to file or can you, if you manage your costs really well and you get a little bit of demand recovery, can you stay out of potential rate proceeding for beyond 2016 or so?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, I think it's premature to speculate on the specifics of that, but certainly we are doing everything we can to put ourselves in a position to go for as long as we can without filing a rate case.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, understood. And finally on the near side, again, I want to make sure, can you walk through just the amount of the megawatts of U.S. wind and U.S. solar, you expect to come online? Meaning not the stuff that's already online or COD, but that you expect to come online in both 2014 and '15. You made some comments in the prepared remarks about specific amounts in 2014. I just want to make sure we're understanding what's coming when.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Okay. At the risk of -- well, in order not to confuse you, I'm going to point you to Slide 11. I think that has the basic information, as well as Slide 25 has the details of individual projects that go into each of the buckets in Slide 11, so I think the information is there.","Operator","And we'll go now to Angie Storozynski from Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","So I wanted to actually follow-up on the regulatory plans for FPL and from 2 aspects. One is recent polls in Florida are suggesting that the former Governor, John Kristoff, is -- could be coming back, and how should we think about it of its potential impact on your regulatory affairs in Florida? Secondly on FPL, could you give us an update on the upgrades to your gas peakers? And thirdly, are you seeing any increased interest in potentially contracting new renewable projects from regulated utilities as they anticipate the new carbon emission rule from the EPA?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Angie, on the first, I would just say that we have operated very effectively through many different political and regulatory environments, and we are simply focused on doing the best job we can to deliver value for our customers. We think that's the best strategy for putting ourselves in the best position in the regulatory environment. On the peakers, we're in the midst of an in the field testing program where we are monitoring the actual emissions. We don't know exactly how that -- how long that will take, but should certainly be completed by the end of the summer. Based on that, we will then have a better sense of how we move forward. I think it's likely to be something along the same lines as we had outlined before, although it may not require as much capital as we had originally anticipated. And I would think that we would still be looking at the bulk of that activity being in the 2016 time frame. On the -- you're going to have to remind me what your third question was.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Yes, I was asking about utilities being more receptible to or willing to sign PPAs for renewable project in anticipation of the carbon rule from the EPA, basically attempting to offset the carbon emissions with some more renewables and the -- either in their portfolio or under PPAs?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Okay. I understand. Yes, I haven't heard of that being a motivator. I think the motivations are otherwise. But, Armando, you want to comment?","Armando Pimentel","Yes, let me give just a brief update of wind development. Moray mentioned this before. Clearly with the PTC extension out there and discussion on the PTC, there's a bit of uncertainty with customers, whether they're going to sign PPA contracts in 2015 or try to push it out. But I think that uncertainty will be cleared up really by the end of the year when we understand what's going on, on that front. We have a very large and active pipeline, potential opportunities at this point. We've talked about that pipeline before over the last year, both in the U.S. and Canada. And a fair number of the PPAs that we've actually signed in the last 18 to 24 months have actually not been driven by renewable portfolio standards in the states, have not been driven by EPA concerns, have actually been driven just by the pure economics of the long-term wind contracts. I think it's still a bit early to understand what some of the EPA rules might mean for us and beyond 2015, but it certainly can't be a negative, and I would expect it to be a positive. And, I guess, the last comment I would make is because we are getting towards the end of the PTC extension, which because of IRS guidelines essentially expires at the end of 2015, there are several acquisition opportunities in the market that we and others are looking at.","Operator","And we will take our last question today from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You sent an update on your latest thoughts on the plans around potential utility investment in the upstream nat gas business, anything you can share on that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Not a lot new that we can share at the moment. Just to remind folks, we continue to pursue the potential opportunity to help the FPL customer by reducing the potential volatility of the fuel component of the bill and possibly lower its average cost over time by investing directly in gas reserves. We need to find the right set of deals that will make that a reality. We are in the midst of pursuing that, and I would certainly hope we will be in a position to come forward with something specific within the next 12 months. But that's -- I've said that before, there's really nothing new there.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So we shouldn't be necessarily expecting sort of first, sort of trial in this calendar year, it's more of 12 month?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, not necessarily.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It could be as soon as this year, Moray?","Moray P. Dewhurst","It could be as soon as this year, but we'll have to see. The only other thing to say is that anything we do to start with will be fairly small, it won't have a huge impact. Obviously, we want to establish a framework and show that these kinds of things can be a good deal before we start to scale up.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference, and we thank you for your participation."],"15593":["NextEra Energy, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Matthew Roskot. Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew Roskot","Thank you, April. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2017 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Jim will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to John for a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.","James Robo","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As John will describe in more detail later in the call, 2017 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. Moreover, 2017 was a year in which we successfully positioned both businesses for strong growth well into the next decade. For NextEra Energy Partners, we started 2017 by structurally modifying the IDR fee, which allowed NEP to extend its distribution growth expectations through at least 2022, avoid the need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest other than modest sales under the ATM program and increase levered returns for unitholders to the low double digits on future acquisitions. This change, combined with other steps we took to improve NEP's investor value proposition over the past year, including governance enhancements, stand-alone credit ratings in the mid- to high-BB category and NEP's utilization of additional sources of low-cost financing, helped separate NEP from its peers. We were able to grow the NEP LP distribution by 15% year-over-year and deliver a total unitholder return of over 75%. NEP outperformed other yieldcos by more than 55% on average, and its total shareholder return was almost 90% higher than the Alerian MLP Index.","With the flexibility to grow in three ways, acquiring assets from Energy Resources organically or acquiring assets from other third parties, NEP has clear visibility to support its growth going forward. As we said before, Energy Resources' portfolio as of the end of 2016 provides one potential path to support NEP's 12% to 15% growth per year through 2022. And with one of the lowest costs of capital among all yieldcos and MLPs, NEP has the currency to be competitive in acquiring long-term contracted assets from other third parties going forward.","With tax reform and a record renewable origination year by Energy Resources in what promises to be one of the best renewables development environments in our history over the next several years, we look forward to further improving NEP's already best-in-class distribution growth visibility. I continue to believe that when NEP's growth potential is combined with its substantial financing flexibility and the strength of its underlying portfolio, with an 18-year average contract life and strong counterparty credit profile, NEP offers unitholders an investor value proposition that is second to none. For these reasons, NEP is as well positioned as it's ever been, and I look forward to strong performance in 2018 and beyond.","Turning now to NextEra Energy. 2017 was an outstanding year of execution across the board. Financially, we were able to grow 2017 adjusted EPS by 8.2% and extend our long-term track record of delivering results for shareholders. Dating back to 2005, we've delivered compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of over 8%, which is the highest among all top 10 U.S. power companies who've achieved on the average compound annual growth of 2.9% over the same period.","In 2017, we delivered a total shareholder return of over 34%, outperforming the S&P 500 by roughly 15% and the S&P Utilities Index by more than 25%. Over the last 10 years, we've outperformed 79% of the S&P 500 Utilities Index and 63% of the S&P 500. We were once again honored to be named, for the 11th time in 12 years, #1 in the electric and gas utilities industry on Fortune's 2018 list of World's Most Admired Companies. The strength of our 2017 execution has set the foundation for several announcements that I'm going to make on this morning's call.","First, as we announced last week, tax reform provides an unprecedented opportunity to benefit FPL customers. Rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $1.3 billion in Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs, FPL plans to recover these costs through federal tax savings, generated during its current settlement agreement. During the fourth quarter, FPL expensed the approximately $1.3 billion that was recorded as a regulatory asset related to Irma cost recovery and utilized the available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of this expense, ending the year with a zero reserve amortization balance. FPL expects to partially restore the reserve amortization utilized in the fourth quarter through tax savings and to end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to potentially avoid a base rate increase for up to two additional years in 2021 and 2022.","As a reminder, FPL is currently allowed to earn within a permitted ROE band of 9.6% to 11.6%. The settlement agreement also allows FPL to access and utilize the accumulated reserve amortization available at the end of 2020 by deferring the initiation of a new base rate case. Based on what we see at this time and assuming normal weather and operating conditions, our goal is for FPL to continue operating under its current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years.","The flexibility afforded under the settlement agreement provides FPL with the ability to return tax savings to customers in the fastest way possible. By foregoing the surcharge, FPL customers are expected to save approximately $250 on average through 2020, with a typical residential bill nearly 30% below the national average, following a $3.35 per month decrease that will take effect March 1 with the completion of cost recovery for Hurricane Matthew.","Moreover, by potentially operating under the settlement agreement for up to two additional years, customers save by avoiding a base rate increase in 2021 and 2022.","Second, I'm pleased to announce that we're increasing our financial expectations to take into account the favorable impact of tax reform at Energy Resources. The reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% at Energy Resources is significantly accretive to earnings. Due primarily to this favorable impact, tax reform is expected to increase NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS by roughly $0.45 in 2018. For 2018, our goal is to achieve our new $7.70 per share midpoint, which assumes we grow our 2017 adjusted EPS of $6.70 per share by 8% and add approximately $0.45 for the benefit of tax reform.","Third, with the certainty provided by the new tax reform legislation and the anticipated continued strength of the investment opportunities at both FPL and Energy Resources, I'm also pleased to announce that we're extending NextEra Energy's financial expectations by one year, from 2020 to 2021. With this announcement, we now expect to be able to sustain the 6% to 8% per year growth in adjusted EPS off our revised 2018 midpoint of $7.70 per share through 2021, subject to our usual caveats. Details of our new financial expectations are included in the accompanying slide.","Tax reform is generally expected to result in lower operating cash flows for NextEra Energy as FPL uses tax savings to recover the Irma storm surcharges. Despite this, everything we see now suggests that our operating cash flow will continue to grow in line with our adjusted EPS growth range from 2018 through 2021. Overall, the tax reform outcome is positive and will immediately benefit FPL customers while being accretive to NextEra Energy shareholders.","Fourth, we're advancing our renewable product offerings as we prepare for the next phase of renewable development. As a result, our prospects for new renewables growth have never been stronger. As expected, Congress did not make any retroactive changes to the PTC or ITC, which were each extended under a five-year phasedown at the end of 2015. With incentives, wind is the cheapest form of energy at $0.012 to $0.018 per kilowatt hour at high wind sites, while solar continues to be priced at a discount to other forms of generation at $0.025 to $0.035 per kilowatt hour. Taken together, we continue to be in the best renewables environment in our history, as evidenced by our 2017 results.","The ongoing cost declines in renewables are leading to increased economic demand from customers. Wind turbine technology continues to improve through a combination of taller towers and wider rotor diameters. Today, we're installing 127-meter rotor diameter turbines. By 2021, we expect manufacturers to be selling approximately 150-meter rotor diameter turbines in the U.S. market, further increasing net capacity factors and helping reduce installed wind costs on a dollar per kilowatt basis. Over the past year, we've seen an approximate 30% reduction in turbine costs. Through the end of the decade, we expect another 10% decline per year on average. As a result, we continue to expect that without incentives, early in the next decade, wind is going to be a $0.02 to $0.025 per kilowatt hour product.","For solar, we continue to see rapid price declines and efficiency improvements. And we're well positioned to mitigate any impacts of the recently announced tariffs from the ITC 201 proceeding. As we previously discussed, before any tariffs were put in place, we purchased modules for our 2017 and 2018 build. We recently completed an additional order that covers our module needs for 2019 and a significant portion of our 2020 build. Ultimately, we expect that by 2020, as the tariff steps down, the market will have adjusted to these new dynamics. By early in the next decade, as further cost declines are realized and module efficiencies continue to improve, we expect that without incentives, solar will be $0.03 to $0.04 per kilowatt hour product, below the variable costs required to operate an existing coal or nuclear generating facility of $0.035 to $0.05 per kilowatt hour.","As the world's current leader in wind, solar and storage development, we are uniquely positioned for the next phase of renewables deployment that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution, to provide a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a firm generation resource. We believe no other company has our expertise in all three products, wind, solar and battery storage, to leverage the combined technologies at the low cost we can achieve. In fact, we recently submitted a bid at a very competitive price for a combined wind, solar and battery storage product that is able to provide an around-the-clock, new firm, shaped product specifically designed to meet the customers' needs.","By leveraging Energy Resources' competitive advantages, including our development skills; purchasing power; best-in-class construction expertise; resource assessment capabilities; strong access to and cost of capital advantages; and the ability to combine wind, solar and battery storage solutions together, we remain well positioned to capture a meaningful and growing share of the renewables market going forward.","Finally, in addition to increasing and extending our financial expectations and having what I believe to be the best opportunity set in our industry, we continue to maintain one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector. Through the sale of noncore assets over the last two years, including FiberNet and our Forney, Lamar and Marcus Hook gas generation assets, we've recycled almost $4 billion of capital while advancing our strategy to become more long-term contracted and rate regulated.","Based on the strength of our balance sheet and enhanced business risk profile, S&P and Moody's recently announced favorable adjustments to our credit metric thresholds. While S&P has already reduced our FFO-to-debt rating trigger to 23% from 26%, yesterday, Moody's announced its plan to reduce NextEra Energy's CFO preworking capital-to-debt rating threshold from 20% to 18% if the regulated contribution to our business mix continues to improve to approximately 70% over time. Based on this level of regulated contribution, we would also expect a further reduction to our FFO-to-debt rating trigger from S&P.","At our current thresholds of 23% and 20% at S&P and Moody's, respectively, we currently expect to have $5 billion to $7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity that can be utilized through 2021 to either buy back shares or opportunistically execute on profitable incremental capital investments or profitable acquisition opportunities if it makes sense to do so. Our excess balance sheet capacity serves as a cushion as its utilization is not currently assumed in our financial expectations.","Today's announcements set the foundation for growth over the next four years. While there certainly will be challenges that we'll have to manage due to the overall strength and diversity of our opportunity set, I will be disappointed if we're not able to continue to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate range while, at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings. I remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects, and today's announcements for NextEra Energy are a reflection of that enthusiasm.","I'll now turn the call over to John to provide the detailed results.","John Ketchum","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter, capping off an outstanding year overall. We achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $6.70, up 8.2% from 2016, while continuing to make excellent progress on our major growth initiatives. FPL grew regulatory capital employed approximately 10.3% year-over-year as we continued investing in new and modernized generation as well as a stronger and smarter grid to further improve the already outstanding efficiency and reliability of our system. All of our major capital initiatives, including one of the largest solar expansions ever in the Eastern U.S., remain on track.","In 2017, FPL continued executing on its outstanding customer value proposition, delivering its best-ever service reliability performance while maintaining a typical customer bill that is more than 25% below the national average and the lowest among the top 10 investor-owned utilities by market cap. As Jim mentioned earlier, 2017 was the best period for new wind and solar origination in our history. The Energy Resources team added more than 2,700 megawatts of new renewables projects to our backlog, including the largest combined solar and storage facility in the United States announced to date and roughly 700 megawatts of additional wind repowering to our backlog. Over the course of the year, we commissioned roughly 2,150 megawatts of wind and solar projects in the U.S., including the first approximately 1,600 megawatts of our repowering program. All in all, 2017 was a terrific year of execution at FPL and Energy Resources.","Now let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2017, FPL reported GAAP net income of $344 million or $0.73 per share. FPL's adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter, which excludes a tax reform-related item that I will discuss in a moment, were $394 million or $0.84 per share, an increase of $23 million and $0.05 per share, respectively, year-over-year.","For the full year 2017, FPL reported GAAP earnings of $1.88 billion or $3.98 per share. Adjusted earnings were $1.93 billion or $4.09 per share. Before moving on, let me take a moment to discuss the specific tax reform impacts to FPL. For the fourth quarter, FPL is excluding from adjusted earnings the $50 million after-tax net impact that results primarily from the shortfall of available reserve amortization to offset the Irma cost recovery expense. This tax reform-related item reduced our reported ROE for regulatory purposes to approximately 11.1% for the 12 months ended December 2017.","For the full year 2018, we expect tax savings to begin restoring our reserve amortization balance. And coupled with our weather-normalized sales forecast and current CapEx and O&M expectations, we expect to target a regulatory ROE of 11.6%. Based upon our historic pattern of underlying revenues and expenses, we do not expect that the tax savings will fully offset our typical reserve amortization requirements for the first half of 2018, causing FPL to initially earn below our 11.6% target regulatory ROE. We expect FPL to earn a regulatory ROE towards the middle of a range of roughly 10.4% to 10.8% in the first quarter and roughly 10.7% to 11.1% in the second quarter before returning to more normal levels in the third and fourth quarter, all on a trailing 12-month basis and subject to our normal caveats. So while this will result in some lumpiness in our quarterly expectations, we do not expect it to impact our full year results.","During the fourth quarter, FPL was required to revalue its deferred income tax liabilities to the new 21% corporate income tax rate. The majority of the reduction in income tax liability, totaling approximately $4.5 billion, has been reclassified to a regulatory liability that we expect will be amortized over the underlying assets' remaining useful lives.","Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.3% for 2017 and was the principal driver of FPL's adjusted EPS growth of 10.2% for the full year. FPL built upon key successes from 2016, again being recognized as the most reliable electric utility in the Southeast. At the same time, FPL's typical customer bill has remained well below both state and national averages.","FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $5.3 billion. Each of our ongoing capital deployment initiatives continues to progress well. We were pleased to complete construction of the first 4 74.5-megawatt solar energy centers, governed by the Solar Base Rate Adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement, on schedule and under budget. An additional four solar sites, totaling nearly 300 megawatts, are currently on track to begin providing cost-effective energy to FPL customers later this quarter. We also continue to advance the development of the additional 1,600 megawatts of solar projects that are planned for beyond 2018 and have secured potential sites that could support more than five gigawatts of FPL's ongoing solar expansion.","This month, we completed the early retirement of the St. Johns River Power Park, an approximately 1,300-megawatt coal-fired plant co-owned with JEA. Construction on the approximately 1,750-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget. Additionally, progress on the Dania Beach Clean Energy Center continues to advance through the regulatory approval process.","Continued smart investments such as these will allow FPL to deliver on its outstanding customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and superior customer service, and are expected to support a compound annual growth rate in regulatory capital employed of approximately 8% from the start of the settlement agreement in January 2017 through at least December 2021.","The economy in Florida remains healthy. The current unemployment rate of 3.7% remains below the national average and near the lowest levels in a decade. Florida's consumer confidence level remains near 10-year highs. The real estate sector also continues to show strength, with new building permits remaining at healthy levels and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida home prices up 4.4% from the prior year.","FPL's fourth quarter retail sales increased 0.5% from the prior year comparable period. We estimate that weather-related usage per customer contributed approximately 1.2% to this amount. On a weather-normalized basis, fourth quarter sales declined 0.7% as ongoing customer growth was more than offset by a decline in weather-normalized usage per customer.","For 2017, we estimate that FPL's retail sales benefited from a positive year-over-year impact of 1.7% from weather, which is partially offset by a decline of 0.9% as a result of the net effects of Hurricanes Matthew and Irma. After accounting for these factors and the 2016 leap year impact, FPL's 2017 retail sales on a weather-normalized basis declined by 1.6%, which was primarily driven by a reduction in underlying usage per customer, partially offset by customer growth. While the recent trend in underlying usage is below our long-term expectations, we have not yet drawn any firm conclusions. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and will update you on future calls.","Modest changes in usage per customer are not likely to have a material effect on earnings while we operate under the current settlement agreement as we will adjust the level of reserve amortization utilization to offset any effect, which is expected to allow FPL to maintain its target regulatory ROE.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported full year 2017 GAAP earnings of $2.963 billion or $6.27 per share. Adjusted earnings were $1.23 billion or $2.61 per share, reflecting roughly 12% year-over-year growth. For the fourth quarter, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.894 billion or $4 per share and adjusted earnings of $230 million or $0.49 per share. This quarter's adjusted results excluded two items, a gain related to revaluing deferred income tax liabilities that I will discuss in a moment, and a charge associated with our Duane Arnold Energy Center.","For Duane Arnold, in the latter part of 2017, we concluded that it is unlikely that the facility's primary customer will extend the current contract after it expires in 2025. Without a contract extension, we will likely close the facility at the end of 2025 despite being licensed to operate until 2034. As a result, during the fourth quarter, Duane Arnold's book value and asset retirement obligation were reviewed, and an after-tax impairment of $258 million was recorded that reflects our belief it is unlikely the project will operate after 2025. That being said, we will continue to pursue a contract extension that would enable Duane Arnold to continue operations. Duane Arnold's contribution to Energy Resources net income has been and is expected to be negligible over the next several years.","As a result of tax reform, Energy Resources was required to revalue its deferred income tax liability to the new 21% corporate income tax rate. This $1.925 billion reduction in income tax liability provided an income tax benefit during the fourth quarter, which has been excluded from adjusted earnings. Based upon our strong banking relationships and our position as the number one renewables developer, we remain confident that our access to tax equity will remain robust. As an example, following the signing of the tax reform legislation, we were able to close our four remaining 2017 tax equity financings, totaling more than $1 billion in proceeds at economics substantially similar to what was expected before tax reform.","Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter increased by $0.08 versus the prior year comparable period. This primarily reflects contributions from new investments and increased contributions from our existing generation assets as a result of repowering, partially offset by lower contributions from our gas infrastructure business due to the absence of the Texas pipelines' earnout adjustment that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.28 or approximately 12% year-over-year. Growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables portfolio, including the roughly 2,500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects that we commissioned in 2016, which are included in new investments during the first 12 months of their operation. In total, new renewables investments added $0.67 per share. Contributions from new natural gas pipeline investments added $0.10 per share. Partially offsetting new investment growth was a decline of $0.11 per share in contributions from our existing generation assets, the majority of which is attributable to the sale of the Lamar, Forney and Marcus Hook natural gas-fired generating assets in 2016.","Contributions from our gas infrastructure business declined by $0.19 per share, $0.16 of which is attributable to the absence of the earnout adjustment that was recognized for the Texas pipelines in 2016. All of the other effects had a negative impact of $0.19 per share, mostly driven by a year-over-year increase in interest expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.","In 2017, Energy Resources advanced its position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects. Since the last call, we have signed contracts for 736 megawatts of new renewables projects, including 512 megawatts of wind and 224 megawatts of solar. With today's announced contracts, our 2017 and 2018 wind backlog is now nearly 2,000 megawatts. With visibility to several hundred megawatts of additional projects for 2018, we continue to believe that we can achieve the range of expectations that we have previously provided for 2017 and 2018. For 2019 and 2020, we are already just below the range of expectations that we have provided for solar. And for U.S. wind, our current backlog is already almost half of the low end of our expected range.","Additionally, our total current backlog of almost 7,000 megawatts, including repowering for 2017 through 2020, is the largest for a four-year period in Energy Resources' history. The accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands.","Beyond renewables, 2017 was an excellent year for Energy Resources' natural gas pipeline activities. During the year, both the Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection natural gas pipeline projects successfully achieved commercial operation on budget and on schedule. The Mountain Valley Pipeline also made excellent progress over the year, receiving its first limited notice to proceed from FERC earlier this week, and we remain on track to achieve a year-end 2018 commercial operations date.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2017, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.155 billion or $4.55 per share. NextEra Energy's 2017 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $590 million or $1.25 per share, respectively. For the full year 2017, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $5.378 billion or $11.38 per share. Adjusted earnings were $3 - $3.165 billion or $6.70 per share. NextEra Energy's operating cash flow, adjusted for the impacts of certain FPL clause recoveries, storm costs and recoveries in the Indiantown acquisition, increased by almost 15% year-over-year.","During the fourth quarter, we were able to capitalize on the ongoing favorable market conditions and completed all of the refinancing initiatives we were considering as of the third quarter call. These combined financings, which have roughly $165 million of after-tax NPV savings on a cash basis, resulted in net income reduction of approximately $33 million when they closed in the fourth quarter.","For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.15 per share compared to 2016, primary reflecting the impact of these refinancing costs.","Turning now to our financial expectations for NextEra Energy. As Jim discussed, we are increasing the range of our adjusted EPS expectations and increase - and extending our long-term growth outlook. We now expect NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in the range of 6% to 8% through 2021, off a revised base of the midpoint of our new 2018 range, or $7.70 per share. Additional details of our revised expectations are shown in the accompanying slide.","For 2018, while we target the new $7.70 midpoint of our range, we expect that the majority of the growth will come in the second half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, in the first half of the year, FPL is expected to earn below its regulatory ROE of 11.6% as we do not expect that the tax savings will immediately offset our typical reserve amortization requirements. This will present a headwind to adjusted EPS growth during the first quarter, with stronger growth expected for the balance of the year as the regulatory ROE on a trailing 12-month basis increases towards our target 11.6% level by the second half of the year.","During the period of our financial expectations, we expect the interest on all NextEra Energy's debt to continue to be fully tax-deductible at the 21% federal corporate income tax rate despite the limit on interest deductibility in the tax reform legislation. As a reminder, due to the NEP governance changes that we implemented in 2017, NextEra Energy is required to deconsolidate NEP from its financial statements beginning January 1, 2018. These changes will be reflected in our first quarter financial results.","We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. We expect the board of NextEra Energy to determine the dividend policy for beyond 2018 at our next regularly scheduled board meeting in February, and we will make an announcement about the outcome of that - of their decision at that time. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.","Let me now turn to NEP. Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.405 per common unit or $1.62 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2017.","Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and CAFD increased approximately 18% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. For the full year 2017, adjusted EBITDA increased 16% while CAFD was up 11% from 2016.","In regards to the impacts of tax reform for NextEra Energy Partners, NEP recorded a $101 million charge related to revaluating its deferred income taxes to the new 21% corporate income tax rate in the fourth quarter. The duration of NEP's income tax shield, which we have previously said is greater than 15 years, will remain better than 15 years following tax reform. Additionally, the expectation that NEP runs a negative earnings and profit or E&P balance for at least the next eight years also remains unchanged. With no adverse impacts to NEP's tax shields or the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment, NEP remains well positioned to continue delivering on its unitholder value proposition.","NEP's fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $199 million increased $31 million from a year earlier. Fourth quarter CAFD was approximately $76 million, an increase of $8 million year-over-year, which was driven primarily by NEP's strong portfolio growth, with a relatively modest offset from higher fees. Wind resource returned to normal after a weak third quarter as overall wind resource was 102% of the long-term average during the fourth quarter. The appendix of today's presentation includes a slide with additional details regarding 2017 wind resource for the NEP portfolio.","For full year 2017, adjusted EBITDA and CAFD were $743 million and $246 million, up 16% and 11%, respectively, driven primarily by growth of the underlying portfolio. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.","The NEP portfolio as of year-end 2017 supports adjusted EBITDA and CAFD run rates in line with the expectations we have shared previously for December 31, 2017. Since the federal income tax rate declined from 35% to 21%, the resulting pretax value of NEP's tax credits, which are calculated by dividing one minus the tax rate, changes as well. While tax reform impacts the calculation of NEP's adjusted EBITDA, it has no effect on cash available for distribution. Our previous December 31, 2017, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million are now $830 million to $930 million as a result of this change. The December 31, 2017, run rate range for CAFD of $310 million to $340 million remains unchanged. Our previously announced December 31, 2018, run rate expectations, reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2018 for adjusted EBITDA of $1.05 billion to $1.2 billion are now $1 billion to $1.15 billion as a result of tax reform. The December 31, 2018, run rate range for CAFD of $360 million to $400 million is unchanged. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an ongoing operating expense.","From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2017 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.62, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2022. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2018 distribution that is payable in February 2019 to be in a range of $1.81 to $1.86 per common unit.","Tax reform has highlighted several optimization opportunities within NEP's international portfolio, which we continue to evaluate. One such opportunity that we are exploring is the potential sale of the Canadian portfolio, which could enable the partnership to recycle capital back into U.S. assets, which benefit from a longer federal income tax shield, allowing NEP to retain more CAFD in the future for every dollar invested. We would only execute on such a transaction if it were accretive to NEP's long-term growth runway to do so, potentially positioning the partnership to extend its financial expectations and need for common equity. If we decide to move forward, we will update you on the progress of our efforts over the coming months.","With the IDR restructuring, governance enhancements, financing flexibility, competitive cost of capital and visible prospects for future growth in place, we are pleased with NEP's execution during 2017. Heading into 2018 and beyond, NEP is as well positioned as it's ever been to deliver its long-term financial expectations and best-in-class investor value proposition.","That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to maybe hit first on the last thing, John, that you talked about on NextEra Energy Partners in terms of the - a potential for sale of the Canadian portfolio. I'm sorry, I didn't quite follow sort of the potential benefit of that and how to think about that, what would the rationale be in terms of tax reform?","John Ketchum","Yes. We are looking at - as a result of tax reform, Stephen, we are looking at some optimization opportunities around our international portfolio. There is a difference between the federal income tax shield in the U.S. and in Canada after the results of tax reform have come through. So this has pinpointed a potential capital recycling opportunity, where we may be able to sell the assets in the Canadian portfolio and then use those proceeds to reinvest either in third-party M&A opportunities or acquisitions from Energy Resources or to support our organic growth program. And by reinvesting those proceeds in the U.S., what that does is it has the effect of actually creating more CAFD for every dollar invested. And because of that, it puts us in a position where we could extend our runway, our financial expectations and extend the need for common equity. So it's kind of a very interesting opportunity that we continue to evaluate here internally.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, understood. That makes a lot of sense. At the beginning, you all mentioned some of the changes at the rating agencies in terms of targeted ratios. I just want to make sure I understood that properly. Given the most recent change from Moody's that you mentioned, moving from 20% to 18%, so long as the - if there was a mix of the regulated assets in the 70% range, if - am I to understand that if you have that kind of business mix, that, that would result in additional leverage capacity over the $5 billion to $7 billion? Did I get that right?","John Ketchum","Yes. So let's walk through it. So right now, here's the state of play. We are at 23% FFO to debt with S&P. We're currently at 20% CFO to debt with Moody's. Moody's has said that we have an opportunity to move down from 18% to 20% if we - or I'm sorry, from 20% to 18% if we're able to further improve our regulated business mix up to 70%. S&P, though, is still the gating metric. So S&P, we feel like if we could improve our regulated mix to right around the same range that Moody's is targeting, that would also result in a reduction to the S&P credit threshold. So yes, that would create additional balance sheet capacity. But right now, the $5 billion to $7 billion of balance sheet capacity we described, that's tethered to where we stand today, which is 23% at S&P and 20% at Moody's, with the opportunity to further improve upon that $5 billion to $7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity if we're able to make a slight improvement in our regulated business mix for both agencies.","Stephen Byrd","That's very clear. And then maybe just lastly on the utility business. In terms of tax reform, I just wanted to check whether that has any impacts on your net rate base growth. I was wondering whether it might increase your rate base growth or if you think your overall sort of rate base position over time is similar to sort of where it's been in the past pretax reform.","John Ketchum","Yes, no. It does impact our rate base. Again, one of the main impacts of tax reform is for rate-regulated utilities, customers and shareholders benefit because we were able to preserve in the final outcome of tax reform the ability to fully deduct interest at the utility level, but that was made as a compromise in exchange for no longer being able to take immediate expensing at the utility. So if you can't take immediate expensing at the utility, it has the impact of lowering our deferred tax liability, which is actually zero cost equity in our capital structure. So if that goes down, it's just more equity that we're able to put into the business, which has the effect of increasing the rate base growth over time.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","So just a couple of questions. On the excess capital, the $5 billion to $7 billion, so just to clarify, in your plan on growth rate, you're just effectively keeping that as cash on the balance sheet for now, it's not being put into buybacks or any investment, it's just extra available cash?","John Ketchum","Yes. Exactly, Steve. We think of it as excess debt capacity that we have on the balance sheet. It is not utilizing that excess balance sheet capacity. It's not in our current financial expectations. It's really a cushion and upside. So if later on, we wanted to explore 1 of 3 options, which one of which could be a buyback; another could be something in the regulated M&A space; or third, incremental capital investment opportunities around the two main businesses, those are opportunities to utilize that excess balance sheet capacity.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. Second question, just a quick detail. So in your 2018 guidance, it's up about $0.65 from prior midpoint. So $0.45 of that is tax. Is there any particular item that represents the other $0.20?","John Ketchum","Yes. It's pretty simple. What we did is we took the $6.70, and we just said, \"Look, we're going to assume we're going to grow $6.70 at 8% and then add on $0.45.\" So really, that extra $0.20 is roughly that additional 8% off the $6.70.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And that's just all the business? Okay.","John Ketchum","Yes. And targeting the midpoint, Steve, of the $7.70 in '18.","Steven Fleishman","Great. And then can you give us a sense against these S&P, Moody's metrics, kind of where are you with tax reform? Because we have your metrics as of now, but it doesn't include with the tax reform changes in terms of FFO to debt.","John Ketchum","Yes, no. Yes, we do not expect tax reform to have an impact on where the metrics currently stand. So what I just told you takes into account tax reform.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then just lastly, on NEP. So in terms of the communication here, the Canadian transaction might be an upside to runway and growth runway, and then you're still just assuming the NEE portfolio as a drop-down as of year-end '16. So anything you've done '17 and plan to do through 2020 would be additional potential growth for NEP?","John Ketchum","Exactly. I mean, Steve, NEP has terrific visibility into future growth because of that, because if you locked our portfolio down as of the end of '16, consistent with what we said at the investor conference, that locked-down portfolio as of the end of '16 was enough to support NEP's growth, 12% to 15% through 2022. And so what we've been able to add since then is incremental to that. And on the Canadian portfolio, we would only do that - to be very clear, we will only do that transaction if it is incrementally accretive to our long-term growth runway and puts us in a position to extend our financial expectations and potentially our need for common equity.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Two questions. One, with the onetime - and Jim, just curious, how you're thinking about this and how you and the management team will present to the board because it's obviously a board decision. With the onetime step-up in earnings guidance for 2018, how are you thinking about the dividend and whether there's a similar kind of onetime step-up in the dividend and then continued growth from there?","James Robo","So Michael, as you said, it's a board decision. We have been talking about some various options over the last couple of months. When we - in 2015, when we set the 12% to 14% growth rate through at least 2018, the \"at least\" was not a - that was not a mistake in two words that we put in front of that. And so we're going to be reviewing a variety of different options. Obviously, earnings are stepping up with the midpoint at $7.70, something like 15%. So we will have some room from a payout ratio standpoint. And we have a lower payout ratio than the rest of the industry does, and so we have some room there as well. So I'm a big believer in returning cash to shareholders. And so we'll be making a recommendation here in a few weeks, and we'll have an announcement sometime in February once we make the decision in our board meeting.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And one quick follow-up, more strategic. Post-tax reform, how does NextEra and how do you look at the M&A market in utilities? Meaning, does tax reform make M&A more difficult for utilities? Does it make it less difficult for utilities? We've had a number of years where there's been just kind of an accelerated level of transactions. Just want to kind of get your high-level views.","John Ketchum","Yes.","James Robo","Yes. I think two things, Michael. One is that it obviously takes a pretty important uncertainty off the table, right? So you know at least what the rules of the world - road are for how you finance any potential acquisition going forward and what the benefits are. And then I would just say, secondly, I think you've seen the rating agencies put a variety of our peers on negative watch over the last couple of weeks because tax reform, all else being equal, if you're 100% regulated, puts stress on your FFO-to-debt ratios. We've been very methodically moving our business mix to create balance sheet capacity and to improve our business mix over time. And I think we're in kind of a unique position relative to the rest of our peers vis-\u00e0-vis our capacity and so that's obviously a positive for us.","That said, we're going to continue to be super disciplined about what we look at, and it will have to be accretive and will have to make strategic sense for us. And that's - as you've seen over the years, we've been very disciplined, and we haven't chased things for the sake of just getting them to close. And so we'll - that will continue to be how we approach M&A.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI.","Gregory Gordon","So just a follow-up question and then a new question. On the - your earnings were up 9%, the $0.65 that Steve Fleishman articulated, with $0.45 from tax. If I'm just thinking about the components of the other $0.20, is part of that the increased earnings power from not having bonus depreciation in '18 and beyond and the resultant increase in earnings power at the utility? And then if I do that math, clearly, the delta would come from better outcomes at Energy Resources ex tax reform. And if so, what are you seeing that's ahead of the prior plan in Energy Resources that caused you to, whatever that component is, increase it by that amount?","John Ketchum","Yes. Really, what we were doing, again, is just rebasing ops. So if you took $6.70 and you said what's the right midpoint for 2018, we've been telling investors we'd be disappointed not to be able to grow '18 at 8% off of '17, right? And that's really your missing 20% or your missing $0.20 to get you to the $7.70 midpoint. Then you add on $0.45 for tax reform, and tax reform primarily reflects the reduced corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in Energy Resources. A couple other things in there, a little bit of a deferred tax benefit at FPL as well, but that's all in the $0.45. That's really how you get to $7.70 as the midpoint. The midpoint for '18 is what we're targeting, and it's what we are then going to base our future growth expectations off of at 6% to 8%, off that 2018 $7.70 baseline going forward.","Gregory Gordon","Great. Second question is with regard to the explanation of what you're doing with regard to helping FPL customers on Slide 7. Would you mind just walking through the steps of what happened this year, how you utilized the reserve amortization to offset the Hurricane Irma costs and then how the reserve amortization will be replenished and then how that positions you to then avoid having to ask customers for more money for another two years? Can you just - apologize for asking, but if you could just take us discretely through those steps to understand this impact.","John Ketchum","Yes, absolutely. Really simply, we had a $1.3 billion regulatory asset on our books, and that asset was there because we anticipated having to charge customers $4 in '18, maybe $5.50 or so in '19 and '20. And so that established a regulatory asset on our books for about $1.3 billion. We then said, \"Well, tax reform has occurred. Here's an opportunity to immediately return tax savings to customers by utilizing surplus in the right way.\" I mean, the average savings to the customer is going to be about $250, that you can see an immediate rate reduction of $3.38 where Matthew rolls off on March 1 and potentially the ability to avoid a base rate increase up through 2022 - I'll get to that in a minute. So how did we do it? We wrote down the $1.3 billion. We had sufficient surplus to offset the majority of that $1.3 billion, and it's a permitted use of surplus under our settlement agreement to do that. That left roughly $50 million after tax that could not be recovered from surplus.","We are taking that against - excluding that from adjusted earnings as a tax reform-related item. And then as you go forward, on the second part of your question, since we start with a zero reserve amortization balance, we're able to replenish that over time through the tax savings that we get through the - from the reduction in the federal income tax rate of 35% to 21%. And instead of immediately returning or flowing that savings to customers over a much longer time, as you amortize that benefit out, this is a way to get the savings into customers' pockets immediately. So that's how that works. We would expect to end 2020 with a reserve amortization balance that would be sufficient to potentially allow us to stay out of a rate case for up to two years.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So I wanted to ask real quickly, can you comment real quickly on the payout ratios here? And just related thinking on that, I heard your earlier commentary about evaluating kind of the pace of EPS growth, but can you give us a little bit of a sense or a way to think about eventual payout ratios under the new forecast? Has it moved at all? I suppose that could give us a little bit of a sense on how you're thinking about this, if it's changed.","James Robo","So Julien, I think what I said is probably all I'm prepared to say. As we said, it's a board decision. Our current payout ratio is - the industry average payout ratio is around 65%. Our current payout ratio is below that and is - now, with the new rebasing that we've done in 2018, will be quite below that. And when we - and as I said earlier, I'm a big believer in returning cash to shareholders. We are discussing options with the board right now, and we'll have an announcement on it in a few weeks.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. All right, excellent. And then also a cash flow question real quickly if you can. As you think about sort of the financing benefits from 100% expensing with tax reform as well as, I imagine, some benefits in terms of equipment costs, how does that change your financing plan on the near side? If you could just talk about that a little bit and maybe discretely break it out. And then at the same time, on the equipment side, how has that changed your outlook for '21 and even '22 at this point in terms of the near business trajectory?","John Ketchum","Yes. I mean, two things I'll say about that. First of all, we're not limited in terms of our interest deductibility, so it really doesn't change a whole lot the way we would approach financing those businesses. We will continue to expect tax equity dollars to be available. Again, we have always had a first call on the tax equity market. So we intend to finance the Energy Resources renewables build in much of the same way as we have in the past. In terms of tax savings and its impact on the renewables business, a lot of those tax savings from manufacturers in particular, I mean, we would expect to hopefully see some benefit and reduced prices on the equipment side as a result of the lower taxes that they will be paying. Armando, I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that.","Armando Pimentel","No. I mean, I think you said this in a couple of times today. Things are going well at Energy Resources, and there's nothing really that happened in tax reform that upsets our plans going forward. I mean, we feel really good about Energy Resources in that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","But perhaps to clarify, in terms of wind equipment pricing itself, how much is that - how much are you realizing the benefits that I suppose others are talking about? And how has that changed your own views on '21 to '22? Clearly, you extended the outlook by one.","John Ketchum","Yes. I mean, I think what we have said is and what is in Jim's remarks, we saw a 30% reduction last year, as much as 10% going forward. Tax reform could have some incremental benefits probably on top of that. As you get out there, we will certainly, as always, try to squeeze our supply chain to pass those benefits onto us. I mean, this is a competitive space. In order to be competitive, if you're on the equipment side, and deliver the lowest price possible while retaining your profit margin, you're probably going to be expected to relay most of those tax benefits onto your customer if you want to be competitive.","James Robo","And Julien, just one other thing. When we talked about 30% and 10%, that's cost per kilowatt hour or cost per megawatt hour. And we would expect that - we'd expect the - that's the way we think about it, and that's how we - it's not just turbine price, it's wind capture, it's balanced plant reduction and costs, it's all of those things.","Operator","And this concludes today's presentation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Julie Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Julie Holmes","Thank you, Roxane [ph]. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining us this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power & Light Company.","Moray will provide an overview of our results. Following which, our executive team will be available to answer your questions. We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com.

You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid third quarter results despite challenging market conditions in Energy Resources' major markets, and we remain well-positioned to achieve our overall objectives both for this year and for the longer term. We have previously indicated that our focus this year is on executing against plans that are expected to drive growth for the company across both its principal businesses through the middle of the decade, and I'm pleased to be able to report that all our major initiatives continue on track.","At Florida Power & Light, we continue to deliver superior value to our customers, which is the foundation of our strategy and is demonstrated by providing the lowest typical residential bills in the state combined with superior reliability, award-winning customer service and a clean emission profile.","We continue to invest capital at a record rate in major projects that will improve this value proposition over time, including our nuclear uprates and fossil modernization initiatives, all of which made good progress this quarter. The rapid growth in our regulatory capital employed, combined with a consistent earned ROE enabled by the current rate settlement agreement, naturally resulted in strong earnings growth at FPL.","We completed the technical hearing for FPL's base rate case and entered into a proposed settlement agreement with 3 major interveners. Although this proposed agreement is opposed by the Office of Public Counsel, the Florida Public Service Commission has scheduled evidentiary hearings in November and will fully consider it at that time with a decision likely by the end of the year.","At Energy Resources, our financial performance was hampered by the continuing impact of the down power at Seabrook and by disappointingly mild market conditions in Texas, but in other respects, remained solid. I will provide more detail later in the call.","We continue to make good progress on our record backlog of renewables projects, all of which remain on track. We expect to bring into service more than 1,200 megawatts of new U.S. wind capacity in the fourth quarter. Included in this amount is the expected acquisition of 165-megawatt project that is additive to the numbers we have discussed in prior earnings releases.","In addition, we disclosed during the quarter that we signed our first PPA for a 2013 U.S. wind project, a project that is not dependent upon extension of the PTC program, which, as you know, is scheduled -- currently scheduled to lapse at the end of this year. While this additional PPA by itself is not large enough to change the range of our financial expectations, we see it as supportive of the view we have publicly expressed that there will continue to be a Wind Development business in the U.S. post-2012 even if the PTC program is not extended.","Because of the continued progress we have made against our execution objectives, there have been no significant changes to our expectations either for this year or for the longer term. We continue to believe that the major investments we are making at both of our primary businesses will drive our growth in 2013 and beyond and allow us to attain our longer-range expectations.","Our expectations include a satisfactory degree of rate relief at FPL, either through approval of the proposed settlement agreement or through a fair and balanced order on the underlying base rate case. As a reminder, we expect adjusted earnings per share for 2012 to be in the range of $4.35 to of $4.65. And for 2014, we continue to see a range of $5.05 to $5.65, subject to all the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.","Let's now walk through our results for the quarter. We will begin with the results at FPL and then discuss Energy Resources and the  consolidated numbers.","For the third quarter of 2012, FPL reported net income of $392 million or $0.93 per share, up $0.10 per share year-over-year. As in the first half of the year, FPL's results this quarter were driven by continued investment in the business to improve overall customer value.","During the quarter, we invested roughly $900 million of the approximately $4.3 billion we expect to invest in FPL in 2012. And regulatory capital employed, that is capital on which we are able to earn a return, grew 18% over the same quarter last year. This capital investment program is central to our strategy of delivering the best customer value proposition in the state. Although the increase in capital requires a degree of base rate relief, the life cycle benefits for customers are very significant. Even with slight upward pressure on rates in the short term, we expect our typical residential bills to continue to be the lowest in the state. And the value delivery to customers improves with each passing year owing to the use of straight line depreciation for rate-making purposes.","During the quarter, we amortized approximately $33 million of surplus depreciation, enabling us to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11%, consistent with the 2010 rate settlement agreement. For the full year, we continue to expect to recognize roughly $500 million of surplus depreciation, amortization. Utilization of approximately $190 million of the remaining surplus in 2013 is built into our rate case filing. As we said on a number of occasions, FPL is in the midst of the largest capital deployment phase in its history. During the quarter, we continued construction of both our Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach modernization projects. Cape Canaveral is now 86% complete and is currently on schedule and on budget, with an expected in-service date in mid-2013.","The Riviera Beach modernization is also moving ahead with 22% of construction complete and it, too, is running on time and on budget. Our third modernization project, Port Everglades, is well into its development cycle, and we continue to expect to bring that plant into service in mid-2016.","Execution on our nuclear uprate program at FPL is also well along, with final completion anticipated for the spring of next year. 2 of the 4 Florida units have completed their uprate work and are now operational. During the quarter, St. Lucie Unit 2 received its required license amendment from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate at higher power levels and is expected to return to service by the end of the year. And the fourth unit, Turkey Point Unit 4, will begin its uprate in the fourth quarter with completion expected in the spring of 2013.","While the final capital investment will be greater than originally estimated, the incremental output will also be greater. The uprates are now expected to provide at least an additional 526 megawatts of clean, emissions-free energy for our customers, roughly the equivalent of a medium-sized nuclear plant.","Combined with the improvement in the material condition of the plants, this extra capacity will serve our customers well for many years to come. The gas plant modernizations and nuclear uprates are expected to provide significant benefits to our customers over the lives of the plants and also to provide the platform for earnings growth in the business. When discussing these projects in an earnings release or in the hearing room, it is easy to take for granted the enormous effort required to execute them successfully. So I'd like to take a moment to recognize the hard work, dedication and coordination of thousands of employees and contractors and to thank them for their commitment to excellence in meeting the many project milestones thus far. We look forward to the final completion of all these projects and to delivering improved value to our customers through lower fuel costs, enhanced reliability and cleaner air.","Before moving on to discuss the Florida economy, I'd like to note 2 other developments both indicative of our commitment to customer service. First, while Florida has been very fortunate so far this hurricane season, we must always be prepared. In August, our service territory was affected by tropical storm, Isaac, which resulted in heavy rains, severe flooding and localized wind damage. Altogether, more than 400,000 customers experienced outages. But thanks to good preparation and the hard work of employees, contractors and our mutual aid partners, FPL was able to restore power to nearly 60% of affected customers within 4 hours and more than 95% within 24 hours. Second, and just this month, J.D. Power and Associates released results of the first wave of their Residential Customer Satisfaction survey for 2013. FPL retained its top ranking in Florida, its second-place rank among large segment utilities in the South region and improved its national ranking to 17 from 25 among all 126 U.S. utilities. This is a testament to the hard work and customer focus of FPL's 10,000 employees.","In Florida, most economic indicators we follow continue to improve modestly. Tourism taxable sales have grown steadily over the past 2 years and are now well above sales levels seen prior to the recession. Consumer confidence is trending in a positive direction, and the September figure is the highest reported since 2007. Although Florida has experienced positive year-over-year job growth for more than 2 years, there were signs earlier this year that job growth was slowing. Recent data have been a bit more encouraging, with job growth stabilizing in recent months. Employment gains have been particularly strong in business and professional services, health care, retail trade and leisure and hospitality. Job losses in the construction and government sectors continued to limit the overall pace of job creation in Florida.","The unemployment rate mirrors national trends, with rates remaining stubbornly high by historical standards. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Florida was down slightly in September to 8.7%, which is 1.7% lower than September 2011. There was also a significant increase in the state's labor force during this period. Florida's relative position has also improved. It now ranks 37th in the U.S. in terms of the unemployment rate, with states such as Georgia, South Carolina and Connecticut having higher unemployment rates. All in all, while we are not where we would like to be, the Florida outlook is clearly improving.","Turning now to the Florida housing market. Here, too, we continue to see signs of improvement. As shown on the accompanying slide, although there was a slight uptick in the delinquency rate in the second quarter, the inventory of existing homes continues to decline which in turn is helping to spur new construction growth and drive increases in home prices.","In August, the number of housing permits in Florida reached its highest level in more than 4 years, although it is still well below the prerecession peak. According to the Case-Shiller Index, Florida home prices continue to increase year-over-year, with the most recent data showing the largest annual increase since 2006. On the whole, housing indicators are trending in a positive direction and we are encouraged by the data.","Most of our customer metrics at FPL also continued to improve gradually. During the third quarter, we had approximately 30,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2011, representing an increase of 0.7%. We have now seen fairly consistent growth for the last 10 quarters, and we remain encouraged by this trend. Underlying usage also increased for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 1.6% over the same quarter last year.","On the other hand, the improvement in inactive and low-usage accounts seems to have stalled. In September, the number of inactive meters decreased, but the percentage of low-usage customers remained roughly flat compared to the same period last year.","As you will recall, we filed a request for a base rate increase in the first quarter this year. In mid-August, just prior to commencing the technical hearing in the case, we reached agreement on all key issues with 3 of the major interveners representing customer groups, including Florida Industrial Power Users Group, South Florida Hospital & Healthcare Association and Federal Executive Agencies. A fourth intervener, Algenol Biofuels, has indicated support for the proposed settlement agreement as well.","However, the Office of Public Counsel, which by statute is supposed to represent all Florida customers, has opposed the settlement. Major terms of the settlement include a 4-year term; a $378 million retail base revenue increase effective January 2013; an allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.7% with 100 basis point band; Generation Base Rate Adjustments, or GBRA, upon commercial operations of our Cape Canaveral, Riviera Beach and Port Everglades modernizations, based on the capital costs for Cape Canaveral as filed in the rate case and the capital cost for Riviera Beach and Port Everglades that were approved during their respective need hearings; and finally, flexibility over the 4-year term to amortize up to $400 million of the remaining surplus depreciation credit plus a portion of the fossil dismantlement reserve.","We believe the settlement as a whole is fair to both shareholders and customers. While we continue to believe our initial base rate request is warranted, parties must compromise in order to reach a settlement. In this case, we have given up a portion of allowed return on equity in exchange for longer-term certainty around the investments in our modernization projects and infrastructure that in turn are expected to enable FPL to continue providing low bills and superior performance.","The settlement offers investors the prospect of a reasonable return and a reasonable degree of risk while, at the same time, providing customers greater certainty around long-term bill affordability. Since base rates comprise roughly half of the typical residential bill, the settlement offers customers confidence that their bills will remain among the lowest in the state for at least the term of the agreement.","In August, the Florida Public Service Commission held a technical hearing on the initial base rate request. We are very comfortable with the totality of the evidence submitted to the commission during these 2 weeks and continue to believe that we have the prospect of a fair and balanced outcome should the commission choose to approve the proposed settlement agreement or instead rule on the merits of the underlying base rate request.","However, the commission has laid out a schedule to hear additional evidence specifically related to the proposed settlement agreement, and we are now preparing for a hearing on that evidence, which is scheduled to take place November 19 through November 21. A special agenda conference has been scheduled for December 13 to consider the settlement agreement.","As we have noted previously, we continue to expect to have the lowest typical residential bill in the state whether the commission rules in favor of the settlement agreement or issues a determination on the fully litigated case. Under the proposed settlement, the increase in FPL's typical residential customer bills in 2013 would be roughly $1.50 a month or $0.05 a day. We strongly believe this settlement, which would help secure low rates for our customers through the end of 2016 while supporting our continued ability to provide safe, highly reliable low-cost service, is very much in the public interest.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2012 GAAP earnings of $44 million or $0.10 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $162 million or $0.38 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the effect of the mark on non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI, and for 2011, the after-tax loss on natural gas-fired generating assets held for sale.","Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings in the third quarter was below last year's by $0.11, but only a few cents below where we had hoped to be primarily due to lower-than-normal wind resource. On this chart, we have shared the drivers of the changes from last year's third quarter in the standard format we commonly use. However, because several of the elements on this chart are interrelated and there are more than the usual number of puts and takes, let me try and put the overall results in perspective.","Last year's third quarter benefited from 2 factors that are not present this quarter. First, we had operating contributions from the gas-fired assets that were sold late last year, and obviously, these are not present this year. Net of the associated savings and interest, this amounts to about $0.05. Overall, the sale is EPS accretive, but given the pattern of earnings, there is a negative comparison in the third quarter.","Second, last year's third quarter included gains on the close-out of some hedges in the gas infrastructure area, which amounted to about $0.08. Since they are an ongoing part of the business, these hedge close-outs should not be thought of as onetime gains or they will tend to be lumpy. If we factor out these 2 effects, this year's third quarter would have been up by about $0.02. This difference in turn is a function of some ups and downs.","You may recall that last year's third quarter was challenged by extreme conditions in Texas. This year, we were much better protected against extreme conditions, but the summer turned out to be very mild and flat from a pricing standpoint. Last year, our customer supply and trading activities struggled in a difficult environment. This year, they bounced back, albeit to levels still below those of 2009 and 2010. The net of all these was roughly a positive $0.09. We also benefited from growth in the business with new assets contributing about $0.05 net of their associated interest.","On the other hand, we gave up about $0.04 because of the down power at Seabrook and the refueling outage that began in September, and the existing wind portfolio was down $0.02 due to PTC roll-offs. As I mentioned earlier, the wind resource was below normal but it was comparable to last year's third quarter. All other effects, which include slight declines in other operating assets, slight increases in O&M and G&A and share dilution amount to a negative $0.06. Many of these effects we could reasonably anticipate or are typical of the variability in the business. Relative to our expectations at this time last year, the major differences were primarily below-average wind resource, as well as the Seabrook down power and disappointingly mild conditions in Texas. Nevertheless, we are satisfied with the financial performance and continue to feel comfortable with the outlook for the full year.","At Energy Resources, we continue to focus on executing on our largest ever backlog of renewables projects. In the third quarter, we brought an additional 80 megawatts of U.S. wind online, and year-to-date, we have added approximately 250 megawatts of wind to our portfolio. We expect to bring more than 1,200 megawatts of U.S. wind projects into service in the fourth quarter this year and are therefore on track to add approximately 1,500 megawatts of U.S. wind in 2012, including the 165-megawatt project mentioned earlier in this call. This will be the biggest wind program ever completed in this country in a single year, and we'll push our total wind portfolio over the 10,000-megawatt mark.","Looking at growth beyond 2012, the roughly 600 megawatts of Canadian wind projects in our backlog are on schedule to meet their expected timeline for completion through 2015, with the majority expected to come online in 2013 and 2014. Also, as we mentioned earlier in the call, we added a new U.S. wind project to our backlog in 2013 that is not dependent on any extension of production tax credits. We are moving ahead with our plans to add roughly 900 megawatts of solar generation through 2016. In July, our McCoy solar project received approval from the California Public Utility Commission for its 250-megawatt 20-year PPA with Southern California Edison. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made in meeting our execution objectives.","Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the third quarter of 2012, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $415 million or $0.98 per share. NextEra Energy's 2012 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $532 million and $1.26, respectively. Year-to-date through the third quarter, the company's adjusted earnings were approximately $1.5 billion or $3.55 per share compared to approximately $1.4 billion or $3.44 per share for the same period last year.","On an adjusted basis, the corporate and other segment was down $0.04 from the same quarter last year, primarily due to a $0.03 impairment charge on an early stage technology investment. Earlier this month, the Public Utility Commission of Texas voted on aspects of our Lone Star Transmission project. While the results were disappointing, the impact to the overall project is not material to our corporate outlook. We remain on track with our construction program and expect to bring the line into full service in the spring of 2013.","In the third quarter, we issued a second round of equity units, bringing the total to $1.25 billion for the year. This completes our near-term equity needs based on the projects currently in our backlog and ensures we have the balance sheet strength we need for the immediate future. We continue to expect to be free cash flow positive in 2014. As we stated earlier this year, we are targeting a 55% dividend payout ratio in 2014 as a consequence of the mix of our portfolio continuing to shift towards more regulated and long-term contracted assets. This translates into a compound annual growth rate for dividends of approximately 10% using a 2011 base.","In light of the results achieved year-to-date and the progress made against our execution objectives, we continue to be comfortable with the 2012 and 2014 adjusted EPS expectations that we shared with you last fall. As we indicated earlier in the call, we expect adjusted EPS in 2012 to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. And for 2014, we continue to see a range of $5.05 to $5.65. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.","We recognize that our third quarter results are below where many analysts had projected we would be this quarter. As you may recall, we have often indicated that we do not provide quarterly financial expectations since we believe the timing of earnings may shift throughout the year and our focus should be on achieving our annual objectives.","At this point in the year, we are comfortable with our current performance. To provide some perspective, it may be worth noting that year-to-date through the third quarter, NextEra Energy has posted adjusted earnings of $3.55 per share. Achieving the midpoint of our full year earnings expectations implies fourth quarter adjusted earnings growth of just 2.2% above the prior year. We believe this is reasonably achievable and certainly hope to do better.","At this point in the year, we would normally seek to provide you our thoughts on earnings expectations for the year ahead. However, given the schedule of events for FPL's base rate proceeding, we are not yet in a position to do so. We had also indicated that we hoped to be in a position to hold an investor conference late in the year, but we think it makes sense to defer this until we have greater clarity around FPL's outlook for next year.","While visibility around FPL's potential financial performance in 2013 will remain limited until a rate case decision is issued, we have provided FPL's expected regulatory capital employed for 2013 in the appendix to this presentation. For the full year, we expect average regulatory capital employed to be in the range of $27 million to $28 million.","Separately, we can offer a few thoughts about Energy Resources. The most important observation is that after 2 very challenging years driven by adverse market conditions, we expect Energy Resources to return to growth in 2013. We have previously discussed the headwinds associated with declining power prices and hedge roll-offs. While there is some continuing effect in 2013, the biggest impact is in 2012. With the large 2012 U.S. wind program beginning to have an impact in 2013, we believe the business is well-positioned to pick up again.","In 2013, we expect adjusted earnings at Energy Resources to grow approximately 10% to 15% above 2012 to a range of $740 million to $780 million subject to all the usual caveats we provide including normal weather and operating conditions. As we do each year in the third quarter, we have updated our equivalent gross margin hedge slides and included an additional year forward. The portfolio financial information for 2013 and 2014 can be found in the appendix to the presentation.","For 2013, all projects which are expected to be in service by the end of 2012 have been moved to their respective categories which, in this case, is predominantly contracted wind. For the 2014, projects expected to come into service in both 2013 and 2014 are included in the new investments line.","In aggregate, our existing asset portfolio is roughly 95% hedged against primary commodity price movements in 2013 and 93% hedged in 2014. On a comparable basis, the equivalent figures for 2015 and 2016 are 88% and 84%, respectively.","We are also providing some additional portfolio information on our Investor Relations website in the Quarterly Business Updates section. For Energy Resources wind assets, we have identified each project's tax credit election, either PTC or ITC. And for all Energy Resources' assets, we have included the financing structure, either project debt or differential membership interest, otherwise known as tax equity. And we hope you find the additional information helpful.","To close, let me bring you back to our summary list of critical success factors for 2012. This list hasn't changed, and we continue to be very focused on excellence in execution. We are pleased with our progress so far in 2012 but recognize that we have more that we need to accomplish before the end of the year.","And with that, we will now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","As you look at the evolution of the Texas market, there now are essentially 2 different regulatory models that the router [ph] group recently proposed. As you think about those different constructs, could you talk at high level in terms of the impacts to your business over time?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure, let me ask Armando to pick that one up.","Armando Pimentel","Stephen, we're going to know a lot more, obviously, after tomorrow's meeting in Texas, which is an important meeting. I think it's a bit early for us to talk about what the ultimate and potential impacts are of either one. As a general rule, any mechanism that provides both current and future generators with some mechanism to be able to keep their plants open, to be economic and to potentially build future plants is a positive not only for the folks in Texas and the Texas market but also for the generators. So I don't want to speculate on what either plan might do for us. We have filed comments though with the PUCT. We certainly do prefer and support the capacity market out in ERCOT. We think that's the best way to be able to not only support current generators but future generators. And I don't know whether you've seen on our comments or not, but we also believe that the reserve requirement should be a requirement, the reserve margin, as opposed to something that they just shoot for.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. And then just as follow-up, as you look at renewables growth opportunities, we've seen some activity there. Do you see the PTC question of expiration or extension driving that very much? Or could you just talk more broadly about as you see opportunities on the M&A side to acquire assets, what's your general take on the ability to grow via M&A?","Armando Pimentel","I think there's -- I've made comments before where I've been pretty optimistic about projects that we might be able to pick up on the M&A front, and those have -- the reality has not proved to be true. But we, even if that's the case, we have picked up at least one asset or so every year for the last couple of years, and we've done that again in the third quarter, an asset that we hope to close in the fourth quarter. I will tell you that there is a lot of activity out there. There's a lot of projects that -- single projects that we're looking at and multiple projects that we're looking at both on the existing projects, those in construction and those in development. A lot of that I think will depend on what happens with the PTC extension at the end of the year and what equity holders believe they've got to sell. I would be disappointed if at some point during the next 12 to 15 months, we don't pick up at least 1 or 2 other significant projects like we just picked up in the third quarter of this year. On the PTC front and what that means for new development for us, obviously, there's going to be a big difference in 2013 compared to 2012. If there is no PTC in 2013, but even if there is a PTC in 2013, there's obviously a significant amount of activity in 2012 that's taking place. So even with the PTC, I think the overall activity will be down. We're still fairly optimistic that there will be an extension for 1, at least for 1 year and maybe for a couple of years. We're just going to have to wait and see what happens from now through the end of the year. But even without a PTC, we think there will be some opportunities in certain states to develop wind in 2013. And as we showed during the quarter, when we signed a 100-megawatt PPA, there may be a few more of those out there.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Just to add one comment on that. I do think that there's a little bit of an interaction between the state of the asset acquisition market and the prospects for PTC extension. So everybody obviously is waiting to see what happens with the PTC extension, and that clearly is going to affect different folks thinking about assets that they may hold. So I think if we get a PTC then you may see -- well, you will obviously see us with more greenfield development, you may see others, too. If you don't see a PTC extension, then I think there will be relatively more activity on the asset M&A front.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Daniel Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","On the utility side, I guess just kind of given how wide the parties are between agreeing to the settlement and not agreeing to the settlement, should we assume that this is going to have to go through the full hearing process to make a decision on the settlement? Or do you guys have any sense of maybe a deal can get done without having to go through the full process?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are right now actively getting ourselves ready for live testimony, cross-examination on November 19 through 21. So we are certainly expecting that we will be there, and we will have a thorough hearing on the additional aspects that are in the settlement agreement that were not covered in the technical hearing in August for the underlying case. As we also indicated, there's an agenda conference currently scheduled for December 13. So we would certainly expect to have a resolution on that before the end of the year.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on usage trends of the utility, it looked like there's some nicely positive underlying demand trends kind of popping up better than we've seen recently. Is there any more color you can kind of share on where that extra usage is coming from as you guys look at what the customers are doing?","Moray P. Dewhurst","There's not a lot of additional detail I can give you. I guess we've had some good news on the usage front for the last several quarters. We're a little bit reluctant to declare that a trend, just in case it might go away on us. But it's certainly encouraging, but not a lot of detail on where it's coming from. So it's more than you would expect from ongoing underlying usage growth. So I think there's sort of some recovery factor in there. But as I said, we are back to the old phrase, cautiously optimistic that we'll see some underlying usage growth continue. But probably not at the levels that we've seen the last couple of quarters.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just, Moray, a couple of questions on the forward hedging slides. It looks like the gas infrastructure line moved up meaningfully in '13, '14. Could you give us a little more color on what's going on in that business?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, fundamentally, growth in the business, as we continue with seeing additional opportunities and reflecting that in our expectations. So what we are learning from our existing production activities is encouraging. So just greater volumes overall is what's driving that.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And is there any reason why you used a September 7 date for these, since that was pretty much probably the bottom in the power market?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sheer bad luck, that happened to be the date of the roll-up that we based this set of views on. But you are right that it was an interesting inflection point, so we've seen a pretty strong increase in pricing since then. But that was just coincidence.","James L. Robo","This is Jim. Just 1 comment. Remember, we're pretty well-hedged in '13 and '14, so those -- that volatility is really more relevant for our out-year earnings than it is for the near term.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then one last question, just more to confirm your comments for this year that basically to get to the midpoint of your guidance this year, you just need 2.2% up fourth quarter.","Moray P. Dewhurst","That's correct.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And that doesn't seem to be a stretch to achieve?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No. I mean, if you think about the sort of drivers for Energy Resources, we're going to see some growth from new assets, and the gas producing activity should grow a little bit. The existing portfolio should be very roughly flat. I'm sure there'll be some puts and takes as usual. We've got a refueling outage coming up at Duane Arnold, but that's offset by the fact that we should have a shorter outage at Point Beach because last year, we had the big outage for the uprate. So fundamentally, we should see some continued good growth from the new assets, and so we feel pretty good about where that is subject to all the usual caveats. There's a lot of time to go, and there's always ups and downs in that business. Also, the fourth quarter, there's typically less uncertainty around the variability of just market conditions. Obviously, the third quarter is your big quarter. It was, as I said in the prepared remarks, a little disappointing in Texas. But you usually have greater visibility on the fourth quarter. And then on the other side of the house, it's the same story, maintaining a consistent ROE but continuing to invest the capital in the major projects. And we should see a continued trend of earnings growth there. So we feel pretty good about that. And again as I indicated, we certainly hope we'll do better than the midpoint of the range. But I just provided the 2.2% to give some perspective on it. It doesn't seem that unreasonable.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I just wanted to follow-up on Steve's question on the gas business. I wasn't clear, I'm sorry if I'm just a little slow there. It does seem like a big jump in that infrastructure business, and you said it was because of volumes, is that right? Could you just help me out a little bit more, drill a little bit deeper for me?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. Let me ask you, which numbers are you referring to specifically, so I'm [indiscernible]?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","If we look at the EBITDA numbers for -- in the portfolio financial information, those hedge numbers, if you look at 2013 and 2014, the numbers look like they've substantially increased for EBITDA in the range for the gas infrastructure business, and...","Moray P. Dewhurst","Okay, that's fine. You're looking at the comparison 2013 to 2014.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right, and 2013, you're right, just from last quarter to this quarter.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Right, yes. Recognize that, that's a fairly -- if you think of the difference between gross margin and EBITDA, that's a fairly leveraged business. So there's a certain level of sort of a \"fixed cost\" but -- organizational infrastructure cost that you need to drive that business, but that doesn't scale lineally with the scale of production. So as your production ramps up, you should get some profitability leverage. And I think that's what you're seeing there. So you've got a volume growth being leveraged by cost structure because the operating expenses are not growing as rapidly as the underlying gross margin.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And that volume growth is being -- I mean, the outlook for that volume growth has increased because of anything in particular? Or just, I mean, how do we think about that? And I guess is it -- can I go back down or I mean...","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think you should think about this as simply growth in the business, more activities, more wells producing. Recognize that these shale gas wells, so they have a typical decline curve, the shale gas production does. So a lot of your activity is really driven by your drilling activity ultimately. So it's a business that you can modulate. And as we've seen good opportunities, we just scaled up the level of activity.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then just on the production tax credit, sort of the mechanics of that maybe getting extended. There's some talk about the fiscal cliff and how they might just sort of keep -- sort of agree to sort of kick it down the road to be addressed with more of a major tax reform kind of a situation to be developed a few months down the road, if you follow me. And I'm just wondering if that would probably keep the production tax credit where it is, or whether or not it would -- and if that were to happen, if they were to say simply like, \"we'll keep things sort of status quo for the next 6 months as we try to iron something out\", would that mean the production tax credit would be in effect? And if it were, how would that impact you guys or how would you -- or would it be enough time to help you get more projects in. Do you follow what I'm sort of saying?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. One comment first. Let me ask Jim to comment also. I mean obviously, any response to that question has to be speculation, because how they might resolve, \"kicking the can down the road\" scenario remains to be seen. But with that caveat, Jim you want to...","James L. Robo","Yes. I think 2 things, Paul. One is that when you look at the history of how the PTC has been extended as it's expired, historically, what happened is that it's been brought up as part of a package. There's something like 61 or 62, I'm probably getting that number wrong, but it's correct in order of magnitude, expiring tax credits at the end of this year. The PTC is obviously one of those. And historically, what's happened is that the lawmakers have simply scratched out the 2012 and written in 2013 in the bill and kicked the can down the road. I think that there's certainly some odds that, that will happen. I think the important thing to remember about 2013 though, and Armando already said it, is regardless of whether there is a PTC extension or not, 2013 is not going to be a very big wind installation year in the country. Folks are not going long equipment in order to bet on whether the PTC will get extended. Suppliers are not building inventory. And so there is a -- even if the PTC is extended in December, it will be very hard for folks to get projects in place in 2013. So it's going to be not a large year whether the PTC is extended or not.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Real quick, just on the utility side, I mean obviously, whatever rate increase comes out of the rate case would be a tailwind for the business. But how do you think about cost pressures next year and beyond at FP&L?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I guess, the short-term outlook is not really inconsistent with what we've seen over the last few years, i.e. continued modest pressure on O&M but nothing out of the ordinary. I guess in the spirit of full disclosure, I should point out that under the settlement agreement with a fixed term, our exposure, our income exposure to unexpected increases in inflation or interest rates obviously is higher. So that's an aspect of the overall agreement. So right now, we don't see anything on the horizon that's causing us great concern. Just continued slow pressure on nominal O&M offset by our normal, continued incremental productivity from year-to-year.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, when you think about O&M at the utility, do you think about -- I mean, is your goal -- is your normal trend kind of inflationary plus whatever the cost of any new assets that you bring online in a given year, has it been higher than inflationary? And if so, what are the drivers? Kind of what do you think the biggest puts and takes could be?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, for the last few years, the net O&M growth has been slightly positive in real terms, but that's really been driven by a couple of major things, benefits and insurance costs. If you factor those out, everything else has been going down maybe a percentage point a year in real terms. So we've -- over the last decade, we've gone from a period where we were still able to drive costs out in nominal terms to a period where we were driving them out in real terms but were kind of flat-to-rising nominal. For the last few years, it's been slightly up in real terms, but as I say, primarily due to the benefits and insurance. Insurance is obviously kind of a cyclical phenomena. I don't see that continuing at the same pace for future years.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and last item. Just pension and OPEB, as you're kind of getting closer to the year end of 2012, how do you think about that in terms of cost pressures for beyond 2012?","Moray P. Dewhurst","There is an impact in 2013 from the pension. You've got the effect of losses sustained during the down period a few years back that rolled through. It's not huge. The OPEB is a minor factor.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So the vast majority of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to ask you to dig down a little bit more into Texas in the quarter. There were a lot of puts and takes at Energy Resources, one of them was $0.09 favorable from less extreme weather, better supply and trading in Texas. But you also indicated that, that wasn't as much of a rebound as you had otherwise hoped for given that the weather kind of flip-flopped the other way and was maybe more mild than people had hoped. Can you dive a little bit more in the components of that $0.09 and then sort of going into next year and beyond, sort of are you more or less at a stable platform? Or are there other adjustments we should expect to get back to sort of what you think a stable margin is in Texas?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. Let me make a couple of general comments, and then ask Armando also to add his thoughts. A couple of different things going on. Recall that last year's third quarter really was some pretty extreme conditions in Texas. And as we indicated back then, the good performance that we had on our gas-fired assets was more than accounted for by weakness in the Retail business and the fact that wind happened not to blow during the worst of the spiking prices. So all of that, in a sense, reversed itself. And we got back to kind of a normal situation from that perspective. But relative to a typical summer year, we just didn't see the number of days of strong prices. I'm not talking about the 1000-plus megawatt hour periods but just regular strong days. So for example, there were -- in the entire quarter, I believe there were only 3 days where the average price in ERCOT was above $100 a megawatt hour, even in what we call the needle peak of 2:00 to 6:00 hours. So it was just a very flat pricing environment. And so that is below what we would normally expect of a typical summer. In a typical summer, you're going to get more short-term periods of volatility than that. So it's sort of -- it came back from the extreme but it didn't come back to what you would typically think off as a normal level. So with that -- those general comments, let me see if Armando wants to add anything.","Armando Pimentel","Yes, Greg, the only thing I'll add is we set ourselves up for the ERCOT summer this year to be long and to take advantage of what we believe would be decent market prices. That didn't happen. We're now trying to figure out what to do for 2013 and 2014, but it's very likely that we're going to be in a very similar position in Texas. And that is hoping that our assets take advantage of higher prices during the summer. If that does not happen, then you are obviously going to give up some of the upside that you would have otherwise been able to get because you're going to leave some assets open, hoping for those prices. And when they don't come in, you're going to get lower margins. I think, most of -- if I remember correctly, there were a lot of days in ERCOT this year where real-time prices cleared with a three handle. And that not a 300-handle, that was a 30-handle, which is certainly not what we were expecting.","Moray P. Dewhurst","And one of the consequences is that there are fewer opportunities available for what we call our asset optimization activity. So I feel very good about the way we structured the portfolio to protect against the extreme conditions and the balance that we struck there. So that was fine. But if you don't have just the regular short-term periods of volatility, there's less you can do with the assets. And I don't know, roughly  to scale it, maybe with all of that -- if it had been a more normal summer, we will have like $0.04 or $0.05 perhaps probably more of income from the Texas segment. I don't know if that helps you.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","No, that helps a lot. So it sounds like you'd be positioned next summer very similarly to the way you were positioned this summer. So if you have a mild summer again next year, we wouldn't see a big pullback in profitability on the put side. If we saw a tight summer, you'd have some upside?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think that's fair, very fair.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Worms with BMO Capital Markets.","Michael S. Worms - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","With regard to all of the equity units done this year, will there be any need for equity in 2013?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Not based on the backlog-only scenario, the capital plans that we have today. Obviously, to the extent that we are successful in adding significantly to the capital profile going forward, we have to make sure that we have the balance sheet strength to support that. But based on what we see today, which is, of course, the capital program that supports the earnings expectations out through 2014, we're in good shape on the equity front, the balance sheet.","Michael S. Worms - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. And one other question, if I can follow up. Can you give us an update of what's going on in Spain with your project?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. Let me ask Armando. He's much closer to that than I am.","Armando Pimentel","In Spain, over the last 6 weeks or so, there's been a proposed regulation\/law that would really affect all of the energy providers in Spain, not just the project that we're interested in, obviously, which is a CSP solar project that we hope to get half of it in operations in the first quarter of '13 and the second half, no later than the third quarter of '13. The 2 pieces of the legislation that affect us are 6% essentially revenue tax, and that really affects all energy providers in Spain. The second piece is a reduction in the amount of natural gas that we would be able to burn at the plant, which is really one of the key items that helped us with the investment decision and help others with their investment decisions over in Spain when they were dealing with solar thermal plants. But a reduction in the amount of gas that could be used, a pretty significant reduction. If you look at both of those and if you assume for a second that there are no changes to that legislation before it becomes final later this year or earlier this year, that's a reduction in our expectations of -- I mean, it's a significant reduction for the project of roughly $0.03 to $0.04 on an EPS basis, which is not that significant obviously to the overall corporation. But we continue to be very aggressive in what we do in Spain on both the political and regulatory front and we're certainly hoping that there is a better outcome. But if there is not a better outcome, that's essentially the effect that we would see going forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Armando, continuing on Spain, I remember the project financing there left the lenders with some exposure. I assume the 6% revenue tax and the limit on natural gas would not trigger that. So essentially, all of those changes would be for next year's account?","Armando Pimentel","That's correct. The best way to think about it, these projects -- we were very well-protected and certainly love the financing that we did, but we are very close now to COD on these projects. So the net result, if all of this, the proposed law gets to final, it might be that we have to put a little bit more equity into the project. And by a little bit, I do mean a little bit. Maybe in the neighborhood of $40 million to $50 million or so, certainly not significant. But the reality is that we will likely, with this proposed law, finish our projects, own the projects and very likely get to the perm part of that mini perm loan sometime later next year or early 2014.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you. And so simply, just realizing lower profitability than you might have expected otherwise?","Armando Pimentel","Correct.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Perfect. Moray, I was hoping to go back to Texas just briefly and follow-up on the earlier question. When you look at the results from 2011 third quarter, I think you spent the better part of a couple of months evaluating your policies there. And then sometime in the fourth quarter suggested you were changing them to go into the third quarter of '12 much longer. As a result of what you experienced in the third quarter, would you anticipate any changes in the policy? Or pursuant to the question you answered earlier, is there's simply no change and we should anticipate you would go into the third quarter of '13 with the same policy, again being sort of longer than you might otherwise have been in '11.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. Let me try to explain that. There were a couple of things that really changed coming out of -- lessons learned from last year. One was really, I'll say strictly internal coordination, and we've now got a, I think, a much tighter approach to the tactical management of the aggregate position in Texas on a weekly and daily basis. So that's been a good thing, that's worked very well for us this year. The second thing that we did was that we shifted the mix a little bit more. We left a little more open on the gas plants and protected ourselves against some extreme conditions. So on that side, what you might call the policy side, obviously, we will review that as we prepare for the next summer season then tweak it, I'm sure somewhat. But that basic structure, I think, served well. And so that's not the reason that we were a little disappointed in the outcome in Texas. So that structurally did what it was intended to do. The reason we were a little disappointed in the outcome is simply that there wasn't enough volatility and pricing movement to get what we would normally have expected primarily out of the gas assets. So from a policies perspective, we'll revise and tweak, but won't fundamentally change it.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's really helpful. And then can you remind us the revised cost of the nuclear uprates at P&L?","Moray P. Dewhurst","About 3.1 is where we are right now.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you. And that's reflective of the revised megawatts you referenced in your prepared comments.","Moray P. Dewhurst","That's correct.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference."],"15248":["NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 30, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Julie Holmes","Moray P.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Julie Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Julie Holmes","Thank you, Leslie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. With me this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power & Light Company.","Moray will provide an overview of our results, following which, our executive team will be available to answer your questions. We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures -- financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong results during the first quarter of 2013, and both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources are executing well on the objectives we've discussed with you last quarter and during our investor conference.","At FPL, we maintained a regulatory ROE of 11%, while we continued to invest heavily in the business in ways that enhance what we believe is already the best customer value proposition in the state. Average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 14% over the same quarter last year and was the main driver of our net income growth of about 20%.","I am pleased to report that 3 of FPL's major capital projects are now complete. The successful repowering of Turkey Point Unit 4 earlier this month marked the completion of our extended nuclear power uprate program. We also finished installing 4.5 million smart meters across our service territory to serve our customers better.","Finally, our first modernization project at Cape Canaveral entered service last week, more than a month earlier than originally expected. And our Riviera Beach and Port Everglades modernizations remain on track.","At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings were down slightly compared to the prior year comparable quarter, primarily from lower wind generation. This quarter's adjusted results excludes 3 unusual items: the gain on the sale of our Maine hydro assets, a charge associated with our decision to sell our merchant fossil assets in Maine and charges associated with an impairment on our Spain solar project. I will discuss each of these items in more detail later in the call.","Our renewables backlog remains on track, and we continue to make good progress on our incremental growth opportunities. Since our investor conference in March, we signed long-term power purchase agreements for an incremental 150 megawatts of new U.S. wind projects and 40 megawatts of new solar projects.","On the transmission front, we successfully energized our Lone Star Transmission line in Texas on time and under budget. We continue to pursue a number of other transmission opportunities in North America, as we discussed at our investor conference in March.","Looking beyond this quarter, we are focused on driving long-term growth across our primary businesses that is profitable and creates value. Central to this is a continued search for ways to improve our productivity and relative cost position sustainably.","As we mentioned during our recent investor conference, we have initiated a comprehensive company-wide internal review to identify opportunities to continue to improve our businesses through revenue enhancement and O&M savings. Even though our overall relative cost position is excellent, we believe we have room for further improvement. We are fairly early in our review process but we are pleased with our progress, and we will provide updates on this initiative throughout the year.","I want to take a brief moment to elaborate on the growth plan we laid out for you at our conference. If we simply complete the projects that were in our backlog in March, which are outlined on the left side of the accompanying slide, we believe we can grow adjusted EPS at a compound annual growth rate of roughly 5% through 2016 off a 2012 base.","At FPL, this includes successfully bringing our remaining 2 modernization projects online on time and on budget. It also includes our completed nuclear uprate program, which I mentioned in my opening remarks.","At Energy Resources, it includes 175 megawatts of U.S. wind expected to enter service in 2013, roughly 600 megawatts of Canadian wind to enter service through 2015 and approximately 900 megawatts of solar to enter service through 2016. Also included in our March backlog is our Lonestar Transmission project in Texas which, as I noted earlier, is now fully operational. We must stay focused on completing the remaining projects in our backlog while we pursue and execute on new incremental opportunities across our core businesses.","Our ability to grow beyond 5% through 2016 will depend in large part on how successful we are in identifying and implementing productivity improvements and on how successful we are in developing new capital deployment opportunities.","The internal review I mentioned earlier began this month, and we are working hard to identify opportunities to improve our businesses through O&M savings.","At FPL, every dollar we can extract in productivity and O&M savings creates headroom to allow us to invest incremental capital in the business without driving up customer bills. We have already identified $75 million in potential savings through a number of initiatives, and we fully expect to find more. We have also identified $4 billion to $5 billion of incremental capital deployment opportunities at FPL that appear to have strong customer benefits, although more analysis is required before we are ready to commit to all of them.","One of these opportunities is accelerated storm hardening that will build on the program we started some time ago to improve our systems' resiliency and reliability. We will be filing updated plans for this additional infrastructure investment with Florida PSC tomorrow.","While some of the potential incremental investments will be recovered through clauses or on an AFUDC return, others, such as storm hardening, will be absorbed through productivity improvements and the O&M savings we are able to generate. We have set a stretch goal for ourselves to keep base O&M roughly flat in nominal terms through 2016 at Florida Power & Light.","Additional growth at Energy Resources beyond our March backlog will come from new wind and solar projects. As I noted earlier, since the March investor conference, we have signed PPAs for an additional 150 megawatts of new U.S. wind and 40 megawatts of new U.S. solar projects. We have a strong pipeline of additional projects and continue to expect to develop between 500 megawatts and 1,500 megawatts of new contracted U.S. wind and up to 300 megawatts of new contracted solar projects over the next 4 years, equating to an incremental capital investment of somewhere between $1 billion and $4 billion.","Based on the opportunities we see over the next 4 years at both FPL and Energy Resources, we continue to expect that our portfolio mix and earnings profile will shift towards a more regulated and long-term contracted business. Maintaining a balanced portfolio is important for our risk profile and our credit position.","In 2016, we expect adjusted EBITDA from our regulated and long-term contracted operations to reach roughly 84% of the total.","Let me now walk through our results for the first quarter of 2013. We will begin with results at FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers.","For the first quarter of 2013, FPL reported net income of $288 million or $0.68 per share, up $0.10 per share year-over-year. The regulatory return on equity during the quarter remained unchanged at 11%. However, the quality of earnings improved, as cash recovery associated with the base rate increase reduced the utilization of reserve amortization as compared to the same quarter last year.","We invested roughly $700 million in the quarter and expect to invest approximately $2.8 billion for the full year. Regulatory capital employed growth of roughly 14% over same quarter last year was the main driver of growth in net income of approximately 20%. The remaining difference was a function of a number of smaller items, including improvement in the non-retail portion of the business. We would expect to see our growth in net income generally track our growth in regulatory capital deployed, though there may be differences on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Weather during the quarter was both mild and unusual in nature. The number of heating degree days in January and February was well below normal. And in March, we experienced an abnormally low number of cooling degree days. We estimate that for the quarter, base revenues were roughly $40 million less than we expected, primarily as a result of the weather. We utilized $137 million of surplus depreciation during the quarter, and we remain comfortable that we can achieve our financial expectations this year and still retain sufficient reserve amortization for future years.","Looking back over the past 2 years, we have utilized a larger proportion of surplus depreciation in the first half of the year, and we do not expect this year to be any different. As many of you recall, we have been expecting 2013 to require the utilization of more surplus than in subsequent years, and this remains true. 2014 and later years will benefit from the growth of our existing wholesale contracts, and thus, require less reserve amortization to meet our targeted regulatory ROE.","All of our major initiatives that we laid out for you in prior quarters remain on track. Turkey Point Unit 4 nuclear uprate, I mentioned earlier, completes the extended power uprate program at FPL. Today, the plant is running at approximately 50%, and when it ramps up to full power in a few more weeks, our uprate program will have added a total of more than 500 megawatts of emissions-free generation to our fleet.","I also noted earlier that our Cape Canaveral modernization project is now operational after entering service more than a month ahead of schedule. The project also came in under budget, and we are very pleased by the success of our development and construction effort.","The 1,210 megawatts of highly efficient combined-cycle gas generation from the plant will save customers money on fuel, reduce air emissions and start to provide shareholders with a cash return on their substantial investment.","Construction continues at our Riviera Beach plant modernization, which is now 53% complete, and the project remains on budget and on schedule to enter service in June 2014.","We are also moving ahead with the Port Everglades modernization project, with demolition of the current plant scheduled for July of this year and construction set to begin next spring. Our Port Everglades plant is expected to enter service in June 2016.","All in all, our 3 modernization projects will add approximately 3,700 megawatts of efficient, clean, combined-cycle generation to our fleet and are expected to provide roughly 1.2 billion in customer benefits over the lives of the plants.","Other developments at FPL during the quarter include progress on our proposed acquisition of the Vero Beach municipal electric utility system. On March 12 of this year, residents voted in favor of the transition, and we expect the transaction to close in 2014.","On our pipeline project, we received a number of bids in response to the RFP, and we are in the process of evaluating them now. We expect to make a decision sometime in July and hope to have additional information to provide by our second quarter earnings release.","The Florida economy continues to improve slowly. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in March dropped 1.4 percentage points from the prior year to 7.5%, outpacing the improvement in the national unemployment rate of only 0.6% over the same period. This is the first time since January 2008 that the Florida unemployment rate is lower than the national rate. We are seeing the improving employment picture reflected in retail activity, which has increased markedly since the trough in mid-2009 and is now above prerecession levels. At the same time, Florida consumer confidence is well above the low points reached in recent years and seems to be reasonably stable even after federal budget sequestration and the expiration of the payroll tax holiday.","The Florida housing market also continues to recover. The backlog of homes in foreclosure is gradually declining, and Florida has improved from having the second highest mortgage delinquency rates in the country to having the ninth highest rates. The Case-Shiller seasonally adjusted index for South Florida home prices continues to increase at a double-digit pace and is now at the highest level since early 2009. Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, nearly doubled on an annual basis and remained the second highest in the nation.","These generally encouraging developments are reflected in the internal indicators that we follow at FPL. During the first quarter, we had approximately 33,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter in 2012, representing an increase of 0.7%. This growth rate has been fairly consistent for the last 12 quarters.","Total retail sales declined 3.5%, as January and February were unusually mild, while March was much cooler than normal. Comparisons with last year are also affected by the leap year impact. Underlying usage was roughly flat for the quarter. The number of inactive meters declined to the lowest number that we have seen in 5 years, and it is now approaching its long-term average.","On the other hand, the improvement in low usage accounts seems to have stalled. It may be that partially occupied premises have increased more or less permanently, due to an increase in investor-owned and internationally owned properties.","New service accounts are on track for the strongest year since 2009, and we continue to see growth in our industrial accounts which, as a reminder, are primarily tied to the construction industry in our service territory. We remain encouraged by these overall positive data.","Let me turn now to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of negative $40 million or negative $0.09 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $177 million or $0.42 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the effect of the mark on non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI.","In addition, we have excluded 3 other items from adjusted earnings this quarter. These are the gain on the sale of our Maine hydro assets, a charge associated with the decision to sell our merchant fossil assets in Maine and charges associated with an impairment on our Spain solar project. I'll provide more details on these items in just a moment.","Energy Resources' adjusted EPS contribution was slightly negative compared to the same quarter of last year, decreasing $0.02. The primary drivers for the quarter were lower wind generation of $0.06 and PTC roll-off of $0.01, partially offset by the absence of the Seabrook derate we experienced in 2012 of $0.02.","Our customer supply and trading businesses contributed a positive $0.04 due to favorable market conditions. New wind and solar investments increased $0.03 over the prior year comparable quarter. Contributions from gas infrastructure declined $0.03, as last year's comparable quarter included a gain associated with hedge closeouts. All other effects were minor as reflected on the accompanying slide.","For the full year, we expect to elect CITCs on roughly 300 megawatts for our Mountain View Solar project and portions of Genesis and Desert Sunlight solar projects that are expected to enter service in 2013. This equates to roughly $80 million in adjusted earnings, up from $53 million in 2012 on 457 megawatts of wind projects.","While there are fewer megawatts of CITC elections in 2013, the capital costs for solar are higher than capital costs for wind, which results in an increase in earnings for the year-over-year comparison.","As I mentioned, we have excluded 3 items from adjusted earnings this quarter due to their unusual nature in order to make period-to-period comparisons more meaningful. However, it is important to understand their impact. The sale of the Maine hydro assets closed during the quarter. And as we previously indicated, the transaction resulted in a significant GAAP gain of $216 million. The sale had a small positive cash impact.","Based on changes we have made to our merchant portfolio in the Northeast and our commitment to continuously evaluate the role of all our assets, we have concluded that our Maine fossil assets no longer strategically make sense for the business. We have, therefore, made the decision to sell our 796 megawatts of merchant oil-fired assets in Maine. Based on the estimated fair value, we have recognized a charge of $41 million with no current cash impact.","Our Spain project is nearing completion. However, the project is facing financial challenges as a result of recent tariff changes that fundamentally impact the project's economics. After extensive analysis, in accordance with accounting rules, we concluded that the value of our assets should be written down by $300 million. After accounting for certain income tax valuation allowances, which have no impact on cash, the total after-tax impact to GAAP net income is $342 million. However, the economic effect is as we have previously discussed, and we continue to believe that our economic exposure is limited to our equity commitment of somewhat less than $300 million. As a reminder, we have removed from our financial expectations all contributions to operating earnings and cash flow from this project.","We continue to make good progress in developing our backlog of renewables projects. Our solar and Canadian wind programs are on track to meet their respective commitments of roughly 600 megawatts of contracted wind capacity in Canada through 2015 and roughly 900 megawatts of contracted solar capacity through 2016.","As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased that our 2013 to 2014 wind program is on track, with 325 megawatts of projects with signed long-term PPAs. With the economics of wind improving as a result of better turbine technology and lower turbine prices, wind PPA contracts are very attractively priced. As a result, buyers are clearly interested in taking advantage of these prices and the production tax credit extension.","Recently, the IRS clarified the start of construction language necessary to qualify for the PTC. A facility qualifies if significant physical work begins at the site or certain Safe Harbor provisions are met. We view this language as positive.","Our solar development pipeline remains on track with the potential to build up to 300 megawatts of incremental projects in addition to the March backlog. As I indicated earlier, we recently secured 2 20-megawatt PPAs and are actively working on additional opportunities in our pipeline. We are pleased with our progress in our development pipeline and remain comfortable with the ranges we have discussed.","As a reminder, we indicated in March that we have the potential to deploy $1 billion to $3 billion in incremental capital and add between 500 and 1,500 megawatts of U.S. wind capacity in 2013 and 2014, and we see opportunities for a further up to $1 billion of incremental capital investment to support our target of up to 300 megawatts of new solar projects through to 2016. We will update you each quarter on our progress as we secure PPAs and continue to work our development pipeline.","Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the first quarter of 2013, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $272 million or $0.64 per share. NextEra Energy's 2013 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $475 million and $1.12, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment were up $0.02 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to consolidating income tax adjustments in our Lone Star Transmission project. As we noted last quarter, we expect the full year contributions to earnings from this segment to improve slightly relative to 2012.","On our last earnings call, we laid out for you a list of critical success factors for 2013. These remain a priority for us. At FPL, we'll continue to strive to deliver the best value in the state to our customers. The FPL team had a great year in 2012, and we will focus on ways to make our customer value proposition even better. We will continue to develop the Riviera Beach and Port Everglades modernization projects, with a focus on coming in on time and on budget. And finally, we've made a good start in our effort to identify additional ways to improve productivity, so we can invest capital in projects that will continue to improve the value we deliver to our customers.","At Energy Resources, we must maintain our focus on excellence in day-to-day operations. We must continue the successful development of our Canadian wind and our solar portfolios, and we will continue working hard to develop a strong portfolio of profitable contracted solar projects along with our 2013, 2014 U.S. wind program. We expect to finance any incremental investment in a way that supports our targeted credit metrics.","And finally, in our transmission business, our focus will be on successfully operating our newly commissioned Lone Star Transmission project and looking for additional transmission opportunities in North America.","Based on what we see at this time, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2013 to be in the range of $4.70 to $5, and we see nothing that would change the ranges of earnings expectations we provided you in March for 2014 through 2016. We continue to see adjusted EPS growth at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off a 2012 base.","As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.","And with that, we will now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just turning to the wind conversation a little bit with the range now out there of 500 to 1,500 for the next 2 years. Is that 1,500 megawatt, the top end number, is that a reflection of kind of the logistical limitations of you guys building that much wind in a short amount of time? Or do you think there's the ability, at some point, to maybe surpass that given the compelling economics of wind with the tax credit still sitting out there?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, Dan, I would say that the whole range is based on our total assessment of what's realistic over this period, including both the customer dimension and the supply-chain dimension. So while I would never say never, I think that based on what we see today, 1,500 is a good upper end for the U.S. wind program.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then have you thought about kind of the way the IRS interpretation? I mean, it looks like there's maybe some ability to even go beyond 2014 from a development perspective. Do you guys see a window where this could expand into 2015?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think that right answer to that is just to say that we are very focused on our 2013-2014 program.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on solar, obviously, you guys kind of rescaled on the Blythe project, which was expected. But when do you think we could start to see movement on some PPAs being announced on the solar front? Is that a 2013 announcement prospect? And what should we be watching maybe to see some of these projects move forward?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I guess I would just divide the solar pipeline into the 2 parts. I think obviously, with just announcing 2 small projects here, I think there could be several more of those. We've previously noted that there's probably not more than one more large scale project to come that could -- would -- certainly we could have success on that in this year, or not. So I mean it's a little difficult to say exactly when it's going to happen. Armando, do you want -- do you have any other comments? Armando is shaking his head, so that's all we've got.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess just the last one. Again, I guess, it looks like we had a light performance from a wind utilization perspective. A, how far off were you guys versus normal? Because I didn't see it in the slides. And then b, is there a time when we need to reevaluate kind of the growth rate or base line expectations, given the fact that there seems to be a fairly regular underperformance from wind relative to the model?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I guess, there's 2 parts to the answer to that question. First, on the wind resource, just numerically, in the first quarter we're about 97%. It's quite clear looking at the data over the last few years that the wind resource available to the portfolio in aggregate has been, on average, below the longer-term averages. So I don't think there's any question about that. The second part of the answer, however, is that we are right in the midst of essentially recalibrating all our wind models. And the reason that I pulled the wind resource slide from the release this time is that we -- while we have a new set of numbers, they are not directly comparable to the ones that we have been presenting. So I was a little concerned that people would compare one with the other and come to misleading conclusions. So we will be putting those back out once we have a better basis for comparisons on that. So we are doing some recalibration. But I would just estimate -- underline that the wind resource, like any other sort of climate-related variable, can go through quite significant cycles. So we can have several years in a row where you are below average, and that is statistically perfectly normal.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Moray, I had to jump off for a second. But did you say that you expect near [ph] to be slightly improved versus '12?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think you may have been picking up the reference to corporate and other. As we've previously said, for '13, we expect it to be a little bit up over 2012. We certainly expect Energy Resources to be up as well in '13.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And I think you filed with Florida that you expected to earn 11.25%. Is that still reasonable?","Moray P. Dewhurst","The forecasted surveillance report for the remainder of the year is -- comes in at about 11.25%. So yes, that's roughly what we're thinking at the moment based on what we see.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, have you initiated discussions in Spain? And what's the outlook for resolution here aside from walking away?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think as a practical matter it's going to take some time to resolve the situation. We are in active discussion with our bank group. But for commercial reasons, I don't think it would be appropriate for me to say more.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And I guess, from our current position, the way you've characterized Spain, there's nothing but upside from here. Is that fair?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I can't absolutely say that there's nothing but upside. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we continue to believe that our exposure is limited to the equity contribution, which is roughly $270 million based on today's exchange rate.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman.","Steven Fleishman","Just a couple questions. The 2013, '14 EBITDAs were down about $100 million to $140 million in -- for Resources. Is that mainly just taking Spain out? Or is there any other changes in there?","Moray P. Dewhurst","There's a few minor changes, but by far the biggest change was removing Spain.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then you mentioned the good kind of market conditions for the supply trading. Could you give us maybe a little more color on that? Which business within that benefited?","Moray P. Dewhurst","It was really spread all across the board. The full requirements piece of it was roughly half the $0.04. And even within that, it was a variety of different deals. As I recall, it was mostly concentrated in the PJM deals, more than NEPOOL. But most everything was a little bit better. And then a little bit in just the regular general marketing and trading. So nothing specific that you can really point to, but each element of that portfolio did a little bit better than we expected.","Steven Fleishman","And then retail was fine?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Retail was -- yes. Flat where we expected it to be.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. One other question, just the -- there's, I guess, the proposed legislation on renewable MLP has been -- has come back out again. Could you just give us your latest thoughts on that proposal? What are the good things, bad things and how that ties into whether we can get another PTC extension?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. Let me ask Jim to comment on that one.","James L. Robo","So Steve, I think the important thing to understand about the MLP proposal with -- of adding renewables to be able to be MLP-able, if you will, is that it's not really a replacement for the PTC. And that's because this bill doesn't fix the -- doesn't address the passive loss limitations that exist as a result of the 1986 tax changes. And so new wind projects have significant losses that would not be allocable to the investors. And so it's a terrific vehicle for old wind assets coming off of a 10-year -- coming off of their 10-year PTC window, and that's terrific. And we think as the largest owner of those kind of assets, that it would be helpful to us if it passed. But it is not a replacement for the PTC, is the bottom line, and would not really impact new builds as a result of that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the utility, you mentioned the storm hardening program and that you would make a filing tomorrow. But that -- and I wanted to make sure I understood this, that you wouldn't be seeking full recovery via a rider. Could you just give a little more granularity about what's recovered via rider? What you would kind of utilize AFUDC earnings to capture for the next few years. And then when would you put this into cash rates?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. Let me try and see if I can take those. First of all, we have a requirement for an annual filing with the commission on our storm hardening plans, and that is, I believe, this week. We will be indicate -- based on the work that we've done to date, we can see very significant benefits from the hardening activities that we've already undertaken. And so we would like, if we can, to accelerate our rate of progress on that, and we believe that we will be able to do that and that will be the effect of the filing tomorrow. For recovery purposes, given the fixed rate agreement, the -- that has to be absorbed within the fixed rates that we can see out through 2016. In terms of ultimate cash recovery, it would be then obviously part of the rate base that would go into whatever we end up doing for 2017. Let's say, hypothetically, we had a rate case in 2017, it would be in the rate base on which the revenue requirement would be assessed. Broadly speaking, what we typically call our base infrastructure-type investments, so that's the basic investment that we have to do in the transmission\/distribution infrastructure. All the sort of basic, outside of major generation projects, would typically have to be absorbed within the fixed rate agreement that we have in place. If there are specific large projects that are approved by the commission within this period, they would become eligible for AFUDC, so you would have an earnings impact but a noncash impact, potentially, within this period, but we'd have to wait for cash recovery beyond. So the projects that clearly get cash recovery through increases in rates in the period of the rate agreement are the 3 modernization projects. Then there are some projects that might be recovered through clauses. So if there were a capital investment that was associated with environmental upgrades that were authorized for recovery through the environmental clause, for example, those would get cash recovery through that mechanism. So there's a whole variety of things. But I think the bottom line way to think about this is the reason that we are so very focused on productivity is that the more progress we can make on the productivity side, not only do we make the business better in and of itself, but we also create what I call the headroom to enable us to do additional capital activities that are good for customer and will provide long-term value creation potential for the shareholder.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. One other piece, just on O&M at the utility. Year-over-year O&M was down a good bit. Just I didn't know if there were onetimey items -- onetimer items in the 2012 quarter? Or just could you give a little detail there?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. As always, with O&M, there are some significant variations from quarter-to-quarter. So some of that effect is timing. But some of it is related to planned outages, which vary from year to year. But having said that, as I said before, we are very focused on the broader O&M picture. We have this company-wide initiative underway, and we feel pretty good about where we are on that long-term stretch goal of keeping O&M flat in nominal terms over the period of the rate agreement.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I wanted to follow up on one question from Dan on this April 15 IRS -- I guess, I'm not sure what the official term is, but the IRS letter or whatever, in terms of the PTCs and the ITCs. I know you guys are focused on this year and next, but could you just give us a little bit of flavor as to your reading of the IRS language and what that might mean for the industry in terms of 2015 in terms of new wind potential for the industry?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Frankly, we haven't focused much thought or time on what the implication is for 2015. I think -- at least the way we see it, we have a great window of opportunity to build another portfolio of U.S. wind in 2013 and 2014. And the sooner that we can get projects underway, the sooner we can get them completed, deliver benefits to our customers and value to our shareholders. So we really, at this stage, haven't been focused on 2015.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Most of my questions have also been asked and answered, but one on just customer load growth. In the first quarter, it looks like the change in underlying usage was basically flat. And last year, I think it was up a little over 1%. And in your Analyst Day, you had laid out some expectations there. Can you talk a little bit more about the drivers for the first quarter, how you look at that versus your expectations?","Moray P. Dewhurst","We don't attach a great deal of significance to any one quarter's change in the underlying usage per customer. Last year, we were, I think, pleasantly surprised. We had several quarters where we thought it was higher than sustainable. So this one is kind of a little bit lower than we would expect for the medium-term outlook. But I can't put my finger on any particular drivers in there. It does fluctuate a fair amount from quarter-to-quarter. So going forward, I still think we're going to see small positive increases in average usage per customer over the next few years. But in any quarter, we could be up by a 1% or flat to slightly down as we were this quarter.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, because -- so it sounds like within customer classes, different class, so you didn't see any one class that really stuck out to you as being different than expectations.","Moray P. Dewhurst","No, nothing that's not within the normal bands of noise for these data series.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple things. In the projection that you'll earn the -- around 11.25% ROE on a regulatory basis for the year, does that projection take into account the expectation that you will in fact achieve 0 base O&M growth for the fiscal year?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think the short answer is yes. It certainly reflects our current expectation on O&M for the year. I'm having trouble recalling exactly what that is for this year. But clearly, the range that's in this forecasted surveillance report includes our current thinking about O&M for this year, and that certainly won't be significantly off from last year.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Awesome. And so just to recap what you said with regard to the ability to sort of earn on the storm hardening portion of sort of your opportunity set in terms of incremental opportunities for between now and '16. By definition, you see the ability to hold O&M flat is creating the headroom for sort of that tranche of potential opportunities should the commission accept them?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Absolutely, yes. Now recognize that most of that, the headroom, needs to be created in future years because most of that spending will ramp up this year and the higher levels will be attained next year. But absolutely, yes.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in the next rate cycle, all of that would get rolled into the rate proceeding?","Moray P. Dewhurst","That's correct.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Last question, you talked about how the surplus depreciation in the quarter was $137 million. You talked about using more in the first half than the second half. Then you said that surplus depreciation use would decline in subsequent years but the impact of that would be mitigated and\/or offset, I don't remember the exact language, by increases in wholesale revenues from contracts coming on. Can you talk about the size and duration of those contracts?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I don't think I can say anything very specific about the duration. We did have some discussion, in the March investor conference there's a slide that, I don't recall exact numbers right now, but does show you the magnitude of the impact in 2014. But we have a significant pickup in 2014 associated with one large contract.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just curious on the wind resource update that you talked about. And I think you had mentioned a number of 97%. Is that on the new basis, so therefore not comparable with, I think, it was 101 [ph] in Q1 last year? Or is that given all...","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. Thank you, Jonathan. I should have pointed that out. Yes, that is the current best thinking about what the actual wind resources relative to long-term normal trends. So not directly comparable to the prior materials.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So that's the only number we have so far on the new series basically?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. It's just going to take us a little bit longer. We've had -- some of the same people have been involved in certain quarter closing activities, which have set us behind where I had hoped we would be on that, but we will get that out soon.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And could you give us any sort of sense, I guess, on the old basis, like the year 2012 was 6% below normal or 94%. Is the new normal similar to 2012? Or is it less significant than that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No. The fundamental difference in the recalibration is -- the simple way to think about it is we are recalibrating how much of the output we really think is driven by variability in wind resource as opposed to variation in other factors, including asset availability, curtailments and a variety of other things. There was just kind of a little tweak going on there. And in short, we think, looking back, we've actually been over-attributing shortfalls to wind resource.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So operating, the reliability has been slightly less good, I guess.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. And let me give you -- there are lots of instances here, but let me give you one little one, but it turns out to be significant. Each of these turbines has to be aligned to the average wind direction, and the alignment of the turbine instantaneously to the average wind direction has an impact on the power extraction. So in order to do that, you have to have a vein, essentially, on the turbine that allows the control system to figure out where the wind is coming from, to allow the control system to align the turbine optimally with the wind. If those veins are slightly out of alignment, and they do have a tendency to get out of alignment over time for various reasons, then you will have the control system not optimally extracting the wind. So we've had a recent program where we have been going through and realigning some of these little veins. So that may sound like a small item, but being off by a couple degrees, which you wouldn't notice off a regular visional inspection, can make a difference. So there's a whole series of things like that. And we'll have more for you on that, but I felt we couldn't deal with that within the context of the earnings release.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first question. You spent a lot of time at the Analyst Day or at least the presentation on transmission opportunities. I'd be very curious to get your thoughts on FERC 1000, how the compliance filings are working out and, as of today, what the opportunity set before you by region is.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure, I'd ask Armando to comment more. But generally speaking, we're getting actually more encouraged that more transmission opportunities may be opening up to competition, which we think will give us some opportunities. But Armando?","Armando Pimentel","And that would have been my first remark, which is FERC Order 1000 is working. It may work a bit slow and it may work a bit different by the regions, but it's clearly working. I mean, we've seen opportunities come up this year in California. Opportunities come up in ISO New England. We're excited about some things that we're looking at in SPP. And it's -- so it's one of those things where I look at where we have -- we look at -- we have the pipeline today compared to where it was a couple years ago, and it's pretty exciting. But as we talked about at the Analyst Day, it's not just the U.S. opportunities or the 48 states. We've got several opportunities up in Canada that we're pursuing, a bid that we put in earlier this year that we expect to hear back in the third quarter. Hawaii looks like it might have some opportunities if those -- that RFP comes out in the second or third quarter of this year. So as you might imagine, the incumbent utilities have a significant interest in what happens in their home territory and would like to build the transmission themselves, but we see continued opportunities. And in some regions and states, none of which I'll mention at this time, it actually looks like even the state regulators are pushing the traditional utilities to be a bit more open and either seek partners or to open up the opportunity entirely to new incumbents. So that's pretty exciting for us also.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Absolutely. And just putting pen to pad here, when do you think we'd hear more definitive or concrete plans around the transmission opportunities outside of Texas?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, Julien, I was just going to say, just to put all this in context, as a reminder, what we have said is the transmission opportunities that we're working are the projects that are likely to come into service in the 2017, 2018 kind of time frame. So these are long-term projects. In addition, I have certainly indicated to a number of people that my -- I personally would be delighted if we could, sometime in the course of the next 12 months, find that we have succeeded on one of a half dozen or so realistic opportunities that we have. So I think we have the possibility that sometime in the next 12 months, we would have a project to announce. But even if we do, it would be a project that won't have an earnings impact until well out into the latter half of the decade. But that's fine, because we feel very good about where we are through the middle of the decade.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then bringing it a little bit nearer term here. Looking at New England in the quarter, obviously, you have some assets up there, I suppose a fossil asset that you're looking to get rid of. To what extent did that operate? How did that impact your results? And how do you think about the uplift we've seen at Algonquin of late?","Moray P. Dewhurst","The answer to how much is operated is very, very little for a long time. Recognize, these are oil-fired assets. So they are essentially oil-fired peakers in today's environment. And obviously, with the gas\/oil spread being where it is, that has meant they have just not operated a great deal. So their impact on operating earnings and cash flow really immaterial. But the more fundamental thing is now in light of the structure of the remaining assets in New England, which has really fundamentally been reduced to a merchant position at Seabrook and one minor other asset, they really -- they didn't fit into -- they didn't play a role in the portfolio. So that was the reason for making the decision to discontinue operations there and seek a purchaser.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","You had mentioned that you expected a continued positive trend in weather-normalized use per customer. And I think in your Analyst Day presentation, that was forecasted about 0.3% to 0.7% CAGR. What, in your view, are the drivers of a positive trend as opposed to a negative trend in response to the phase-out of traditional incandescent bulbs and a tendency towards greater efficiency in climate controls in commercial buildings, residential and commercial customers comprising the bulk of your load?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Hugh, I guess there are couple of things. First, you've got, I would say, cyclical factors. We are still coming back from a period where average usage per customer was actually down relative to long-term averages. Second, you've got long-term secular factors, which tend to drive modest increases, and then -- and I'll come back to those in the moment. And then third, you've got -- those are offset by the factors you mentioned, the efficiency thing. So we have an explicit view of the impact of efficiency standards, which are primarily in the HVAC and lighting areas. But that middle category, the sort of long-term drivers of growth, it's fundamentally the long-term economic development. For a long period of time, we have seen that as people get more money, they tend to end up with larger houses, more electronic devices, they tend to feel a little more free to turn the thermostat down to be comfortable, all of those kinds of things. And for certainly as long as we've been looking at the statistics, Florida has exceeded the U.S. average in terms of long-run growth in usage per customer. So I guess the bottom line answer is we're not expecting to go back to the levels of growth that we saw in the last decade because we do believe that those efficiency, appliance efficiency standards will have more of an impact. But when you couple some underlying long-term growth with a little bit still of recovery from the depressed consumption associated with the recession, we think somewhere in that 0.5% a year over several years is realistic.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And if I could quickly, on the stretch target of achieving basically flat O&M expense per megawatt hour over the '13, '14, '15, '16 period, that implies a fairly substantial cut in real O&M per megawatt hour. Is that something that's made possible by the rollout of your automated metering system? Or are there other more important drivers that make you think that, that's feasible?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I would say I would -- I certainly wouldn't exclude that. We are definitely seeing all kinds of opportunities from -- arising from the investment that we've made in the so-called smart grid. But that's only one of many things. Look, if you go back and look at the long-term trend, we have consistently, up through the middle of the last decade, driven real O&M per kilowatt hour down substantially. That trend started to reverse a little bit or flattened out in the middle of the last decade, and then it reversed a bit with the -- as we went through the recession in the last few years. So really what we're saying to ourselves is we ought to be able to get back on the track of long-term, real improvement in O&M per kilowatt hour over a multiyear period. And now that we have the resources, many of which were freed up from the completion of the rate case last year, to focus on the analytical work that's necessary to get us there and the ideas that are coming up through this initiative that I referred to, we feel pretty good that we can get back to where we think we should be.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Moray, can you give us what -- on the slide where you showed what the first quarter rate base was, is there a number that you can provide us that would be for the end of 2013?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I can certainly get back to you on that. We have a rough number on where we expect to be given the CapEx plans. I don't have it off the top of my head. But yes, I can get back to you on that.","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

As a result, our net income increased $52 million compared with the same quarter last year.","Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings in the second quarter increased $0.04 compared with the same quarter last year. Contributions from new investments helped offset declines from our existing assets, which stemmed primarily from below-average wind resource this quarter versus above-average wind resource in the second quarter of 2011. Overall, we continue development on the renewables projects in our backlog and remain on track for the goals we laid out at the beginning of the year.","In Florida, the early signs of economic recovery we witnessed in prior quarters appear to have slowed. After significant employment growth in late 2011, Florida's pace of job creation has slowed. The Florida unemployment rate in June was flat compared to May, but has dropped more than 2% since this time last year. Consumer confidence in Florida increased in June relative to last year, but declined versus the prior month. We saw an uptick in tourism taxable sales, which are now trending above the levels seen prior to the recession, and the housing market continues to show signs of modest improvement.","Notwithstanding the somewhat hesitant recovery, we continue to invest in the business to provide greater value for our customers and to keep our overall bills low. We are making major investments to modernize our generation fleet and increase our nuclear generation output to be more efficient, to reduce emissions and to drive down fuel costs for customers. Over the lives of these projects, we expect that fuel and other savings will more than offset the capital and operating costs of these projects.","At Energy Resources, our focus has been on executing the plans for our record backlog of renewables projects. All of our projects continue to proceed with no significant changes in the execution timeline.","As a result of the progress we have made in the first half of the year, our overall financial expectations remain about the same as we previously discussed. For 2012, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65, and for 2014, we continue to see a range of $5.05 to $5.65, subject to all the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.","Let's now look at our results for the second quarter of 2012. I'll start with the results at FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For the second quarter of 2012, FPL reported net income of $353 million or $0.85 per share, up $0.13 per share year-over-year. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth was continued investment in the business. During the quarter, we invested roughly $1.1 billion of the approximately $4.1 billion that we expect to invest in the business in 2012, and regulatory capital employed, that is capital on which we are able to earn a return, grew 17.5% over the same quarter last year.","During the quarter, we amortized $165 million of surplus depreciation, enabling us to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11%. For the full year, we expect to amortize approximately $500 million of surplus depreciation, after which, there will remain roughly $200 million to be amortized. As we stated last quarter, utilization of $190 million of the surplus in 2013 is built into our rate case filing.","As we've discussed on previous calls, FPL is in the midst of the largest capital deployment phase in its history. In the second quarter, we received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, for power uprates on Turkey Point units 3 and 4, and earlier this month, we received NRC approval for the uprate at Unit 1 of our St. Lucie nuclear facility. St. Lucie Unit 2 is currently moving through the approval process, and we expect to receive NRC approval in the third quarter of this year. In total, these 4 projects are expected to contribute approximately 490 megawatts of additional clean generation capacity, which, in turn, will drive down customer's fuel cost.","The modernizations at our Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach facilities are progressing as planned. The projects are anticipated to come into service in mid-2013 and 2014, respectively, and are expected to provide $850 million to $950 million in total present value cost savings to our customers over the lives of the plants.","We experienced the first storms of the season in the second quarter, with our service territory being affected by Tropical Storms Beryl and Debby. Tropical Storm Debby drenched the west coast of Florida for days before passing through the state. And through the hard work of our employees, power was restored to 99% of the impacted customers within 24 hours.","In Florida, most economic indicators we follow have improved significantly from the trough of the recession. However, we are seeing symptoms that the recovery is slowing here in Florida, just as it seems to be for the nation as a whole. As we've repeatedly noted, we do not believe Florida will see a full recovery until the rest of the country sees more consistent signs of growth.","Many of the metrics we focus on have recently flattened, creating a level of uncertainty around what we had hoped was evidence of a sustained economic recovery. In June, the Florida unemployment rate was 8.6%, unchanged from the prior month. On a positive note, the gap between the unemployment rate in Florida and the U.S. has narrowed, and Florida is now just 0.4% worse than the national rate. Looking to job creation, in June, 70,900 new jobs were reported in Florida compared to the same month in 2011.","While the improvement in the job market has slowed recently, almost all residential housing statistics point to a continued recovery in Florida. Mortgage delinquencies continue to drop and are at their lowest level since 2008. The inventory of existing homes for sale reported by Florida realtors is at its lowest point in more than 4 years. As Florida reduces the inventory of existing homes, more room is made for the addition of new homes, and we are seeing that trend manifest in the housing permit data. In May, housing permits increased 58% year-over-year, the largest annual increase in roughly 2 years, although, of course, on a very low base.","While the mortgage and housing data are encouraging, continued employment gains, declining unemployment rates and improvement in the national economy are important to the sustainability of housing market improvements. We will monitor these and other data points, but we continue to believe Florida will provide above-average growth opportunities over the long term.","Our customer metrics at FPL are naturally tied to the pace of economic recovery, both in Florida and nationally. With the recent lull in recovery, our customer metrics appear to have stabilized for the moment. During the second quarter, we had approximately 27,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2011, representing an increase of 0.6%. This growth rate has been fairly consistent for the last 9 quarters. And while we are encouraged by continued customer growth, we, of course, would like to see the pace of that growth improve over time.","Underlying usage increased for the third consecutive quarter, up 1.7% over the same quarter last year. We are particularly encouraged by increases in underlying usage in the residential sector. The commercial sector, however, seems to be lagging a bit. We still hesitate to extrapolate underlying usage growth to a broader context as usage over time can be volatile.","The number of inactive meters and the percentage of low-usage customers, which are indicative of the number of empty homes, declined in June versus the same period last year, but were relatively flat compared to May. Overall, our key customer metrics continue to improve, albeit more slowly than we would like.","As you recall in the first quarter, we formally filed a request for base rate increase and submitted testimony, along with extensive supporting documentation, for FPL's 2012 base rate case. We requested a base revenue increase of $516.5 million, effective the beginning of January 2013, with an additional step increase of $173.9 million when the Canaveral modernization comes into service in June 2013. Included in these amounts is our request to reset the allowed ROE to 11.25%, plus a 25-basis-point performance adder, designed to recognize FPL's excellent overall customer value, but to be maintained only so long as FPL's typical bill remains the lowest in the state.","The quality of service hearings will conclude in August, and intervenor and staff testimony have been filed. We will be submitting rebuttal testimony next week. The technical hearing will begin in late August, and we expect a staff recommendation and commission ruling on revenue requirements and rates in the fourth quarter.","The rate case, thus far, is proceeding much as we expected, with intervenor testimony and consumer sentiment in line with what we had anticipated. As we have previously stated, at its core, the rate case boils down to 3 issues: recovering the capital and operating costs for Cape Canaveral, a plant that we expect will more than pay for itself over its lifetime through fuel savings; addressing the impact of the accelerated amortization of surplus depreciation ordered by the prior commission and implemented under the 2010 rate agreement; and resetting the allowed ROE to a more reasonable level than the current 10%.","We remain open to the possibility of resolving the issues addressed in the rate case through settlement, but our focus is on preparing for the technical hearing in August. We continue to believe our superior customer value, demonstrated by award-winning customer service, high reliability and the lowest average residential bill in the state provides strong support for our request. If our request is granted, our typical residential bill is expected to remain the lowest in the state, emphasizing the affordability of our service.","In April, we updated our expected total bill impact to reflect revised estimated fuel prices, costs for ongoing construction of upgrades at our Florida nuclear facilities and adjusted data related to the requested base rate increase. Based on the April data, the base portion of a typical residential customer's bill is expected to increase by $7.09 per month or roughly $0.23 per day, while the total bill impact would be just $1.41 per month or $0.05 per day, which is lower than we initially projected. Some commercial customers are likely to see their total bills go down.","We will continue to monitor the changing bill impact throughout the rate case process if fuel prices fluctuate. Regardless of the level of fuel prices, our investments in high-efficiency generation will mean fuel savings for our customers.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2012 GAAP earnings of $251 million or $0.60 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $173 million or $0.41 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the effect of the mark on non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI.","Overall, Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted EPS increased $0.04 year-over-year, driven primarily by contributions from new additions. Earnings from existing assets declined $0.09 versus the second quarter last year, due in large part to less favorable wind resource when compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease was offset by the fact that last year's second quarter results were reduced by $0.08 from asset impairment charges. All other effects were minor, as shown in the accompanying slide.","We continue to execute on our backlog of renewables projects, with the remainder of our 1,300 megawatts of U.S. wind on track to come into service in the latter portion of the year. Our solar projects continue to make good progress with no significant changes to our expected in-service dates. In Spain, we are closely following the actions of the government but have no official word yet on a course of action.","Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the second quarter of 2012, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $607 million or $1.45 per share. NextEra Energy's 2012 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $527 million and $1.26, respectively.","The Corporate & Other segment was down $0.09 from the same quarter last year when we experienced an uplift, primarily due to consolidated income tax adjustments related to state tax law changes. Separately, our Lone Star transmission project remains on track, and we continue to expect to bring the line into full service in the spring of 2013.","As we evaluate our growth for the balance of the year and into 2013, we remain focused on maintaining solid credit metrics. As we have previously discussed, we consider our credit rating important and a competitive advantage in this market. We are committed to a strong cash position and to sourcing the right mix of financial products in order to maintain our rating.","We presented the principles underlying our approach to managing our balance sheet and credit position at our Fixed Income investor conference in May, the presentations from which are posted on our website. As stated there, both Energy Resources and FPL are in the largest investment phase either have seen in recent history, and this places stress on our balance sheet and credit metrics. We expect to continue accessing a diverse group of financial instruments to support our growth plans and maintain our balance sheet strength.","As we've noted, we expect our credit metrics to improve as we move into 2013 and 2014, but it is important to maintain our strength in 2012 as well. We expect to issue another round of equity units later in the year, although at this point, we have not determined what the aggregate amount should be. We may go above the upper end of the range of $500 million to $1 billion that we have previously disclosed. However, whatever amount we choose to issue is not expected to have a material impact on the EPS expectations that we have shared with you for 2012 and 2014.","Our development team continues to look for growth opportunities in the market, but absent additional investment, we continue to expect to be free cash flow positive in 2014. As we stated earlier this year, we are targeting a 55% dividend payout ratio in 2014 as a consequence of the mix of our portfolio continuing to shift towards more regulated and long-term contracted assets. This translates into a compound annual growth rate for dividends of approximately 10% using a 2011 base.","Separately, we have received a number of questions on differential membership interest transactions, also known as tax equity. In an effort to provide more detail around how these structures work, the benefits they provide to us and the impact on our financial statements, we have posted a presentation on our Investor Relations website. We encourage you to examine this and follow up with additional questions.","In light of the results achieved year-to-date and the progress made against our execution objectives, we see no reason to change our EPS expectations for this year or for the longer term. We continue to expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65 for 2012, and for 2014, we currently see a range of $5.05 to $5.65. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. While we have not looked as deeply at the numbers beyond 2014, we also expect to maintain our growth momentum into 2015 with continued contributions from new assets expected to come into service at both FPL and Energy Resources.","From a commodity perspective, we're highly hedged in 2015 as well. Note that our financial expectations take into account current market conditions, and we are not depending on or anticipating any great strengthening in the natural gas market. As we do each quarter, we have updated our 2012 and 2013 equivalent hedged gross margin slides for Energy Resources, and they can be found in the appendix to the presentation. There were no significant changes compared to the first quarter earnings release.","To reiterate what we've said in the past, our financial expectations do not include any additional U.S. wind build beyond 2012 due to the uncertainties surrounding the extension of the production tax credit after the end of this year. We continue to be optimistic that the PTC will reemerge in some form, following this year's election, and should that be the case, any investment in U.S. wind beyond 2012 would contribute upside to our current expectations.","Before taking your questions, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Robo. As you know, Jim assumed the CEO role at the beginning of the month, having served as Chief Operating Officer for nearly 6 years and having led Energy Resources for 4 years before that. Jim?","James L. Robo","Thanks, Moray, and good morning, everyone. It gives me great pleasure to talk to you in my new role. Moray has given you an overview of another solid quarter for our company, and I won't repeat his comments. Instead, I want to say a few words about our future.","I know a number of you have asked whether you should expect any changes in strategy under a new CEO, and I'm sure all of you will appreciate any insight I can give you into our plans for the future. The short answer to the question about strategy is that I expect our strategy to be consistent, but our implementation will need to adapt, as it has repeatedly in the past, to changes in the outside world.","At Florida Power & Light, the core of our strategy has been, for many years, to strive constantly to improve the value we deliver to our customers. Today, FPL offers its residential customers a bill that is 25% below the national average and the lowest typical bill of all 55 utilities in the state of Florida, coupled with top quartile reliability, award-winning customer service and a very clean emissions profile.","We are investing heavily in the business to ensure our value delivery gets even better over time. We expect that our investments in new generation will save customers fuel costs and improve our emissions profile, that investments in our transmission and distribution infrastructure will increase our systems resiliency and reliability and that investments in advanced meters will offer customers more feedback in control of their electricity usage, as well as make our internal procedures more efficient. If we receive fair and balanced treatment through the regulatory process, our investors will benefit along with our customers.","At Energy Resources, our strategy is not as easy to capture in a few words, but it has always reflected a balance between a steady view of a long-term vision, captured succinctly by loose terms, scale, skills, scale and scope and a pragmatic recognition that every goal in the competitive power space must be pursued opportunistically.","A decade and more of sustained effort has led to the creation of a business that is not only the largest renewable energy producer in the country but one that also contains many other business capabilities, all linked together by a strong economic logic. We will seek ways to continue to build the business, subject to the opportunity set that the external world offers us. Across both businesses, I expect us to maintain our focus on clean energy, on being low cost and on maintaining our track record of excellent execution.","In addition, underpinning our success in both our major businesses has been an important competitive weapon, our balance sheet. We have long been believers in the need for financial strength in this capital-intensive cyclical business, and I do not expect that to change.","We have also combined our financial strength with a culture of financial discipline and a commitment to strong risk management. That, too, will not change. I do not claim that we have never made mistakes nor that we never will in the future. But I do believe our discipline and risk management have served us well in the past and will continue to serve us well going forward.","As a new CEO, I consider myself very fortunate. I have been an integral part of all the major decisions of the past decade that got us to where we are today, so I understand the situation I'm presented with. Our business, overall, is in great shape, and I can concentrate immediately on 2 things: continued execution against the practical objectives listed on this slide that will see us grow out through the middle of this decade and putting in place the building blocks for new initiatives that will help us carry that growth into and through the second half of the decade.","This is not the occasion for a detailed discussion of our plans for 2016 and beyond, other than to say that we feel comfortable that the company has an attractive set of growth opportunities going forward. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you in more depth on this subject at the various conferences that some of you will be hosting in the fall and at our next investor conference, which we are tentatively scheduling for late in the year.","To close, I'd like to remind you of our track record over the last decade under Lew's leadership. During that period, we have significantly outperformed the relevant industry benchmarks, as well as the S&P 500 index and, in the process have added more than $24 billion in value, $18 billion through price appreciation and more than $6 billion through dividends. That value creation is a tribute to Lew's leadership and to the hard work of all our NextEra Energy employees.","Not the least of Lew's achievements has been the development of the team that has been responsible for delivering these results. I am fortunate to have that team with me today, ready to meet the challenges of the next decade. We are all fully committed to seeing that we continue our long-term track record of outperformance.","Thank you for your continued support of our company, and Moray and I now look forward to taking your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Dan Eggers at Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","To ask my first question is, there wasn't any changes to the backlog for wind and solar in the quarter. But could you just share a little color on opportunities you may be seeing and where the conversations are going, as far as maybe adding more solar projects over the remainder of this year into the backlog?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. Let me ask Armando to address that.","Armando Pimentel","Great. Dan, we're certainly seeing some opportunities in the market, both on a short-term basis and on a longer-term basis. I'm not ready to talk about specifics of what those might be on the short term. But on the longer-term basis, during the quarter, you did see us close on a $10 million purchase of 1,000 megawatt area out in California, which supports 4 250-megawatt sites. There's no power purchase agreement associated with those sites, but those sites do bring some very favorable transmission and resource adequacy to our portfolio. We're out looking for power purchase agreement at this point, and we're hopeful that we would have something to talk about at some point next year. In the near term, I will say that the uncertainty over production tax credits moving forward in 2013 and 2014 is creating some opportunities, both here in the U.S. and Canada, that we are taking a look at closely.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Armando, does that mean that there's people looking to sell, develop their in-process projects, or just that you're seeing people actually willing to assign contracts on things for '13 and '14?","Armando Pimentel","Actually, we're -- both. We're seeing a few opportunities of folks, some developers that have projects that have taken pretty far into the development process, but their uncertainty regarding production tax credits in 2013 and 2014 is making them seek some additional capital outside of what they have. But we're also seeing not as much, and we -- and Moray has talked about this before. We and others are building a significant amount of renewables in the U.S. in 2012. It should be a record year for the industry and a record year for us. That has certainly sapped some of the 2013 demand, even if there is an extension of the production tax credit. But we are seeing some of our customers ask for quotes and bids on 2013 and 2014 both on a contingent PTC basis and on a noncontingent PTC basis.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, Moray, just one question on tax equity. You guys said you're going to be -- start being a cash tax payer in '14. Does that mean you guys are done in the tax equity market for the time being, given the fact you have visibility now to kind of get into the excess backlog?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No, that continues to be the balance that we've talked about before that we need to strike between, essentially, the incremental cost that you pay through a differential partnership deal versus the present value benefit of pulling forward in time when you would otherwise realize tax credits. So that trade-off exists almost regardless of when you expect that cash tax position to flip around. Obviously, the closer in it is, the less valuable the tax equity power will be. But you should not assume that, that means that we won't be doing more transactions.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two things. One, just kind of a little bit of a housekeeping in Florida and then the other Spain. In Florida, did the storms that occur, I think it was late last month, have an impact on O&M? And if so, could you quantify kind of -- did it increase -- how much did it increase O&M versus kind of expectation? And then second, you made a comment, Moray, about the waiting to hear about the Spanish government regarding the project there. Can you just give a little more detail?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. On the FPL O&M, not material. On Spain, as I think many of you are aware, there have been a whole variety of proposals, is probably too strong a word, but possibilities floated around trial balloons. Some of which we believe had some basis in fact, some of which we're not sure have any basis in fact. But certainly, there are discussions about the potential for taxing the energy sector, either in aggregate or, differentially, by technology. And clearly, to the extent that our project was subject to an excise tax or something of that nature, that would affect the economics. We just don't have enough insight at this stage to know which way the government is going to go or how significant those might be. It seems pretty clear that if the impact was limited to what it needed to address the tariff deficit within the electricity sector, that could be achieved with, should we say, levels of pain that are tolerable. If the government seeks to -- really to try and attack a portion of the broader fiscal deficit on the backs of the energy sector, then that could have a different impact. So as I say, we're sort of monitoring the thing. We're staying close to it. Obviously, we are articulating our viewpoint, as is everybody else there, and we just have to wait and see.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Do you have the ability to pull back on the project if the -- I would say, the operating or the government environment for renewables there turns against you?","Moray P. Dewhurst","In principle, we always have that ability, but we're well along in construction. We still like the project. We think it's going to be a good project. So I think it would have to be a fairly extreme situation for us to sort of completely reverse course. I think what we're talking about is what is the impact on the economics, and more broadly, what's -- what is the impact on our view of Spain as a place to do business and invest for the capital in the future.","Operator","Well, next is Stephen Byrd at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wonder if you could just talk to the appetite for the development of a regional natural gas transmission pipeline. I know that's been a potential topic of discussion in the past. Just curious, in your conversations, how that's progressing.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, as we've discussed several times before, we continue to believe that there is need for-- a good case to be made for a third pipeline into Florida. I don't really have a lot to update you on. We've said before that we are optimistic that we'll be able to be in a position to come forward later in the year with more specifics. We're continuing to evaluate a bunch of different possible scenarios on that, I think getting closer to what we think makes the most sense. But I think timing is still, hopefully, later in the year for us to be more explicit about that.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. And just shifting the Texas. In your conversations in the state and with ERCOT, could you give us a sense for the degree of appetite that you see for consideration of a capacity-like mechanism to ensure that the market isn't -- is adequately incenting folks to build new plants in the state?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I'm not sure we want to mention the capacity word, but some reliability supplementary payment mechanism may be appropriate. Let me ask Armando to comment on that.","Armando Pimentel","Yes, there's been a ton of discussion obviously, and there's proposals on the table at ERCOT that folks are responding to. My sense is that the word capacity -- let's take the word out. The mechanisms that would allow payments to be made to generators, hopefully to support the generation and to bring new generation into the area, which is clearly needed in 2014, both by ERCOT's estimates and by ours estimates, that it's moving along more favorably, I'll say, than it was over the last 6 months. That doesn't mean that there's going to be a capacity market. But as Moray pointed out, we are hopeful that there will be some mechanism that recognizes that generators need an incentive in order to build new generation. So I'm hopeful that there will be changes. But in the near term, for 2013 and 2014, ERCOT is, frankly, short of capacity.","Moray P. Dewhurst","And, Stephen, let me just supplement that with -- noting that without that supplementary reliability payment, you get a market that is either very flat, as it has been so far this summer, because there really hasn't been much tightness, or a market which peaks out and induces a lot of stress for a short period of time with consequent trouble for suppliers and customers alike. We don't think that that's a very functional structure. So getting some more supplementary capacity into the market clearly would be a good thing long term for customers.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just curious on the Resources results, you called out an $8 -- it's an $0.08 -- the absence of the $0.08 impairment charge from last year is one of the drivers, I believe, in the $0.09 interest G&A and other. There seems to be like a $57 million gain on disposals in the quarter. Can you -- as well. Could you shed any light on was that one specific item or a number of items, and what's the right tax rate we should be using on that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, sure. It's a number of items. We did have a small gain, a few million dollars on the sale of a project. But the bulk of it is associated with the decommissioning funds and, actually, more than half of it, this may get a little technical, but is effectively not included in our adjusted earnings because it's an offset to OTTI that we previously took out of adjusted earnings in prior periods. In other words, we -- in a prior period, we, for GAAP purposes, marked down certain securities in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, because we didn't have substantive evidence that they would recover. But in fact, they have recovered. We have sold them now at a gain in the course of the regular management of the NDTs. And so we can't, in fairness, take a -- that gain into adjusted earnings when we took the negative, but it's now offsetting out of adjusted earnings. So more than half of that actually is netted out and is in -- is a reversal in the OTTI piece. There is a little piece that's real gains on just the normal transactions in the decommissioning trust. That's what's going on there.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So where does that reversal show up? Sorry, Moray, I'm not following that.","Moray P. Dewhurst","It shows up in the reconciliation between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings, down below in the OTTI piece. So the OTTI adjustment has a different sign than it typically has. We can follow up, take you through the numbers later on, if you like.","Operator","We'll go next to Hugh Wynne at Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I had just 2 quick questions on the Florida Power & Light side of the business. In your estimates of the base rate impact of the rate request that you put to the commission. You estimate also the savings to the customers from lower fuel cost. Can you share the expected sensitivity of customer bills to a $1 move in the price of natural gas?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I don't have that off the top of my head. We'd be happy to follow up and take a rough crack at it. I mean, it's a little hard to see because it filters through. It depends on your assumptions about the dispatch of a fleet. So typically, when we come up with these estimates, we're making up -- we're hypothetically dispatching the fleet against the forward curve, so we don't have that sort of sensitivity ready to hand. But we'll follow up with you on that.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question, regarding the target higher dividend payout ratio, which you point out is associated with a shift to a greater earnings contribution from your regulated and contracted businesses. Ordinarily there, the payout ratio, I think, is also a decision that's taken in light of the capital requirements of those businesses and the growth in their asset base. Based on '14 rate base growth, it would seem to me that longer term, there's an expectation of something like 3.5% growth in FPL rate base. But I wanted to ask you what was the assumption that you factored into that 55% dividend payout decision.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, the board feel comfortable with targeting the 55% in 2014, based fundamentally on the mix shift and a view of a range of possibilities for where we might be going beyond that. So you mentioned the 3.5% number. I don't think we have enough insight today to really know what the growth in rate base might be beyond 2014. But we felt that 55% was sufficiently conservative. That under most of the likely scenarios, we would still be able to fund the growth without having to resort too much to sort of just coming to the capital markets in order to raise capital, in order to pay the dividend, if you see what I mean. So I don't have a specific expectation going out. But I think if you look at how we derived, in essence, the 55% number, it was a function of saying, okay, what do fully regulated businesses typically pay out in terms of payout ratio, what's the range there. What sort of payout ratio is supportable by a business that is fundamentally around long-term contracts, that's obviously a lower amount, and then what's the payout ratio for a business that has merchant assets, which is essentially 0, and we then weight average those. So in a sense, it's what should be a sustainable payout ratio based on the portfolio mix as it will be in 2014. So going beyond that, if that mix itself changes radically beyond 2014, that might cause us to rethink that for future years.","Operator","We'll go next to Steven Fleishman at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just, Moray, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you might go above the high end on the equity units offering for the year. Could you just give some sense on what -- if so, what would be driving that? Is that a function of more investment opportunities that you're seeing? Is that a function of the stock price? Just...","Moray P. Dewhurst","It's more a function of the sort of tactical issues around where we're likely to come out on cash flow, making sure that we have enough liquidity through the end of the year, making sure that the cash balances are roughly where we want to be. A couple of things I would note, as we've often discussed, on the project finance side, we really like to have our projects as far along and complete and clean as they can be when we go to the project finance market, because that's how we get the best deal out of those. So given that the build here is concentrated heavily late in the year, we actually may not get to execution on some of the project finance transactions, that really are associated with the CapEx for this year, until next year. So that means we got to come up with cash in the meantime. And as I've said before, we're going to watch the 2012 metrics as well. So that's one thing. Another thing is that we have some opportunities I don't want to -- for commercial reasons, I don't want to go into details. But we have some opportunities to accelerate some capital expenditures in the year in exchange for commercial advantages, but obviously, we have to have the cash to come up with that. So that all that gets factored into the liquidity analysis and says how much cash do you need, and then obviously, you got to have a balanced mix of financing. So right now, my thinking is that we may well do another issue of comparable size to the one that we did earlier in the year. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we haven't settled on a final amount yet.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just any kind of updates on what you're seeing on -- in Washington on the PTC and I guess some of the other renewables-related legislation that has popped up?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. I don't really have a lot new to report there. There continues to be a lot of discussion. I think at the margin, the discussion is proceeding in a favorable direction, by which I mean that more people are coming to recognize that it doesn't make good economic sense to cut the PTC off 100% instantly. At the same time, as I've also said many times before, we do see a strong political view to the effect that there have to be a definite end in sight for this kind of support, and that's a concept that we have indicated publicly that we can accept. Obviously, the devil is in the details. So I think we're making progress on the discussion. But we continue to believe that we're not likely to see anything really happen until after the election, and that this is just one small part of a much broader set of discussions and compromises that, again, have to be worked out after the election, so not a lot new.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Patterson in Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just back to Jonathan's question, just to make sure that I understand this. The $57 million of dispositions is not an adjusted earnings for the most part. Is that correct?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. I would say roughly a little over half is out of adjusted earnings and a little less than half is in.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on the tax equity market, any thoughts we should have with respect to the tax equity market and the fiscal cliff, so to speak, for all these sort of tax adjustments that might potentially occur? Just -- could you give us any feeling for what's happening in that market, and what the outlook is there?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, there continues to be an active market. I can't say that the prospect of comprehensive tax reform, at least, to date, has had significant impact on the market, although that doesn't mean it couldn't in the future. So really, they're kind of separate questions at the moment. I think there's a high degree of skepticism about whether comprehensive tax reform really will occur, or if so, on what timeframe. And so at least at the moment, it hasn't had a real impact on the tax equity market.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then finally, the situation in Spain, just to sort of put it in perspective. What is there the total exposure? I mean, I don't mean to be cataclysmic or anything. But when you read what you're hearing coming out of what the situation is in Spain, just for investors, how much is the total exposure-- if the situation were to get untenable? Just how much exposure do you have in Spain as an investor there?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, our equity commitment to the project is roughly EUR 300 million, but the rest has been borrowed on a nonrecourse basis against the project in euros. So ultimately, our equity commitment is of that order of magnitude. And you can figure out, obviously, by applying whatever reasonable ROE you want to that, what the potential range of earnings impact is. But that's what we're talking about.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And then no guarantee.","Moray P. Dewhurst","I want to emphasize, at least, on everything we're hearing to date, we don't think the project is fundamentally threatened. We think the issue is around what are ultimately going to be the returns on the project.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Sure. I just wanted to get sort of sense as to -- just to put it in perspective.","Operator","We'll move next to Jay Dobson at Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but Moray, just following up on the Spain question. If I recall, there were some carve-outs in the financing that's sort of handed or pushed a little of this political risk, to sort of broadly calling it that, to the debt side of the equation. And I don't remember exactly how it works, but if you could remind us how that works. And then just with your best view, I know this is moving around a little bit, sort of how that might play into something that didn't, as you point out, fundamentally sort of eliminate the project but more challenge the economics.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. I don't want to play amateur lawyer here, so I'm going to sort of simplify things pretty significantly. But the financing is -- protects us against change in tariff risk, simply put. So if there's fundamentally a change in the tariff, then the banks share in that risk. To the extent that what the government ends up talking about or imposing is simply a tax that's kind of consistent with what's already on the books or is an adjustment to an existing tax that would presumably not be a complete change in the tariff. To the extent that it was extreme, you might well argue that it was a change in tariff. So I think that's what we're talking about. Again, I think the -- realistically, we're trying to figure out what level of tax there is going to be, and hence, what the impact on the returns from the project would be. And again, I would just emphasize that, at least, our take on the numbers is that the government can solve the problem that they have with the electricity sector tariff deficit through the imposition, broadly, on the energy sector of taxes that would not have a materially negative impact on ours or many other projects in which people have committed billions of euros. But to the extent that they want to try and use this as an opportunity to help address the broader fiscal deficit that they're dealing with, then that's a different matter.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And how much of the EUR 300 million of your equity has been committed to date or actually funded?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think we're -- I mean, 75%, 80%. I mean, we're well along in construction. Construction's proceeding very well. We're on target for delivering those units next year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Andy Bischof at Morningstar Financial Services.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I do have one follow-up question to the solar development in California that you purchased. Given an optimistic scenario of if you sign a PPA in 2013, could you put a possible timeframe on when you expect that development to be operational? I'm just trying to get a handle of the CapEx and when you would be spending that amount.","Armando Pimentel","Realistically, it wouldn't be before 2016, and it probably could slip beyond 2016 under some scenarios. And total CapEx would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $800 million to $900 million for one 250-megawatt project. And in the near term, I'd say that the better likelihood for modeling purposes would be one 250-megawatt project. Certainly, we would love to build out that entire 1,000-megawatt facility. But right now, I wouldn't plan on anything other than 250 in the models.","Operator","And we'll go to Ashar Khan at Visium Asset Management.","Ashar Khan","Can I just ask what's happening on the Seabrook? If -- I guess if I read today, even just running at 85%, when do you expect that to come back to 100%?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. No update on Seabrook. It continues to run a little bit below full output because of the derate associated with general cooling limits. It will continue to do so through the next outage, which is scheduled for some time in the third quarter. I think it's September. So that -- I think we previously discussed the full year impact of that being reflected in the numbers. There's really been no change.","Ashar Khan","Okay. And then, Moray, can I just ask, based on the results year-to-date, it seems like you're running at least ahead of -- at least towards the top end of the range. Is that a fair thing to say that you're running a little bit ahead of, I guess, where plan would be or to indicating to a top end of the range for the year?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No, I wish that were the case. But I think right now, we're sort of right in the middle of -- it was very consistent with where we expected to be. Obviously, there's always puts and takes that'll just go one way or another. But as I say, I don't see any reason to change the range for the year, and we could end up in a variety of places in that range. We still feel pretty good about the year. But I will say that it's a very, very tough environment for the Energy Resources folks, any asset or piece of the business that's exposed to competitive market. It's just a tough market environment. So having to work very hard, as I say, scratch and claw every penny that they can get from the businesses, it's not a great market environment. But despite that, we're doing pretty well. So we're certainly pleased with where we are at this stage.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Moray P. Dewhurst","No, thank you for being with us this morning.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Amanda Finnis. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Amanda Finnis","Thank you, Amelia. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2016 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources and Mark Hickson, Senior Vice President of NextEra Energy; all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company.

Before I begin my remarks on our third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Matthew. As you know residents of the Caribbean and South-Eastern US were recently impacted by the severe effects of this dangerous and deadly storm. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been impacted by Hurricane Matthew's widespread destruction. Since 2006, FPL has invested more than $2 billion to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid. Earlier this month when Hurricane Matthew affected FPL's service territory along Florida's East Coast, these investments benefited customers by resulting in fewer outages and faster restoration. In response to the hurricane, FPL deployed more resources pre-storm than ever before, which, together with its grid investments, enabled the company to restore service to 98.7% of the 1.2 million affected customers by the end of the second full day after the storm left our service territory. At the height of restoration, FPL's workforce numbered 15,000, including our own employees along with workers from contracting companies and our partner utilities across the country. I would like to personally thank each member of this team for their dedicated service during this critical period for our customers.","In addition, earlier today NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC\u2019s approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery for total cash consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment, LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million. If approved, these transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy\u2019s previously announced merger with Energy Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. I will provide additional details on this announcement after reviewing our financial results.","Turning now to our financial performance, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners delivered strong third quarter results and, building upon solid progress made in the first half of the year, we remain well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2016. NextEra Energy\u2019s third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9% from the prior-year comparable period, primarily reflecting contributions from continued investments at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. Equally as important, both principal businesses executed well on our major initiatives and it was a period of continued advancement in our opportunity set for new renewables. At FPL, pursuing a balanced outcome in our base rate case to support continued execution of our successful strategy for customers remains a core focus. Since the last call, we completed the technical hearing for the case and, after months of negotiation, we are pleased to have reached, with three intervenors, what we believe is a fair and constructive, long-term settlement agreement that will allow us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently and reliably for the benefit of customers.","A one-day hearing was held last Thursday to consider the proposed settlement agreement. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to vote on our agreement at their agenda conference on November 29th. Our major capital initiatives progressed well and we were pleased to receive Commission approval on our proposal to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility. I will provide additional details on these updates, as well as FPL\u2019s solid financial performance during the third quarter, in just a moment. At Energy Resources, contributions from new investments were the principal driver of growth and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new contracted renewables projects in 2016. We continue to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities, and it was an excellent period of new project origination.","Since the last call, I am pleased to report that our development organization has added almost 2,000 megawatts of renewables projects for post-2016 delivery to our backlog, including approximately 600 megawatts of new wind projects and roughly 1,300 megawatts of additional repowering opportunities within Energy Resources\u2019 existing US wind portfolio. We continue to conduct due diligence to identify the full opportunity set, and I will provide our latest thoughts on our expectations for repowering projects later in the call.","Energy Resources\u2019 continued ability to expand its pipeline of growth opportunities is expected to benefit NEP. Since the last call, NEP completed its third major acquisition this year from Energy Resources with the addition of an approximately 132 megawatt share of high-quality, long-term contracted solar generation. We continue to believe that the scale, financial strength, experience and track record of its best-in-class sponsor are what set NEP apart from other infrastructure alternatives. This acquisition is also another example of why NEP is important to NextEra Energy, as it highlights the value of the Energy Resources\u2019 contracted renewables portfolio, enables the recycling of capital from operating assets back into development projects, and enhances NextEra Energy\u2019s tax efficiency. NEP continued its strong year-to-date financial performance, delivering third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in line with our expectations.","The NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.34125 per common unit or $1.365 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 26% from a year earlier. Overall, with three strong quarters now behind us, we are well positioned for the year and are very pleased with the progress we are making at both NEE and NEP. Now let\u2019s look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $515 million and earnings per share of $1.11, up $0.04 per share year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by 8.6% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL\u2019s net income growth. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended September 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period.","We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a balance of $71 million and, due to higher base revenues driven by weather-related usage and customer growth, we reversed $159 million of reserve amortization in the third quarter. We believe the remaining reserve amortization balance of $230 million, coupled with our current CapEx and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a year-end regulatory ROE of 11.5%, which is the upper end of the current allowed range. Based on what we see right now, we are likely to end the year with a positive reserve amortization balance, which, under the terms of the proposed 2016 rate agreement, we would be able to utilize over the next four years. Earlier this month, we were pleased to receive approval from the Florida Public Service Commission on our proposal to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility, a 330 megawatt coal-fired power plant that has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. With an expected closing date for the transaction in early 2017, we plan to purchase the ownership interest in the facility for $451 million, including existing debt.","Similar to the acquisition of Cedar Bay that we closed in the third quarter of 2015, the transaction is expected to enable early retirement of one of the highest greenhouse gas emitting power plants in the state while also providing estimated customer savings of $129 million. In addition, construction has continued to progress well on FPL\u2019s three 74.5 megawatt utility scale solar PV projects that we expect to enter service this year. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce the completed installation of half of the 1 million new solar panels that will comprise these new solar energy centers. Once complete, these projects will roughly triple the solar capacity on FPL\u2019s system and add to the overall fuel diversity of our fleet, which is important for FPL and its customers.","Consistent with our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers, the proposed 2016 rate agreement, if approved, allows FPL to recover in rates up to an incremental 1,200 megawatts of cost-effective new solar generation approved over the four year term of 2017 through 2020. This would allow Florida customers to benefit from favorable tax incentives, cost declines and efficiency improvements in solar technology that, together, make universal solar a cost-effective source of energy for our customers. The Florida economy remains healthy. The state\u2019s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 4.7% is below the national rate and Florida\u2019s annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation\u2019s rate since 2012. The latest readings of Florida\u2019s Consumer Sentiment have remained close to post-recession highs.","FPL\u2019s third quarter retail sales increased 4% from the prior-year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 3.2% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 0.8%. Continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% was partially offset by a decline of 0.6% in weather-normalized usage per customer. Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to average between zero and negative 0.5% per year for the foreseeable future. FPL was impacted by Hurricane Hermine in September 2016 and Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of storm restoration costs is currently approximately $350 million. Prior to the storms, FPL\u2019s storm and property insurance reserve had the capacity to absorb approximately $112 million in additional storm restoration costs.","The remaining balance of the storm restoration costs not covered by the reserve will be deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on FPL\u2019s balance sheet. Under the 2012 rate agreement, beginning 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the FPSC, FPL is authorized to recover the remaining balance of the storm restoration costs on an interim basis from customers through surcharges, plus an additional $117 million to replenish the reserve to the level authorized by the 2012 rate agreement. Interim recovery is available for costs that in total for the calendar year do not exceed $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt-hours of usage on monthly residential bills based on a 12-month recovery period. FPL intends to file a petition with the FPSC in the fourth quarter of 2016 to seek interim recovery of storm restoration costs under this mechanism.","As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15th for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. The proceeding has encompassed an extensive evidentiary process and during the quarter, we completed the technical hearing for the case and subsequently submitted our post-hearing brief in mid-September. After months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early October with three of the intervenors in the proceeding; the Office of Public Counsel, the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association, and the Florida Retail Federation. The four-year proposed agreement beginning January 2017 and ending December 2020 provides for retail base revenue adjustments as shown in the accompanying slide and an allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.55% with a range of 9.60% to 11.60% and no change to our equity ratio from investor sources.","The proposed agreement also includes the flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1 billion of depreciation reserve surplus, plus any reserve amount remaining at the end of this year under FPL\u2019s 2012 rate agreement. As I mentioned earlier, the proposed agreement also provides for solar base rate adjustments or SoBRA, upon commercial operations of up to 300 megawatts annually of new solar generation, subject to a cost cap of $1,750 per kilowatt and a showing of overall cost-effectiveness for FPL\u2019s customers. We expect our regulatory capital employed to be consistent with our rate case filing plus any incremental solar investment opportunities we move forward with under the SoBRA if approved by the Commission. Under the proposed agreement, FPL would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs consistent with the framework in the current settlement agreement. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt-hour of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge to recover the amount above $400 million.","The proposed agreement also authorizes a continuation, with minor modification, of the Incentive Mechanism for sharing with customers the gains that we achieve in excess of a threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities, and introduces a 50 megawatt battery storage pilot program designed to enhance service for customers or operations of solar facilities. FPL has agreed to not seek incremental recovery of the revenue requirements associated with the battery storage pilot program until its next general base rate case. We believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive, and supports our continued ability to provide clean, highly reliable, low-cost service for our customers through the end of the decade.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $307 million, or $0.66 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $279 million, or $0.60 per share. Energy Resources\u2019 contribution to third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased $0.11 or approximately 22% from the prior-year comparable period. New investments added $0.27 per share, including $0.14 from continued growth in our contracted renewables portfolio. Contributions from new investments in natural gas pipelines were $0.13 per share, including a positive $0.09 impact resulting from a reduction in the contingent earn-out liability that was recorded as part of the Texas Pipelines acquisition last year. The earn-out, which was originally recorded at roughly $200 million, is required to be paid if contracts for growth projects on the NET Mexico pipeline are signed by December 31, 2016 and if those expansion projects meet several precedent conditions. Recently, NET Mexico completed a non-binding open season. While the results of that open season were encouraging in terms of capacity expansion on the pipeline, we are still in the process of evaluating the responses and are having discussions with potential shippers over precedent agreements.","However, based on the information we have to date, we no longer believe that the full $200 million will be payable. We will have a more detailed update in the fourth quarter earnings call, as we move to sign capacity agreements with the parties that have expressed an interest in new capacity. The NET Mexico pipeline remains well positioned as it has one of the lowest capacity payments of any pipe serving the growing Mexican market from the US. We remain confident that the Texas Pipelines asset, which is owned by NEP, will deliver on its adjusted EBITDA and CAFD growth expectations that we outlined at the time of the acquisition. Partially offsetting the positive contribution from natural gas pipelines was a $0.09 per share decline in contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities, primarily due to lower commodity prices and increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates. On an annual basis we would expect the $0.09 cents to be roughly $0.15 for the full-year 2016. The contribution from existing generation assets declined by $0.02 per share, partly reflecting the sale of the Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets earlier in the year, net of interest expense.","Fleet-wide wind resource was 100% of the long term average during the quarter. All other impacts reduced results by $0.05 per share, including the effects of increased interest expense reflecting continued growth in the business and share dilution. We remain enthusiastic about the fundamentals for North American renewables growth driven by the continued execution of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital, and cost of capital advantages. As you may recall, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the wind PTC over a five-year phase down period was further enhanced earlier this year by IRS guidance on start of construction. In addition to the four year start of construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities. Among other things, the guidance provides for an 80\/20 Rule by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for a new ten-year PTC period, if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbine\u2019s total value.","Following our announcement on the last call that we are pursuing repowering opportunities at two of our existing Texas wind projects, the team has continued to conduct due diligence on our existing portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, today we are announcing plans to pursue additional repowering opportunities for roughly 1,300 megawatts to be completed in the 2017-2018 timeframe. We expect to invest approximately $875 million of capital to complete these repowering projects, and earnings from the projects are expected to be comparable to similar new build opportunities with significantly less capital investment. Based on everything we see now, and inclusive of today\u2019s announcement and the announcement from our last call, we expect this opportunity set to continue to grow to support a total of at least $2.0 to $2.5 billion of capital deployment opportunities for repowerings over the next four years, with a greater portion of incremental opportunities expected to become actionable beyond 2018.","In addition to our plans to repower certain of our existing wind generation facilities, I am also pleased to report continued strong customer demand for wind. Since the last call, we signed contracts for roughly 600 megawatts of new wind projects, including approximately 500 megawatts for post-2018 delivery. The attached chart updates additional details on where our renewables development program now stands. Together with the repowering opportunities that I just mentioned, we remain comfortable with the overall ranges we have discussed for 2017 and 2018. The development activities for our natural gas pipeline projects remain on track. The Florida pipelines received FERC notice to proceed in August and have commenced full construction activities. We continue to expect an in-service date in mid-2017. As a reminder, NextEra Energy\u2019s investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million, respectively, and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines. The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process. We continue to expect approximately 2.0 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. NextEra Energy\u2019s expected investment is roughly $1 billion.","Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were $174 million and $51 million, respectively, and strong contributions from new assets remained the principal driver of growth from the prior-year comparable period. In addition, existing assets benefited from a favorable year-over-year comparison of overall wind and solar resource. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $10 million from the prior-year comparable quarter. NEP has executed well against its growth objectives, highlighted by strong access to equity and debt markets. During September, NEP was able to sell to the underwriters, at the time of announcement, the full block of limited partnership units to be issued in connection with the acquisition of a partial interest in the Desert Sunlight Solar Energy Center. This issuance, which raised approximately $297 million, was completed at a lower offering discount and lower trading yield than the prior February offering, and demonstrated yet another source of capital for NEP as we were able to access the retail market for approximately 75% of the issuance.","In late September, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option, which allowed NEP to raise another $45 million. NEP continues to target a long-term capital structure utilizing holdco leverage of approximately 3.5 times project distributions after project debt service and, based on this metric, we estimate our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $450 to $550 million. Looking ahead, together with our at-the-market dribble program, we expect this debt capacity to allow NEP to continue to be flexible and opportunistic as to future growth opportunities and financing activities.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the third quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $753 million or $1.62 per share. NextEra Energy\u2019s 2016 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $809 million and $1.74 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate & other segment decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2015. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, earlier today NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC\u2019s approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery for merger consideration of approximately $2.4 billion.","In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million. If approved, these transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy\u2019s previously announced transaction with Energy Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. The total transaction consideration implies an enterprise value for Oncor of $18.7 billion. Under the terms of the TTHC merger agreement, NextEra Energy will pay TTHC 100% of the merger consideration in cash. As a result of the transaction, no debt will reside at TTHC or Texas Transmission investment upon close of the merger. We expect to fund the merger consideration through a combination of debt and equity, consistent with our commitment to maintaining NextEra Energy\u2019s strong balance sheet and credit ratings. We believe the transaction further affirms NextEra Energy\u2019s commitment to Oncor, its customers in the state of Texas.","As a reminder, NextEra Energy previously announced on July 29 a proposed transaction with Energy Future Holdings that would result in NextEra Energy owning approximately 80% of Oncor Electric delivery. The definitive agreement is part of an overall plan of reorganization designed to allow Energy Future Holdings to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. During the quarter, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the district of Delaware approved EFH\u2019s entry into the merger agreement and we were also pleased to achieve additional credit support for the EFH transaction. Although there is inherent uncertainty involved with the bankruptcy process, we currently expect a creditor vote in confirmation hearing in the fourth quarter in order to be in a position to receive bankruptcy court confirmation of the plan of reorganization by the end of the year.","Separate from the bankruptcy approval process, together with Oncor, we look forward to filing by November 1, our joint application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas, seeking approval of our proposed acquisition. Based on our current targets for completing key milestones, and subject to required approvals, we expect the transactions to close in the first half of 2017.","If approved, the transactions with EFH, TTHC and OMI, which would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor are expected to be meaningfully accretive to earnings, enabling NextEra Energy to grow at or near the top end of it\u2019s previously announced 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share growth rate through 2018, off a 2014 base. Through the transactions, we see an opportunity to make two already great companies even stronger.","In addition, we expect that Oncor\u2019s credit rating will be improved post-closing, generating real savings for customers in terms of lower borrowing costs. NextEra shares Oncor\u2019s commitment to providing affordable and reliable electric service, and providing high-quality customer service for the benefit of Oncor\u2019s customers and the continued economic growth of the state. We believe the transactions are beneficial for all key stakeholders, including the state of Texas and Oncor\u2019s customers, the creditors of the EFH bankruptcy estate, and NextEra Energy\u2019s shareholders.","Setting aside the potential for accretion that we see with our proposed Oncor transaction, we continue to expect 2018 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10, implying a compound annual growth rate off our 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08.","For this year, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35. Within this range, it is worth noting that we believe that we are well positioned to achieve results for 2016 towards the top end of our 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share expectations, again off our 2014 base of $5.30. We hope to be in a position to provide longer-term expectations at an investor conference this spring, following the resolution of the FPL rate proceeding and required milestones in the Oncor approval process. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.","Let me now turn to NEP. From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2017.","The December 31, 2016 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $670 million to $760 million and CAFD of $230 million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016.","Today, we are introducing December 31, 2017 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million and CAFD of $310 million to $340 million, reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2017. The midpoint of this CAFD range reflects roughly 25% growth from the comparable CAFD mid-point based on our December 31, 2016 run rate expectations. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.","In summary, both NEE and NEP delivered excellent third quarter results and we are pleased with the progress we have made on all of our major initiatives. At FPL, we continue to focus on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do. At Energy Resources, we have made terrific progress on our development program and continue to feel optimistic about our renewables growth prospects and the quality of our renewables pipeline. For NEP, renewable origination success at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of potential drop-down assets, and NEP has excess debt capacity to enable it to be flexible and opportunistic regarding future growth. Overall, we continue to believe that we have one of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in our industry.","That concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Hi, good morning. So I wanted to touch on what you, John had mentioned about repowering opportunities, very pleased to see the magnitude of that. I just wanted to make sure I understood your commentary correctly. You were indicating that essentially the capital costs would be lower than the new build which certainly makes sense, but the return would be essentially, as if we are at new build investment levels, so therefore it looks like a relatively attractive return on capital, did I get that right?","John Ketchum","You got that right, so the CapEx is roughly half of the new build and the return is superior to new build transaction.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, great. And in terms of just the kinds of steps you need to go through to actually get these repowerings done, how should we think about execution risk, counterparty negotiations, how much is required in terms of counterparty negotiations, what sort of things we would be thinking about in terms of execution risk?","John Ketchum","Well, on the execution side, we have to negotiate with our counterparties. Some of those counterparty negotiations will include a blend and extend of the existing agreement, but given that the CapEx is again roughly half of the CapEx for new build, and returns are a bit higher, there is a little bit of room for those negotiation with counterparties. That's one of the main execution risks that we have. We also have to study the interconnection agreements to make sure that to the extent we\u2019re providing additional capacity that we have the ability to put that additional capacity online. Those are the main execution risks around the repowering opportunities.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, understood. And you\u2019re laying out 2 billion to 2.5 billion of capital deployment opportunities, so we can sort of do the math to look at the total megawatts involved then I guess?","John Ketchum","That's correct.","Stephen Byrd","Okay. Sorry, and just one last question, and then I\u2019ll get back in the queue. We've seen a number of companies announce their interest in becoming big in wind, we saw one company this morning lay that out. I'm just curious if you could, at a high-level, speak to competitive trends you\u2019re seeing, the kinds of barriers to entry that you see from your perspective, given you\u2019ve been one of the biggest players in wind for a very long time, I'm interested in your perspective on that?","John Ketchum","Sure, Stephen. I'm going to turn that question over to Jim.","Jim Robo","So, Stephen, we've had competitors in this business for 15 years. They've come, they've gone, there is no one in this industry that has the greenfield capabilities that we do, plenty of folks who have -- plenty of folks lay out the fact that they want to be in the wind business and really what they\u2019re in is they are in the wind development project acquisition business at COD, which is frankly not really being in the wind business. Being in the wind business 70% or 80% of the value creation is in the organic development, the Greenfield development of those projects, and there is no one in the industry that has the pipeline that we do, that has the team that we do and the year in and year out track record. I don't, I worry about a lot of things, that's one of the, that\u2019s like very, very low in my list of things that I worry about.","Stephen Byrd","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Tucker from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matt Tucker","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to ask a few questions about the holdco debt capacity at NEP. I guess first, just curious what kind of changed since you provided an estimate. I think when you announced Desert Sunlight, that was about 75 million lower. I appreciate the math illustration you provided in the slides, but just wasn't clear what changed there. And then just how should we be thinking about how you\u2019re going to look to utilize this debt capacity. Is the target something that you\u2019d look to reach over the next 12 to 18 months, over the next few transactions or how much cushion would you like to kind of leave there for potential periods where you really don't feel like you can access equity and want to continue to make acquisitions?","John Ketchum","Yes. So a few things. On the holdco debt capacity, remember that we\u2019ve financed our July dropdown with largely debt. We then went ahead and equitized the September drop. The cash purchase price for Desert Sunlight was $218 million. We raised about $341 million in equity, which allowed us to pay down our revolver. That really was the main contribution to the additional holdco debt capacity to get us to 450 to 550. In terms of the cushion on debt capacity, I really think that puts us in an opportunistic and flexible position as to how we time future dropdown opportunities and as to how we finance those opportunities. So we will see how things progress in terms of the capital markets going forward, but that does give us flexibility. Also, you got to remember with wind assets, when we drop the wind assets in, you can think the leverage, about the leverage from tax equity being right around 45% to 55%. So we are dropping those out, so it\u2019s down, they\u2019re naturally creating additional holdco debt capacity at the NEP level.","Matt Tucker","Thanks, that's very helpful. And then lastly just your thoughts on the current wind outlook, are we completely past El Nino, are we seeing La Nina, just what you\u2019re kind of seeing over the next 6 to 12 months or however far your outlook is?","John Ketchum","Well, it's tough to look out 12 months and really come up with what an accurate forecast might look like, but certainly we saw return to normal with our third quarter results. So we will see how the fourth quarter progresses.","Matt Tucker","Thanks, guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys. Two quick questions. One on the new contracted wind that is not repowerings, I noticed the 100 megawatts in \u201817 and \u201818, and then 500 is post \u201818, should we anticipate that most of what you do on the backlog is going to be longer dated going forward here or is that just -- these are the nature of some of these deals you signed this quarter, because I know you talked about being unsure whether tax credit extensions were going to push things a little bit out?","Armando Pimentel","Hi, Jonathan. It\u2019s Armando. I wouldn't read too much into that. It is just really the pace of negotiations. What I can say is that there is a lot of activity going on right now for both \u201817 and \u201818 and \u201819 and \u201820 in the contracting market. These two came in kind of at the right time for 2019. But I wouldn't read too much into that other than just timing.","Jonathan Arnold","There you\u2019ve got things, irons in the fire still for \u201917 and \u201918?","Armando Pimentel","Yes, absolutely. We still feel comfortable with the guidance for the expectations that we have provided to you and we reaffirmed today for \u201817, \u201818.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. And then just, you obviously had a strong third quarter. Last time you spoke publicly, I think you were talking down the second half a little bit versus the first half in terms of growth, and we have you at about 617 trailing 12 earnings. And I was curious why the guidance range, you didn\u2019t take up the low end or is -- are there some challenges in Q4 that we should be thinking about or it feels like you\u2019re tracking pretty well on the year?","John Ketchum","Yes. Jonathan, we did have a good third quarter, but with the fourth quarter, we still do expect the growth to drop off a bit compared to what we saw with 2015 and we are targeting again to be at the upper end of our 6% to 8% range is the way to think about how we will finish the fourth quarter and the full year.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. So you talked about some tax timing issues in the second half, is that more a Q4 item there or is that still?","John Ketchum","There were some tax timing issues that had benefited the earlier part of the year. That's a part of it. There are some other smaller things as well, not any one thing worth calling out or mentioning.","Jonathan Arnold","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.","Colin Rusch","Thanks so much. I've got two questions. Can you just give us a bit more detail on what's in, the receivable do from a related party at NEP? And then secondly, with the wind repowering opportunity, given the pretty dramatic price declines and battery storage with companies like LG and Tesla offering insulations below $400 a kilowatt hour now, how are you seeing that opportunity change and is there a meaningful [indiscernible] opportunity that you guys are seeing right now.","Jim Robo","Yes. On the dual formulated party for NEP, recall that NextEra Energy provides credit support to NEP, but as part of that credit support arrangement, NextEra energy has the right to benefit from the cache sweeps by taking cash out of those accounts, which it has an obligation to put back in for the benefit of NEP. So that's what the dual formulated parties is. On the battery question, I will defer to Armando.","Armando Pimentel","So we've been talking about batteries now I think for a couple of years and we keep saying that we would expect batteries to be a significant investment opportunity for us sometime earlier in the next decade and it\u2019s tracking based on where we thought our expectations would be. We have roughly currently, well, I\u2019m going to say, about 10 projects, 10 battery projects across the US and Canada, a little bit different technology in each one, but these are fairly small investments that we are making in battery storage, somewhere in the neighborhood of $6 million to $15 million is a potential average for each one of those investments.","Whether it\u2019s Teslo as you mentioned or whether it\u2019s other estimates that you and us have seen, I mean battery storage will continue to come down significantly through this decade and we continue to believe that at some point in the next decade, I don\u2019t know whether it will be earlier or whether it will be later, but battery storage will be commercially viable. The costs will come down enough and you will be able to strap it on with renewable technology, whether it\u2019s wind or more likely solar and have a very competitive project in the renewable energy space.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. So I had one follow-up on the repowerings, so how does the 50% reduction of CapEx versus new build reconcile with the IRS requirement that is an 80% increase in the value of the turbine?","Armando Pimentel","You can't do that reconciliation, Angie. It\u2019s Armando, the way that the 80-20 works is obviously for others on the phone, if you were to go out and completely tear down a wind project and start over, you\u2019d get PTCs on the new investment. Well, the IRS guidance allows you to do a whole bunch of work on those wind projects and 80% of the value that you are putting in. If you meet the 80% test, the entire investment qualifies as new production tax credits. It's based on a fair value method though, not based on a cost method. So when John answered the question before that it\u2019s a lot less capital for repowering opportunities and the economic returns are just as good or better, he was talking about the costs that was going into the wind project, not about the 80-20 test.","Jim Robo","So, Angie, this is Jim. Simply said, it's not 80% of the new build cost, it's 80% of the, whatever you think the value of the existing asset is, and the existing has been typically depreciated by 10 or 11 or 12 years. So it's -- what you\u2019re trying to do is apples and oranges.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And then all of the purchases that are going to be repowered or considered repowering targets have PPA, so there would be no merchant repowering?","Armando Pimentel","Actually, Angie, all of the projects that we announced today that we\u2019re moving forward on, on the repowering side are all projects that we have long-term hedges on. We have not announced any repowering of projects that have power purchase agreements. So when John mentioned that our expectation that this could be a $2 billion to $2.5 billion program, virtually all of the remaining opportunities that we\u2019re looking at are under power purchase agreements and therefore we would have to have discussions with the counterparty as John mentioned earlier to make sure that we can move forward on those. I feel comfortable that we would move forward on a vast majority of those and that's why we gave CapEx guidance on the total program today.","Angie Storozynski","Okay, thank you. And the last question on NEP, so I understand that you have the corporate debt capacity you can use to finance growth, but as you -- you\u2019re the only one really with active IDRs among yield co and those IDRs require simply more and more assets to be dropped down in order to meet this 12% to 15% growth in distribution per share for LP holders and as such basically your funding requirements are growing quite considerably, as you move to high spreads. Would you consider doing away with IDRs in case there is no recovery in the liquidity in the yield co market on the equity side or do you feel like between co-financing via NextEra or private placements, you can actually price that asset to achieve the growth and pay IDRs?","Armando Pimentel","Angie, the way we look at it, I think the first thing to look at when you\u2019re dealing with a yield co like ours, with a strong sponsor is how many projects, I mean, what's the pipeline at the sponsor to be able to drop down projects, do you have a long pipeline of opportunities to be able to drop down into in this case, NextEra Energy partners, because if you have that, the current economics certainly work. There are, you talked about holdco debt capacity at the beginning of your discussion. I hope it\u2019s clear, I think we've made it clear that we will not be reaching at least our preliminary holdco debt capacity target in 2017.","We are slowly increasing the debt capacity at NextEra Energy Partners, so by the end of 2018, at least preliminarily, we believe that we would get to the holdco debt capacity, which gives us, in this market, a tremendous amount of flexibility as to when to be able to raise equity and when to be able to raise additional holdco debt capacity. I think it's just too early in the life of NextEra Energy Partners to really start talking about what we\u2019re going to do in the future with IDRs.","We feel comfortable with the way NextEra Energy Partners is working right now, it brings a lot of benefits to NextEra Energy. We\u2019re certainly not comfortable with where it\u2019s trading. I don't think any management team is ever comfortable with where their units are trading, but we feel confident that we, at NextEra Energy, will be able to have a sufficient number of projects for a sufficient number of time in order for NextEra Energy Partners to be successful long-term.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Yes. I just had one follow-up, in terms of the market for tax equity tax appetite, I wondered if you could just give a commentary in terms of high-level overall access, your position there, just your take on the state of monetizing tax attributes?","John Ketchum","Yes. We have seen the tax equity market for our projects continue to hang in there, Stephen. We've seen no issues. I mean of the things that we try to do going into any one year is estimate the amount of tax equity needs that we will have and then we allocate those to our tax equity providers going into the year. So really, it has not been an issue for us with regard to our projects.","Operator","And with no further questions in the queue, that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"15391":["NextEra Energy, Inc.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Amanda Finnis - Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Clair. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2016 Combined Earnings Conference Call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners.","With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; and Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factor section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our website, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com.

Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners each delivered strong second quarter financial results and solid operating performance. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased 7% against the prior year comparable quarter, driven by new investments and energy resources. For the first six months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth of 11% in both adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. NEP grew per unit distributions by 40% from a year earlier and added to what we already considered to be a solid run rate with the acquisition of two high quality wind facilities just after the end of quarter.","Both businesses remain on track to achieve the full year financial expectations that we had previously discussed subject to our usual caveats.","Florida Power & Light's contribution to second quarter earnings per share was roughly flat, down $0.01 from 2015. Strong growth driven by continued investment in the business was offset by share dilution and a refund to customers related to the decision by the Florida Supreme Court to disallow investments in long-term natural gas supplies. Aside from the impact of this decision, we are very pleased with FPL's financial results.","We earned a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5%, and average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 8.4% over the same quarter last year, reflecting our continued commitment to invest new capital to deliver low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.","Along these lines, during the quarter, we announced a plan to acquire and phase-out one of the state's highest greenhouse gas emitting coal fire plants located in Morton County, which is expected to result in significant customer savings and substantial reductions in carbon emissions. In addition, we received site certification for the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center that is expected to enter service in mid 2019. Earlier this month, FPL was honored to receive the J.D. Power Award for ranking highest in residential customer satisfaction among large utilities in the South. We work hard to continue to improve service for our customers and are proud that FPL's 2016 score is our highest ever in the study's history. As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15 for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following an expiration of our current settlement agreement. And I will provide an update on the proceedings thus far in just a moment.","Energy Resources continued to benefit from strong contributions from new investments, and this was the principal driver of second quarter growth. We remain poised for another big installation year at Energy Resources and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of approximately 2,500 megawatts of new contractor renewables projects in 2016.","If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolio will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year.","During the quarter, the IRS provided start of construction guidance for the Wind PTC. The guidance provides for a start of construction Safe Harbor of up to four years increased from the two-year Safe Harbor formally put in place for the 2014 PTC. While there is some uncertainty on the impact of timing of customer demand as a result of this increased tenure, we believe that the longer-term impact further strengthens what we already consider to be one of the best environments for renewables development in our history.","In addition, the IRS also provided guidance for the repowering of wind projects, and we are pleased to announce that we are currently pursuing repowering opportunities at two of our existing Texas wind projects for roughly 327 megawatts to be completed by the end of 2017. We continue to believe that the longer-term fundamentals for North American renewables growth have never been stronger and that the capabilities of our development organization together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantage place us in an excellent strategic position to capture even more opportunities going forward.","NextEra Energy Partners portfolio additions over the last year drove substantial growth in cash available for distribution. In turn, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.33 per common unit or $1.32 per common unit on an annualized basis. NEP's strong performance was underscored by an approximately 285 megawatt acquisition from Energy Resources earlier this month. Included in the acquisition are the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills Wind Energy Centers, each commissioned in 2015 with GE Technology. These high-quality wind projects are expected to provide an attractive yield to investors. At the same time, the utilization of debt and cash on hand to fund the purchase price reflects the partnerships' flexible approach to financing and allows NEP to be opportunistic to add to future growth in 2016. Overall, we are very pleased with the results for the quarter. We believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well-positioned heading into the second half of the year.","Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the second quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $448 million and earnings per share of $0.96, down $0.01 per share year-over-year. Continued investment in the business contributed $0.08 of growth in earnings per share versus the prior year comparable quarter, but was offset by the impact of the Woodford Project gas reserve refund and share dilution. We continue to identify opportunities to invest capital for the benefit of customers, with regulatory capital employed, growing by approximately $2.6 billion or 8.4% over the same quarter last year.","Similar to the Cedar Bay transaction that closed in the third quarter of last year, we are pursuing a plan to acquire and phase out another coal-fired power plant. The Indiantown Cogeneration facility is a 330 megawatt power plant located in Indiantown, Florida, which has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. FPL proposes to purchase the ownership interest in the Indiantown Cogeneration facility for $451 million, including existing debt. If approved by the commission, this transaction is expected to result in a significant reduction in the plant's operations and enable earlier shutdown of the facility than would otherwise be the case. This plan is projected to save FPL customers an estimated $129 million and prevent nearly 657,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. The acquisition, if approved, is expected to close early in 2017 and is another example of our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers.","Along with Cedar Bay this transaction, if approved, will result in the early retirement of two of the highest greenhouse gas emitting power plants in the state and further FPL's position as a clean energy leader.","During the second quarter, we were disappointed that the Florida Supreme Court reversed the PSC's December 2014 approval of the acquisition of long-term natural gas supplies from the Woodford Project. We continue to believe the investment presents a long-term opportunity to hedge potential volatility in the market price for natural gas and we appreciate the PSC's careful consideration of this innovative approach to managing this risk.","Our second quarter results include a negative impact of $0.03 per share, reflecting a refund to be provided to customers through future fuel clause proceedings for all revenue requirements accrued to date for this investment, as compared to settled natural gas prices over the same period of time. Going forward, the Woodford Project investment has been removed from customer recovery and we expect physical production to be liquidated in the open market.","Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending June 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period.","During the second quarter, we utilized $16 million of reserve amortization, which was less than we had planned, leaving us with a balance of $71 million for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect that the balance of the reserve amortization coupled with current CapEx and O&M expectations will allow us to support a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% through the end of our current rate agreement in 2016. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.","Turning now to Florida's economy, the current unemployment rate of 4.7% is the lowest level since 2007, and the number of jobs was up approximately 245,000 or 3% compared with June of last year. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth and more than 1.1 million private sector jobs have been added since 2010.","The real estate sector continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at a healthy level and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida home prices up 6.3% from the prior year. In addition, the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remain near post-recession highs.","FPL's second quarter retail sales volume was down 2.5% from last year. We estimate that weather-related usage per customer had a negative impact on year-over-year retail sales of 5.5%. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 3%, comprised of a continued customer growth impact of approximately 1.2%, and increased weather normalized usage per customer of approximately 1.8%. As a reminder, our estimates of weather normalized usage per customer are subject to significant short-term volatility.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year as we saw last year.","As we have previously stated, on March 15, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for FPL's 2016 base rate proceeding. During the quarter, nine quality of service hearings were conducted across the state and an overwhelming majority of participants spoke positively about the service they receive from FPL. Intervenor and staff testimony were filed earlier this month and we will be submitting rebuttal testimony next week on August 1. We are focused on technical hearings that are scheduled to take place in late August and early September and we expect the staff recommendation and commission ruling on revenue requirements and rates in the fourth quarter.","The four year base rate plan has been designed to support continued investments in long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and helps keep customer bills low. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement and our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case, that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $234 million or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $313 million or $0.67 per share. Adjusted EPS increased $0.10 or approximately 18% year-over-year. Energy Resources' core business results were primarily driven by contributions from new investments of $0.19 per share, reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program and contributions from our gas pipeline development projects. These gains were partially offset by a decline in contributions from our existing asset portfolio of $0.04 per share.","A favorable impact from the partial reversal of a 2014 income tax charge that resulted from the separation of our Canadian projects to enable them to fit into the overall NEP structure was more than offset by lower state tax incentives, the ongoing impact of PTC roll off and other headwinds versus the prior year comparable quarter. Wind Resources was roughly 92% of the long-term average essentially in line with the second quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide included the impact of unfavorable market conditions on our upstream gas infrastructure activities, and increased interest expense reflecting continued growth in the business.","As I mentioned earlier, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the Wind PTC over a five-year phase down period was further enhanced during the quarter by IRS guidance on start of construction. Subject to beginning significant physical work or meeting certain safe harbor provisions, the guidance extents the PTC for an additional four year period. Therefore, as detailed on the accompanying slide, we now expect that a wind facility that commences construction this year by complying with the Safe Harbor to procure 5% of the total capital to be invested and achieves commercial operation by the end of 2020 will qualify for 100% of the PTC.","As compared to the two-year Safe Harbor period that was put in place for the 2014 PTC, we expect this increase tender to help support our U.S. wind development activities further into the next decade and provide a greater overall opportunity set than would otherwise have been the case. While this is terrific for our longer-term potential growth, we remain watchful as to whether it may impact near-term customer demand by delaying some opportunities from 2017 and 2018 to later years.","For Solar, we continue to expect IRS start of construction guidance to follow later on given that the commercial operation deadline for the first step of the Solar ITC phase-down is not scheduled to occur until January 1, 2020. Overall, the added planning stability provided by tax incentives are expected to serve as a bridge to further equipment cost decline and efficiency improvements that should enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with gas-fired technology, when tax incentives are ultimately phased down.","In addition to the four-year start of construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities. The guidance confirms two key points. First, it explains that the 5% safe harbor for starting construction applies to the repowering of wind facilities. Second, it provides an 80-20 rule by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for new tenure PTC period if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbines total value.","As I mentioned earlier, we're moving forward with repowering two our Texas' wind assets. We're also conducting due diligence on the rest of our U.S. wind portfolio, and are beginning to talk to customers in order to assess the potential size of this opportunity. We hope to be able to give a more comprehensive update on the size of our repowering initiative before the end of the year.","Regardless of the total size, we expect the majority of our repowerings to be in 2018, 2019 and 2020. As a result, we do not expect this opportunity to change our overall financial expectations for NextEra Energy through 2018. The team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue additional opportunities for contracted renewables development. From our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program of over 4,000 megawatts, roughly 1,500 megawatts were brought into service in 2015 and construction activities remain on-track for the remaining project backlog. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolios will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year.","From this space, the expectations we discussed on the last call to bring into service roughly 2,800 megawatts to 5,400 megawatts of new North American renewables projects, over the course of the 2017 to 2018 timeframe, are unchanged. Since the last call, the team signed roughly 200 megawatts of U.S. wind projects, bringing the total contracts currently signed for delivery in this timeframe to approximately 575 megawatts.","Including the 327 megawatt repowering opportunities and currently signed contracts for new wind and solar projects, our 2017 to 2018 renewable backlog is now over 900 megawatts. Together, we expect to invest approximately $250 million of capital to complete these repowering projects, which should generate returns similar to new build opportunities. While the team is actively pursuing a number of additional opportunities, we continue to expect that a greater portion of new project demand and in turn, a greater portion of our investment opportunities to be in 2018.","Although we are optimistic about the prospects for new renewables growth, it is important to remember that forecasting 2017 and 2018 origination expectations at this stage in 2016 remains subject to a number of uncertainties.","Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipelines, the Florida pipelines remain on track. FERC approval was received earlier this year and we continue to expect an in-service date in mid 2017. NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million respectively and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines. The Mountain Valley Pipeline project in which our expected investment is roughly $1 billion has continued to progress through the FERC process and we continue to expect to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018.","Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $156 million and cash available for distribution was $65 million, up $54 million and $15 million respectively from the prior-year comparable quarter. Strong contributions from acquisitions were the principal driver of growth. New projects added $68 million of adjusted EBITDA and $28 million of cash available for distribution. After accounting for the results of new project additions, existing projects in the NEP portfolio delivered adjusted EBITDA and CAFD roughly in line with the prior-year comparable quarter.","Second quarter wind resource for the NEP portfolio is roughly 91% of the long-term average, which was similar to the prior-year comparable period. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $8 million from the second quarter last year. The impact of other effects, including higher management fees and outside services are shown on the accompanying slide. As I mentioned earlier, just after the end of the quarter, NEP completed an approximately 285 megawatt acquisition of the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills Wind Energy Centers for a total consideration of approximately $312 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments plus the assumption of approximately $253 million in liabilities related to tax equity financing. The purchase price for the transaction was funded in part by the issuance of Holdco debt, with the balance of the purchase price funded with cash on hand and through draw under a project level revolving credit facility.","The use of Holdco debt is consistent with our target at NEP for a long-term capital structure utilizing Holdco leverage of approximately 3.5 times project distributions after project debt service. Based on this metric, we expect our current incremental Holdco debt capacity to be roughly $300 million to $400 million. Looking ahead NextEra Energy Partners expects to continue to be flexible and opportunistic as to future growth opportunities and financing activities.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $540 million or $1.16 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $777 million and $1.67 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment increased $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2015.","For the first six months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings per share and operating cash flow of 11%. Our year-to-date results now reflect a first quarter 2016 favorable impact of approximately $17 million or $0.04 per share, not formally included in our first quarter financial statements. This first quarter impact, which occurred as a result of an accounting standards change on March 30, 2016 is expected to be largely representative of a full-year impact, subject to NextEra Energy's stock price volatility and stock option exercise activity.","At the corporate level, our base case plan continues to assume no new equity for 2016. The sale of our Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets located in ERCOT closed at the beginning of the quarter, generating net cash proceeds of approximately $456 million. In addition, we continued to expect opportunities to recycle capital through potential additional sale opportunities of merchant and other non-strategic assets in our portfolio.","Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing plan as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long-term contracted and rate regulated.","We remain on track to deliver our EPS expectations for this year and the longer term. For 2016, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 with more of our growth through a variety of factors expected to occur in the first versus the second half of the year. Based on what we see now, we expect most of our growth in the second half of the year to be in the fourth quarter.","For 2018, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 implying a compound annual growth rate, off a 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.","Turning now to NEP. Following the acquisition of Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills Wind Energy Centers just after the end of the second quarter, we expect the current portfolio to support a CAFD run rate of $230 million to $260 million as of December 31, 2016. As a result, we now expect to exceed the low end of our previously stated December 31, 2016 portfolio run rate CAFD expectation of $210 million.","We are also updating the December 31, 2016 run rate for adjusted EBITDA from $640 million to $760 million to $670 million to $760 million, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2016. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.","From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectation through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2017.","In summary, we continue to execute against our strategic and growth initiatives across the board at FPL, Energy Resources and NEP. We remain very focused on our key objectives for the year and are off to a strong start through the first two quarters. Overall, we believe our opportunity set is one the best in the industry and we are well positioned to leverage our businesses to continue to deliver on our growth expectations now and into the future.","That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, we will now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, sir. We will now take our next question from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead sir.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Wanted to discuss the repowering update you provided on the Wind business. It sounds like you're making some good progress. Could you give us a sense of what portion of your fleet would either be sufficiently old that it's run through the PTC or the elected the (30:58) CITC. Is there a rough portion we should be thinking about that could potentially be eligible for repowering?","Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC","Stephen, it's Armando. Obviously, a question that everybody wants to know so they can give some size to the program. I think what I can tell you is that it's a fair amount of our program that would be eligible for repowering. I'd say that anywhere from maybe 3 gigawatts to 4 gigawatts are potential repowering candidates. But what we say internally and what I want you and others to understand is, each one of these repowering projects that we're looking at is a whole new project, right? I mean, we've got to look at has the permitting changed, have the environmental regulations changed, what do the land leases look like, what discussions can we have with the customers, what do the old PPA's look like? If it's a merchant project, how comfortable are we with revenues and\/or hedges that we have to take a look at. So, we've actually got a very large spreadsheet where we're looking at these projects, but I can tell you that in detail at this point, we've only looked at a very small amount of the projects that we feel comfortable with and most of what we are seeing, again, it's still very early because all of these things are just like their own mini projects. Most of what we're seeing, we think would likely go COD in 2019 and 2020.","There is obviously going to be a portion, if they work that are going to go in 2017 and 2018, and unfortunately it's going to probably be dribs and drabs like you have today when we announced these 327 megawatts, but a large portion of these look like, if they are going to make sense would be in 2019 and 2020. So a very small piece and we're very happy to announce it today, because it was \u2013 certainly, it wasn't something that we were thinking about six months ago, but you'll probably continue to hear from us that, hey, this works and this doesn't work and so on.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very helpful color, Armando. Thank you. And then just shifting over to natural gas infrastructure you've had good success in growing the business. From here, when you look out at additional growth opportunities in natural gas infrastructure, are there logical growth opportunities that you really need in the near term or should we be thinking that, while it's a great opportunity, it's going to progress over an extended period of time. In other words, is there \u2013 are there actionable additional options that you see and do you also see sort of a real need in the near term or is this just something that's broader, it's not quite as near term, in terms of up year thinking around growth?","Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC","Yeah. So, I think a couple points on that. First, when we acquired the NET portfolio last year in Texas, one of the things that we said was, we were happy to be acquiring an interstate portfolio of pipelines and we thought it would give us opportunities to expand in that area. And that we believed that the additional gas requirements coming out of Mexico would present us opportunities down the line.","We still think that, it's what moves or transactions that get negotiated with what our friends, staff or the board are always take a little bit longer than what we would expect, but we still think that there are opportunities. I wouldn't want you to believe that they are $2 billion type opportunities, like we did in NET Mexico. I think these are growth opportunities in Texas and maybe to the Mexican border and we're excited about that. Beyond that, we're doing Greenfield work. It's very difficult for us to be able to participate in the, what I'll call, the acquisition market, which is primarily the MLPs participate in. So, we are doing some Greenfield work along with the small business that we have in the upstream and we are certainly hopeful that from now through 2020 that we would have another project, another pipeline project to be able to announce. But we \u2013 I wouldn't say that there's anything in the near term that we would be announcing.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just a follow-up on the repowering. I recall at one point, you indicated that you might need to get some incremental IRS guidance around 80\/20 calculations and the like. Do you have that in a form that you feel is financeable currently or is there still a need to sort of firm up the structure?","Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC","So, Jonathan, it's Armando. We did get some incremental guidance from the IRS on repowering a couple of months ago. The reason that we felt comfortable announcing the 327 megawatts on repowering today is we think that it at least this project and the calculations, the fair value calculations that we have to do on the project fit squarely into that guidance.","I will tell you that, as I mentioned before that each one of these are mini projects. It would be helpful, obviously to get additional guidance from the IRS to make the entire portfolio that I talked about before work, but there is a good bit of the portfolio that we're comfortable with the guidance that we have received to date and that in and of itself would not to be what holds it up.","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","And one thing to add to that, Jonathan, we have secured tax equity financing for the two projects that we announced on this morning's call.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. That was going to be my follow-up, but are you pursuing incremental clarification or not?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","We don't need any incremental clarification at this point, Jonathan. It would be, we're not the only ones that are thinking about doing something like this, so there are others that are interested, I think potentially in getting additional clarification. But for the projects, at least for the initial projects that we're looking at, the guidance that we have received is good enough. Again, I want to make sure that everybody understands. These things are all mini projects in and of themselves, the IRS piece is just one small bit of what we need in order to make the conclusion that we would move forward.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then on, just as we look at the slide with the detail around the NextEra Energy Resources, EBITDA and cash outlook, it seems to be in a bit of an uptick from first quarter in the financing costs line, can you give us a sense of what's driving that is it incremental project financing, is it higher cost, is it...","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","We just had some incremental refinancing activity that was impacting that line, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. That's all I got. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Paul A. Zimbardo - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Yet another follow-up on repowering, can you provide a little additional color on how you selected those specific 327 megawatts out of the portfolio? And what kind of return profile you're expecting on that investment?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","I feel comfortable giving you little bit more detail on the former, but at this point, I think it's too early to talk about the returns although I can at least tell you on the returns that, we wouldn't be making investment returns on repowering projects, if they weren't at least as good as the returns that we're getting on new projects. But \u2013 so we \u2013 take a look at our portfolio, obviously if a project does not have production tax credits, it's no longer generating production tax credits that makes it a pretty good candidate for repower. Why? Well because if you're going to repower before the production tax credits have expired, you're going to lose some of those older production tax credits in order to gain new production tax credits.","Having said that, projects that still have one year or two years of production tax credits that they're generating, they may also work. I'm not saying that they would work, but you've got to understand whether giving up two years of production tax credits and getting another 10 years of production tax credit as an example in 2020 when you can get 100% PTC's for 10 years, whether that makes sense or not. Projects that -- what we call the convertible investment tax credit, what other people call the 30% grant from the government, those never had production tax credits, those are actually decent candidates. There's not a big difference, whether a project was or is tax equity financed or is project finance. So, either one of those would work. There's not a big difference, whether a project has already been dropped or sold to NextEra Energy Partners certainly NextEra Energy Partners, could do this. Projects that are merchant have one less difficulty associated with them that is, you don't have a PPA counterparty to have a discussion with.","Having said that, we have had discussions with a couple of PPA counterparties, and they love the idea of repowering. I am not suggesting that those are going to get repowered, but at least the discussions that we've had, those customers love the idea that they can get repowered turbine. So that's kind of the things that probably the most important things that we're looking at in order to determine if something, somebody's a candidate.","But the bottom line Paul is that the return thresholds are at least equivalent if not slightly better than what we currently see in our existing \u2013 in our new build portfolio that's why repowerings are so attractive.","Paul A. Zimbardo - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. That's great. And then one other question at the utility after the Supreme Court decision for the gas rate basing, do you still think this is an opportunity you're going to explore and if so, what are the next steps from a regulatory or legal standpoint?","Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company","So, this is Eric Silagy. From the reserve standpoint, I mean, the court was clear that the CSE would have to go back and review this, they feel as if actually to do that they would need the authority, so that would really require legislative action and whether or not that occurs or not remains to be seen.","We clearly see a lot of value in the opportunity at the utility to be able to have predictability and some certainty a little more around gas supplies from a pricing standpoint. And that's what this is the physical hedge. And so, we think there's a lot of value there for customers.","But the commission thought that unanimously and the court made it clear that they weren't really passing a judgment on whether or not it was a good idea, just that they didn't believe that the commission had the authority under the current legislative construct to be able to make that ruling, and so in a way they were encouraging that to be clarified due to legislative process.","Paul A. Zimbardo - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, everyone.","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Good morning, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, really robust spending outlook at resources and then it doesn't appear that you are sort of putting any strain on your credit metrics in the near term. But, can you kind of touch on, if you sort to see any mismatches between the future cash flows and the current development spend, say post 2017, 2018 and then sort of are these merchant, potential merchant asset sales are levered to mitigate any potential for right sizing?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","No. Don't see any mismatches. We continue to grow cash flow through new investments. We do run at a free cash flow deficit, which we finance with \u2013 from third-party sources. We are careful in terms of how we balance our growth going forward. We have very attractive investment opportunities at Florida Power & Light that we continue to execute on and continue to see good opportunities at Energy Resources. But as we said in the prepared remarks, we do continue to look at recycling activities as a way to become more long-term contracted and rate regulated, which is consistent with our strategy.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on the reserve amortization balance, any sort of expectations how much we could carry into 2017 if it's extended as part of the negotiation process in the current filing or do you expect to fully recognize it by yearend?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Yeah. It's a feature of our settlement agreement that we executed back in 2012. So, the plan would be to use what we currently have.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, got it. And then, just lastly on the Woodford Shale investments, what are you (46:20-46:25) come from an asset standpoint?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","I am sorry, Shahriar. Can you repeat the question?","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Sorry about that. So, just on the Woodford Shale investments, what are you exactly unwinding from an asset standpoint or are these just \u2013 are these just contracts?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Yeah. All we're unwinding is basically the fuel costs that was passed onto customers and since natural gas prices have come down just a hair, the differential between what was rolled through in the fuel charge and what the market price for natural gas is, that's really the unwind of the charge. However, I do want to say that \u2013 in our current natural gas price environment, this would have been a great time to be layering into further investments. So, it's unfortunate with the Supreme Court decision.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Exactly. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Good morning Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Can you give a sense of as you look at these repowering opportunities kind of a dollar per megawatt kind of bookings around that?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","It's going to, I mean, it is going to depend. I will give you an assessment though on the ones that we announced today. The CapEx investment is roughly $250 million. That's not to say that it's going to be the same metric for every project that we could do, but for this one is roughly $250 million.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Is part of the economics that make these at least as good as new development the fact that you don't have to do the siting and permitting, how big a component is that?","Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC","As I mentioned before, these are all mini projects. I mean you are going to \u2013 in some cases, you are going to have to re-permit, in some cases you're going to have to relicense, in some cases you are going to have to have discussions with the county or the state or I mean \u2013 you are going to have to deal with birds and bats and bees and you know all of the things that we generally deal with. We've got to take a look at these as a brand new development. Some states are actually easier to get some things down than others, but that's the case for repowering the same as for new investments.","James L. Robo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Paul, let me just add because we have had a lot of questions on, this is Jim \u2013 on repowering this morning. I just want to reemphasize something that Armando said. We are not trying to be cagey in terms of how we are answering all these questions on repowering. I mean, the reality is we have several gigawatts, as Armando said, of opportunities but each project is a completely new development and it's a little bit easier than the old development because you don't have to go get land leases and you have a transmission interconnect, but there is still an enormous amount of work that needs to get done for each of these projects.","So, we have a big team on it, we're running through it. It is as Armando said, if it's up to \u2013 if it's as many as 3 gigawatts or 4 gigawatts, that's a tremendously big opportunity for us and we're as always on something that we've been work \u2013 the other point I just wanted to make is, we've been working on it for about 90 days. And so, we are \u2013 I think we've made tremendous progress actually in the last few months on it and we're going to have more clarity on each of the calls that we do as we go forward.","It is becoming clear though for sure that most of the activity is going to be 2018, 2019 and 2020. And so, really as you think about this for us, it's a terrific driver of growth post 2018 as we think about the longer term future for the company.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And is this 327 megawatts \u2013 a megawatt-per-megawatt displacement or is this adding more megawatts with bigger towers?","Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC","No. This is not a megawatt-per-megawatt \u2013 well, let me put it to you this way. We are taking turbines down that have 327 megawatts of capacity and we're putting refurbished turbines up that have 327 megawatts of capacity. Does that answer your question?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yes, yes. It does.","Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC","Okay.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then you kind of alluded to the fact that the second half growth is going to come in the fourth quarter. Are we expecting a down third quarter?","Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC","Yeah. We're expecting most of the growth to have occurred in the first half of the year versus the second, and that's really due primarily just to some timing issues around some tax items and then Lamar, Forney sale having hit in the second quarter as well. Those are really the two primary factors.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then in Florida, is there a specific time period carved out for settlement discussions?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","No. There is \u2013 there is not. I mean, obviously we're going to be going into hearings starting on August 22. Those are scheduled to last for two weeks. And so we're open to settlement discussions at any time. But realistically, I mean timing becomes more challenging as you get closer and closer to getting in the hearings, simply because everybody is gearing up and then going into the hearings.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks, actually that last question was the vast majority of my question. I was wondering if at this point, there would be any specific filings that talk about the concept of retaining or changing the current return on equity construct. In the last several rate deals you had, the commission has been consistent in giving you sort of a target base ROE with a wide band of opportunity and risk. Do you expect that you'll have the same framework going forward or is there potential for a change in that framework? And if so, when we will get a sense of where the different parties are on that issue?","Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company","Yeah. So, this is Eric. We filed our case and we don't expect any change in the longstanding commission framework of having 100 basis points on either side of a midpoint. That's really designed for again to, for the commission to be able to have predictability and stability and not having people coming in for rate cases in the short-term basis. So, I \u2013 there is no indication that that's going to change that's something that \u2013 that the commission has had in place for awhile and it's effective for all IOUs in Florida.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And has there been any testimony filed on cost of capital yet?","Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company","Well, we had lots of testimony filed, absolutely. So, the commission has received our direct testimony and then as John said, we're in the process now of filing, preparing our rebuttal testimony, and that will go in on August 1.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And is there \u2013 I know that there has been a lot of, I doubt you're going to answer this question, but someone has to ask it. Is there anything that you can say publicly about the Oncor process?","James L. Robo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I know you had to ask it and I'm not going to comment on it. Thanks.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you guys.","James L. Robo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead sir.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, just a follow-up on the rate case. What's your views on the chances of settling the case? Is it kind of the same as when you filed earlier this year or has anything changed in your views on settlement chances?","Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company","Yeah. Steve, this is Eric. It's always hard to predict. We've got a number of interveners. We've made it very clear that we're always open to having these discussions. We think settlement is a good thing just generally as long as it's fair for all the parties. But we just finished nine quality of service hearings where the commission went around the state throughout our territory. The response from customers was overwhelmingly very positive. We've filed a very strong case. I feel really good about where we stand from a perspective of we've had the lowest bills in the state for six years in row and the highest reliability and best customer service and emissions profile that's the cleanest in the Southeast U.S. And I think the commission recognizes that.","So, we're prepared to go into hearings and to finish the case out, but if we can have a settlement, that's great. It's just hard to predict because it's not dealing with one counterparty, it's multiple counterparties.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. And then just maybe just clarify on kind of financing plan, I know you guys have talked about really looking to limit any equity needs for your plan, particularly near-term. Just do you continue to think you can kind of fund the plan pretty much without additional equity?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Yeah, we do for 2016. With of the sale Lamar, Forney generating about $450 million in net cash proceeds, I think that puts us in pretty good position for the balance of this year, we have a few more capital recycling opportunities that we're looking at as well. And for 2017, we're really not going to give any guidance around that until we get through the rate case.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","We will now take our final question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Easy I think easy question and likely for Eric. Eric, can you talk about the issues surrounding Turkey Point, especially with the lawsuit that's been filed and just how do you think about the cost of remediation, how do you think about the kind of the timeline for that and then obviously some of the complainants \u2013 some of the complainants are talking about the potential for cooling towers, what you kind of think about the likelihood and need for that would be as well?","Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company","Yeah, Michael, Turkey Point, it's a \u2013 there are a lot of parties obviously who have jumped in on this for a whole variety of reasons. The reality is that the cooling canals have operated as designed, there is no impact on the local drinking water wells, there is no pollution going into Biscayne Bay. There is a concentration of salt water below the cooling canals that has moved to the limestone, that was frankly anticipated during the original design of the canals. Everybody knew that was going to occur it was a question of how far.","We've now identified because we now have the technology to identify, how far some of that salt water has migrated and we have a plan in place working very closely with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Miami-Dade authorities and others to mitigate that plan. It's fact-based, it's science-based, we're going to undertake that, we are waiting on permits to be able to do some of that. And the costs associated with that is the costs associated with operating the plant. And so, we fully expect that to be recovered through our environmental cost recovery.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, Eric, much appreciated.","Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you very much everyone. That will conclude today's conference call.

Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Julie Holmes, Director of Investor Relations.","Julie Holmes","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Joining us this morning are Jim Robo, NextEra Energy President and Chief Executive Officer; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silangy, President of Florida Power & Light. Moray will provide an overview of our results during the quarter and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings, which are non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Thank you, Julie, good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered a strong third quarter results and continued to make progress on the initiatives laid out in the March investor conference. Our earnings growth in the quarter was driven primarily by continued investment at FPL and the addition of new contracted renewables projects at Energy Resources. With 3 quarters of good performance behind us, we are well-positioned to close up a year above the midpoint of the range of adjusted EPS expectations that we shared with you in January subject to our usual caveats.","At the same time, we continued to execute on our existing backlog of development and construction projects and we have made further progress in firming up some of our incremental investment opportunities.","At FPL, net income growth was driven by investment in projects that are designed to further improve an already strong customer value proposition. We remain very focused on execution and all of our major capital projects are on track with the Riviera Beach and Port Everglades modernizations, both running on time and on budget.","We have filed for the necessary regulatory approvals for the new gas pipeline and the peaker upgrade project and we have made good progress in defining apart towards our goal of keeping nonfuel O&M to roughly flat in nominal terms through the period of the current rate agreement.","At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings growth was driven primarily by new investment in our contracted renewables project. In the third quarter, we brought into service roughly 125 megawatts of wind in Canada but is contracted under the Ontario feed-in tariff program. We continue to execute on our backlog of approximately 800 megawatts of contracted U.S. solar projects, of which about 300 megawatts are expected into come into service in 2013, with the balance expected to come into service by the end of 2016.","We have also been successful in adding to our pipeline of contracted renewables development opportunities and I will provide some additional details later in the call.","During the quarter, we move forward with our company-wide initiative to improve productivity, which we refer to as Project Momentum. After careful evaluation, we have identified and are moving ahead with a number of ideas that we expect to yield in total somewhere between $200 million and $250 million in annual cost savings. The transition cost associated with this initiative negatively impacted adjusted earnings in the third quarter by $0.05 and we expect the full year impact to be roughly $0.09 or $0.10. We will provide more detail on the impact of both FPL and Energy Resources when we walk through their quarterly results.","With the progress we've made year-to-date, we continue to see a long-term adjusted earnings per share of compounded annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off the 2012 base. Our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.","Let me now walk through our results for the third quarter of 2013. I'll begin with the result of FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers.","For the third quarter of 2013, FPL reported net income of $422 million or $0.99 per share, up $0.06 per share year-over-year. As you evaluate the numbers, you may wish to keep in mind that they include the transition costs associated with Project Momentum that I spoke about a moment ago. This includes the negative impact of roughly $0.04 in the quarter and we expect the full year impact to be approximately $0.07 or $0.08. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth in the quarter was continued investment in the business. We invested roughly $700 million in the quarter and expect our full year capital investments to be on the order of $3 billion. Regulatory capital employs growth of 9.3% over the same quarter last year with the main driver of net income growth. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.07%. This includes the impact of the Project Momentum transition costs, absent these costs the regulatory ROE would have been 11.25%. Under the current rate agreement we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermine regulatory ROE for each period, in this case the 11.25%, that I just mentioned excluding special charges such as the Project Momentum transition costs. During the quarter we reversed 10 million of reserve amortization recorded earlier in the year in order to achieve this predetermined ROE. Looking forward we expect to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11.25%, excluding Momentum transition costs for the balance for the year, which will likely mean we will use between $170 million and $180 million of reserved amortization in 2013.And we'll end with the reserve amortization balance of approximately $220 million to $230 million, assuming normal weather for the remainder of the year. Looking beyond this year, we believe that our expected end of year reserve balance, when combined with our weather normalized sales growth forecast at 1.5% to 2% per year and our current O&M expectations, as well as the commitment of a 4-year total of roughly $7 billion in infrastructure CapEx, will allow us to support regulatory ROEs in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% for the remaining period of the current rate agreement.","Furthermore, we expect that we can do this while keeping typical residential customer bills the lowest in the state and among the lowest in the country, and improving on our already excellent reliability in customer service records.","If we are successful in meeting our expectations, by 2016, we will have further improved our already outstanding customer value proposition and we will be well-positioned for whatever proceedings are required to determine rates for 2017 and beyond.","Turning to our development efforts. All of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well and in October, we received approval from the FPSC for 2014 nuclear clause recovery of our full request, which includes recovery of extended power upgrade investment completed earlier this year.","FPL's nuclear plant upgrades with the largest in recent U.S. history and added more than 500 megawatts of zero-emission capacity to our system. In addition to helping improve our fleet's overall fuel diversity, these upgrades are already delivering millions in fossil fuel savings for FPL customers.","Our Riviera Beach and Port Everglades modernization are both running on time and on budget. Riviera Beach is about 90% complete and is expected to come into service by mid-2014. Site clearance at Port Everglades is underway and construction is slated to begin in the spring of next year with an expected in-service date by mid-2016.","We are also moving through the regulatory process on a number of our growth initiatives. Last week, the commission voted unanimously to approve FPL's natural gas transportation capacity contracts that support a new pipeline into the state. While this decision is still subject to appeal, it is an essential first step to enable the stable trail transmission and Florida Southeast connection pipeline projects to move towards construction.","Additionally, our Commission decision on our accelerated storm hardening program is expected in the coming weeks and hearings on our request to upgrade pigging capacity included in our environmental cost recovery close filing earlier this year are currently scheduled for December, with the Commission decision expected in January.","The programs we have laid out to accelerate and expand reliability investments to improve our system infrastructure are also progressing well. During the quarter, we activated more of the functionality of our smart meters, including remote connect and disconnect. We also continued our deployment of automated feeder switches and fault current indicators. Year-to-date, we have avoided almost 300,000 customer interruptions due to this technology.","We also have commissioned a new substation relay system designed to help reduce outage exposure and outage time and it will be rolled out to many of our substations over the coming years. We continue to make good progress on hardening our feeders, replacing wood transmission structures with steel or concrete, as well as our other storm hardening efforts.","Recall, the general infrastructure and storm hardening investments do not have separate cost recovery mechanisms. Costs incurred as part of these programs will be absorbed in our current rate structure for the next 4 years.","Let me now spend a few minutes on the Florida economy. Overall, Florida's economy continues to improve. Most of indicators we track have improved relative to a year ago and the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Unemployment ticked down again in August at 7%, rolling from over 11% in August 2010. The number of jobs in the state is up 1.8% compared with the year ago, outpacing the average of the rest of the country. However, we are seeing some signs that the rate of growth maybe moderating. Consumer confidence is diminished a bit in recent months and there are signs that the strong growth in retail sales may be tapering off. As the accompanying chart shows, new building permits have dropped from their recent peak, although they remain at a healthy level.","As you all know, events in Washington in recent months have not been supportive of consumer confidence and some of what we're seeing here in Florida maybe just a temporary pause. Nevertheless, as we have noted before, we believe that full recovery in Florida will depend in part on continued improvement in other parts of the country. The fundamental attractiveness of our state remains strong and a number of studies suggest that Florida has improved its economic competitiveness relative to most other states over the past few years.","Learning from the general Florida metrics to our own, Florida's customer count averaged approximately 53,000 or 1.2% higher than in the comparable quarter in 2012. This is a significantly higher growth rate than we expected or than we have been running recently. However, a significant portion of this, probably about 1\/4, can be attributed to the rollout of our remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by our Smart Meter program.","This ability to more efficiently and inexpensively manage the connect and disconnect processes, has in turn, led to a sharp drop in our number of inactive accounts, that is meters installed for which we have no customer account. While a sharp increase in customers in the corresponding decline in inactive meters is an excellent development, it does complicate our analysis of growth. Not surprisingly, the larger number of customer accounts being activated are disproportionately residential and therefore, have lower usage in our average retail accounts. Thus, the impact on volume growth for new customers is much less than 1.2%.","In the accompanying chart in the top left, we've attempted to adjust for this effect. We estimate that customer growth of 1.2% drove volume growth of 0.5%, while weather driven usage was negative 0.7% and underlying usage per customer was down slightly.","Regardless of the exact contributions from customer growth and usage impacts, it is clear that overall weather adjusted volume was up only slightly compared with the third quarter of last year. While a single quarter of weak growth should not be a cause of concern, we will obviously be watching closely to see if there's any structural change going on or if we are just seeing a temporary effect.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of $281 million or $0.66 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $190 million or $0.45 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of nonqualifying hedges and the net effect of other than temporary impairments or OTTI on certain investments.","Beginning in the third quarter, adjusted earnings also exclude after-tax operating results associated with the Spain solar projects. Energy Resources had a good quarter, with contribution to adjusted EPS increasing $0.07 versus the prior year comparable quarter, despite the impact of the transition costs associated with Project Momentum, that I spoke about earlier on the call. These transition costs negatively impacted the quarter by roughly $0.01 and we expect the full year impact to Energy Resources to be approximately $0.02 or $0.03.","Contributions from new investments with the primary driver of adjusted earnings growth for the quarter and generated roughly $0.08 up the year-over-year increase. The gas infrastructure business contributed $0.02 to growth due to additional production over the prior year, offsetting these gains were lower contributions from our customer supply and trading businesses, which declined $0.03 versus the third quarter last year, due in large part to lower margins in our full requirements business. All other effects in the quarter were minor.","The Energy Resources team continues to drive execution on our growth plans. As mentioned earlier in the call, during the quarter, we brought into service a Canadian wind project with a capacity of roughly 125 megawatts. As a reminder, we have approximately 475 megawatts of additional Canadian wind capacity, which we expect will enter service in 2014 and 2015. We continue to expect to bring approximately 300 megawatts of contracted solar projects into service this year or early next year with the addition of our 20-megawatt Mountain View project and a partial commissioning of our Genesis and Desert Sunlight projects. The balance of Genesis and Desert Sunlight, as well as our 250-megawatt Macquarie project are expected to come into service by the end of 2016.","Turning to our U.S. wind program. The team recently signed a PPA for a 200-megawatt project, which is expected to come into service in late 2014 or 2015, bringing our total new contracted U.S. wind development portfolio to approximately 1,175 megawatts. The IRS recently provided additional clarity around the requirements for projects to qualify for the PTC under the Safe Harbor provisions that were included in the January PTC extension.","The new IRS guidance essentially provides that U.S. wind projects satisfying the Safe Harbor provisions that are placed in service by year-end 2015, will be eligible for the PTC. While we have yet to determine the impact that this guidance could have on our projections, the new wind projects in the 2014 to 2015 timeframe, we consider this a positive development for our U.S. wind program and we will continue to provide updates in our expectations as we move forward.","We are also working to continue to build our solar business. We previously discussed the potential for adding 1 or possibly 2 more large scale solar projects before the end of 2016 and I'm pleased to note that we have recently entered into an agreement to purchase a development projects for the First Solar who will complete the development process and also provide EPC services for us. While there are a number of additional milestones to be achieved before we can consider this transaction complete, this is an important step for our solar portfolio.","This project will have a capacity of approximately 250 megawatts and operate under a 20-year PPA. Total capital cost is estimated at $1.1 billion. Together with the 40-megawatt projects that we announced earlier this year, this project would bring the portfolio of incremental solar to about 290 megawatts, near the top end of the expected range of 0 to 300 megawatts that we discussed at our investor conference. We now have nearly 1,100 megawatts of U.S. contracted solar projects in our development portfolio.","As we do each year in the third quarter, we have updated our accrued in gross margin hedge slides and included an additional year forward. The portfolio of financial information for 2014 and 2015 can be found in the appendix to the presentation. For 2014, old projects which are expected to be in service by the end of 2013, have been moved to their respective categories, which in this case, include both contracted wind for the wind projects and contracted other for our solar additions. For 2015, projects expected to come into service in both 2014 and 2015 are included in the new investment line.","I would like to emphasize that this includes only contributions from projects for which we have assigned PPA. I would also like to remind everyone that these charts use a metric that we call equivalent EBITDA in order to put all our businesses on a comparable basis for the purpose of analyzing our exposure to first order changes in future commodity prices, primarily movements in forward prices for natural gas, power and spark spreads. Equivalent EBITDA is not a GAAP measure and should not be thought of as a surrogate for or constituent of cash flows.","Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the third quarter of 2013, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $698 million or $1.64 per share. NextEra Energy's 2013 third quarter adjusted earnings in adjusted EPS was $607 million and $1.43, respectively.","The Corporate and other segment was up $0.04 versus the prior year, primarily because last year's Q3 results included a small asset impairment charge of $0.03. We continue to expect the full year contributions from this segment to improve modestly related to 2012, in part due to increased contributions from our Lone Star Transmission line, which went into service in the spring of this year.","Other areas of our transmission business are also progressing well. We were recently designated by the Ontario Energy Board to develop the East-West Tie Line Transmission project with our partners, Enbridge and Borealis. While we still need approval to construct the line, following the development process, we certainly consider this a positive first step. We look forward to providing you with updates on this project, as well as others mentioned in our investor conference as our transmission team continues its development efforts.","Before closing, I'd like to make a few comments on our financing plans and cash flow position. We've repeatedly noted the important role of balance sheet strength and credit play in our overall competitive strategy. At our investor conference in March, we discussed our expected growth in cash flow and our focus on returning to credit metrics more consistent with our past performance no later than 2014. We indicated that dependent on our success in firming up what we call incremental investment opportunities, we expected to need to issue up to $1.5 billion in equity in 2014 in order to achieve our target credit metrics. We have also indicated we expected the majority, if not all of this, to be in the former Street common rather than equity units.","In the accompanying chart, we have shown some of the principal credit metrics that we track with our expectations for 2014 and the corresponding ranges that the rating agencies indicate for those metrics at our ratings. You will note that we expect to see our metrics return to levels fully consistent with our rating by next year.","Since the March investor conference, we have obviously enjoyed significant success in firming up many of incremental growth opportunities. While various approvals and permits are still needed, we feel very confident that we will be able to move forward with much, if not all of the incremental investment, sometime over the next 3 or 4 years. As a result, today, our best estimate is that we will need to issue at least $1 billion in incremental equity before the end of next year.","In pursuing the necessary financing to support our growth plans, including issuing new equity, we expect to be, as we have been in the past, opportunistic as to the exact timing structuring of specific transactions. We will take advantage where we can of favorable market opportunities and will not lock ourselves into a preset schedule.","As you think about our financing needs, as well as our overall value proposition, it will be important to keep in mind our cash flow position. We have previously indicated we expected to see strong growth in cash flows in 2013 with more to come in 2014 and we are on track relative to our expectations this year.","In 2012, our cash flow from operations was about $4 billion. This year, we expect it to become about $4.8 billion. And next year, we expect it to be somewhere between $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion consistent with the range we suggested back in March. This would represent growth of nearly 50% over 2 years.","The accompanying chart attempts to put this in perspective. We show on the left side of the chart a range of expected distributable cash flow for capital holdings in 2014. Capital holdings is the entity that aggregates all our non-FPL financing activities. Distributable cash flow is defined here as net of expected interest and principal repayment obligations on all limited recourse, project level debt at Energy Resources, as well as net of expected maintenance CapEx. We then compare this with total senior debt of capital holdings, as well as with the sum of senior debt and lower rated subordinated debentures.","As you will see, the coverage is strong and is of course further supported by the parent guarantee. The comparison on the right side of the slide, we have also put FPL on a roughly similar basis treating all our infrastructure capital as maintenance CapEx and comparing the resulting expected 2014 distributable cash flow with the total first-mortgage debt outstanding. While there are some differences between FPL and capital holdings not reflected in this analysis, the general comparisons maybe helpful to you.","In short, we continue to execute well and if we are successful in meeting our financial expectations for 2014, we will have a very strong and balanced cash flow position across the portfolio.","Before leaving the subject the cash flow, I feel sure that 1 or 2 if you will have questions about the status of our thinking on the so-called yield co.. First, let me be clear that we have made no firm decisions at this point. We continue to examine the concept of recycling capital by our focus on investors with the strong interest in yield oriented vehicles, supported by renewable assets, whether in a public or a private format.","During the quarter, we have observed further developments that appear to support the viability of the concept, at least under current market conditions. We've spent some time looking at the specifics of our own portfolio, and now estimate that we have perhaps 1,500 to 2,000 megawatts of operating assets that would fit the desired format with another 1,200 megawatts in the development pipeline, all of which could potentially be contributed during the 2014 to 2017 timeframe.","Longer term, additional projects might become suitable, especially as wind projects complete the 10-year period of PTC eligibility. I want to reiterate that we have made no firm decisions and continue to study various alternatives and we'll keep you up-to-date with our thinking as it evolves.","Over all, with good performance in Q3 and continued progress on our new initiatives, our financial expectations remain much the same. We continue to see our 2013 adjusted EPS in the upper half of the $4.70 to $5 range that I told you in January.","In 2014, we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $5.05 to $5.45. And for the longer-term outlook, we continue to see adjusted EPS growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016, off the 2012 base.","As always, our expectation is subject to the usual caveats we provide including normal weather and operating conditions. And in the appendix, we have provided a number of sensitivities around our 2014","expectations. And we'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first, just to elaborate a little bit further on yield co. and I'm sure further questions will go. Could you talk a little bit more specifically, of those operating assets, how you're thinking about the 1.5 to 2 gigs? What are those assets, if you could at least talk broadly? And then secondly, with respect to the development pipeline, are those assets that have tax attributes today or are you thinking about when you say development, those that are rolling off tax attributes?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Let me take the development side first. As you would expect, that is all renewable, because that's where our development efforts have been concentrated for some time. And a mixture of wind and solar, but excluding wind projects that would be PTC projects for reasons that we discussed before. Of the base, existing operating projects, it would be a mix of projects, heavily renewable, potentially some of our contracted fossil assets as well and the renewables being a mix of wind and solar, wind that has either completed its PTC period or on which we didn't take PTCs.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then maybe just more broadly here, if you will. What's the timing on making a decision. I don't want to put you in a back in a lock or anything, but just broadly speaking, what are you waiting for, perhaps the better way to ask it?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I guess the first 1 I can respond to that is we're waiting for our own analyses to be -- to reach a crystallization point. I would say at this stage, each round of review that the senior team has done has enlightened us further, but it also raises more question. So there'll be a series of rounds of those and until we're comfortable with what they've got all issues addressed, we don't feel any compulsion to take pressure to make a decision one way or the other. I think we talked that on the last call, we certainly talk to the conferences about some of the issues that we have. So I'm not going to reiterate those things. But until we're really comfortable that we've got all the pieces buttoned down, as I've said, we don't feel any compulsion to make a decision one way or the other.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then lastly if you will; obviously got some IRS guidance in the quarter, can you speak to how much wind you expect to have in the pipeline or qualifying for the PTC by year-end and how this sort of evolved -- how are the IRS guidance and pushing it into '15 has evolved taking it into the pipeline opportunity of the wind?","Moray P. Dewhurst","It's a good question. I think the short answer is no, I can't. Because it's still fairly recent and it has had impact already on the market. So as we discussed before, customers react to their expectations about the PTC program just as we do. So I think we're now going through sort of another round of jointly with customers and potential customers are trying to figure out how much more that may add. So the plus side is, the fundamentally good aspect is that I think it provides more opportunities. There is a little bit of a short-term negative because it takes some of the pressure off individual situations. So I think -- we should be in a better position to give you some thinking about that, probably at the next call. But right now, we're just not far off alone.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Are you looking specifically at yield co., are you looking at the general idea of an alternative structure?","James L. Robo","We are looking at the general idea of an alternative structure, but with a definite focus on trying to create a structure that's appealing to yield oriented investors with a strong interest in renewables, is probably the best way to put it. So as we discussed on the last call, we're looking at both, what I'll call the public yield co. vehicle, which there are some examples out there, as well as potential into private alternatives, private analogues, if you like.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess yield co. is kind of a vague term. Okay. And then why are you not carving out Project Momentum implementation costs from your adjusted earnings?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I guess we could have, I mean our feeling is they are part of our operating results, but we wanted to call them out so you can make whatever adjustments for your modeling purposes that you should choose.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And when do you expect that $200 million to $250 million to start hitting impact statement -- hitting the income statement?","Moray P. Dewhurst","We're already seeing some benefits this year. We'll see a lot more next year. I think the best way to think about that is an annualized run rate by 2016. So by the time we get to 2016, we should have a full value of that flowing through.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And could you just describe, is this headcount, is this process, is it all of the above?","Moray P. Dewhurst","It is all of the above. We undertook a process that generated something like 9,000 individual ideas that various teams worked through and analyzed. And in the end, we have about 1,000 individual ideas that we're now pursuing, so they range over the map in every department or every part of the company was involved. So it's just a little bit of everything. Certainly, there are some headcount implications and the transition cost largely driven by those headcount implications, but there's a lot of changes to the way we conduct work that will allow us to see benefits over time.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In your resources waterfall chart, you usually have existing assets kind of broken out, I guess that didn't change. But you had a pretty [indiscernible] tough wind headwind. What does that do to earnings?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. I mean, there were lots -- as you might expect, within that broad category, there were lots of ups and downs. The wind for the existing assets was actually a bit better than last year, the wind resource is about the same. We've got a little more output out of the projects. So it's just a whole series of pluses and minuses, but net the existing assets to be about the same.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just a sort of follow-up on the equity needs and the potential for yield co., could one assume that the equity needs would be somewhat satisfied by yield co.?","Moray P. Dewhurst","In theory, I think that's possible. In practice, I don't think it's that likely. I think the yield co. alternative needs to be thought of as sort of a restructuring of where we -- the basic financial structure. So it could be but I think, it's better to think of the equity as just separate from.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I got you. Then in terms of the equity, should we think of this as basically common or should we think of it as potentially hybrid or something else?","Moray P. Dewhurst","You should think of it as primarily, it's not 100% common. We've continued to manage with a slice of hybrids and a slice of -- let me be explicit. Hybrids for us means the deeply subordinated junior debentures. And then equity units, maybe what you're referring to when you say hybrids. But both of those have a place in the capital structure. But I think we have about the right amount of each of those right now.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then back to Project Momentum, it does appear that you guys are using a more conservative approach in terms of accounting for the cost to achieve. And I was just wondering, how long would those costs to achieve, should we think is a sort of flow in terms of how they'll progress and you mentioned that the full benefit will sort of show up in 2016, but how do we think about the cost to achieve. I mean will they be sort of steadily run rate here for the next couple of years or how should we think about the cost to achieve and how they might affect your earnings going forward?","Moray P. Dewhurst","At this stage, I would expect that we will see the bulk of them this year. As we indicated in the prepared remarks, we've got maybe $0.10 for this year. There probably will be some in 2014, don't know how much at this stage, but not likely as much as $0.10. And then '15 and beyond, I would be surprised if we have more than a few pennies.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay great. And then just finally on the sales growth, you did mention that there was a little anomalies here with in terms of usage, at least of change. And we are seeing, as you know, around the country, sort of more significant pullbacks in usage -- weather normalized usage. Any sense -- I mean you did mention in the prepared remarks and everything, but any sense as to -- anything or any more color that you can give with respect to what you're seeing so far?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, if it's anything, I think it's most likely to have to do with general economic conditions. We don't see any signs that this is driven by what I'll call incremental efficiencies. So we bake into our expectations about a percentage point decline every year as new efficiency standards kind of roll through the capital stock. So it's hard to see that this recent phenomenon would represent any sharp change in and efficiency. So I think it's much more likely -- if it is real, to be just due to economics. So I think, the main thing there is -- that we know that several of the indicators at the general economic level seem to be kind of taking a pause and then we also see that same phenomenon in our usage. So we're just a little more cautious that we may be not slowing down, but the rate of growth may be coming down a bit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Thanks for the incremental disclosure, very helpful. When we think about how you've contextualized the percent or the portion of your nonutility business that could potentially be eligible for the yield co. structure, how we translate that into the percentage over the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of distributable cash you're showing on line 13 comes from those eligible projects?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think the short answer is, you can't right now because we haven't made the connection between those 2 because frankly, they've been independent streams of activities. So stay tuned on that.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then obviously, we also have to figure out or you have to figure out how much debt goes with that to get to a bottom line yield, distributable cash number, how much is amortizing? Those are all the sort of pieces that we have to figure out, right?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Absolutely. The modeling of what it would look like has to take into account all of those things. The other thing to be noted there is just to reiterate our commitment to the strong credit position. We would have to make sure that were we to move forward with a yield co. structure, that we adjust back-up at the corporate level to make sure that we retain the appropriate financial mix and credit metrics that we're targeting there. So that's an extra layer of complexity. It's not just which assets would move down and what's the debt associated with them. But it's also the ripple effect back to the parent company to make sure that you've got everything balanced back there.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Otherwise, said in plain English, you just can't push a lot of assets down without also pushing the right amount of debt down so that the current credit remains strong?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Fair enough.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Is that right?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, fair enough.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","To circle back to Paul's question, I do think it's -- can you comment a little more on what type of metrics you use to measure customer -- underlying customer demand, as it pertains to the weather versus energy efficiency and things because in other regions like, for instance, Arizona, which is also a state recovering from a housing bust, they also saw a big pullback in what they consider to be normalized -- weather normalized demand, very similar to what you're talking about. Can talk about the type of metrics you use to try to get at that and how confident you are that they sort of capture that or what they might be missing?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I'll do my best. I think the real challenge here is that we don't have any metrics that we can really look at on a short-term basis that drill in on this problem. And that's one of the reasons why we many times said in the past that any one quarter, we should expect to see weather adjusted usage per customer move around quite a bit. So even in a period, now going back several years, when on average, underlying usage was growing at about 1 percentage point per year. We would still see individual quarters where it didn't grow at all and other quarters where it grew at 1.5% or 2%. So those sort of quarter-to-quarter things, very hard for us to sort out. So to the core of the question, longer-term, you can look at -- the basic thing you have is the uses usage pattern by segments of customers. And so part of what's going on here is the customer mix is changing and the usage patterns of the customers within the different segments in that mix, also appear to be changing a little bit. In short, we have seen over the last few years much stronger recovery in residential piece and in the small end of the commercial segment and much weaker recovery, if any, in the large commercial piece. So we're really, in terms of metrics, we actually look more to the trends at the segment level.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","As you look out in the last quarter in terms of developments on yield co., I wonder if you could just talk at a high level as you think about the cost to capital of these approaches to investors that are seeking cash flow. Not in detail, but just holistically as you think about cost to capital, right investor base, et cetera, just how you think about that relative to within NextEra?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. I'll take a crack at that. I think I'm going end-up repeating things that we probably said on the last call, I said at one of the conferences. To me, this is a question about whether there is a segment of investors who simply value a cash flow stream with particular characteristics differently from the way that the rest of the investor base does. And here, in particular, we're talking about a cash flow stream that has high current income, relatively stable, but also with strong and visible growth. I think if you look at the yield co. structures that have been introduced so far, that element of significant predictable growth has been an important distinguisher of how they trade. So to me, that indicates that to the extent there is a discrete investor segment here it's 1 that both likes the solidity of current income, but also is willing to pay for visibility into a meaningful growth pattern. So that, I think, what you're trying to do is structure a vehicle that appeals to that particular segment and then the real core question is how big is that segment, how much more is it willing to pay for the cash flow stream than other investors and is that a transient phenomenon, or one that is going to be around for a while? So that's kind of the framework that we think about, I'm sure Jim and others have slightly different versions, but that's how I think about it.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's helpful. And within the approach to yield co., one thing that investors sometimes think about is the economic participation of the parent, that is incentive payments back to the parent as return levels are reached. I know it's a little bit more specific, but I know that goal is obviously always to maximize the value of NextEra to shareholders. As you all think about potential participation of the parents in returns at whatever yield co. could be contemplated, is that something that you are generally or positively disposed towards because you want that -- the parent growth and parent participation?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Byrd, it's certainly yet another of the things which we have to consider. I guess the main point I will make there is it does seem to be important that you -- to the extent you can, you create alignment of interests between the 2 sets of investors and one of our concerns is not getting a situation where the interests are divergent. And in that sense, the kind of incentive structures that you're talking about, I think, can play an important role if they are designed correctly. But if it's an important aspect, the specifics of how they're designed are important. But I see them as mostly about aligning interest.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of items. One on the O&M cost reduction, the $200 million to $250 million. Is that incremental -- I assume that's the main driver for keeping nominal O&M flat and that there couldn't be kind of a potential down -- actual downward trajectory in O&M being driven off of that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","A couple of comments on that. On a number of occasions, I think at one of the conferences in September, I kind of tried to frame it on the FPL side by saying that last year, we had about $1.5 billion of non-fuel O&M. If you just extrapolated at a traditional 2.5% a year growth rate, what we have been running in the last few years, out to 2016, you would've found that to attain the goal of keeping nominal O&M flat, that would've translated to about $150 million a year run rate reduction. And so that's kind of the scope of the challenge. Now the $200 million to $250 million obviously includes Energy Resources and other parts of the business. But it's why we feel pretty comfortable that we have line of sight on the actions that will be necessary to give us a decent shot at that goal of keeping that O&M flat in nominal terms. Now indirect answer to your question, we certainly haven't -- we're not saying this is all that there is going to be. In fact, one of the important things coming out of Project Momentum is a commitment on going further searches for improvement. So this is where we are today. We've got a lot of work to do to make sure we deliver on that. But we're certainly not going to treat that as that's the only thing that it could possibly be.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And 1 or 2 other questions unrelated on the O&M side. When you commented on the 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth, are you now including items like the pipeline in that number or is that still outside of that number?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No. The 5% to 7% is adjusted EPS growth at the enterprise level. So it's inclusive of everything. And certainly when we share that range in the March investor conference, we discussed the pipeline as a potential project in the incremental investment category. So clearly, it was included in that and it certainly remains so.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And finally, the earnings power...","James L. Robo","Michael, this is Jim. I just wanted to add to that. Given the combination of the progress we've made on Project Momentum along with the progress we've made in our development efforts on both sides of the business, I said this in September, I'll say it again now. I will be very disappointed if -- we have a lot of executions still left to do over the next 3 years, but I'll be very disappointed if we don't earn at the top end to that range through 2016, i.e. what I have the teams focused on is earning $6 in 2016.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And on the pipeline, just I want to think about the earnings power. Do you actually accrue AFUDC during the construction of the pipeline and then that kind of converts to cash once it comes online in late 2017?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. And Michael, it's possible, in response to your first question, what you may have been thinking about is where the pipeline shows up in the segment discussion in our forward-looking statements. This does get a little bit more complicated, but everything that we discussed to date has had the potential contribution from the pipeline clustered in the FPL segment. Although we have also indicated that those are not strictly FPL assets. So that may be part of the confusion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Are there any commitments that you can make with regards to the dividend as it relates to your decision about whether to do a yield co. or not?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, first of all, the answer is no. Dividend obviously is a board decision. But I'm not quite sure I'm following the interrelationship between the dividend and the yield co. in your mind.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, when we think about yield co. mechanism, there's significant amount of cash that does come from NextEra Energy Resources that currently helps go towards the parent that helps go towards funding a variety of different activities within the NextEra structure. In the event that you were to drop down any of those assets into a separate yield co. Mechanism, I'm just wondering whether that might have an effect on, whether you might want to think about your dividend for NextEra shares. Is there a separation of that dividend? Or is there a commitment that you can that the yield co. would not have any impact on the dividend? Just trying to get a sense of how you think about that.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Okay. I think I would have to think a little further about the question. I guess my initial reaction is at least at this stage, I don't see the yield co. necessarily leading to any fundamental change in the dividend policy, again, the dividend policy is a matter for the board to decide and any specific implementation within that policy is also a matter for the board to decide.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just wanted to ask. You mentioned -- if I heard correctly, that the ability of Florida Power & Light to rely [indiscernible] ROEs through 2016 was predicated on certain assumptions regarding load growth and you gave those numbers but I'm not sure I heard them correctly, I wonder if I can ask you to repeat them and perhaps break them down into their various components.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. In terms of volume growth out through the 2016 period, the average is about -- the expectations average is about 1.5% to 2%. The vast majority of which is coming from customer growth. Essentially what we do for the forecast there is take the -- I believe it's the University of Florida population projections and then factor them down to implications for customer growth. So probably 3 quarters of the growth in the base expectations is coming from customer growth, but the total volume growth expectation is about 1.5% to 2% per year. So call it 1% to 1.5% customers and maybe another 0.5% per year. And the usage side -- the usage piece, just to remind folks, is really still sort of cyclical economic recovery, i.e. getting back towards the average usage per customer level that we saw in 2007, 2008.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So do you happen to have symptom to have the underlying population growth assumption and the usage assumption that go into the 1.5% to 2%?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Take the population growth of, call it 1.3%, 1.4% and maybe 1.5%, so the rest is the usage piece.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So you see usage rising sort of marginally maybe a 0.25% or 0.5% per year as it reverts in your view to the 2007 levels and then the ongoing population growth. And have you told that there were reason to modify that assumption? That just strikes to me as optimistic given trends around the country and recent experience in the service territory.","Moray P. Dewhurst","A couple of comments here. First of all, baked into that usage value is, as I think I'd indicated earlier, an assumption of about a negative 1% a year impact, the ongoing effect of efficiency standards as capital stock rolls through. In terms of the other part of your question, obviously people can judge for themselves whether it's optimistic or pessimistic. It's actually pretty consistent with what we have been running for the last year and a half or so. Actually usage growth has been little stronger than that over that period. So this quarter is a little bit of a pullback from what we have seen. And that's why I was indicating earlier that we just need to have a little more time to see whether that's the start of a new trend or whether it's just a short-term blip.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. Quickly on the yield co. NRG Energy appears to have acquired some wind and gas assets from the Edison Mission Energy portfolio to contribute to its yield co. Are those assets that you looked at, and if so, can you tell us why you decided not to pursue?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I can't comment on specific assets. All I can say is as I've said in the past that we look at a lot of different things, particularly in the renewable space.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I actually hate asking questions about yield co. again, but putting it into more of a context, so you're saying that you see about 2,000 or up to 2,000 of existing assets that will qualify for a yield co. structure and about 1,200 of assets currently under development. I mean this is such a small portion of your total portfolio. I mean if this really worth pursuing a public yield co. structure given the cost associated with such a process?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I think the only answer I can give you to that is we don't know. That's why we are continuing to study it. But obviously, the fact that we are continuing to study it suggests that we think it could potentially be significant. I think if you look at the potential multiple expansion on certain types of assets, depending on what you believe about how they're implicitly valued today, you can still scale that up and have a meaningful amount in terms of shareholder value creation. So certainly we're going to try and find opportunities like that but we just don't know at the moment. Jim is going to comment as well.","James L. Robo","And Angie, I think the thing to think about is that's over a period of years that we've laid out somewhere in the order through the next 3 to 4 years. Effectively, all of our renewable assets -- contractor renewable assets, ultimately would -- you could conceptually think about being able to be in the yield co. once the project financing, the tax equity and the PTC lives rolled off. So I think it's not right to think about this being all of it, it's all of it that we can think about in the period of the next 3 to 4 years.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","How about adding the gas pipeline assets to that structure, the future gas pipelines?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I don't think we really thought about that at this stage.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Julie Holmes for any additional or closing remarks.","Julie Holmes","Thank you for joining us and if anyone wasn't able to get through on the call, we could follow-up with you separately.

Before I begin my remarks on the third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about the 2017 hurricanes. As you know, residents of the Caribbean and Southern U.S. were recently impacted by the dangerous and deadly effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been affected by any of these storms' widespread destruction.","Hurricane Irma was the largest hurricane event Florida Power & Light has ever faced. The powerful storm impacted all 35 counties and 27,000 square miles of FPL service territory, causing more than 4.4 million customers to lose power. In preparation for the hurricane, FPL assembled and pre-positioned the largest restoration workforce in U.S. history, which grew to approximately 28,000 at its peak. This preparation and coordinated response, combined with the hardening and automation investments that FPL has made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid, enabled the company to restore service to over 2 million customers in one day and to complete the restoration of all 4.4 million customers in 10 days.","The efforts of our team resulted in the fastest restoration of the largest amount of people by any one utility in U.S. history. Mutual aid in times of disaster is one of the hallmarks of our industry, and this storm was no exception. We are deeply grateful for the assistance provided by our industry partners. I would also like to personally thank each member of the restoration team, as well as the contractors, vendors and first responders that supported our efforts for their dedicated assistance during this critical time for our customers.","To put Hurricane Irma in context it's useful to compare it to Hurricane Wilma from 2005, which prior to Irma was the storm that affected the largest number of FPL customers. Unlike Hurricane Irma, which made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 storm and affected the entire state, Hurricane Wilma was a Category 3 storm whose primary impacts were to the southern half of the Florida peninsula.","Based upon a methodology developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Hurricane Irma had an approximately 50% higher damage potential than Hurricane Wilma and resulted in over 90% of FPL customers losing power compared to 75% for Hurricane Wilma.","Notwithstanding the fact that Hurricane Irma was a much stronger storm impacting a larger portion of FPL service territory, there was an approximately 80% reduction to pole damage and an 80% improvement in the time to energize all substations following the storm when compared to Hurricane Wilma.","After day one, FPL had 50% of its customers restored; also an 80% improvement compared to the Wilma restoration efforts. In fact, 95% of customers impacted by Irma were restored in one week and while the average customer outage from Hurricane Wilma lasted for over five days, the average outage for customers affected by Hurricane Irma was roughly two days, a 60% improvement. The total GDP within our service territory averages over $1 billion per day. By reducing the average customer outage by more than three days when compared to Wilma, we believe the avoided economic loss to the state has more than paid for the $3 billion in hardening investments we have made since 2006.","Given the size and scale of this hurricane, the Florida Public Service Commission has opened a docket to solicit customer comments and to take evidence on the statewide utility response to Irma, including an analysis of the impact prior hardening activities had on restoration efforts. We believe that the improvement in FPL's storm restoration effort shows that our ongoing transmission and distribution investments together with our preparation and coordinated response are providing significant value to our customers. In an effort to mitigate a significant bill impact for our customers related to the cost recovery for Hurricane Irma, we currently expect to propose a surcharge equivalent to $4 on a 1,000-kilowatt hour residential bill beginning in March of 2018, which equates to a step-up of $0.64 from a surcharge related to Hurricane Matthew that rolls off at that time.","Subject to a review and prudence determination of our final storm cost by the Florida Public Service Commission, which are preliminarily estimated to be approximately $1.3 billion, we expect this surcharge to increase by roughly $1.50 to approximately $5.50 per month in 2019 and stay at that level until the storm costs are fully recovered, which is expected by the end of 2020.","Turning now to our financial performance, NextEra Energy delivered solid third quarter results and building upon strong progress made in the first half of the year remains well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2017. NextEra Energy's third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.11 or 6.3% against the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting contributions from new investments at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources.","Year-to-date, we have grown adjusted earnings per share by 9.2% compared to the prior year comparable period. We also executed well on major initiatives, including continuing to capitalize on one of the best renewable development periods in our history.","At Florida Power & Light, earnings per share increased $0.08 from the prior year comparable quarter. Strong growth was driven by continued investment in the business to maintain our best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service.","We earned a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5%, and average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 9.8% over the same quarter last year.","All of our major capital initiatives remain on track, including the 1,750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and construction of the eight 74.5 megawatt solar energy centers that are currently being built under the solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement.","We were also pleased that the Florida Public Service Commission approved the settlement agreement with the Office of Public Counsel for the early phase-out of the St. Johns River Power Park helping to further reduce costs for FPL customers and lower emissions for Florida residents.","At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by roughly 3% year-over-year as contributions from new investments more than offset a negative contribution from our existing assets as a result of poor fleet-wide wind resource, which was the lowest on record for the months of July through September over the past 30 years.","Following the success of recent quarters, it was another excellent period of new project origination. Since the last call, our development organization has added 760 megawatts of long-term contracted projects to our backlog, including the largest announced combined solar plus storage project in the United States.","This continued cost and efficiency improvements in wind and solar technology support compelling renewable economics that remain the primary driver of ongoing customer origination activity. Energy Resources continued to advance our wind repowering program as well, adding 514 megawatts to our repowering backlog for 2018 delivery. We also commissioned more than 300 megawatts of repowering projects and closed the first tax equity financing for a wind repowering portfolio.","Finally, we were pleased to receive the FERC certificate for MVP and look forward to advancing construction activities to support a year-end 2018 commercial operation date. Overall, with three strong quarters complete in 2017, we are pleased with the progress we are making at NextEra Energy and are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed subject to our usual caveats.","Now, let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2017, FPL reported net income of $566 million or $1.19 per share, an increase of $51 million and $0.08 per share, respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 9.8% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of 9.9%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion in the third quarter and we continue to expect our full year capital investments to total between $5 billion and $5.4 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended September 2017.","As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a pre-determined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. During the third quarter, we reversed $124 million of reserve amortization after offsetting the impacts of Hurricane Irma, leaving us with a balance of roughly $1.15 billion which can be utilized over the remainder of our settlement agreement.","We continue to expect the flexibility provided by the utilization of our reserve amortization, coupled with our weather normalized sales forecast at current CapEx and O&M expectations to support our target regulatory ROE of 11.5% for the full year 2017, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current settlement agreement.","Each of our ongoing capital deployment initiatives continues to progress well as we focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition. Construction on the approximately 1,750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and under budget. The eight solar sites totaling nearly 600 megawatts of combined capacity are currently being built across FPL service territory and are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost effective energy to FPL customers later this year and in early 2018.","We also continue to advance the development of the additional 1,600 megawatts of solar projects that are planned for beyond 2018 and have currently secured potential sites that could support more than 5 gigawatts of FPL's ongoing solar expansion.","Last month, the Florida Public Service Commission approved the settlement agreement between FPL and the Office of Public Counsel, the consumer advocate in Florida, regarding FPL's proposal for the early shutdown of the St. John's River Power Park and approximately 1,300 megawatt coal-fired plant jointly owned with JEA. The early retirement of the plant, which is expected in January 2018 is projected to provide total savings to FPL customers of $183 million and prevent nearly 5.6 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, adding to the customer savings and emission reductions of our Cedar Bay and Indiantown transactions.","Earlier this month, we filed the determination of need with the FPSC for the roughly 1,200 megawatt highly efficient, clean-burning natural gas Dania Beach Clean Energy Center. The project which has a total expected capital investment of approximately $900 million is a modernization of our existing Lauderdale Plant and is expected to begin operation by mid-2022. Consistent with our focus on low bills, we estimate that the facility will generate more than $335 million in net cost savings for FPL customers over its operational life.","Finally, we were pleased that earlier in the week, the city of Vero Beach City Council approved FPL's purchase of substantially all of the assets of the municipal electric system for approximately $185 million. We are continuing to work on the remaining necessary approvals and hope to be in a position to close the transaction in late 2018. If we are successful, we look forward to Vero Beach's roughly 34,000 customers benefiting from FPL's best-in-class customer value proposition, including rates that are among the lowest in the state.","Despite the effects of Hurricane Irma, the Florida economy remains strong. Florida seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.8% in September, down more than 1% from a year earlier and the lowest in over 10 years. As an indicator of new construction, newbuilding permits remain at healthy levels. The most recent reading of the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 5.3% from the prior year, while mortgage delinquency rates continue to decline. Overall, Florida's economy continues to grow with the latest ratings of Florida's consumer confidence near post-recession highs.","FPL's average number of customers in the third quarter increased by roughly 62,000 or 1.3% year-over-year. For the third quarter, we estimate that warmer weather had a positive year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 1.6% and that Hurricane Irma had a negative impact of approximately 3.5%. After taking these factors into account, third quarter sales decreased 3% on a weather normalized basis, which reflects continued customer growth more than offset by an estimated decline in usage per customer of 1.7%.","With the increased uncertainty in our estimate of weather normalized usage per customer as a result of Hurricane Irma, we are unable to draw any firm conclusions about long-term trends in underlying usage. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage going forward.","As a reminder, modest changes in usage per customer are not likely to have a material effect on earnings over the course of the settlement agreement, as we will adjust the level of reserve amortization utilization to offset any effect, which would allow us to maintain our target regulatory ROE.","Overall, despite the effects of the hurricane, the underlying Florida economy remains strong, supporting ongoing customer growth. And primarily due to weather \u2013 warmer than expected temperatures, we have utilized less reserved amortization than expected through the first three quarters. Assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we currently expect to end 2017 with a reserve amortization balance of more than $1.1 billion that can be utilized over the remainder of the settlement agreement.","Our capital initiatives to further enhance our already best-in-class customer value proposition are also progressing well. These smart capital investments are expected to deliver a regulatory capital employed compound annual growth rate of roughly 8% per year from 2017 through 2020. We are pleased with FPL's year-to-date execution and we'll continue to maintain a relentless focus on delivering low bills, high reliability, clean energy and outstanding customer service.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2017 GAAP and adjusted earnings of $292 million or $0.62 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted EPS increased by $0.02 from last year's comparable quarter. New investments contributed $0.12 per share, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program.","As I previously mentioned, third quarter fleet-wide wind resource was the lowest on record over the past 30 years at 87% of the long-term average versus 101% in the third quarter of last year. The weaker wind resource in the third quarter was the primary driver of the negative $0.03 contribution from existing generation assets relative to the prior year comparable quarter. All other impacts reduced results by $0.07 per share, including the effects of increased interest expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.","As I mentioned earlier, we signed contracts for 760 megawatts of new projects since the last call. In addition to the 566 megawatts of wind for 2018 delivery, we successfully originated 164 megawatts of solar for delivery between 2018 and 2020, and the 30 megawatt battery storage project that will be paired with one of the solar PPAs. This project is the largest combined solar and storage facility in United States announced today. This strong quarter of origination activity is consistent with recent trends and reflective of continued strong customer demand driven largely by wind and solar economics. The combination of low cost wind or solar energy paired with a low cost battery storage solution provides a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a firm generation resource.","Today, we are able to offer this firm wind or solar resource for a lower cost than the operating cost of traditional inefficient generation resources. As we have previously discussed, with continued equipment cost declines and efficiency gains as the tax efficiencies phase down early in the next decade, we expect new firm wind and firm solar without incentives to be cheaper than the operating cost of coal, nuclear and less fuel efficient oil and gas fire generation units, creating significant opportunities for renewables growth going forward.","Our wind repowering efforts also continue to progress. As I previously mentioned, we added 514 megawatts to our repowering backlog, including approximately 241 megawatts of contractor projects that have new PPA extensions in place. Our wind repowering backlog now stands at over 2,300 megawatts, all for 2017 and 2018 delivery. During the quarter, Energy Resources successfully commissioned an additional 308 megawatts of wind repowering projects. We also closed our first tax equity financing related to wind repowering, raising roughly $243 million on a portfolio of 327 megawatts of projects.","We continue to expect to invest a total of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion for repowerings through 2020. The progress we have made this quarter reflects the continued strong outlook for renewables development and we believe that by leveraging Energy Resources' competitive advantages, we are well-positioned to capture a meaningful share of the wind and solar markets going forward.","The attached chart provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands. Beyond renewables, we continue to make good progress on the Mountain Valley Pipeline. Earlier this month, we received the FERC certificate for MVP. We are working to complete final development activities and expect to begin advancing construction efforts to support a December 2018 in service date. NextEra Energy's expected investment is approximately $1.1 billion.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the third quarter of 2017 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $847 million or $1.79 per share. NextEra Energy's 2017 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $875 million and $1.85 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate and Other segment increased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2016. Earlier this month, our transmission team was selected by the New York Independent System Operator to develop a 20-mile 345 kV transmission line in a company facility located near Buffalo, New York.","The project is New York ISO's first competitive transmission award under its Public Policy Transmission Planning Process. It will help the state to maximize the flow of energy from lower cost renewable generation. The project is required to be in service by June 2022 and our investment is expected to total roughly $180 million. We are very pleased with this recent success, and although a very competitive business, look to build on that success with other opportunities going forward.","For 2017, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.85. We currently expect lower growth in the fourth quarter as we are pursuing several refinancing initiatives to capitalize on favorable market conditions that could drive up to roughly $150 million of NPV savings on a cash basis, but will result in a reduction in net income when they close later this year.","For example, we recently announced the refinancing of $750 million of Capital Holdings hybrid securities. While this transaction produces more than $50 million of NPV savings on a cash basis, it will result in a net income reduction of approximately $13 million in the fourth quarter. Despite this, we continue to believe we are well positioned to achieve full year results at or near the upper end of our previously disclosed 6% to 8% adjusted earnings per share compound annual growth rate expectations off our 2016 base.","For the full year 2017, we expect cash flow from operations to grow above our adjusted EPS growth rate, after adjusting for impacts from certain FPL clause recoveries, storm costs and recoveries in the Indiantown acquisition.","Looking further ahead, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.80 to $7.30 for 2018 and in the range of $7.85 to $8.45 for 2020, applying a compound annual growth rate off a 2016 base of 6% to 8%. With the overall strength and diversity of our growth prospects of both FPL and Energy Resources, and based on everything we see now, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6% to 8% range through 2020.","We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018 off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always all of our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Although it is still premature to draw any firm conclusions, we wanted to provide an update on the potential impacts of the recent tax reform proposal on our long-term adjusted EPS expectations. We have modeled the scenario making certain assumptions based on the framework that was released on September 27 by the Trump administration, the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance.","Off our 2020 baseline, we would expect the scenario to be roughly $0.20 to $0.30 per share accretive. We continue to be actively engaged in the tax reform discussion and we'll provide further updates as the ultimate direction of and progress on tax reform becomes clear. In summary, NextEra Energy remains on track to meet its 2017 expectations and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future growth prospects. At FPL, our ongoing focus is on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making smart long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability, and efficiency of everything we do. At Energy Resources, we continue to make terrific progress on our development program and remain optimistic about our renewables growth prospects as a result of improving equipment costs and efficiencies and ongoing advancements in energy storage. Overall, we continue to believe that we have one of the best opportunity sets in our industry and that we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our growth expectations going forward.","Let me now turn to NEP. Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.3925 per common unit, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. We are pleased to announce that following approval by the Conflicts Committee of the NextEra Energy Partners Board, NEP has reached an agreement to acquire four additional assets from Energy Resources, adding to what we view as an already best-in-class portfolio with an average 18-year contract life and counterparty credit rating of A3 following the acquisition.","These assets are expected to further enhance the quality and diversity of NEP's existing portfolio and to complete the growth necessary to achieve our previously outlined year-end 2017 adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution run rate expectations. We expect the transaction, which is anticipated to be funded with the issuance of the $550 million of previously announced convertible preferred units and cash on hand, to yield a double-digit return to NEP's unitholders and to be accretive to LP distributions. I will provide additional details on the transaction in a few minutes.","Building upon the changes we have pursued this year to further improve NEP's investor value proposition, including the governance enhancements, the modified IDR structure, standalone credit ratings in the mid-to-high BB category, and the agreement to issue $550 million of convertible preferred units, NEP demonstrated its ability to access additional low-cost sources of capital this quarter with the issuances of $300 million of 3-year convertible debt and a total of $1.1 billion of 7-year and 10-year senior unsecured notes at historically low yields.","Today we are also announcing that we have upsized and extended NEP's revolving credit facility to further enhance NEP's financial flexibility and strengthen its standalone prospects going forward. I will provide additional details on each of these financings in just a moment.","Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today we are introducing December 31, 2018 run rate expectations reflecting roughly 22% and 17% growth, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2017 run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD midpoints. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution in NEP and are well positioned to meet our 2017 and longer-term expectations.","Now, let's look at the detailed results for NEP. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $178 million and cash available for distribution was $47 million, up approximately 2% and down roughly 8% from the prior year comparable quarter, respectively. Poor wind resource had a meaningful impact on NEP's assets. Fleet-wide wind resource was 82%, the lowest third quarter on record over the last 30 years, compared to 95% for the third quarter in 2016. Although still early in the fourth quarter, wind resource has begun to return to more normal levels in October. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by 15% and 10%, respectively. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.","As I previously mentioned, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $39.25 per common unit or $1.57 per common unit on an annualized basis, an increase of approximately 15% from a year earlier. NEP completed multiple financing transactions this quarter, further demonstrating its ability to access a variety of capital sources. In early September, NEP issued $300 million of convertible notes due in 2020 at a 1.5% coupon. The notes have the potential to convert into equity at a 25% premium to the September 6, 2017 closing price of $42.29.","Consistent with our desire to achieve the top end of NEP's growth expectations, the conversion rate has been structured to allow an approximate 15% annualized growth rate in distributions per unit without an adjustment to the conversion rate. Concurrently with the debt issuance, NEP purchased a capped call that provides economic and dilution protection up to a 50% premium to the September 6 closing price.","In September, NEP also issued $550 million of both 7-year and 10-year senior unsecured notes to refinance approximately $1.1 billion in existing secured holding company debt that had maturities in 2018 and 2019.","We believe the strong demand for the offering, which was more than 5.5 times oversubscribed is indicative of NEP's superior value proposition supported by diversified cash flows from long-term contracts with strong creditworthy counterparties.","The transaction priced at historical lows, including the lowest spread in coupon for a Ba1, BB U.S. dollar offering on the 7-year tranche and the lowest coupon for a Ba1, BB USD offering on the 10-year tranche.","As I just mentioned, today we are also announcing amendments to our existing revolving credit facility. In addition to lower borrowing rates, the facility will be upsized from $250 million to $750 million and the maturity will be extended from July 2019 to October 2022. We believe that the strong demand from 20 banks to participate in the amended credit facility is reflective of the core strengths that separate NEP from other infrastructure alternatives.","We continue to expect to target total HoldCo leverage to project distributions of 3 times to 4 times at year-end 2017, and consistent with NEP's credit ratings, total HoldCo leverage to project distributions of 4 times to 5 times over the longer term. We believe these leverage targets are supported by NEP's amortizing project debt and long-term contracted portfolio and are consistent with our experience in financing clean energy assets. As a result of this financing flexibility, aside from any modest issuances under the aftermarket program, or issuances upon the conversion of NEP's convertible securities, we continue to expect that NextEra Energy Partners will not need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest.","Beyond the new financings, the previously announced NEP governance enhancements which will give LP unitholders among other rights the ability to elect a majority of the NEP board beginning at the shareholder meeting to be held later this year, we also implemented during the quarter. As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NEP's portfolio with the agreement to acquire four additional assets from Energy Resources. This portfolio is a geographically diverse mix of wind and solar projects collectively consisting of approximately 691 megawatts, including the acquisition of a 25.9% indirect interest in the Desert Sunlight Solar Energy Center. The portfolio has a cash available for distribution weighted to remaining contract life of 22 years.","The transaction is expected to close by year-end subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and represents another step toward growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least 2022. NEP expects to acquire the portfolio for total consideration of approximately $812 million subject to working capital and other adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $459 million in liabilities related to tax equity financing and considers approximately $268 million of existing non-recourse project debt related to the Desert Sunlight project. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $185 million to $205 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $79 million to $89 million, each on a five-year average annual run rate basis beginning December 31, 2017.","The purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded through the issuance of $550 million of previously announced convertible preferred units with the balance funded with cash on hand as a result of NEP's recent convertible debt financing. Additional details are shown in the accompanying slide.","Following the acquisition of this portfolio from Energy Resources, we expect the NEP assets to support the previously announced December 31, 2017 run rate expectations, reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2017 for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million and CAFD of $310 million to $340 million. Since we currently expect today's announced acquisition to close later in the fourth quarter, we do not expect the portfolio to provide a meaningful contribution to fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA or cash available for distribution.","As I mentioned earlier, consistent with our previously announced long-term growth prospects, today we are introducing December 31, 2018 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $1.05 billion to $1.2 billion and CAFD of $360 million to $400 million, reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2018. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense.","From a base of our fourth quarter 2016 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.41, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2022. With the acquisitions announced today, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2017 distribution, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2018, to be at the top end of our previously disclosed range of $1.58 to $1.62 per common unit.","While we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the impact of tax reform on NEP, we expect that the most reasonable scenario is NEP's U.S. federal income tax shield, which is currently greater than 15 years and NEP's earnings to profits balance, which is currently expected to remain negative for at least the next eight years will not be materially affected.","We are pleased with the progress NEP has made over 2017 and we are well positioned to achieve our full year financial expectations. Upon the closing of the announced acquisition from Energy Resources, we have successfully executed on our growth strategy for the year. We believe NEP continues to provide a best-in-class investor value proposition. As we have previously outlined, NEP has the flexibility to grow in three ways, acquiring assets from Energy Resources organically or acquiring assets from other third parties. NEP also has a cost of capital and access to capital advantage with substantial flexibility to finance its long-term growth as was further demonstrated by the transactions completed this quarter. These advantages, together with the stability of NEP's cash flows backed by the portfolio's long-term average contract life and strong counterparty credit profile, amortizing debt, tax position, enhanced governance rights, and long-term growth expectations through at least 2022, all support NEP's favorable position relative to other yieldcos and MLPs. NextEra Energy Partners continues to make excellent progress against the strategic and growth initiatives and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about NEP's long-term prospects.","That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that we'll open the line for questions.","QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to check in on your excess balance sheet capacity and just generally your balance sheet strength. You've been putting up additional wins in the renewables business, and it looks like there's also upside at the utility. When we think about using that excess balance sheet capacity, do you see significant organic opportunities at the different business units? Or do you think you're likely to still have excess balance sheet capacity through the end of the decade?","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Okay. So first of all, the excess balance sheet capacity is about $3 billion to $5 billion through 2020. And when you look at the financial plan that we have laid out through 2020 at the Investor conference, the CapEx that we already have planned for the FPL business and the Energy Resources business does not take into account that $3 billion to $5 billion of excess balance sheet capacity. So what do we do with it? We have a few options. I think our preferred option would be to find incremental capital investment opportunities that drive long-term value for shareholders and that also help to create growth post-2020, which we view as being strong given all the potential growth platform opportunities that we have in the next decade, given where we see renewables and also given all the opportunities that FPL has on Eric's side of the business.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you. Just shifting gears to storage, you made some interesting remarks about storage, and I guess we are hearing that storage solicitations are now a regular part of a lot of renewable procurements. I was just curious to your opinion as to whether we're currently in the right zip code that you think many customers will opt for storage linked with renewables, or do you think that's a few years down the road? What's your sense of the likely customer appetite over the next couple of years for storage linked with renewables and PPA?","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Storage is very real now. And I think, as evidenced by the project we announced today with the 30 megawatts tied to an existing solar project, making it the largest combined solar plus storage project in the U.S. But when you look at where storage economics are, storage costs continue to come down significantly, efficiency continues to improve at a rate where we can now combine storage with solar and really, you know, beat the pricing, the existing variable cost just operate a nuclear or coal plant and be pretty darned competitive even with combined cycle gas facilities.","And what's the result of that? Because of that, on almost every solar procurement that we are betting on today counterparties are asking us not only for a solar bid, but also for a combined solar plus storage bid. They clearly understand the benefits that are created by the firm, dispatchability of the combined product. So the short answer is we're already here and things should only continue to improve as we go forward and as tax incentives phase down in the next decade and you can combine storage, which will be even lower cost, even more efficient with an even lower cost and more efficient solar panel and balance of system cost. We see that as a very viable product going forward and we also are continuing to look for opportunities to combine solar with wind or storage with wind. And with that, I don't know if Armando has anything that he would like to add?","Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Hey Stephen, real quick. Recall that at the Investor Conference, what we laid out was roughly $700 million of CapEx opportunities in the storage market through 2020. We continue to think that's a good number. That doesn't mean that customers aren't significantly interested in what's going on and proactively asking for bids. And even as the cost estimate comes down, we continue to believe that this is going to be a significant opportunity early part of the next decade.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's super helpful. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Fleishman, Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just one question on the NEP financing for the new drops. Could you just repeat kind of the financing plan that you laid out for the new drops yesterday?","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely, Steve. So for the new drops remember right around the time of the investor conference, we completed the $550 million convertible preferred offering at a 4.5% coupon, lowest coupon ever for a convertible offering. That will comprise the lion's share of the $812 million equity price for that acquisition. The balance will come from cash on hand, that cash on hand is really coming from the convertible debt offering that we closed on in September at a 1.5% coupon, was up 25% and then the capped call on top of that given us economic consideration up to \u2013 up 50%.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","We go next to Greg Gordon, Evercore Partners.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","The first is, you've reclassified a significant chunk of your wind assets from merchant to contract and then there's a footnote that describes why, but could you go into some more detail as to what the underlying assumptions are that with regard to the profitability of those assets and why they've shifted?","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. It's really pretty simple. So those are repowering assets that were formally ERCOT merchant assets. And the way the economics works is that roughly 90% of the gross margin comes from the production tax credit, so 90% of the gross margin comes from the Production Tax Credit, so you can think of the PTC as essentially being a contractual head. So every megawatt hour that we're generating, we're getting paid $24 on that megawatt hour for 90% of the gross margin. And so given that and also the fact that some of those projects will carry financial hedges going forward, the more appropriate classification over the next 10 years during the PTC period is as a contracted asset.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Well, that makes a pretty underlying strong statement about the incremental IRR we're getting on the repowerings of the vast majority of your return at the hurdle rate is coming just from getting the PTCs without worrying about a substantial energy margin, is that the right way to think about it?","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Well, yeah, I mean, remember too, I mean it's about half the CapEx and because it's half the CapEx you're getting the driver from the PTCs, and then energy is the upside. That's why we've said the unlevered IRRs are a few ticks up from what we would get on a newbuild wind project.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Fantastic. My second question is, if you would humor us, can you delineate what the basic assumptions you're assuming are in your baseline tax case?","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean it's really what came out on September 27, so you can think of it as a 20% corporate tax rate, 100% immediate expensing and then we've made an assumption on what the interest limitation is that I'm probably not going to share on this call.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Fair enough, but the industry EI has been lobbying on behalf of the industry to try and achieve an off-ramp or an exemption on interest deductibility and bonus depreciation, correct?","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Well, I'll let Jim take it.","James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.","So, Greg, listen. I just think on tax reform, it's very fluid right now. Obviously the industry has been weighing in. I've been spending a lot of time on it. And we don't even have a bill out of House Ways and Means yet. So I think it's too early really to say anything about where any of this, where any of this stands other than you can rest assured I'm highly engaged on this.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Have a good day.","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","We'll go to Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hey, guys. Couple of questions. One probably for Armando, which is, can you talk about, when you think about your renewable pipeline, how much of that is the counterparty, a traditional regulated utility versus how much of it is a corporate entity, whether a big tech company or someone else?","Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.","So, Michael, right now for us I'd say 90% of what we're doing is probably the more traditional customers and those could be the rate-regulated utilities or the munis and co-ops. And I'd say 5% to 10% are the latter, which you asked about or the corporate entities, what we call C&I companies. We continue to see more C&I companies out there and actually we are engaging in that business more proactively today than we have in the past. I would expect for us that 5% to 10% to go up.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, guys, how are you thinking about the Section 201 case and some of the recent developments and what that could do if any to solar-related demands, really for 2018 solar demands, but even for the next few years?","James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.","So Michael, this is Jim. Obviously, it's something that we're watching very closely. I think, I spoke on this issue in September. We're fine in 2017 and 2018, because we pre-bought our panels when we saw this going on. 2019 is probably the year we're most concerned about. That's probably where there is a potentially a pinch point depending on where the ITC comes out and where the administration comes out on this. Post-2019, I think there's going to be, the market's going to \u2013 the market will have time to react to whatever happens and I think we'll get back to normal business in 2020 and beyond. But 2019 is our focus and we're working quite hard on a number of fronts and it's something that we're watching closely and we're highly engaged on it and the whole team is highly engaged on it across the board.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","We'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Actually let me start real quickly on the 201 issue there, if I can. What are you expecting when you talk about 2019 and really beyond that in terms of market reaction? I mean, what's your kind of playbook as far as you see this playing out right now?","And then secondly, what is your expectation in terms of the positioning of parties and thinking about how this could actually play out over the next few months? Is a settlement possible, et cetera, to make this a little bit more palatable?","James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.","So Julian, it's Jim again. I just think it's too early to tell what's going to happen here and I think \u2013 you know, honestly, there's a pretty broad range of potential outcomes on this and I wouldn't care to speculate on what's going to happen. I think we'll see where \u2013 and what we're doing is frankly scenario planning across a variety of different outcomes and making sure that we're going to be prepared in case of any potential outcome.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Well, and looking beyond the current 2020 period, you guys have done a fantastic job in the repowering side thus far. I'm curious, how are you thinking about repowering opportunities under kind of a sub-100% PTC, call it 80%, 60%? I mean, you've been pretty forward-looking before across the industry and this seems like an opportunity to pivot. Are you engaging with parties on that front? I mean, do you have an expectation for an ability to use those PTCs that are expire \u2013 say, 2012, 2013 and 2014 vintage projects as they come off in the early part of the next decade and repower those?","Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Hey, Julian. This is Armando. (54:18)","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm just thinking in the longer term. Yeah.","Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Look, most of what \u2013 not most, just about everything of what we're doing today is to make sure that we can grab the \u2013 as many of these repowering opportunities through 2020 having safe harbored a good part of that equipment in order to get the 100% production tax credits. There's already been, excuse me, one entity out there, which I'm sure you've seen that has announced a project where they would be getting 80% production tax credits and the economics work for them under that scenario. Our expectation is that when the production tax credit goes down to 80%, that there are actually going to be some repowering opportunities that are going to work, maybe not necessarily for the reasons that some might believe. When we're looking at repowering opportunities, one of the things that we're looking at it is how close is the old asset, if you will, to the end of its PTC life, right?","And if it's nine or ten years into its life, taking the asset down and repowering it and putting it up and getting 100% PTCs for ten years might work. But if it's at the end of 2020, if it's only gone through seven years, let's say, you wouldn't necessarily want to repower the asset at that point and lose three years of the old PTCs. But if you wait another year, now you're at eight years or nine years, it may actually make sense to give up one year of the old PTCs and get ten years of the 80% PTCs. So that scenario planning is something that we are spending a little bit of time right now. We certainly have a lot of assets that would be subject to that. But I do believe that there are going to be repowering opportunities that work with 80% PTCs.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Well, thank you all very much.","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Ridzon, KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. John, I think on the second quarter call, you said look for most of the second half growth to hit the fourth quarter, I'm just kind of trying to calibrate, we saw a 6.5% growth in the third quarter here. Did some of that growth shift quarters, and then just how do I think about the subpar wind resource you had in the quarter? How does that figure into the (56:46) numbers?","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So, by the time of the second quarter call, we were pretty well into July, which was not a terrific wind resource month. We were concerned about the trend for the rest of the quarter for August and September, August ended up kind of following suit with July and we were a little bit surprised because September rebounded a little bit more than we had expected, I think September ended up being about 95% of normal, now we've seen October has truly rebounded so far this month. That was part of it. We had a little bit better performance out of other miscellaneous parts of the business, none worth pointing out individually that when added up put us in a little bit better position than what we were expecting for the quarter including some origination activity that we had on the business.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And so we think about that incremental positive as essentially being offset in the fourth quarter by the refinancings you talked about?","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. And so, the fourth quarter, that's why I think I made the comment that growth would be down a little bit in the fourth quarter. We have really been focused on liability management. When you look at our portfolio \u2013 one of things that I've made a comment on at the investor conference is, if you look at our financing portfolio, we have one of the longest average tenors combined with one of the lowest average interest rates of any of our peers. And that's because we constantly look at the portfolio for refinancing activity opportunities. And those are the opportunities we're looking to execute on in the fourth quarter. The remarks were that the MPV could be as high as $150 million, obviously those come with some prepayment penalties that do have some book impacts associated with them, but we're just trying to continue our trend of being very mindful that we're in an attractive low interest rate environment and looking at the balance sheet as we always do, to be opportunistic, and that's what you can expect to be reflected in the fourth quarter results.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And you don't treat those kind of one-timey make wholes or anything as unusual items?","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","No. We've flown through.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yep. Thanks, Paul.","Operator","We'll go next to Shar Pourreza, Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, everyone. Just a quick follow-up on the battery storage comments, John. The Dania filings that you filed for showed that the asset was materially more economical than battery storage and solar, even in the 2022 timeframe. So I'm curious on sort of how that fits in with your viewpoint that batteries, plus solar could be economical with the CCGT? And then just a follow-up on Dania is looking at FPL's gas assets, there are other plants that fit to similar economics as sort of the plant that you're converting. So I'm kind of curious if the Dania plant is a one-off and do you see other opportunities thus far?","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I think we'll just tackle the Dania piece first. The Dania piece first is, one, you got to consider its location, I mean, it's in South Florida, it has a transmission advantage given its location. If you look at the economics on the reduced O&M, on improving the fuel efficiency of that facility, given its location, that's why that one works. We continue to look for other opportunities, we have the 50-megawatt battery storage pilot program in Florida where we will look to do a lot of the same things we've done on the Energy Resources side including the project we announced today where we can actually combine our storage capability with newbuild solar in Florida. And those opportunities will come about not only through the eight facilities we're currently building, but then the 6,300 post-2018. Where exactly they will end up will depend on where they are located in the overall economics of those facilities. But it's a terrific opportunity for Florida to take advantage of the same opportunities that our regulated customer base outside of Florida are looking for. Jim?","James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Shar, this is Jim. Just one other thing on storage and renewable competitiveness is, we see storage and renewables really competing very well against inefficient old operating nuclear and coal plants where you look at the economics of those sites, they're anywhere from $0.04 to $0.05 on a cash cost per kilowatt hour basis to operate. These new CCGGs, particularly in a constrained place like Dania Beach are very, very cost effective and super fuel efficient and typically you wouldn't see renewables and storage competing with that just yet.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Turnure, JPMorgan.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Given you guys probably have maybe six or so months to go to kind of finish out the 2017 to 2018 bucket of renewable backlog, could you just give us an update on how you might fall out within that 4 gigawatt range, you're coming up on the bottom now. Will any of it kind of spill into 2019 in terms of your maybe original expectations? Has anything changed in the last three to six months?","John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So first, we're already there on solar, not only there on solar for 2017 and 2018, we're pretty darn close to our range for 2019 and 2020. And we look to continue to add to that obviously going forward. And then on the wind side, given the 760 megawatt total portfolio today, the wind additions that were part of that, we're within striking distance on wind and I'll let Armando fill in the details or kind of his viewpoint.","Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.","So for wind, and this is \u2013 this has been the case for a long time, right. When folks are looking for wind, they're looking out much shorter \u2013 at a much shorter time period. One of the things that I'm honestly most happy about so far in this cycle is we have almost 900 megawatts of wind signed up already for 2019 and 2020. But when you're focused on 2017 and 2018 and particularly on wind, there's the current \u2013 there's just the recent history that we announced today of signing 560 megawatts of 2018 wind.","And I can tell you that we are working on a pretty decent backlog for additional 2018 wind right now, whether that happens or not, it depends. Customers understand that if they wait a little longer that the prices could be a little cheaper, and so you're always fighting that. But I was very pleasantly surprised with the 566 megawatts we signed for 2018 this past quarter, and my expectation is that that number in 2018 will continue to go up, just as it has in the past, just because wind has a shorter timeframe.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is it fair to say that's kind of the higher half or the upper half of the range is still achievable for 2017 to 2018?","Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.","You know, it's \u2013 I think though, I think honestly all of the numbers in that range are achievable. And if all I wanted to do was to meet the higher end of the range on wind for 2017 and 2018, we could probably do that, but that's not necessarily always the right thing to do, right? I mean, you may be talking customers into building something in 2019 and 2020, because it's better economics for us honestly, than it could be for 2018. So every situation is different. Again, I'm happy at this point that we've signed almost 900 megawatts for 2019 and 2020, and that we still have a pretty decent backlog of 2018 opportunities that we have been shortlisted on.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful color. And then maybe, John or Jim, given the stock performance has been as strong as it has year-to-date, just kind of maybe going back to an earlier question on cash return versus dividend or incremental investment opportunities versus buybacks. Does the stock performance kind of lower the hurdle to deploy capital into other investments or to return cash to shareholders through a bigger dividend increase maybe than previously expected?","James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.","So Chris, this is Jim. Listen, we remain very disciplined in how we evaluate all our incremental opportunities. We're looking hard at a lot of different things to continue to deploy that excess balance sheet capacity very profitably for us going forward. And that's going to be our focus, but as always, we're not going to do dumb stuff either, we're going to be very disciplined about it. And we'll be \u2013 on the dividends, we will be \u2013 we just had a discussion with the board about the dividend in October, we'll have another one in December and will be coming out with our post-2018 dividend policy in February once the board finalizes where they're going to come out on that. So, more to come on the dividend.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sounds great. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","James L.

Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners enjoyed strong fourth quarters and ended 2015 with excellent results. NextEra Energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.71 which was a penny higher than the upper end of the range we discussed going into the year and up 8% from 2014. We also experienced double digit growth in operating cash flow and continue to maintain our strong financial position and credit profile. NextEra Energy Partners successfully executed the acceleration of its growth plan despite the challenges of difficult capital market conditions in the second half of the year and grew its fourth quarter distribution per unit by 58% versus the comparable prior year quarter with a distribution of $0.3075 or a $1.23 on an annualized basis. ","Before taking you through the detailed result let me begin by summarizing some additional highlights. At Florida Power and Light we continue to invest in the business in 2015 with a focus on delivering value to customers. And all of our major capital initiatives remain on track. Since the last call we received Florida PSE approval of the 2019 need for a planned Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. We expect this project to further advance our focus on providing clean, reliable and cost effective energy for our customers consistent with our long term strategy. We continue to work hard at FPL to further enhance what we consider to be an already outstanding customer value proposition. Our customers enjoy electric service that is cleaner and more reliable than ever before while our typical residential customer bill is the lowest among reporting utilities in the state of Florida and is approximately 14% lower than it was a decade ago.","Despite a challenging summer lightning season FPL delivered its best ever full year period of service reliability in 2015 and was recognized as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. This was accomplished as we continued to invest to make the grids stronger, smarter and more responsive and resilient to outage conditions. Our performance is the direct result of our focus on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and the long term investments we\u2019ve made to improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do. And 2015 was an excellent period of execution by the FPL team.","At Energy Resources 2015 was an outstanding period of performance for our contracted renewables development program. New renewables project additions drove financial results while origination results for new projects to be placed into service by the end of 2016 exceeded the expectations that we discussed at our March Investor Conference. The longer term outlook beyond 2016 also continued to develop favorably. The team signed contracts for a total of approximately 2,100 megawatts of new renewables projects over the last year making this our second best year ever for renewables origination performance.","We continue to believe that Energy Resources is well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in our recent history. We now have greater certainty regarding federal tax incentives for renewables, as Congress took action in December to extend the 2014 wind PTC and the 2016 solar ITC programs over a five year phase down period. We expect that the IRS will provide starter construction guidance with the two year Safe Harbor period for wind and solar similar in form to what was put in place for the 2014 PTC. The certainty regarding tax incentives will provide planning stability which we think in turn will serve as a bridge to further equipment cost decline and efficiency improvements that will enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with combined cycle technology when tax incentives are phased down. ","In the meantime with tax incentives both wind and solar will be very competitive and in addition to the favorable impact of tax policy we expect the carbon reduction requirements under the EPA's clean power plan to significantly drive demand for new renewables as we move into the next decade. Finally we expect low natural gas prices to continue to force coal-to-gas and coal-to-renewables switching, with new renewables supported by the factors I just mentioned.","Driven in large part by our enthusiasm about our renewables growth prospects in the middle of last year we increased our expectation for NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share to 6% to 8% through 2018 off a 2014 base. These increased expectations will in turn affect our capital expenditure plans for renewables development program which we will update on the first quarter earnings call in April. Across the portfolio both Energy Resources and FPL continue to deliver excellent operating performance. The fossil, nuclear and renewables generation fleets had one of their best periods ever with E4 or the equivalent forced outage rate at less than 1.5% for the full year.","Similar to NextEra Energy NEP also delivered on all of its financial expectations, NEP grew its portfolio through the acquisition of economic interest in over 1,000 megawatts of contracted renewables projects from Energy Resources with total ownership increasing by over 1,200 megawatts and established its presence in the long term contracted natural gas pipeline space with the acquisition of seven natural gas pipelines in Texas. This acquisition is expected to reduce the impact resource variability as in the portfolio and extend NEP's runway of potential dropdown assets.","All of the same factors that favor growth in new renewables for Energy Resources likewise should benefit NEP. The strong renewables origination performance at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of generating and other assets potentially available for sale to NextEra Energy Partners now and in the future.","In contrast to many other U-cos [ph], NEP does not have the same dependence on third party acquisitions to grow but rather can reasonable expect to acquire projects that have been organically developed by its best in class sponsor. We continue to believe that the strength of its sponsor and the ability to demonstrate a strong and highly visible runway for future growth is a core strength of the NEP value proposition which is but one of many factors that distinguish it from other U-cos.","As we head into 2016 both NextEra Energy and NEP remain well positioned to deliver on their financial expectations subject to the usual drivers of variability including in particular renewable resource variability. FPL benefits from a surplus amortization balance of $263 million which is expected to position it to earn at the upper half of its ROE range while it continues to execute on its capital investment initiatives for the benefit of customers. In addition the rate case will obviously be a core focus area for FPL in 2016. ","At Energy Resources the business plan is built around the contribution from new investments and executing on the development and construction of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new renewables scheduled to go commercial by the end of the year. Meanwhile NEP entered 2016 with a solid run rate and the flexibility necessary to execute its growth plans. In summary we are very optimistic about our prospects for another strong year.","Now let's look at our results for the fourth quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter of 2015 FPL reported net income of $365 million or $0.79 per share up $0.14 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2015 FPL reported net income of $1.6 billion or $3.63 per share up $0.18 per share versus 2014.","Regulatory capital employed grew 6.8% for 2015 which translated to net income growth of 8.6% for the full year with fourth quarter performance leading in the way. Regulatory capital employed continued to growth through the year. In additionally to being the first full quarters since the closing of the Cedar Bay transaction in September, fourth quarter results were also impacted by timing effect and a number of smaller items, including outstanding performance under our asset optimization program.","As a reminder, FPL's current rate agreement provides an incentive mechanism for sharing with customers gains that we achieve in excess of threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities. In 2014, these activities produced roughly $67 million of incremental value, of this amount $54 million was for the benefit for Florida customers. Under the sharing mechanism which only applies once customer saving exceed $46 million, FPL was permitted to record approximately $13 million of pre-tax income in the fourth quarter of 2015. Consistent with the expectations that we shared with you previously, our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended December 2015. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period.","During the fourth quarter, aided by the impact of usually warm weather we utilized only $67 million of reserve amortization. This brings our accumulative utilization of reserve amortization since 2013 to $107 million, leaving us a balance of $263 million which can be utilized in 2016. In 2016, we expect to use the balance of the reserve amortization to offset growing revenue requirements due to increased investments. We expect to reserve amortization balance along with our current sales CapEx and O&M expectations to support regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% in 2016.","As always our expectations assume among other things normal weather and operating conditions. Fourth quarter retail sales increased 11.7% from the prior year comparable period and we estimate that approximately 9.6% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage for customer. On weather normalized basis, fourth quarter sales increased 2.1% comprised of continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% and increased weather normalize usage per customer of approximately 0.7%. As a reminder our estimates of weather normalized usage per customer are subject to greater uncertainty and periods with relatively strong weather comparisons like we have seen throughout 2015.","For the full year 2015, retail sales increased 5.6% compared to 2014. After adjusted for the effects of weather full year 2015 retail sales increased 1.2%, weather normalized underlying usage for the year decreased 0.3% and looking ahead we continue to expect year-over-year weather normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year. ","The economy in Florida continues to grow on a healthy rate with strong jobs growth reflected in consistently low rates of seasonally adjusted unemployment around levels last seen in early 2008. And over a 1 million jobs have been added from the low in December 2009, though the pace of jobs growth is beginning to slow. Leading indicators in the real estate sector continue to reflect the strong Florida housing market and the December rating of Florida's consumer sentiment remained close to post-recession highs. ","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, beginning with the reporting change. We have reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our natural gas pipeline investments and the management of these projects within our gas infrastructure activities at Energy Resources. As you may recall our upstream gas infrastructure activities has not only better informed our hedging decisions but have also led the opportunities in gas reserves to benefit Florida customers and the acquisition development and construction of natural gas pipelines. Our reporting for energy resources now includes the results of our natural gas pipeline projects, formally reported in the corporate and other segment, while our 2014 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, the effects are minimal due to the prior immaterial contribution from these projects during early stages of development. ","Contributions from the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP in October are also included in the Energy Resources results for 2015. Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $156 million, or $0.34 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $185 million or $0.40 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was flat against the prior year comparable period which primarily reflects the contributions from new investments being offset by higher corporate G&A and interest expenses. ","For the full year 2015, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.1 billion or $2.41 per share. Adjusted earnings were $926 million or $2.04 per share. Energy Resources full year adjusted EPS increased $0.14 per share despite a significant headwind associated with poor wind resource versus 2014, which was largely offset by strong results in our customer supply and trading business. These improved customer supply and trading results reflect in-part a returns in more normal levels of profitability in the first quarter following the adverse effects of the polar vortex conditions in 2014. While wind resource was approximately 96% of the long-term average in 2015, other factors including and particular icing in the fourth quarter and other production losses, reduced production by another 2%.","New investments added $0.31 per share, consistent with a reported change that I've just mentioned, this includes $0.04 per share of contributions from our gas pipeline projects, reflecting the addition of the Texas pipeline acquired by NEP to the portfolio as well as continued development work on the Florida pipelines in Mountain Valley project. New renewable investments added $0.27 per share, reflecting continued strong growth in our portfolio of contracted wind and solar projects. In 2015 alone we commissioned approximately 1,200 megawatts of new wind projects and approximately 285 megawatts of new solar projects.","Contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities which declined by $0.02 per share were negatively impacted by increased depreciation expense as a result of higher depletion rates. Based on market conditions we elected not to invest capital and drilling certain wells, which resulted in our earlier recognition of income through the value of the hedges we had in place, although this helped mitigate other negative effects in 2015, including higher depletion rates, below commodity price environment presents a challenge for these activities going forward.","Partially offsetting the growth in the business was a negative impact of $0.22 per share, reflecting higher interest in corporate expenses, including increased development activity in light of what we consider to be a very positive landscape for the renewable business. Results also were impacted by negative $0.06 per share of share dilution, while benefiting from the absence of charges associated with the 2014 launch of NEP. Additional details for our results are shown on the accompanying slide. ","Energy Resources full year adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 9%, cash flow from operations excluding the impact of working capital increased approximately 14%. As we did last year, we have included a summary in the appendix of the presentation that compares Energy Resources adjusted EBITDA by asset category to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2014.","As I mentioned earlier 2015 was an outstanding period of performance for new wind and solar origination, since our last earnings call we have signed contracts for an additional 206 megawatts of wind projects for 2015 delivery. With these additions we have exceeded the expectations we shared at our March 2015 Investor Conference for our 2015 to 2016 development program. The accompanying chart updates information on each of our programs now stand. We have also signed contracts in California and Ontario for storage projects to enter service in the next couple of years. Although it is early in the technology life cycle, we are successfully originating source projects that support our expectations to invest up to $100 million per year, in order to maintain our competitive position with regard to this important emerging technology. ","For all the reasons, I've mentioned earlier, we continue to believe that the fundamental outlook for our renewable business has never been stronger and we are working on an update to our capital expenditure expectations for our 2017 to 2018 development program. It is important to keep in mind that because these projects drive growth upon entering commercial operation, the greatest potential benefits are to 2019 and beyond. For 2016, we believe that our development program is largely complete other than one or two additional opportunities that we're pursuing.","Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipeline projects that are now reported in the Energy Resources segment. The Florida pipelines remain on track and we expect to be in a position to receive FERC approval early this year to support construction beginning the mid-2016 and an expected in-service state in mid-2017. As a reminder, NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be approximately $1 billion and $550 million respectively. And FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines. ","The Mountain Valley's pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process than filed its formal application in October 2015. We continue to see market interest in the pipeline and we'll pleased to announce earlier this month the addition of Consolidated Edison as a shipper on the line as well as the addition of Con Edison Gas Midstream as a partner. We continue to expect approximately 2 bcf per day, 20 year firm capacity commitment to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. With the addition of Con Edison our ownership share in this project now stands at approximately 31% and our expected investment is roughly $1 billion. ","Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $135 million and cash available for distribution was $75 million. During the quarter, the assets in the NEP portfolio operated well, overall renewable resource was generally in line with our long-term expectations and the acquisitions of the Texas pipeline in Jericho were far more completed as planned. Overall 2015 was a successful year of execution against our growth objectives, consistent with our decision to accelerate the growth of NEP the portfolio grew throughout the year to support our fourth quarter distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 58% against the 2014 comparable fourth quarter distribution.","Also consistent with the range of expectations that we have shared, full year adjusted EBITDA was approximately $404 million and cash available for distribution was $126 million. Clearly 2015 had its challenges as well, changes in market conditions not only affected our financing plan in 2015 but also led us to pursue additional options to be more flexible and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets going forward.","On the last call we announced an after-market equity issuance or dribble program for up to $150 million at NEP. At the same time NextEra Energy also announced a program to purchase from time to time based on market conditions and other considerations up to $150 million of NEP's outstanding common units. During the quarter NEP completed the sale of over 887,000 common units raising approximately $26 million under the ATM program.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the fourth quarter of 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $507 million or a $1.10 per share. NextEra Energy's 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $530 million and a $1.17 per share respectively. For the full year of 2015 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.8 billion or $6.06 per share. Adjusted earnings were roughly $2.6 billion or $5.71 per share. Our earnings per share results for the year account for dilution associated with the settlement of our forward agreement of 6.6 million shares that occurred in December of 2014 and the June and September settlements totaling approximately 16 million shares associated with the equity units issued in 2012.","The impact of dilution on full year results was approximately $0.17 per share. The issuance of additional shares is consistent both with our strategy of maintaining a strong financial position and with our ability to grow adjusted EPS at 6% to 8% per year over a multiyear period. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segments increased $0.09 per share compared to 2014, primarily due to investment gains and the absence of debt returning to losses incurred in 2014.","NextEra Energy's operating cash flow adjusted for the potential impacts of certain FPL clause recoveries and the Cedar Bay acquisition grew by 16% in 2015 and as expected we maintained our strong credit position which remains an important competitive advantage in a capital intensive industry. ","At FPL we will continue to focus on excellent execution and delivering outstanding value to our customers. In addition the right case we're seeing will be a core area focus that is likely to occupy much of 2016 and I will discuss this more in just a moment. With regard to delivering on our customer value proposition and executing on our major capital initiatives of FPL we will focus on completing our generation modernization project at Fort Everglades, constructing our peaker upgrades at Lauderdale and Fort Myers and delivering the three new large scale solar projects and our other additional investments to maintain and upgrade our infrastructure.","At Energy Resources growth will continue to come primarily through the addition of new renewables and continued construction of our gas pipeline projects which we expect to more than offset PTC roll off of approximately $37 million. We feel better than ever about the quality of our renewables development pipeline and as we said in the last call, over the next few years we expect to as much as double the development resources committed to our wind and solar origination and development capabilities in order to seize an even larger share of a growing North American renewables market.","Headwinds could come from the potential impact of El Nino on wind resource in the first half of the year and current weak commodity price environment. With regard to weak commodity prices we evaluated our generation portfolio for markets where we expect low prices for sustained periods of time. As a result of that exercise we took steps at the end of last year to reduce approximately 40% of our merchant generation capacity by entering into a contract to sell our [indiscernible] natural gas fired generating assets located in ERCOT.","Once closed the sale is expected to be slightly accretive to our EPS and credit profile and will generate $450 million in net cash proceeds that will be recycled into a long term contract renewables business. We remain well hedged through 2018 and will continue to evaluate our other merchant generating assets for potential capital recycling opportunities. ","With regard to our upstream gas infrastructure business sustained weak commodity prices of course means fewer new drilling opportunities, other things equal and we have reduced our expectations of future growth from this part of the portfolio. When we elect to drill we hedge most of our expected gas and oil production for up to seven years. In cases where we have elected not to drill we have as we did in the fourth quarter liquidated the hedges that were put in place which generally allows us to recover a portion of our original investment on those wells that we had planned to drill. ","At the corporate level we don't expect our financing plan in 2016 to require equity and if there would be a need we would expect it to be modest. Similar to previous years we will work to maintain a strong balance sheet with a flexible and opportunistic financing plan and a focus on capital recycling opportunities. Also as I just mentioned we plan to evaluate capital recycling opportunities within our merchant generation portfolio as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long-term contract in rate regulated.","Earlier this month, we filed a test year letter with the Florida PEC to initiate a new rate proceeding for rates beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. FPL was finalized in base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next four years through 2017 through 2020, while the details of the number are still being finalized. We expect a proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $860 million started in January 2017, $265 million started in January 2018, and $200 million upon commission of the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center in mid-2019 with no base rate adjustment in 2020.","Based on these adjustments combined with current projections for fuel and other cost we believe that FPLs current typical bill for January 2016 will grow at about 2.8% roughly the expected rate of inflation through the end of 2020. When thinking about the rate case, there are four key points to keep in mind. First, we're proposing a four year rate plan which provides customers' a higher degree of predictability with regard to the future cost of electricity. Second, from the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPL is planning to invest a total of nearly $16 billion with additional significant investment expected in 2018 and beyond to meet the growing needs of Florida\u2019s economy and continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other cost flow, while the benefits of building a stronger, smarter grade and a cleaner more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers through higher service reliability and lower bill, you must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates. ","Third, you may recall that FPL is required to file the comprehensive depreciation study as part of the rate case, the appreciation study to be filed with this rate case reflects the investment that FPL has made since the last study in 2009. Based on the changing mix of assets and the recoverable life span, the resulted impact of the study is roughly a $200 million increase in annual depreciation expense. Fourth, we expect to request a performance adder of 0.5% as part of FPLs allowed regulatory ROE, compared with peer utilities in the southeast and coastal U.S. FPL has the cleanest carbon emission rate, the most cost efficient operations, the highest reliability and the lowest customer bills. But an allowed ROE midpoint is below the average of those pure utilities. We believe that the proposal for a performance adder presents an opportunity to reflect FPLs current superior value proposition and encouraged continued strong performance.","The estimated impact of the three base rate adjustments phased in during the four year period would total of approximately $13 per month or $0.43 per day on the base portion of a typical residential bill. FPL has worked hard to deliver service that is ranked amongst the cleanest and most reliable to the lowest cost and has made the decision to seek relief only after a thorough review of the financial projections. Since 2001, FPLs investments in high efficiency natural gas synergy have saved customers more than $8 billion on fuel, while preventing 95 million tons of carbon emissions. In addition, while the cost of many materials and products that the company must purchase in order to provide affordable reliable power have increased and the energy demand of Florida customers are growing with the projected addition of nearly 220,000 new service accounts during the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPLs focused on efficiency and productivity that significantly lessened the bill impact.","Compared with the average utilities O&M cost FPLs innovative practices and processes save customers nearly $2 billion a year or approximately $17 per month for the average customer. Through its focus on cost reduction FPL ranks best in class among major U.S. utilities or having the lowest operating and maintenance expenses measured on a cost per kilowatt hour of retail sales. In additional, while other utilities around the country are facing potentially higher cost to comply with the EPAs going power plant, FPL is already well positioned and comply with the targets in Florida. ","Today, FPLs typical residential bill was about 20% lower than the stated average and about 30% lower than the national average and we expect it will continue to be among the lowest and lower than it was ten years ago in 2006, even with our requested base rate increases. We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in March. The timeline for the proceeding will ultimately be determine by the commission, but we currently expect that we'll have hearings in the third quarter with the final commission decision in the fourth quarter in time for new rates to go into effect in January 2017.","As always we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement. Over a period in the last 17 years FPL has entered into five multi-year settlement agreement that have provide a customer with a degree of rate stability and certainty. Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers and we'll continue to provide update throughout the process. ","Turning now to expectations, for 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 and in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, applying a compound annual growth rate of a 2014 base of 6% to 8% we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12 to 14% per year through at least 2018 of a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. ","As always our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Before moving on let me take a moment to discuss the expected impacts on the business of the recent phased down extension of bonus depreciation. Let me start by saying that we had already assumed the extension of bonus depreciation in our 2016 financial expectations. In addition after analyzing the recent extension we do not expect bonus depreciation to impact in NextEra Energy's earnings per share expectations through 2018.","At NEP as I mentioned earlier, yesterday the board declared a fourth quarter distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 per common unit on an annualized basis representing the 58% increase over the comparable distribution a year earlier. From this base we continue to see 12 to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020 subject to our usual caveats. As a result we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of a $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit. ","The December 31, 2015 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $540 million to $580 million, and cap fee of $190 million to $220 million reflect calendar year 2016 expectations for the portfolio at yearend December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2016 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and cap fee of $210 million to $290 million reflect calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at yearend December 31, 2016.","Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and our net of expected IDRPs as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. As we have said before in the long run in order for NEP to serve its intended purpose we need to be able to access the equity markets at reasonable prices. For 2016 beyond the ATM program, we continue to plan to issue a modest amount of NEP public equity to finance the growth included in our December 31, 2016 annual run rate. However we will be smart, flexible and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets.","If the equity markets are not accessible at reasonable prices we expect to have sufficient debt capacity at NEP that together with proceeds rates or at the market dribble program should be sufficient to finance currently planned 2016 transaction. Where conditions are appropriate one alternative would be to raise equity privately, prefunding drops before they are publicly announced. However this is just one option that we're considering and we may access the equity markets in other ways when market conditions permit. In addition we expect our drops to be smaller in magnitude in order to manage the capital required to finance the acquisitions. ","As I mentioned earlier the at the market dribble program has proven to be successful as NEP raised approximately $26 million of equity during the fourth quarter and we will continue to seek opportunities to use this program to help finance potential future acquisitions. We continue to believe it is important that we remained focused on the fundamentals and given the strength of NEP's sponsor and the prospects for future renewables development the NEP value proposition which relies on projects organically developed by Energy Resources rather than third party acquisitions for growth is the best in the space. ","We plan to continue to be patient with NEP and have taken the necessary steps to provide time for recovery at the equity markets. NEP benefits from a strong sponsor, de-risked and long term contracted cash flows with an average contract life of 19 years, strong counterparty credit and projects that in many cases have been financed predominantly through mortgage style financing that provides long term protection against interest rate volatility. We remain optimistic that the NEP's financing model can and will work going forward. In summary we have excellent prospects for growth. The environment for new renewables development has never been stronger and FPL, Energy Resources and NEP each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board.","The progress we made in 2015 reinforces our longer term growth prospects and while we have a lot to execute in 2016 we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year. With that we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Steven Bird with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.","Steven Bird","Wanted to just check in on the solar valid initiative, it looks like consumers for smart solar which you had supported has gotten the votes necessary. Could you just speak to the process for getting this on the ballot and just what we should be looking at going forward there?","Eric Silagy","Sure, hi Steven good morning its Eric Silagy, so the necessary votes were secured signatures, those have been verified and it\u2019s just two tests, there is a number of votes or signature I should say and then also a number of congressional districts that seek at least half of the congressional districts, those two tests have been met.","So the next step right now is at this language, consumer referred solar amendment language has to be verified by the Supreme Court as being valid to be on the constitutional ballot, that has to take place by April 1, briefs have been filed by number of groups in front of the Court. Oral arguments have not been scheduled, they\u2019re not required actually. So the Court could possibly rule without the oral arguments, where they\u2019ll set oral arguments being heard and then by April 1, at the latest the Court will. If the Court approves the language, it will onto the ballot for November elections. ","Steven Bird","Okay. That's very clear. Thank you and then shifting over to resources. We're obviously very happy about the expansion of the ITC and PTC. Wanted to get your sense of the state of the tax equity market given continued growth in renewable, we had heard some reports that the market is -- some of the players maybe exiting and overtime there could be a bit of a squeeze in terms of who is actually able to secure tax equity. Would you mind talking at a high level, in terms of your take on the health currently of the tax equity market and where you see that and whether or not that might be an advantage for you all given your position versus say smaller competitors?","John Ketchum","Sure Steven. Actually we see the opposite, we see the tax equity market actually strengthening. One of the benefits of having a global banking network that as we have, gives us the ability to access different tax equity providers and one of the things that we do at the beginning of each fiscal year and we just completed this process, is work on our tax equity allocations going forward. So we feel very good and to the extent that others that maybe having poor financial performance and don't have the same prospects for future growth may not have the same access to tax equity going forward that we do given the strength of our renewable pipeline and our track record which speaks for itself.","Steven Bird","Very helpful. Thank you very much. ","Operator","And we'll go next to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Dan Eggers","Just John, going back to the bonus depreciation comment, in fact that is not early affecting any of your funding or growth expectations, can you walk us through where you guys expected to be from a tax cash payout respective and then how far into the future does that take you with the bonus depreciation to the extent [indiscernible]?","John Ketchum","Yes, we don't expect bonus depreciation really to have much of an impact as to when we become a cash tax payer and the reason for that is that at Energy Resources we use tax equity financing because we used tax equity financing it really doesn't result in that much of a deferral of our deferred tax asset balance.","Dan Eggers","And it doesn\u2019t affect the FPL, why?","John Ketchum","Well, if you walk through the impacts on the business, at FPL what you would expect to see is, a lower amount of equity required to be put in the business because you have a lower tax liability, Energy Resources, we used the tax equity financing but on a consolidated basis at NextEra Energy the lower tax liability we have at NextEra Energy result in higher FFO to debt which gives us additional flexibility in terms of having to issue less equity and so having to issue less equity really offsets any impacts that we have at FPL and that's the reason why on a consolidated basis net-net bonus depreciation really is not expected to impact our financial expectations going forward.","Dan Eggers","Okay and I guess then we\u2019re early on the idea of what's going to happen to the pipeline for a renewable development that in your past conversations suggest there is a lot of focus trying to jam in projects in '16 to catch the solar ITC. Are you guys having discussions right now about your shifting the timing and magnitude of the shape of when the [indiscernible] get done and given the fact that the customers have more flexibility in than?","John Ketchum","No, not the way our contractual structure.","Dan Eggers","Okay, great, thank you. ","Operator","And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, first just on the capital markets and balance sheet needs, just to be very clear about just in terms of equity expectations for this current year, I think, I heard you say, you don't really expect any at the corporate level, can you just explain upon the assumptions baked there in and specifically discuss capital recycling, I presume that equity does not presume further capital recycling and how you think about more specifically what that recycling might look like? Obviously in light of the Texas decision, is there more merchant divestment coming is what I\u2019ve asked just kind of the follow up.","John Ketchum","In terms of our equities needs for 2016, our base case is that we're recycling opportunities available in our merchant generation portfolio that we'll continue to explore somewhere to what we do with the Lamar-Forney transaction back in 2015. We also have some renewable assets that may be rolling off of contracts that could be good opportunities as well and then we have some renewable assets on the balance sheet that we have not previously put debt financing up against that could provide additional sources of capital for 2016 offsetting what would otherwise be a modest equity needs in 2016 for NextEra Energy.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, but just to be clear on equity here are you assuming further asset sales beyond the Lamar and Forney to make sure -- to hit that in your equity?","Jim Robo","Julian this is Jim, you know I think the way you should think about it is, everything we have is always for sale and if there is an opportunity to sell something that's accretive to the creeds or earnings going forward and makes sense from a strategic standpoint we're going to sell it. But we're also not betting that we're going to have to sell in order not to have to issue equity this year. You know, how much equity content we need in any given year is always driven by how much capital we're going to deploy, what the opportunities are, how we're doing against all of our financing activities and we have a whole host of things that we, a whole host of levers at our disposal that we go to, and obviously issuing equity is very -- and the team knows this is a very low on my list of the kind of things that we want to do, to do finance the plan.","Now obviously the flip side of that is we need a strong balance sheet and we're committed to strong ratios to maintain a strong balance sheet, so you know what we said is I think very clear in the script. We said we don't believe we're going to have an equity need this year and if there is one, it's going to be very modest.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great, very clear and then just lastly on natural gas and obviously the dip we see here, does that impact at all your rate based gas effort in Florida or your solar efforts in Florida?","John Ketchum","Well on the one hand you could say it should create more opportunities given the distress nature of that space and potential assets coming up for sale. On the other hand it does provide somewhat of a limitation in that you have to able to identify producer operators that are willing to sell, in today's lower natural gas price environment at a price that makes sense for Florida customers, but we're working hard to identify those opportunities through the FPL origination efforts.","Eric Silagy","Julian, this is Eric, I'll just add that on the three solar projects it has no impact, those are underway and remember those were advantage sites that we had because we had the property, the transmission was there and so we're moving forward with those that provide customer benefits right up front.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great, thank you very much guys.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research, please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Hi, good morning, so first just on the current renewable backlog opportunity, I know you mentioned we'll have more specifics on the Q1 call, but just could you, just give a little bit and I might have missed it in the commentary, just a little bit of a high level color on how you're looking at the extensions to the CPP kind of moving the needle on these things. I think you said like maybe more like after a big push, after '19 was that, just want to make sure I understand what you -- the high level color you gave.","John Ketchum","So Steve, I think the first thing we looked at is, if you go back over the last several years you probably had a renewable market in the US of 8 gigawatts to 9 gigawatts, it's lumpy though as you know. When we look at '17 through '20 we see a market that's probably much closer to 13 gigawatts to 15 gigawatts and there are some out there that would say that towards the latter part of the decade that that market could get up to 18 gigawatts to 20 gigawatts. So when we look at it we say well, you know gee whiz we've gotten our fair share in the past and so our expectation is to continue to get our fair share in the future.","If you look at wind, on its own and by the way it\u2019s often very difficult to separate how much of that is going to be wind and how much of it's going to be solar, although I will tell you that solar is more and more competitive the longer you go out. But if you look at the near term if you look at '17 and '18 on the wind side certainly the expectations are that there's going to be an awful lot of wind built, right, especially if the IRS comes through with what we think they're going to come through, the same interpretation of in construction as they've had before you're going to likely get a 100% PTCs for CODs on wind all the way through the end of 2018. 2017 remains to be seen whether that will be a banner year for wind or not but I think combined '17 and '18 we'll be pretty good on the wind side.","Then you look at wind a little further out obviously you got CPP, we and others have provided comments to EPA on CPP, one of those comments that EPA asked for was what do we do with the clean energy incentive program right. So right now states have to have a state implementation plan that could go in as late as the fall of 2018, before that plan goes in you can't really get under the incentive plan for renewables, so that's probably a '20 to '21 billed that you see there, we're hoping that comes up a little bit, we do see CPP making a difference for wind, probably starting in '19, but certainly no later than '20.","On the solar side, the way that it's been structured, you could potentially get 30% ITC on solar all the way through 2020. I'd say this over and over again in the past, we continue to be surprised by the demand for solar, out there, it\u2019s certainly more competitive but there is lot of demand for solar. So we see fairly steady solar growth from '18 through '20. I think it was Dan asked the question before about '16 maybe go to '17, which I don't -- I agree with what John said but the point there also on solar is you may actually see a smaller '17 because still much is getting build in '16. So, is that good?","Steve Fleishman","Yes, that's helpful and just the reason you\u2019re going to do the updated into Q1 versus now, versus later as you just have better visibility on the backlog, again to Q1?","John Ketchum","It will have -- I know that a lot of people read the CPP, we've read at 100 times, it's complicated. We want to make sure that we understand what we think it's going to happen in the market but in addition, we're talking to all of our customers and make sure that we understand what their plans are for the next couple of years. ","Steve Fleishman","Okay. One other question on the gas pipeline business, Jim, I guess, how are you thinking about -- are the projects on time, are you seeing any counterparty risk and maybe more importantly given the rest on the business just, do you see that as acquisition opportunities or stay away, to be careful, just how are you looking at what's going on in that space?","Jim Robo","We're making good progress, in terms of timing on the projects and so I feel good about on the pipeline projects, I feel good about that. There is always pressure on timing and certainly FERC has been little slower in terms of pipeline permitting and it's been historically, but we're feeling good about that. In terms of counterparty risk, obviously we feel good with our portfolio projects that vast majority of the counterparties that we have on all the pipelines across both the Florida pipelines, Mountain Valley pipeline and the Texas pipelines, they all are very strong credit worthy entities and so we don't have that counterparty risk that some of the other folks in the pipeline business do and our average contract length is quite long, it's probably close to 20 years.","So, given where the market\u2019s at, obviously there is a lot of distress in this market, we'd have interest only in pipeline with strong credit counterparties and long-term contracts. And so, if there are those that become available and there maybe some of those become available given some of the things going on the industry, we'll be interested in that, obviously we'll be disciplined as we always are vis-\u00e0-vis acquisition but it would be something that we'll look at. But I have no interest in adding anything with commodity exposure and short contracts","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Congrats on a good quarter. Two questions, one FPL related, one near, at FPL, how much of the rate increase request is related to the total change in depreciation meaning, you mentioned the D&A study and then the incremental 200 million, but we've also got the roll off of the RAG [ph] amortization, is that part of that 200 million, is that incremental to it. And then Armando if you won't mind, can you just talk about what the PTC roll off is not just in '16, but -- does that accelerate in '17m does it decelerate or stay at a constant level over the next couple of years?","John Ketchum","Okay, Michael. This is John, I will take the first one then turn it over to Armando for the second one. On the depreciation question about 200 million and the surplus amortization balance, I think the 263 that I've mentioned earlier for '16 rolls off by the end of the year as part of our settlement agreement that expires.","Armando Pimentel","And Michael, we again have to get back to everybody, obviously, it's 37 in the next year which John mentioned in the call, I don't recall what it is in the following year.","Michael Lapides","Okay and just on the FP&L question the 200 million from the D&A study, that drives part of the rate increase request, but then you had multiple years of accumulated regulatory amortization, should we assume that all of that flows back in and not just the amount for 2015 but the multiple years into depreciation at -- in 2017 and beyond at FP&L?","Jim Robo","I think the way you should think about the impacts of -- was there amortization, first of all when you do depreciation study, everything gets washed out in the study, so you're looking at things fresh, looking at the current, what we currently depreciate in terms of our ongoing depreciation expense and we do a new study and we come up with a new revenue requirement from that study. And there are a lot of puts and takes in it and you know the fact that we had some surplus amortization over the last several years has led to our rate base being a little bit higher than it otherwise would have been had we not had the surplus amortization, but actually doesn't have a giant impact on the ongoing depreciation expense in the study.","Michael Lapides","Got it, last one Jim, just curious, any thoughts on the bipartisan energy bill that's kind of weaving its way to the U.S. Senate right now? You mentioned, there were was some commentary earlier in the call about some of the investments in storage and I think there is some terms in that legislation, if it were to make its way through that would have a pretty big impact on storage on the grid.","Jim Robo","So Michael, I give the sponsors a lot of credit for working to try to get something done in this environment, that in this environment of Washington, that said I think it\u2019s highly-highly unlikely that anything gets done this year.","Michael Lapides","Got it, thank you, much appreciated guys.","Operator","And we're out of time for questions here, thanks everyone for joining the program today, you may disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"15736":["NextEra Energy, Inc.

NextEra Energy's third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.22, or approximately 10% against the prior year quarter, reflecting strong execution at Florida Power & Light, Gulf Power, and Energy Resources.","Year-to-date we have grown adjusted earnings per share by nearly 12% compared to the prior-year comparable period. We continue to execute well on our major initiatives, including continuing to capitalize on one of the best renewable development periods in our history.","At Florida Power & Light, earnings per share increased $0.03 year-over-year. All of our major capital projects, including one of the largest solar expansions ever in the United States remains on track as we continue to advance our long-term focus on delivering outstanding customer value.","FPL's typical residential bill remains nearly 30% below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities, while FPL maintains best-in-class service reliability and an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation.","At Gulf Power, we continue to execute on the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we outlined at our June investor conference. We remain focused on improving the Gulf Power customer value proposition by providing lower cost, higher reliability, and outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions.","Along these lines, the Blue Indigo Solar project, which is Gulf Power's first solar development project, is expected to go in service in early 2020 and generate significant customer savings over its lifetime.","At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by roughly 19% year-over-year as contributions from new investments continued to drive growth. Continuing the success of recent quarters since the last earnings call, our renewables backlog increased by approximately 1,375 megawatts, including 350 MW of battery storage projects as we further advance the next phase of renewables deployment that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution.","Overall with three strong quarters complete in 2019, we are pleased with the progress we are making at NextEra Energy and are well positioned to achieve the full-year financial expectations that we have previously discussed; of course, subject to our usual caveats.","Now, let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2019, FPL reported net income of $683 million, or $1.40 per share, an increase of $29 million, or $0.03 per share, respectively, year over year.","Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 8% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion in the third quarter, and we expect our full-year capital investments to total between $5.7 billion and $6.1 billion.","Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be, approximately, 11.6% for the 12 months ending September 2019, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the quarter we restored $308 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $916 million.","All of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well. The 10 solar sites, totaling nearly 750 megawatts of combined capacity that are currently being built across FPL service territory, are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost-effective energy to FPL customers early in 2020.","Earlier this month FPL and a number of interveners reached a settlement agreement for FPL's proposed Solar Together program, which now incorporates a 10% allocation of the residential capacity to low-income customers. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to make a decision about the proposed program by the end of the first quarter of next year.","All of the solar projects we are currently constructing are part of FPL's groundbreaking 30x30 plan to install more than 30 million solar panels by 2030, which will result in roughly 10,000 megawatts of incremental solar capacity on FPL system in Florida. The solar deployment will also help FPL achieve a 2030 CO2 emissions rate reduction target of 67% versus the 2005 US electric industry average.","Beyond solar, construction on the highly-efficient roughly 200 megawatts Dania Beach Clean Energy Center continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date in 2022. While Florida was fortunate to avoid significant harm and damage from Hurricane Dorian, residents of the Bahamas were severely impacted by the effects of this dangerous and deadly storm. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been impacted by the storm's widespread destruction.","As the storm approached the East Coast of the United States, Hurricane Dorian was forecast to make landfall within FPL's service territory as a major hurricane, which could have resulted in countless Floridians and an estimated 4 million FPL customers suffering extensive damage.","In response to this threat and to ensure that we could quickly restore power to our customers should this devastating storm hit us, FPL followed its well-developed plan to respond to such an event, including pre-staging approximately 17,000 personnel.","While FPL service territory was only hit by the strong outer bands of the storm, the hardening and automation investments that FPL has made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter, and more storm-resilient energy grid helped FPL restore service to the approximately 160,000 customers who were impacted by Hurricane Dorian and to avoid additional outages.","Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of storm restoration costs, including pre-staging of personnel, is approximately $274 million. Under the terms of FPL's current settlement agreement, beginning 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the Florida Public Service Commission and subject to a review and prudence determination of the final storm costs, FPL is authorized to recover storm restoration costs on an interim basis from customers through a surcharge.","Earlier this month, the Florida Public Service Commission issued proposed rules in response to the new law that allows for clause recovery of storm hardening investments, including undergrounding.","This new law will allow FPL to pursue these investments in a programmatic basis over the course of decades, further strengthening FPL's storm resilient energy grid against future threats such as Hurricane Dorian. We expect that the final rules will be adopted next year.","Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which is reporting third quarter 2019 GAAP and adjusted earnings of $76 million and $80 million, respectively, or $0.16 per share. As a reminder, during the first 12 months following the closing of the Gulf Power acquisition, we intend to exclude one-time acquisition integration costs from adjusted earnings.","Additionally, interest expense to finance the acquisition is reflected in corporate and other and this expense offsets a significant portion of the third quarter Gulf Power adjusted earnings contribution.","Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 9.8% for the 12 months ending September 2019. For the full year 2019, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. During the quarter, Gulf Power's capital expenditures were roughly $225 million.","We continue to expect Gulf Power's full-year capital investments to total between $700 million and $800 million and the execution of its overall capital program is advancing well. All of these major capital investments, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and Plant Crist coal to gas conversion continue to remain on track.","The Florida economy remained strong. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.2% in September, below the national average and the lowest level in the last decade. As an indicator of new construction, building permits remain at healthy levels.","The most recent reading of the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 3.9% from the prior year. Overall, Florida's economy continues to grow with the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remaining strong.","During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 100,000 from the comparable prior-year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying growth and the addition of Vero Beach's roughly 35,000 customers late last year. FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 0.1% year-over-year.","Partially offsetting customer growth was a decline in overall usage per customer of 1.6%, as favorable weather was more than offset by an estimated 3.9% decrease in weather normalized usage per customer, including a small decline in usage associated with Hurricane Dorian.","As we previously noted, usage per customer tends to exhibit significant volatility from quarter to quarter, which can be more pronounced during periods of particularly warm weather conditions, similar to those experienced during the third quarter.","For Gulf Power, the average number of customers was roughly flat to the comparable prior-year quarter. We are beginning to see recovery accelerate in the areas of the service territory that were most impacted by Hurricane Michael last year. Gulf Power's third quarter retail sales increased 2.3% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable weather.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $367 million, or $0.75 per share, and adjusted earnings of $424 million, or $0.87 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.14, or approximately 19% from last year's comparable quarter results. New investments contributed $0.22 per share, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program.","The contribution from existing generation assets declined $0.01 per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter as the improvement in wind resource was more than offset by a number of headwinds, including a onetime unfavorable state tax item.","After a weak period to the start of the year, when resource improved during the third quarter and was 104% of the long-term average versus 94% in the third quarter of 2018. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business, including existing pipelines increased by $0.03 year-over-year. All other impacts reduced results by $0.10 per share, driven primarily by the write-off of costs related to a development project. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.","The Energy Resources development team continues to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history, with our backlog increasing by approximately 1,375 megawatts since our last earnings call. Since the last call, we've added 747 megawatts of solar and 340 megawatts of battery storage, all of which will be paired with the new solar projects.","Year-to-date, more than 50% of the solar megawatts that we have added to the backlog include a battery storage component, as customers are increasingly interested in a near firm low-cost renewable product that is specifically designed to meet their generation needs.","As a result of increased MISO transmission upgrade and their interconnection cost estimates that impacted approximately 1,400 megawatts of industry projects, including some of our own. We have removed 339 megawatts from our wind backlog. Offsetting these reductions are 624 megawatts of new signed contracts since the second quarter call, resulting in a net increase of 285 megawatts to our wind backlog.","Additionally, as a result of other customers being impacted by the same interconnection cost issues, we have seen new contracting opportunities develop that we hope to capitalize on over the coming quarters. Through the first three quarters of 2019, we have added nearly 4,200 megawatts to our renewables backlog, which now totals more than 12,300 megawatts.","To put our new - our current backlog into context, it is larger than Energy Resources\u2019 operating renewables portfolio at the end of 2014, which took us more than 15 years to develop. Following the terrific year-to-date origination success, we have now largely pivoted our development efforts to 2021 and beyond. With nearly 5,500 megawatts of projects already in our post 2020 backlog, including more than 600 megawatts of wind for 2021 delivery.","At this early stage, we have made good progress towards our long-term development expectations. We expect that overall wind demand in 2021 will be roughly the same levels as in 2019 and that solar demand will continue to increase through the early part of the next decade.","We continue to believe that by leveraging energy resources competitive advantages, we are well-positioned to capture a meaningful share of these markets going forward. Beyond renewables, we continue to advance construction activities from Mountain Valley Pipeline and expect to be approximately 90% complete by the end of this year.","We were pleased that the Supreme Court agreed to hear oral arguments on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline's case related to its Appalachian trail crossing authorization and are hopeful that the Fourth Circuit Courts original decision will be overturned.","At this time, we do not expect a material impact on the construction schedule as a result of the FERC stop work order related to MVP\u2019s biological opinion and incidental take statement. Prior to the order, much of MVP\u2019s construction activities had scaled back as a result of a voluntary suspension and the upcoming winter season.","We have been working with our project partners to resolve all of the outstanding permit issues for MVP and we continue to make good progress with these efforts. We continue to target a full in-service date for the pipeline during 2020 and now expect an overall project cost estimate of approximately $5.4 billion.","Consistent with our focus on leveraging energy resources competitive advantages to identify and develop additional long term contracted projects. Today, we are pleased to announce that we have signed a proceeding agreement for the Lowman Pipeline.","The approximately 50-mile, 16-inch intrastate pipeline would supply natural gas under a 40-year from capacity agreement to PowerSouth Energy Cooperative roughly 700 megawatt Lowman Energy Center in Southern Alabama.","We believe the project which will support a coal to gas modernization will help provide meaningful benefits to both PowerSouth members through reduced energy costs and to the environment through a reduced emissions.","The project which will be wholly-owned by Energy Resources is advancing through the development phase and has a targeted in-service date in mid-2022 subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals. Total capital investment for the pipeline is expected to be between $120 million and $130 million. We look forward to providing additional details as the project advances.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2019, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $879 million or $1.81 per share. NextEra Energy\u2019s 2019 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.163 billion and $2.39 per share, respectively.","Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment declined $0.11 year-over-year, primarily as a result of the higher interest expense related to the Gulf Power acquisition financing. NextEra Energy has also generated a double-digit percentage increase in year-to-date operating cash flow versus the comparable 2018 period.","During the quarter, NextEra Energy issued $1.5 billion of equity units as we continue to focus on opportunistic and prudent capital management to maintain the strength of our balance sheet. The equity units will convert to common equity in 2022 and position us well for continued long-term growth while providing additional cushion against our credit metrics.","The financial expectations which we extended through 2022 earlier this year remain unchanged. For 2019, we would be disappointed if we do not realize adjusted EPS growth at the top end of our 6% to 8% growth rate off of the 2018 base of $7.70 per share, which, if achieved, would result in adjusted EPS of $8.32.","While we are pleased with our year-to-date results, which have benefited from execution at Gulf Power tracking ahead of our plan, we currently expect headwinds in the fourth quarter adjusted EPS due to a number of factors.","As we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we plan to pursue a number of refinancing activities to take advantage of the low interest rate environment, and expect to incur financing breakage impacts associated with several wind repowering, as well as Energy Resources share of the costs associated with the acquisition of the outstanding Genesis debt.","These initiatives could generate negative adjusted EPS impacts of as much as $0.10 to $0.15 in the fourth quarter before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years, and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders.","Looking further ahead, we continue to expect NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in the range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of our 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70 plus the accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the Florida acquisitions. For 2022, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the range of 6% to 8% off of a 2021 adjusted EPS, translating to a range of $10 to $10.75 per share.","Based upon the clear visibility into meaningful growth prospects across all of our businesses, we would be disappointed if we are not able to deliver growth at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS range in 2022. From 2018 to 2022, we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range.","We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2020 off of a 2017 base of dividends per share of $3.93. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited, to normal weather and operating conditions.","In summary, NextEra Energy continues to execute on its strong start to 2019 and remains well positioned to meet its 2019 expectations and long-term growth prospects. At FPL, we remain focused on operational cost effectiveness, productivity, and making smart long-term investments to further improve the quality reliability and efficiency of everything we do.","At Gulf Power, we continue to execute the NextEra Energy playbook to create long-term customer and shareholder value. At Energy Resources, we maintain significant competitive advantages to capitalize on the continued strong market for renewables development. We remain intensely focused on execution and believe NextEra Energy remains well-positioned to drive shareholder value over the coming years.","Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered strong third quarter results, with year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 55% and 81% respectively.","Excluding all contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, cash available for distribution increased approximately 54% from - versus the prior-year comparable quarter. Yesterday, the next NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.5175 per common unit or $2.07 for common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range.","At the end of the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners announced an agreement to acquire Meade Pipeline Company, which owns an approximately 40% interest in Central Penn line, an interstate natural gas pipeline in Pennsylvania that is backed by a minimum 14-year contract with a high credit quality customer and no volumetric risk.","The fixed payment structure of Meade\u2019s lease further diversifies the NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 portfolio while helping mitigate any potential wind and solar resource variability. Following the attractive acquisition financing, the transaction is expected to yield a double-digit return to NextEra Energy Partners LP unitholders and generate a CAFD yield of roughly 14% additionally executing on third-party acquisition helps extend NextEra Energy Partners already best-in-class runway for LP distribution growth.","We believe this acquisition is consistent with NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 focus on investing in long-term contracted clean energy assets with strong creditworthy counterparties, and that natural gas will play an important role in the country's clean energy future.","That said, there are very few pipelines that fit NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 investment criteria of being long-term contracted with creditworthy counterparties. Following the Meade acquisition, NextEra Energy Partners expects the natural gas pipelines will contribute approximately 30% of year-end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution.","With roughly 12,000 megawatts of operating long-term contracted wind and solar projects and the ongoing origination success at energy resources combined with the continued strength of the best renewables development environment in our history, we expect contribution percentage from pipelines to decline over time. We continue to believe that NextEra Energy Partners remains uniquely well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing disruption in the nation's power generation fleet over the coming years.","The Meade investment is expected to be financed with a combination of partially amortizing project financed debt and a new convertible equity portfolio financing as well as existing NextEra Energy Partners debt capacity. Beyond the Meade financing, during the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners took additional steps to further enhance its financing flexibility, which I will discuss in more detail later in the call.","As a result of the expected acquisition and financing initiatives, last month NextEra Energy Partners introduced new year-end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution expectations assuming full contributions from PG&E related projects which at the midpoint represent approximately 60% growth from the comparable year-end 2018 run rate midpoint.","With this strong year-over-year growth in cash available for distribution, NextEra Energy Partners expect to be able to achieve its long-term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2021. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution in NextEra Energy Partners and believe we are well-positioned to continuing \u2013 to continue delivering healthy unit value going forward.","Now, let's look at the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $315 million and cash available for distribution including full contributions from our Desert Sunlight projects was $147 million, up approximately 55% and 81% from the prior year comparable quarter respectively primarily due to portfolio growth.","New projects added $104 million of adjusted EBITDA and $59 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects also contributed favorably to significant year-over-year growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution.","As wind resource is favorable at 107% of the long term average versus 94% in the third quarter of 2018. Cash available for distribution from existing projects also benefited from a reduction in debt service payments as a result of the purchase of the outstanding Genesis holding company notes and the recapitalization of a portfolio of NextEra Energy Partners renewable assets earlier this year.","As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees which we treat as an operating expense. For 2019, we previously reported cash available for distribution including full contributions from our PG&E-related projects as we were working on resolving the ongoing financing issues related to the bankruptcy.","After finalizing our plans to release the restricted cash of our Genesis project, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment, we believe it is unlikely that we will pursue remedies that would result in the release of the trapped cash at the Desert Sunlight 250 and 300 projects prior to PG&E\u2019s exit from bankruptcy. Going forward, we will report cash available for distribution, excluding any contribution from Desert Sunlight projects until the event of default have been resolved.","For the third quarter, cash available for distribution, excluding all contributions from Desert Sunlight projects was $125 million, an increase of approximately 54% year-over-year. Year-to-date, the Desert Sunlight projects have generated $45 million of cash available for distribution. Starting in early 2020, restricted cash will begin to be scrapped to pay down the outstanding principal balance unless this provision is waived by the project's lenders.","Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners recent financing initiatives. The Meade acquisition is expected to be financed with a total of $920 million of partially amortizing project financed debt and a roughly $170 million convertible equity portfolio financing, both of which we have firm commitments for, as well as the existing NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 debt capacity.","By leveraging the strong demand for high quality energy infrastructure assets in both the public and private capital markets, NextEra Energy Partners was able to secure attractive financing for the acquisition that enhances returns for LP unitholders by limiting downside risk.","During September, NextEra Energy Partners launched a tender offer to purchase 100% of the outstanding operating company notes at our Genesis project. Our current expectation is that by the end of this year, we will have acquired all of the outstanding Genesis debt resulting in an increase in run rate cash available for distribution from the project to approximately $100 million, through the removal of project level debt service.","Following the expected purchase of the remaining Genesis debt, NextEra Energy Partners expects to receive approximately $59 million of distributions that have been restricted at the project as of the end of the third quarter, plus approximately $50 million that would have been restricted by year-end.","To fund the purchase of the Genesis debt, in September, NextEra Energy Partners issued $500 million of seven-year senior unsecured notes at an attractive yield of 3.875%. The transaction price at historic lows including the lowest spread for a non-investment grade issuer in the power space for that tenor and the second lowest coupon across all industries for that tenor, reflecting NextEra Energy Partners strong credit profile.","Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners expectations, as we announced last month, following the completion of the Meade acquisition, our expectations for year-end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution, including full contributions from the PG&E-related projects, increased to a range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2020 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2019.","We remain confident that our existing contracts with PG&E will be ultimately upheld in PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy process. And note that both PG&Es and the creditors plans of reorganization propose that all renewable PPAs are assumed by PG&E post bankruptcy.","Excluding all contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, NextEra Energy Partners expects a year-end 2019 run rate for cash available for distribution in the range of $505 million to $585 million.","Year-end 2019 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations which assume full contributions from PG&E-related projects, as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized, increased to $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion following the completion of the Meade acquisition. We also introduced December 31 2020 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution that are the same as the year-end 2019 run rate expectations.","The midpoint of the new cash available for distribution range represents a two-year compound annual growth rate range of more than 25% from the comparable year-end 2018 run rate midpoint assuming full contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, supporting our long-term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2021.","As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat this as an operating expense. From the base of NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 fourth quarter 2018 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.86 per common unit, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024 subject to our caveat.","For 2020, we expect to achieve these distribution growth objectives while maintaining a payout ratio in the mid-70% range. We are pleased with the progress NextEra Energy Partners has made in 2019 against its strategic and growth initiatives.","As we have previously highlighted, NextEra Energy Partners has the flexibility to grow in three ways organically acquiring assets from third parties or acquiring assets from energy resources portfolio. By executing on the Meade acquisition, NextEra Energy has further enhanced its already best-in-class long term visibility into growth and through reduced near-term acquisition needs from energy resources.","Without the need to sell common equity until 2021 at the earliest other than modest aftermarket issuances together with an attractive underlying asset portfolio, favorable tax position, and enhanced governance rights, NextEra Energy Partners is well-positioned to deliver long-term LP unitholder value.","In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects.","That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","So, a couple of questions, you did put out a press release recently talking about this potential for $25 billion to $35 billion of necessary spending to get the full undergrounding program completed. Can we talk \u2013 can you talk about when that might go from sort of theoretical to actually being laid out and executed and over what time frame you might be looking to execute that for the benefit of your customers?","Rebecca Kujawa","Sure, Greg. Some of this stems from - well, a couple of things. One is, as you know, we've had a long program now over many years that Florida Power & Light to invest in storm hardening and resilience across the FPL grid infrastructure.","This past legislative session, the Florida State Legislature passed a new law called Storm Secure, that authorizes further investments, including undergrounding our electrical infrastructure, which all of the utilities in Florida will be able to file plans with the Public Service Commission and start to make those investments and recover on those investments through a clause mechanism.","What we said about it both at the Investor Conference which at that time the law had not been signed by the governor and then subsequent investor materials is that this represents a multi-decade opportunity and tens of billions of dollars of potential investment into our grid infrastructure. It's going through the process now.","The next steps include the Public Service Commission finalizing a rule and having that fully discussed through that process. And then, FPL and Gulf Power would start to file their plans and make those investments and start to recover through the clause.","Greg Gordon","Two more questions. One, with regard to NEP, obviously, the prospects for that business look great. But how do you address like the perspective that even though these gas infrastructure investments you're making make a lot of economic sense, provide good value to the customers that they're serving that it made on the margin be diluting the sort of the clean energy sort of ESG-related aspects of the profile of NEP, even though they do to your point that you've made bring some benefits in terms of personification.","Rebecca Kujawa","We try to cover some of this in the prepared remarks. We've long believed that what is really valuable from an NEP unitholders perspective is our investing in long-term contracted clean energy assets, with creditworthy counterparties. And we believe that gas infrastructure, specifically pipelines to the extent that they meet those criteria, could be a great fit for NEP. And of course, as you know, we executed on an acquisition of some pipeline several years back, and that's added tremendous value to unitholders.","This was a unique opportunity. We think the returns are particularly attractive, particularly when you couple that with debt financing that we were able to execute. And as I commented on the prepared remarks, assuming that we are able to close the acquisition, the CAFD related to all of the pipelines would be roughly 30% of the overall portfolio.","And as we look forward ,and particularly focusing on NextEra Energy Resources portfolio as an obvious source of potential acquisition targets for NextEra Energy Partners. We have a significant amount of long-term contracted renewables, that could and likely will be sold into NextEra Energy Partners over time.","So that percentage of 30%, assuming the close of the acquisition will likely go down over time, particularly since this is a unique opportunity to acquire the Meade Pipeline.","Greg Gordon","My last question is, the delta between the GAAP earnings and the operating earnings is pretty, pretty significant this year, more significant than it has been in some prior years and I understand a lot of that is due to the transition \u2013 some transitions related to the business, but can you just take us through as we move through time, do you expect the difference between GAAP and operating results to tighten again, as we move into 2020 and beyond or are there going to be continued structural reasons why we should expect natural gas related or gas infrastructure related or interest rate related adjustments to continue.","Rebecca Kujawa","So, Greg, of course there's a couple of things that are excluded from our adjusted earnings that flow through GAAP. As you highlighted some of the hedges that we enter in Q4 but our power portfolio as well as our gas infrastructure portfolio, the marks related to those investments work both through that. But the bigger driver this year has really been about interest rates.","And interest rate cap is going down has contributed to a significant amount of mark that we exclude from adjusted earnings purposes. So, that'll fluctuate over time. We think that the hedging activities that we enter into whether it's hedging or gas and power exposure or interest exposure makes sense both for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners to ensure that we have the ability to have low cost and continued access to the capital markets over a long period of time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Just wanted to clarify, I think Rebecca you said that the \u2013 you think that in the wind business that 2021 could be as good a year as 2020? Did you\u2026","Rebecca Kujawa","No, no.","Steve Fleishman","Is that correct? Yeah.","Rebecca Kujawa","That\u2019s 2019. Comparable to 2019 - no, 2020 should be a very strong year as our customers are working to take advantage of the last year of 100% PTC. But we do think it\u2019ll be more likely than not comparable to 2019.","Steve Fleishman","And then on the - just, could you maybe talk a little bit more about what the MISO issue was that kind of affected this 1,400 megawatts of clearing projects and just maybe a little more color on the opportunities projects and just made a little more color on the opportunities that you see maybe if gaining some market share there.","Rebecca Kujawa","Sure. Both MISO and SPP have had a significant amount of queue requests be put into their queues over the last couple of years. I think as both developers and those that might buy renewables put in requests ahead of the tax credits trying to phase down.","And so, they face some tough modeling issues both for MISO and for SPP that resulted in what we think are some unusual outcomes and high costs for interconnection requests, which affected, in particular, about 1,400 megawatts of industry-wide projects as we commented in the prepared remarks. This creates opportunities for us.","So, for some of those projects, there had some obvious customers that wanted to buy some wind and solar projects, which will create opportunities for energy resources to help fill that supply. It also creates the opportunity or incentive for us to optimize our existing queue positions and existing interconnection rights to maximize all the generation that could be filled for those interconnection requests.","So, certainly, a speed bump with respect to some of the things in our backlog, but in context of now the substantial backlog that we have really is no more than a minor blip, but we wanted to comment on it given the movement in the backlog.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to focus on Mountain Valley and just first cover just the process next steps both from a legal perspective as well as with FERC, would you mind just kind of talking through what we should be thinking about from a process point of view from here.","Rebecca Kujawa","Sure. One of the two things that are particularly notable. One is the Supreme Court has decided to take this up as you well know and we'll hear this in the first part of 2020 and ultimately render its decision by June of 2020.","So then, we'll understand whether or not the Fourth Circuit's decision in ADP's case which obviously sets the press and also for Mountain Valley pipelines crossing of the Appalachian Trail.","The second aspect is finishing up the permitting for Mountain Valley pipeline. The new biological opinion is expected to be issued in the early part of 2020. That obviously would address the current stop work order and set forward the process of finalizing the remaining permitting other than the Appalachian Trail Crossing.","So as I've commented in the script, we continue to believe that more likely than not the pipeline will be put into service in 2020. And again, higher costs than we originally had anticipated but approximate now $5.4 billion across all of the partners.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. And how much capital has NextEra invested to date? And if the project were to be canceled due to legal issues, what would the financing implications be for NextEra overall?","Rebecca Kujawa","So we've invested a little bit over $1 billion year-to-date, and that's just our portion of it as opposed to the whole project overall. And what was the second part of the question, Steven, the financing implications?","Stephen Byrd","If the project would be canceled, what would the financing implications be for NextEra?","Rebecca Kujawa","We've got a pretty sizable balance sheet at this point Steve. So not significant implications for us. It certainly would be disappointing from a development standpoint not to be able to complete it. And I think at this point that much less likely than the alternative which is that we expect to bring it into service.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Richard Ciciarelli","This is actually Ritchie Ciciarelli here for Julien. I was just wondering if you can comment on your regulated strategy for the rate case filing? Have you made any decisions around consolidating FPL and Gulf and could that potentially provide additional accretion if you consolidate the capital structures there?","Rebecca Kujawa","So Ritchie, we did make comments at our June investor conference that we were at the early stages of evaluating a merger and ultimately a joint rate case filing between FPL and Gulf. And I\u2019d argue at this point we're probably still in the early stages, as we highlighted then and continue to highlight, our best information at this stage which could change, but our best information at this stage is that we would file in 2021 for new rates in 2022. And that was both for FPL and Gulf.","As we get closer to that period of time, we certainly might update that if things change or be able to give you more information, but we're still at the preliminary stages of that.","Richard Ciciarelli ","And then can you just comment on the JEA process and I guess expectations for how long that will take, I guess, complete?","Rebecca Kujawa","So, Ritchie, as we\u2019ve commented a couple of times, we're certainly interested in doing more regulated M&A and the processes that are very public both at Santee Cooper and JEA. We've indicated our interests, but at this point, out of respect for both processes that are entering more advanced stages, we're limited on what comments we may make on it. But I'd fall back to the fact that we've continued to be interested and of course as you well know JEA, released its list of folks that made it to the next round and of course we were on there.","Operator","And the next question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza","Just a quick follow-up on the 21 GRC filings. You guys sort of formulate your thoughts and get the process together. If I could - can you just highlight maybe some of the arguments you'll present as far as the benefits to FPL customers to have a merged utility? Obviously, the benefits for Gulf stated and it\u2019s - but just sort of as you guys think about as a merged entity where you see the benefits flowing to FPL customers.","Rebecca Kujawa","Shahriar, I think it's \u2013 I appreciate the interest in it. I think at this stage to talk specifically about any sort of rate case strategy would be a little bit premature. But you should expect that a lot of what we might talk about would be consistent with what we always talk about with you guys, which is we really do focus on capital investments that make sense for our customers that improve the reliability, remove cost from the system, improve our emissions profile over the long term to make sure that what we provide to our customers is really valuable to them. And we continue to focus on that and be very diligent in those efforts throughout a long period of time in terms of our history with FPL.","And as we laid out in great detail at our investor conference, the investment program that we have at Gulf Power over the next couple of years investing roughly $3 billion of capital to have the cost of O&M, substantially improve reliability, substantially improve the emissions profile, and substantially improve the safety profile or certain things that we're proud of and we think are really the right things to focus on from a customer standpoint and ultimately from a regulatory standpoint.","Shahriar Pourreza","And then just, Rebecca, one last topic here is just on the retail choice. I mean, obviously, the Supreme Court has started their review. Maybe just a little bit of an update of thoughts on when you expect the timing from the Supreme Court and just the arguments around single issue and items being on ambiguous. And then as far as maybe just a quick update on the votes and as we hit the February deadline?","Rebecca Kujawa","You\u2019re absolutely right. There are two - just like the last quarter conference call, there were two things that need to happen before the initiative could be put on the ballot. One, the Supreme Court is doing its diligence which as you rightfully highlighted. It's not an evaluation of the merits of the proposal. It is simply whether or not, in my words, not necessarily the legal words, but in my words that a single subject and it\u2019s unambiguous and can be easily understood by the average voter.","The hearings were a number of weeks ago and the Supreme Court could render its decision at any time. There's not a specific statutory time frame for them to render their decision. We think in the hearing that issues were brought up and effectively argued that both it is ambiguous and is not single subject. So, we're optimistic that the Supreme Court might render a decision that would be favorable to us but of course, that remains to be seen and we'll hopefully know soon.","On the votes, there are roughly 500,000-ish. 460,000 I rounded up relative to the 760-something-thousand votes or signatures that they need to gather before February 1. The practical deadline really is the very beginning of January. There's some time frame for the state to evaluate and validate these signatures. It is not insurmountable but they would need to significantly increase their rate of signature gathering in order to get what they need in order to get on the 2020 ballot.","Shahriar Pourreza","And then just you don't envision a scenario where the Supreme Court renders a decision post the February ballot deadline?","Rebecca Kujawa","We certainly - it seems unlikely, but we don't know. Based on precedent, it seems that it would be more likely not in the next couple of months, but we don't know.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","I'm looking back at the Investor Day deck and the capital spend trajectory for FPL was about $5.6 billion to $6.2 billion each year through 2022. That implies kind of if you continue to earn at the high end of the band that kind of the law of big numbers starts to kick in and the growth rate of that FPL would actually start to slow down. What are the things that could keep -- what are the things that are not in that $5.6 billion to $6.2 billion CapEx budget that could make that a higher rate base growth trajectory?","Rebecca Kujawa","So we obviously laid out the plans for this period of time through 2020. So I'm assuming you're asking for kind of a post 2020 view. And some of the things that we highlighted in the Investor Conference which still remain very much true today and we even talked about one of them at the very part beginning of the Q&A, two major capital programs that will last well beyond the 2022 expectations period.","First is Storm Secure continuing to harden the infrastructure. That, of course, now is even further authorized through the clause mechanism and has a path for recovery of those investments near the time of having made those investments.","And then second is a continued build out of solar and FPLs in Gulf service territory. The 30-by-30 program by 2030 is about 10 gigawatts of capacity. If we execute on that exactly to that plan, it's roughly 20% of FPL\u2019s generation will come from solar generation in 2030, which obviously leaves a lot of opportunity for further expansion of solar beyond that time frame.","Michael Lapides","Got it.","Rebecca Kujawa","Just normal investments in the infrastructure.","Michael Lapides","But is most of that for the post-2022 time frame? So, if I think about the 2020 to 2022 time frame, there's not a lot that's going to move that $5.7 billion to $6.2 billion number around?","Rebecca Kujawa","So, we have our expectations. They were the best information that we had at the time and continue to have. Obviously, we reserve the rights to change that investment plan over time, but we think it is a terrific plan that we're excited about, and that really focuses on developing the customer value that we think is so important.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","A couple of questions - good morning. A couple of questions about renewables. Have you heard anything about a possible extension of Section 201 solar import tariffs. And then separately from that, at a recent conference, a lot of the developers there were talking about 0% returns through contracted life on wind projects. And I'm just wondering, I mean, you guys are usually in better shape than other people, and I'm wondering what kind of returns you guys are seeing for wind.","Rebecca Kujawa","Okay. I\u2019ll start with the second question first. Our returns are not anywhere near that stated report. We continue to be disciplined in our investment plans, in energy resources. Our returns have remained roughly consistent over a long period of time on a levered basis. And we continue to strongly believe that they're creating value for our shareholders relative to our cost of capital. We can't speak to what other people are investing in. What we do know is that we have significant competitive advantages across this business.","Certainly our experience in it is extremely important. It is not only that we have a significant amount scale, we're investing a substantial amount of capital. We've got great relationships with our suppliers where we're a meaningful customer of theirs, And of course we've had continued significant investments in digital technologies to keep getting better at this business every year.","So we love the business. We think it's a terrific growth opportunity for us. And as you look out over the next couple of years, you'll continue to see the returns from Energy Resources along the lines of what John highlighted at the investor conference, continue to be very attractive.","On the on the tariffs, this changes minute-by-minute and day-by-day. So what our supply chain team continues to focus on is working very closely with our suppliers. Obviously, that story might be a little different between wind and solar, but they have obviously anticipated the uncertainty that could be in the market in the coming years and we've positioned ourselves appropriately so that we can continue executing our developmental program at attractive returns.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Pavel Molchanov","On the power storage front, you've talked about the kind of mainstreaming of storage deployments. I'm curious if in your business development efforts, you found any storage technologies other than lithium-ion that you think are worth commercializing and scaling up in a serious way.","Rebecca Kujawa","We continue - just like we have been with the gas business before, then the wind business, gas business before, then the wind business, then the solar business, we always remain technology agnostic and whatever becomes commercialized that we can deploy at scale with high confidence in the long term total cost of ownership, we would certainly be open to it.","That said what we continue to see and what we are currently signing contracts with our customers is predominantly lithium ion but there is a lot of venture capital and a lot of private equity for further stage investments being invested in this space to see if we can find something even better than lithium ion.","But with the electric vehicle sector really focusing on lithium ion, those that are producing lithium ion batteries are investing in the manufacturing scale which is producing significant cost improvements and some technology improvements that\u2019s making it very compelling.","So, as you look at in our materials, you look at what we think is likely to happen in the middle part of the next decade, you\u2019re talking about a $5 to $7 a megawatt hour adder to get to a nearly firm wind or solar resource. That's a pretty attractive price. So, in order to beat that, you'd have to see a pretty big step change in where some of these other technologies are to truly be competitive.","Pavel Molchanov","And then kind of a corollary to that maybe on the flip side of the value chain, EV charging, any update on the role that you guys are playing in that Florida build out? The state overall still lags behind a lot of the other coastal states in its EV infrastructure. So, curious what you guys are doing to resolve that?","Rebecca Kujawa","It has been a focus in Tallahassee at the state government level to really think about it and think about what part of different companies and organizations might play in it. And we certainly have worked on a couple of pilot opportunities to think about how that infrastructure can be built out. There may be more to do at some point, but we're still evaluating whether or not that's an opportunity within the regulated utilities or potentially on the competitive side.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."],"15737":["NextEra Energy Inc.

Sir, please go ahead.","Matt Roskot","Thank you Jamie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2019 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. ","Jim will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to Rebecca for a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today\u2019s earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Today\u2019s presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today\u2019s presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.","James Robo","Thank you Matt, and good morning everyone. 2019 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy\u2019s performance was strong both financially and operationally, and we had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company. ","By successfully executing on our plans, NextEra Energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of $8.37, up 8.7% from 2018. Over the past 15 years, we\u2019ve now delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of nearly 8.5%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of less than 4% over the same period. ","Amidst this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. In 2019, we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 43%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index, and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one, three, five, seven, and 10-year basis. ","Over the past 15 years, we have outperformed all of the other companies in the S&P Utilities Index and 85% of the companies in the S&P 500 while more than tripling the total shareholder return of both indices. Although we are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, we remain utterly focused on the future and committed to continuing that track record going forward.","During 2019, FPL successfully executed on its ongoing capital plan, including placing the highly efficient Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and an additional 300 megawatts of cost effective solar in service on time and on budget. Smart capital investments such as these help FPL improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition despite customer bills that were already nearly 30% below the national average and among the lowest of all 54 electric providers in the State of Florida. Earlier this month, the typical FPL residential customer bill decreased by nearly $4 or roughly 4%. ","FPL had continued success with its cost savings initiatives, reducing its already best-in-class dollar per retail megawatt hour non-fuel O&M costs by more than 5% year-over-year. These ongoing cost savings combined with the flexibility afforded by FPL\u2019s current settlement agreement enabled FPL to avoid a customer surcharge for the roughly $260 million of storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Dorian. ","In addition to low bills, FPL delivered its best-ever service reliability performance in 2019 and was recognized for the fourth time in five years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation.","Finally, last quarter we were pleased that following an extensive and thorough 18-month review, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 their second 20-year license extensions. These units are the first nuclear power plants in the United States to achieve this milestone, and this decision supports the continued production of clean, zero emission, reliable, and affordable nuclear power in Florida for many years to come.","Beyond executing on its strategic initiatives, during 2019 FPL positioned itself well for continued long term growth. Early in the year, FPL announced its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan, which is one of the world\u2019s largest solar expansions and will result in roughly 10,000 megawatts of incremental solar capacity on FPL\u2019s system. This solar expansion combined with low cost battery storage solutions, such as the Manatee Energy Storage Center that was announced during 2019 represent the next phase of FPL\u2019s generation modernization efforts and are expected to further reduce FPL\u2019s CO2 emissions rates, which is already among the lowest in the nation and has declined more than 30% since 2005.","In addition to the terrific progress in generation, during the year, Florida passed the Public Utility Storm Protection Plans law that allows for clause recovery of storm hardening investments, including undergrounding. This new law supports continued hardening of FPL\u2019s already storm-resilient energy grid and allows FPL to pursue these investments in a programmatic manner over the course of decades while deploying billions of dollars of incremental capital for the benefit of customers. We expect the final rules related to the new law to take effect later this quarter and that FPL will seek to begin clause recovery of its storm hardening investments beginning in 2021.","With terrific visibility into significant investment programs such as these, we remain as confident as ever about FPL\u2019s ability to sustain its long-term growth trajectory while further improving our customers\u2019 value proposition.","The Energy Resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2019. The renewables origination success remained particularly strong with the team adding more than 5,800 megawatts to our backlog over the past year as we continue operating in what we believe to be the best renewables development environment in our history. Our ongoing renewables origination success results from our ability to leverage Energy Resources\u2019 competitive advantages, including our best-in-class development skills, large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, strong access to and cost of capital advantages, and world-class operations capability. More than 50% of the solar megawatts that were added to our backlog in 2019 included a battery storage component, and the current backlog has more than 2,000 megawatts of trifecta projects that combined wind, solar, and battery storage together. ","We also increasingly see storage as an important standalone business in its own right as we were reviewing a number of opportunities to add storage to our existing solar sites to take advantage of the ITC and enhance the value of our existing projects for customers. This highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution as well as Energy Resources\u2019 unique skills to combine the three technologies into integrated, near firm, low cost products.","Energy Resources\u2019 significant competitive advantages position it well to capitalize on the enormous disruption that is occurring to the nation\u2019s generation fleet. We continue to expect that by the middle of this decade, without incentives, new near firm wind is going to be a $20 to $30 per megawatt hour product, and new near firm solar is going to be a $30 to $40 per megawatt hour product. At these prices, new near firm renewables will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal, nuclear, and less efficient oil and gas-fired generation units. We were pleased by the 60% PTC extension that was passed in 2019, and we expect that it will support incremental wind demand in 2023 and 2024. ","Our confidence in renewables being the low-cost generation alternative in the middle of this decade remains stronger than ever. We expect the disruptive nature of renewables to be terrific for customers, terrific for the environment, and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade.","Let me now turn to Gulf Power and highlight how we executed in 2019 against some of the long term objectives that we outlined last year. As we\u2019ve often discussed, two of the key hallmarks of the NextEra Energy playbook are reduced operating costs and using those savings to fund smart capital investments for our customers. After one year of ownership, we are well on our way to executing this strategy at Gulf Power. In 2019, we reduced Gulf Power\u2019s O&M costs by approximately 20% year-over-year. In addition to lowering costs, we\u2019ve also identified smart investment opportunities to benefit customers. In 2019, Gulf Power invested approximately $730 million, or roughly 2.5 times Gulf Power\u2019s average capital investment amount over the past five years, and was able to regulatory capital employed at roughly 11% year-over-year. ","Beyond realizing operating efficiencies and deploying smart capital, in the past year Gulf Power was able to meaningfully improve its customer value proposition. Gulf Power achieved its best ever service reliability year, which was approximately 20% better than its 2018 results. Customer service was also better with notable improvements in speed of answer and Florida Public Service Commission complaints. ","There is nothing more important in our company than the safety of our employees. We made significant improvements in this area in 2019 as well with an approximately 40% reduction in our OSHA rate at Gulf Power versus 2018. ","As the major capital investments that we advanced during 2019 come into service in 2020 and beyond, they will help achieve the other key objectives that we have outlined at Gulf Power, such as meaningful emissions reductions and, perhaps most importantly, a significant reduction in customer bills in real terms. ","In addition to creating tremendous customer value, we expect that execution of the plans we\u2019ve laid out at Gulf Power will also generate great outcomes for our shareholders as well. In our first year of ownership, Gulf Power\u2019s adjusted earnings increase by 25% year-over-year. This outcome was even better than our plan at the start of the year and positions us well to deliver on the financial growth objectives that we outlined when we announced the acquisition. This high level performance across the board would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all Gulf Power employees. ","While we are pleased with the results that we\u2019ve achieved at Gulf Power during 2019, we remain focused on the significant execution ahead of us here to deliver even greater value to our customers and our shareholders. ","Finally, we were once again honored to be named for the 13th time in 14 years number one in the electric and gas utilities industry on Fortune\u2019s list of Most Admired Companies, as well as ranked among the top ten companies worldwide across all industries for social responsibility. During 2019 alone, NextEra Energy made approximately $13 billion in capital investments in American energy infrastructure, making us one of the top capital investors in the U.S. in any industry. ","None of these recognitions nor our track record of success would be possible without the hard work and commitment to excellence of our people, who live our core value of doing the right thing every day. In the last year, there has been an increasing focus on ESG on the part of many of our stakeholders. The fact is our company has been focused on all of the elements of ESG for more than 25 years. We are proud of our track record here, but there is still so much more to do in this country to decarbonizes the electric transportation and industrial sectors. NextEra Energy is living proof that you can be clean and low cost and financially successful all at the same time.","We will be at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving very hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector. We expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful CO2 emissions reductions across the country while simultaneously lowering generation costs for customers, and our continued investments in clean energy will help advance NextEra Energy towards its goal of reducing its CO2 emissions rate by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline. ","In summary, I continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy\u2019s long term growth prospects. In 2019, we extended our long term track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best-in-class organic growth prospects. Based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2020, 2021 and 2022 while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. We remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years. ","Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which also had a terrific year of execution in 2019. In the more than five years since the IPO, NextEra Energy Partners has consistently delivered on its commitments. That history of execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets which grew significantly and was further diversified in 2019. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired a portfolio of more than 600 megawatts of wind and solar assets from Energy Resources. Additionally during the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy Partners closed on the acquisition of Meade Pipeline Company, which owns an approximately 40% aggregate interest in Central Penn Line, an interstate natural gas pipeline in Pennsylvania that is backed by a minimum 14-year contract with a high credit quality customer and no volumetric risk. ","Finally, during the year NextEra Energy Partners advanced an additional organic growth opportunity, announcing the repowering of 275 megawatts of wind projects. We are proud that 2019 is the first year that NextEra Energy Partners successfully executed on all of the three ways it can grow: organically, acquiring assets from third parties, and acquiring assets from Energy Resources\u2019 portfolio, highlighting the clear flexibility and visibility into growth going forward.","To support the ongoing growth investments and optimize the capitals structure for the benefit of LP unit holders, NextEra Energy Partners completed a number of financings and refinancings in 2019 as well. At the start of the year, NextEra Energy Partners faced headwinds related to the PG&E bankruptcy. The team immediately focused on managing and mitigating the negative impacts of this event, and we ended 2019 having favorably addressed many of the challenges. The Energy Resources portfolio acquisition and associated financing that we announced last March allowed NextEra Energy Partners to complete its original 2019 growth objectives, even after excluding PG&E related project cash flows.","During the year, NextEra Energy Partners also purchased all of the outstanding holding company and operating company notes at our Genesis project. In addition to resulting in an increase in run rate cash available for distribution through the removal of project-level debt service, as a result of the purchase of the debt NextEra Energy Partners received approximately $128 million of distributions that had been or were expected to be restricted at the project. The release of this cash was used to partially fund the debt repurchase. I remain confident about a long term favorable resolution for our PG&E related assets.","In addition to growing LP distributions by 15% year-over-year and achieving a run rate adjusted EBITDA range in excess of what was originally expected, NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 year-end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution expectations, assuming full contributions from PG&E related projects, represents approximately 60% growth from the comparable year-end 2018 run rate range. With this strong year-over-year growth and cash available for distribution, NextEra Energy Partners expects to be able to achieve its long term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2021. As of year-end 2020, we expect to have achieved NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the mid-70s range even after excluding cash distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects. ","NEP delivered an attractive total unit holder return of approximately 28% in 2019, further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO. I continue to believe that the combination of NEP\u2019s clean energy portfolio, growth visibility, and flexibility to finance that growth offer LP unit holders an attractive investor value proposition. As with NextEra Energy, we remain focused on continuing to execute in delivering that unit holder value over the coming years.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rebecca, who will review the 2019 results in more detail.","Rebecca Kujawa","Thank you Jim, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL.","For the fourth quarter of 2019, FPL reported net income of $400 million or $0.81 per share, down $0.04 per share year over year. For the full year 2019, FPL reported net income of $2.33 billion or $4.81 per share, an increase of $0.26 per share versus 2018. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 8.3% for 2019 and was the principal driver of FPL\u2019s net income growth of roughly 8% for the full year.","During the fourth quarter, growth from new investments was offset by a number of factors, including a contribution to our charitable foundation that should fund its operations for the next several years. FPL\u2019s capital expenditures were approximately$2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $5.8 billion.","FPL\u2019s reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the 12 months ending December 31, 2019, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the fourth quarter, we utilized a total of $18 million of reserve amortization, including the approximately $260 million that was utilized to offset Hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs, leaving FPL with a year-end 2019 balance of $893 million. ","We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for one additional year, and as a result expect to file a base rate case in the first quarter of 2021 for new rates that are effective in January of 2022. While we have not made a final decision, based on our review we expect that the merging of FPL and Gulf Power and making a single rate case filing will result in customer benefits, and we therefore see this as a likely approach for the filing at this time.","All of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well. The 10 solar sites totaling nearly 750 megawatts of combined capacity that are currently being built across FPL\u2019s service territory are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost effective energy to FPL customers in early 2020. To support the significant solar expansion that FPL is leading across Florida, we have secured sites that could support 10 gigawatts of future projects. ","Earlier this month, the Florida Public Service Commission held hearings on FPL\u2019s proposed Solar Together program. We continue to expect a decision about the proposed program at the end of the first quarter.","Beyond solar, construction on a highly efficient, roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach clean energy centre remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022. We continue to expect that FPL\u2019s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate of regulatory capital employed of approximately 9% from 2018 through 2022 while further enhancing our best-in-class customer value proposition.","Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP and adjusted earnings of $23 million and $26 million respectively, or $0.05 per share. For the full year, Gulf Power reported GAAP earnings of $180 million or $0.37 per share and adjusted earnings of $200 million or $0.41 per share. As a reminder, during the first 12 months following the closing of the acquisition, we excluded one-time acquisition integration costs from adjusted earnings. Additionally, interest expense to finance the acquisition is reflected in corporate and other.","Gulf Power\u2019s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.8% for the 12 months ending December 2019, which is in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25% under its current rate agreement. For the full year 2020, we expect to target a regulatory ROE near the upper end of this allowed band, assuming normal weather and operating conditions.","As Jim discussed, the overall execution of Gulf Power\u2019s capital program is advancing well. Gulf Power\u2019s first solar development project, the roughly 75 megawatt Blue Indigo solar energy center is expected to go into service later this quarter and generate significant customer savings over its lifetime. All the other major capital investments, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion, continue to remain on track.","The Florida economy remains healthy as Florida\u2019s population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. According to recent IRS data, Florida attracted a net gain of roughly $16 billion in personal taxable income in 2018, by far the highest of any state in the country and the fastest rate of growth as well, which is a reflection of the attraction of Florida\u2019s low tax, pro-business policies. Florida\u2019s most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.1%, below the national average and at the lowest level in a decade. Florida has now added nearly 2 million private sector jobs over the last 10 years. ","Leading indicators in the real estate sector have remained at a stable pace, reflecting continued strength of the Florida housing market. Other positive economic data across the state include continued strength in retail taxable sales as well as the consumer confidence index, which remains near 10-year highs.","During the quarter, FPL\u2019s average number of customers increased by approximately 100,000 from the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying growth and the addition of Vero Beach\u2019s roughly 35,000 customers late last year. For 2019, FPL\u2019s retail sales increased 1.7% from the prior year, driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison. ","On a weather normalized basis, FPL\u2019s retail sales declined by 0.6% as customer growth was more than offset by a reduction in underlying usage per customer. The decline in underlying usage was a reversal from the trend that FPL experienced in 2018 when underlying usage increased by 1.7%. As we\u2019ve previously noted, usage per customer tends to exhibit significant volatility which can be more pronounced during periods of particularly strong weather conditions, similar to those experienced during 2019, which makes distinguishing between underlying usage changes and weather impacts challenging.","For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased slightly versus the comparable prior year quarter as it moves beyond the impacts of Hurricane Michael in 2018. For 2019, Gulf Power\u2019s retail sales declined slightly due to unfavorable weather and a small decline in underlying usage per customer.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, beginning with a reporting change in our segments. Given the Trans Bay Cable acquisition during 2019, we have reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our competitive transmission business and the management of these projects within our company. Our reporting for Energy Resources now includes the results of our NextEra Energy Transmission projects, formerly reported in corporate and other segment. Our 2018 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, resulting in an increase in Energy Resources\u2019 full year 2018 adjusted EPS of $0.09 per share.","Incorporating the reporting change, Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $433 million or $0.88 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $326 million or $0.66 per share. Energy Resources\u2019 contributions to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter decreased $0.01 versus the prior year comparable period as strong underlying growth from new and existing investments was more than offset by a number of items, including the negative $0.14 adjusted EPS impact of our refinancing activities which were primarily related to financing breakage costs associated with several wind repowerings as well as Energy Resources\u2019 share of costs associated with the acquisition of the outstanding Genesis debt.","As a reminder, while these refinancing activities created a reduction in fourth quarter adjusted earnings, they are expected to translate to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders.","For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.81 billion or $3.72 per share, and adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion or $3.49 per share. Energy Resources\u2019 full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.35 or approximately 11% versus 2018. For the full year, growth was driven by continued additions to our renewables portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.55 per share. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business, including existing pipelines, increased by $0.13 versus the prior year. Also contributing favorably were the customer supply and trading business, where contributions increased by $0.05 versus 2018, and NextEra Energy Transmission, which increased results $0.04 year-over-year primarily as a result of the Trans Bay Cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019.","These favorable results were partially offset by higher interest expense, reflecting the negative $0.14 adjusted EPS impact in the fourth quarter of refinancing activities as well as growth in the business and lower contributions from the existing generation assets. ","In 2019, wind resource was 96% of the long term average, down from 97% a year earlier. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.","In 2019, Energy Resources continued to advance its position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects, commissioning approximately 2,700 megawatts of renewables projects in the U.S, including repowering. Since the last call, we have added 1,609 megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog, including approximately 500 megawatts of combined new wind and repowering, 700 megawatts of solar, and 340 megawatts of battery storage, all of which will be paired with new solar projects.","Energy Resources has now placed a total of approximately 3,700 megawatts of repowering projects in service since 2017, which represents approximately one-third of its operating wind portfolio as of year-end 2016. We expect that by the end of 2020, more than 60% of Energy Resources\u2019 operating wind projects will have been originally recommissioned or repowered within the last five years, highlighting the young age of the overall fleet and the expected long date future value creation of the portfolio. ","Following the terrific origination year in 2019 and with nearly three years remaining in the period, we are now within the 2019 to 2022 renewables development ranges that we introduced in the middle of last year. For the post-2022 period, our backlog is already more than 2,400 megawatts, placing us far ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage. The accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands.","Beyond renewables, as of year-end 2019 the Mountain Valley pipeline was approximately 90% complete. We have been working with our project partners to resolve all of the outstanding permit issues for the pipeline and we continue to make good progress on these efforts. We expect that the issues related to MVP\u2019s biological opinion and Nationwide 12 permit will be resolved in the spring, allowing construction work along much of the route to resume. We also remain hopeful that the Supreme Court will overturn the Fourth Circuit Court\u2019s original decision on Atlantic Coast Pipeline\u2019s case related to its Appalachian Trail Crossing authorization, resolving similar challenges for MVP. We continue to target a full in-service date for the pipeline during 2020 and an overall project cost estimate of approximately $5.4 billion. ","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $975 million or $1.99 per share. NextEra Energy\u2019s fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $706 million or $1.44 per share respectively. For the full year 2019, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $3.77 billion or $7.76 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.06 billion or $8.37 per share.","For the corporate and other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.35 per share compared to the 2018 prior comparable period, primarily as a result of higher interest expense related to the Gulf Power acquisition financing. NextEra Energy also delivered strong operating cash flow growth which increased at a faster rate than the adjusted EPS growth rate. ","As expected, during 2019 we also maintained our strong credit position. Based on the S&P methodology, we estimate that we ended the year at a 22.5% FFO to debt level versus our current downgrade threshold of 21%. For Moody\u2019s, we expect 2019 CFO pre-working capital to debt was 19.6% versus our current downgrade threshold of 18%. NextEra Energy\u2019s cushion versus our credit metrics reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet and supports the record roughly $14 billion of capital investments that we expect to make in 2020. ","The financial expectations that we extended last year through 2022 remain unchanged. We continue to expect that NextEra Energy\u2019s adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70, plus the accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the Florida acquisitions. For 2020, we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.70 to $9.20, and as Jim highlighted, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of this range. This year, we do expect that our adjusted EPS growth will be more weighted towards the second half of the year.","For 2022, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the range of 6% to 8% off 2021 adjusted EPS, translating to a range of $10 to $10.75 per share. From 2018 to 2022, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. As always, all of our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.","Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2019. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $280 million and cash available for distribution was $101 million, an increase of 70% and 130% respectively. The strong growth was driven primarily by the significant year-over-year growth in NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 portfolio, including the 2019 acquisitions of the Energy Resources\u2019 assets and the Meade Pipeline Company, as well as a full quarter\u2019s contribution from the portfolio of projects that were acquired in late 2018. ","For the full year 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion, up 25% year-over-year. Cash available for distribution, excluding all contributions from our Desert Sunlight projects, was $366 million, an increase of 8% from the prior year. Including full contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, NextEra Energy Partners achieved CAFD growth 20% versus 2018. ","Similar to the quarterly results, full-year growth in both adjusted EBITDA and CAFD was primarily driven by portfolio growth. The benefit from new projects was partially offset by the divestiture of Canadian assets during 2018. Cash available for distribution was also reduced by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. ","Yesterday the NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.535 per common unit or $2.14 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2019. ","As Jim mentioned, during 2019 NextEra Energy Partners executed several financings for the benefit of LP unit holders. In addition to raising approximately $1.2 billion of unsecured holding company notes which priced at some of the lowest spreads ever in the sector, NextEra Energy Partners also raised $1.4 billion of low-cost project finance debt and executed a $1.3 billion revolver extension. NextEra Energy Partners also raised $1.8 billion through three convertible equity portfolio financings. With low initial coupons, the convertible equity portfolio financings provide more cash to LP unit holders, allowing NextEra Energy Partners to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of future distribution growth which will also, as a result, lower future financing needs. ","In addition to reduced future asset and equity needs, these financings provide NextEra Energy Partners the flexibility to convert into common units at no discount over a long period of time. This should be accretive to LP unit holders who retain all of the unit price upside as NextEra Energy Partners executes on its expected distribution growth objectives. These attributes combined with the significant flexibility that NextEra Energy Partners retains with the financings, including the timing of conversion, option to convert at any price, option to pay the buyout in cash rather units, and the option to deploy the buyout amount into other assets should generate significant value to LP unit holders while also providing significant downside protection. ","Finally, last quarter following the achievement of certain NextEra Energy Partners units trading thresholds, we converted the second tranche of the convertible preferred securities that we issued in 2017 into an additional roughly 4.7 million NextEra Energy Partners common units, further supporting our ongoing goal of using low-cost financing products to layer in equity over time. ","The NextEra Energy Partners portfolio at year-end 2019 supports the revised adjusted EBITDA and CAFD December 31, 2019 run rate expectations that we announced at the time of the Meade acquisition. Since NextEra Energy Partners long-term distribution growth expectations are supported without the need of additional asset acquisitions until 2021, the December 31, 2020 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD remain unchanged, at the same levels as the year-end 2019 run rate expectations.","Including full contributions from PG&E-related projects, year-end 2020 run rate cash available for distribution is expected to be in a range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2020 and assuming normal weather and operating conditions. Excluding all contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect a year-end 2020 run rate for CAFD in the range of $505 million to $585 million. ","Year-end 2020 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations, which assume full contributions from PG&E-related projects as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized, are $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as an operating expense. ","From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.14, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect that the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in February 2021 to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.46 per common unit. ","In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth. FPL, Gulf Power, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2019 reinforces our long term growth prospects, and while we have a lot to execute on in 2020, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year. ","That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that we will open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question today comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Congratulations on another very, very consistent year performance.","Rebecca Kujawa","Thanks Greg, good morning.","Greg Gordon","A couple questions for you. Based on my back of the envelope math, it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ve earned the maximum allowable ROE at Florida Power & Light this year. Can you tell us where you landed on a return on equity basis for fiscal year \u201919?","Rebecca Kujawa","Yes Greg, from a reported regulatory ROE standpoint, so what ultimately goes to the Florida Public Service Commission, we did earn the 11.6% ROE as allowed under our settlement agreement. You are right - we did have some below the line expenses, which is typical, but those below the line expenses are excluded from that regulatory ROE calculation.","Greg Gordon","Got you, understood. And then when you point out in your slide deck that the majority of your PTCs are now being allocated through tax equity, there\u2019s a very clear slide in the appendix on that. That means that we should be looking at NCI on the balance sheet flowing through the income statement as the way that that\u2019s flowing through earnings now, is that correct?","Rebecca Kujawa","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Greg Gordon","Okay, and the average amortization of a tax equity deal for a wind project is approximately 10 years, is that right?","Rebecca Kujawa","Yes, the earnings recognition is roughly coincident with the 10-year PTC range for all of our wind projects that are in PTCs.","Greg Gordon","Right, and for a solar deal, it would be slightly faster?","Rebecca Kujawa","Yes, it typically relates to the recognition of the ITC period, so for many tax equity structures, that\u2019s over five years. Certain tax equity partners prefer a seven-year structure, and so then it would be over seven years as opposed to five.","Greg Gordon","Right. As you guys gear up for preparing for the rate case in 2021, are there any milestones this year or will the majority of the activity be happening in early \u201921?","Rebecca Kujawa","Well as you certainly appreciate, there\u2019s a ton of milestones that are largely internal for our teams as they get ready for any rate proceeding, and many of those preparation efforts started well before this year and are ongoing, and we have the incremental work this year of doing all the analysis of thinking about bringing FPL and Gulf together. But as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, based on what we know today, our expectation is that we would file a rate case in early \u201921 for the new rates effective in 2022, and you know the first start of that would be the filing of the test year letter, which we would expect to file in early \u201921.","Greg Gordon","Great. My last question is the battery storage backlog is obviously continuing to ramp. Are you buying battery storage--are you buying the product from another vendor or are you buying the components from different OEMs and building your own bespoke battery storage product? In other words, are you using a vendor like Fluence or one of the other total product companies, or are you sourcing components and building your own battery units?","Rebecca Kujawa","It\u2019s much more the latter, Greg. We see a tremendous amount of value and are being able to have some nimbleness in where we procure the battery packs, but then we also are procuring separately, as you suggested, things like the containers and the other equipment that you would ultimately use to assemble the battery facility. And then also we\u2019re designing our own management systems. We ultimately believe that some of the real value add that we\u2019re going to be able to add to customers, that will likely differentiate us from others is that battery system management because we\u2019ve talked about with you guys and with others over time that there\u2019s probably not one value stream that creates the value for batteries, it\u2019s usually a couple of different applications within the same system, and that management system and optimizing that is going to be part of the secret sauce of batteries. ","We\u2019ve invested a lot of time and energy in thinking through that not only on the Energy Resources deployments but also for the deployments that we\u2019ve had at FPL, and we\u2019re learned a tremendous amount and we\u2019re really excited as we highlighted in the prepared remarks about batteries as a terrific supplement to further renewable deployment certainly in the middle part of the next decade and thereafter as renewables become a significant component of the generation stack in U.S. power markets. ","Greg Gordon","Thanks a lot.","Rebecca Kujawa","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Steve Fleishman","Yes, hi. Good morning. Just a question first if you could update us on the Santee Cooper situation and your interest there; and then secondly, with JEA now gone and stock obviously doing very well, just kind of overall thought process on M&A strategy and opportunities right now. Thanks.","James Robo","Steve, this is Jim. I\u2019ll take that. Obviously, we\u2019re pretty limited in what we can say about the Santee Cooper situation other than what I\u2019ve said previously, which is we remain very interested in Santee Cooper and we think South Carolina is a terrific place to do business, and that\u2019s probably all I can say about that.","On the JEA front, I would say we\u2019re disappointed that the sale process has been terminated. We think we could have brought enormous value to the customers and the citizens of Jacksonville, and we think it\u2019s unfortunate that it\u2019s been terminated, but that is what it is. In terms of future M&A activity, I will repeat what I\u2019ve been pretty consistent in terms of what our strategy is on that front, which is in terms of what we like, we have been very focused. First of all, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a utility in the country that wouldn\u2019t benefit from the application of our playbook. That said, we have been focused on opportunities in the southeast, in the midwest, as well as FERC regulated opportunities. Those are, from a regulatory standpoint and other opportunities, what we think are the best fit for us and that remains our focus.","We continue to be very interested in trying to do something. That said, M&A is always hard and there are a lot of hurdles to get over, and we will, as always, be extraordinarily financially disciplined. You will never see us announce a deal that we say is strategic and has no accretion, so anything that we do will have significant accretion associated with it. So, I think that\u2019s probably the sum total of what I can say on that. ","Steve Fleishman","Okay. One quick technical question. Is there a quick and easy way you can quantify the balance sheet capacity available for these FFO to debt metrics at Moody\u2019s and S&P in terms of dollars?","Rebecca Kujawa","Yes, we\u2019re probably not going to quantify it exactly, Steve. As you\u2019ve heard us say quite a number of times over the years, a strong balance sheet is incredibly important to us. We clearly have some room from our downgrade thresholds, which is certainly terrific and is important to us as we think about how do we make sure that we\u2019re prepared for making investments that we want to make in the future, including especially this year, setting aside the comments that Jim just made on M&A, just for our organic growth prospects alone we have $14 billion of planned capital investment in our business, and having a strong balance sheet as we start to make those investments is incredibly important. ","Steve Fleishman","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good morning, can you hear me?","Rebecca Kujawa","Good morning, we can hear you just fine.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thanks again for all the commentary. Perhaps kicking if off on the retiring front, would just be curious on your thoughts on the \u201924 opportunity now, given the PTC extension. How does that shift your thinking and logic around incremental repowering? I know you provided already some fairly detailed remarks on repowering already, but I want to dig in on that specific opportunity especially given that that\u2019s a year already after the timeline for the solar ITC here, if you can elaborate.","Rebecca Kujawa","Sure, of course. As we highlighted in our development expectations that we laid out this summer for the 2019 through 2022 time frame, you\u2019ll note that the repowering opportunities that we saw were heavily, and at that time exclusively in the 2019 to 2020 time frame, and we\u2019ve continued to work on opportunities to repower assets at both an 80% PTC and a 60% PTC, so first we\u2019ll focus in the 80% before we even think about the extensions of anything that\u2019s possible in 60%. ","Remember, there\u2019s always a trade-off in making these investment opportunities. Part of the economic value of that is getting the new set of PTCs, and so there\u2019s a balance of the cost of the investment that you need to make in that equipment and also ensuring that you can meet the IRS test of the 80\/20 valuation, and as the PTC value goes down, it gets a little bit harder to justify both of those requirements.","Again, we thought it was a terrific program, created a huge amount of shareholder value, really highlights the option value embedded in our portfolio, and we\u2019ll continue to be creative and work towards creating more opportunities like that or things that are analogous to it in the future.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, excellent. Just clarifying the last question a little bit, you mentioned FERC regulated opportunities. Jim, can you elaborate a little bit further on the thought process there? Obviously this transmission ROE question has been lingering across the sector. I just want to make sure we heard you right as to how you\u2019re thinking about the various FERC asset classes. ","James Robo","Yes, so obviously we did the Trans Bay acquisition, that\u2019s not in the midwest or the southeast, and we do on a long term basis like FERC regulated assets, notwithstanding the recent ROE decision on the MISO transmission owners. ","Listen - I think there\u2019s been--you know, obviously that\u2019s an open docket at FERC right now. I probably can\u2019t comment on what I think the outcomes are going to be there, other than to say I do believe FERC regulation will be constructive in the long term, and we think in the long term it\u2019s a good place for us to deploy capital.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Maybe Jim, if I can, one more quickly on ESG. As you think about establishing targets and becoming, perhaps, more prescriptive and being a leader on this front, how do you think about being more specific on carbon? I know this comes up a little bit, but I\u2019m curious on the thought process there. I know it\u2019s also complicated, too. ","James Robo","Sure. I think we have been pretty specific about what our 2025 goal is, which is--remember, all of these discussions are about percent reductions. We started at an enormously lower level than the rest of the industry on just base CO2 emissions per megawatt hour generated, so any of the goals that we lay out, which our goal is a 67% reduction off our 2005 base by 2025, I think if you went back and you looked at the 2005 U.S. average and compared our NextEra rate in 2025 to that 2005 average, I\u2019m going to give you a number and everyone is going to go check me on it, that would be an 85% or 90% reduction relative to the 2005 U.S. average CO2 emissions rate. ","We are going to significantly decarbonize our company and our emissions, and I\u2019m really excited about the goals we\u2019ve set. I think they are very doable, and what I\u2019m most excited about is the role that we can play both in Florida and in the rest of the country in terms of leading the way to decarbonize not just the electric sector but the transportation sector. ","There\u2019s lots more to do, as I said in my prepared remarks. I think the country has a lot more to do, and the great news for the country and the economy is you can be clean and low cost at the same time, and whatever we do will be for the benefit of the customers and it will drive good economics, better GDP growth for the country, lower costs, and obviously a better environmental profile. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey, good morning guys. Just on the near backlog, it\u2019s obviously very strong again, so I\u2019m just trying to get a sense, Rebecca, on how much of that backlog increase, mainly on the wind side, was attributed to a pull forward of projects with the modest PTC extension versus actual incremental opportunities you\u2019re seeing as we think about modeling forward.","Rebecca Kujawa","Yes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very much. I think it\u2019s early--obviously the PTC extension happened very, very late in 2019, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen any impacts from it whatsoever, coupled with the fact that it\u2019s quite a number of years down the road. It doesn\u2019t affect the profile of the PTC in the next three years, which is really what was driving a lot of our customers\u2019 actions. ","In terms of overall demand and how that\u2019s reflected, as we\u2019ve said in the past, we thought 2020 was going to be a significant development year - clearly it is for wind, and that 2021 is more likely than not to be roughly comparable with where we were in 2019, and we continue to see really strong interest from our customers about wind in the long term, as they should be. As Jim highlighted, the cost of wind and solar projects out in the mid-2020s, assuming there are not any meaningful extensions of the incentives, which is an assumption at this point that should be checked, but assuming those incentives are not extended, are very competitive versus existing coal and nuclear plants and some less efficient gas-fired plants, so economics should continue to drive decisions for our customers for many, many years to come.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. Then just lastly, thanks for the incremental disclosures around Gulf. Is there anything you can maybe provide directionally on the base assumptions you\u2019re assuming in \u201922 as we\u2019re thinking about your EPS guidance, i.e. maybe from a regulatory construct or even addition to spending opportunities, like the extension of SoBRA. Is there anything you can provide directionally on how you\u2019re thinking about this?","Rebecca Kujawa","Not much beyond what we\u2019ve already talked about in terms of everything that\u2019s built into our expectations for 2020 through 2022, and as you recall from the investor conference materials, we did lay out a lot of the details for both businesses through 2021, and of course more detail for Energy Resources out in \u201922. But the fundamentals are very consistent with what we\u2019ve been doing for a long time on the regulated businesses - again, focusing on good capital investment that adds value for our customers and taking cost out of the business to ensure that we have very thoughtful views on customer bills, and in the case of Gulf Power targeting a meaningful decline in the bills out to the mid-2020s. So keep doing what we\u2019re doing, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the growth opportunities for all of the businesses that lay out in front of us.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it, so stay tuned around the cap structure and the reserve amortization and how you\u2019re thinking about chewing up between the two utilities?","Rebecca Kujawa","Absolutely. ","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, great. Congrats guys. ","Rebecca Kujawa","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Unknown Analyst","Hi, just [indiscernible] on behalf of Mike. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a check on the battery growth you\u2019re talking about, can you talk about these reductions you\u2019re seeing on the battery systems for the projects in the pipe, and would it be possible to quantify the scale of opportunity for retrofits on existing sites, either at NEER or at NEP?","Rebecca Kujawa","In terms of battery cost, we\u2019ve laid out some of our thoughts and expectations, I think most recently in our EEI investor presentation. We haven\u2019t broken out a lot of the detail between battery back and the rest of the balance of system costs, but everything that we\u2019ve laid out in terms of where we\u2019ve seen the market declines coming from in aggregate has really started to materialize, and whereas two years ago we were surprised at how much faster costs were coming down, we\u2019ve gotten more aggressive with our assumptions and now they\u2019re roughly consistent with what we were thinking. ","We continue to be very optimistic longer term about batteries, and as the whole industry has talked about, it\u2019s really not about the power sector. It\u2019s being driven much more by the electric vehicle sector, and those drivers appear to be pretty clear for quite a number of years down the road, which is really driving the manufacturing efficiencies and scale that we\u2019re seeing on a battery pack side. So really excited about optimistic about where that business is headed.","Unknown Analyst","Got it. Could you just comment on the retrofit opportunity for either NEER or NEP for batteries, and would it be possible to get the tax credits on adding storage to an existing solar project? ","Rebecca Kujawa","You know, it could obviously be a significant opportunity coincident with the significant deployment of [indiscernible] particularly where the penetration is high, adding batteries to existing solar sites could be very advantageous. To the extent that they\u2019ve elected the ITC and ultimately are being used to charge the battery system, yes, they would qualify for ITCs as long as we meet certain conditions. It\u2019s a terrific opportunity for the team, but it\u2019s really consistent with what we\u2019ve been thinking about for the overall market opportunity and what we\u2019ve been highlighting for quite some time now to investors.","Unknown Analyst","Got it. Just one last question from me, if you could talk about the impact on interest rates on NEP\u2019s ability to execute the convertible refinancings. Thank you.","Rebecca Kujawa","It\u2019s been terrific. A low interest rate environment is obviously terrific for both of our businesses. We love low cost of capital to be able to deploy these solutions as economically as possible for both our customers on the Energy Resources side, as well as regulated utilities and of course also for NextEra Energy Partners. It\u2019s been terrific.","Unknown Analyst","Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, with that we will conclude today\u2019s question and answer session, as well as today\u2019s conference.

Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew Roskot","Thank you, Dorie [ph]. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company.","Rebecca will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be able to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation, on our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com.

You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rebecca","Rebecca Kujawa","Thank you, Matt, and good morning everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong first quarter results and is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 12% year-over-year reflecting successful performance across all of our businesses. FPL increased earnings per share $0.20 from the prior year comparable period, which was driven by continued investments in the business for the benefit of our customers.","The roughly 1,750-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, which is among the cleanest and most fuel efficient power plants of its kind in the world, entered service at the end of the first quarter on budget and ahead of schedule.","During the quarter, FPL also successfully completed the construction on schedule and on budget of nearly 300 megawatts of cost effective solar projects built under the Solar Base Rate Adjustment or SoBRA, mechanism of our settlement agreement.","By executing on smart capital investments such as these, FPL is able to maintain our best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service.","FPL\u2019s typical residential bill remains nearly 30% below the national average and below the level it was in 2006, while our service reliability has never been higher. The integration of Gulf Power, which we closed on at the start of the first quarter, continues to progress smoothly. We are now focused on ensuring we successfully execute on key systems and capital initiatives. We have already begun to see significant benefits from our focus on operational cost effectiveness with base retail O&M cost down nearly 5% year-over-year.","Consistent with our focus at FPL, we are also identifying smart capital investments to further reduce costs and improve overall customer value proposition. By executing on this strategy, we expect the acquisition to benefit customers, shareholders and the Florida economy.","At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by $0.10 per share year-over-year primarily reflecting contributions from new investments. There was another strong quarter of renewables origination with our backlog increasing by nearly a 1000 megawatts since the last call.","Included in these backlog additions, is our first co-located, combined, wind, solar and storage project. As we further advanced the next phase of renewables deployment, the pair's low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution to provide a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a merely firm generation resource. At this early point in the year, we are pleased with our progress at FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources.","Now let's look at the detailed results beginning first with FPL. For the first quarter of 2019, FPL reported net income of $588 million or $1.22 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.20 year-over-year.","Regulatory capital employed growth of 8.3% was a significant driver of FPLs EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter appeals. FPL\u2019s Capital expenditures were approximately $1.1 billion for the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be between $5.7 billion and $6.1 billion.","Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2019 compared to 11.2% for the 12 months ending March, 2018. During the quarter, we utilized $156 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $385 million.","As we previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year, given the pattern of its underlying revenues and expenses and we expect this year to be no different. We continue to expect that FPL and 2020 with the sufficient amount of surplus to continue operating under the current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years, creating further customer benefits by avoiding a base rate increase during this time.","Turning to our development efforts, we continue to identify smart capital investments to further enhance our already best-in-class customer value proposition. Consistent with the \"30-by-30\" plan we announced earlier this year, FPL\u2019s Ten-Year Site Plan that was filed with the Florida Public Service Commission earlier this month included plans for roughly 7,000 megawatts of additional cost effective solar projects across Florida over the coming years.","This includes the approximately 300 megawatts that remain under the SoBRA mechanism of our settlement agreement as well as, the nearly 1,500 megawatts of SolarTogether community solar projects that we expect to construct over the next two years subject to approval by the Florida Public Service Commission.","Through SolarTogether, which would be the nation's largest community solar program participating customers will subscribe to a portion of new solar power capacity and in return they will receive credits that are expected to reduce their monthly bills over time.","During the initial pre-registration period, customer demand for the voluntary program was substantial, with approximately 200 of FPL\u2019s largest energy users indicating more than 1100 megawatts of intended participation.","The 20 new universal solar sites that are currently planned for this program are projected to cost approximately $1.8 billion and generate an estimated $139 million in net lifetime savings with non-participating customers expected to receive 20% of this total. To support what is one of the largest ever solar expansions, FPL has already secured approximately 7 gigawatts of potential sites.","During the quarter, FPL also announced its modernization plan to replace two existing natural gas steam units totaling approximately 1,650 megawatts with clean and renewable energy, including the world's largest solar powered battery system. The 409-megawatt, 900-megawatt hour Manatee Energy Storage Center is expected to increase the predictability of the existing co-located solar project, enabling FPL to more efficiently dispatch other power plants. The project is expected to enter service in 2021 and save customers more than $100 million, while eliminating more than 1 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions.","We will provide additional detail on these announcements and other capital initiatives at our June investor conference.","Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported first quarter 2019 net income of $37 million dollars or $0.08 per share. During the first 12 months, following the closing of the Gulf Power acquisition, we intend to exclude onetime acquisition integration costs, including those related to enhanced early retirement programs, severance and system costs. We do not intend to exclude any integration costs beyond this year.","Interest expense to finance the acquisition is reflected in the Corporate and Other segment, and largely offsets the first quarter of Gulf Power net income contribution. Gulf Power\u2019s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.0% for the 12 months ending March 2019.","For full year 2019, we are targeting a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. We expect to achieve the regulatory ROE expansion through operating efficiencies, while making significant capital investments to improve the value proposition for our Gulf Power customers.","During the quarter, Gulf Power\u2019s capital expenditures were roughly $100 million and we expect our full year capital investments to be approximately $700 million. We will provide additional details on Gulf Power\u2019s operating plan and capital investment opportunities in June.","During the quarter, Gulf Power filed a cost recovery petition for the approximately $350 million in Hurricane Michael restoration costs. Subject to a review and prudence determination of the final storm costs by the Florida Public Service Commission, Gulf is proposing a surcharge equivalent to $8 per month on a 1000 kilowatt hour residential bill until the storm costs are fully recovered, which is expected to occur after approximately 60 months.","Gulf Power believes that the proposed surcharge strikes an appropriate balance between ensuring timely cost recovery and mitigating customer bill impacts. The Florida economy continues to show healthy results and is among the strongest in the nation. The current unemployment rate of 3.5% is near the lowest levels in a decade and remains below the national average.","The real estate sector continues to grow with average building permits in the Case-Shiller index for South Florida up 11.6% and 4.8% respectively versus the prior year. Florida's consumer confidence level also remains near a 10-year high.","During the quarter, FPL\u2019s average number of customers increased by approximately 100,000 from the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying growth as well as the addition of Vero Beach's roughly 35,000 customers late last year.","FPL\u2019s first quarter retail sales increased 0.5% year-over-year. Partially offsetting customer growth was a decline in overall usage per customer of 0.5% driven by unfavorable weather, and an estimated 0.1% decrease in weather normalized usage per customer.","A slight decline in underlying usage is a reversal from the trend over the past 12 months, but as we have often discussed, this measure can be volatile over time. We will continue to monitor closely and analyze the underlying usage and we'll update you on future calls.","For Gulf Power, the average number of customers was roughly flat to the comparable prior year quarter. We estimate that hurricane Michael resulted in a decrease of approximately 7000 customers, roughly offsetting the strong growth experienced during the earlier months of 2018.","Overtime we expect that 60% to 80% of these customers will return as they are able to rebuild and otherwise recover from this devastating storm. Gulf Power\u2019s first quarter retail sales decreased 7.5% year-over-year primarily due to milder than normal weather in 2019 relative to the extreme cold experienced in January of 2018.","As a reminder, unlike FPL, Gulf Power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset fluctuations in revenue or costs. Now let me turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $301 million or $0.63 per share, and adjusted earnings of $448 million or $0.93 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.10 or approximately 12% from last year's comparable quarter results.","Last year\u2019s first quarter results have been restated higher by $9 million or $0.02 per share to reflect the adoption of new lease accounting standards during the fourth quarter of 2018. New investments added $0.08 per share primarily reflecting the roughly 1,700 megawatts of new contracted wind and solar projects that were commissioned during 2018. Weaker wind resource during the first quarter was responsible for roughly the entire $0.10 decline in contributions from existing generation assets.","First quarter fleet wide wind resource was one of the worst over the past 30 years at 91% percent of the long term average, versus 102% during the first quarter of 2018. We continue to have confidence in the accuracy of our long term wind resource assumptions and expect to continue to experience both positive and negative quarterly variability. The appendix of today's presentation includes a slide with additional details of long term resource variability for the current Energy Resources\u2019 wind portfolio.","Beyond Renewables, our other existing generation assets continue to perform well. We were pleased to receive the 20-year license extension for the Seabrook\u2019s Nuclear facility, allowing the profitable plant to continue to offer the New England states attractively priced carbon free energy until at least 2050.","Our gas infrastructure business including pipelines, and the customer supply and trading businesses both contributed favorably to the first quarter results. All other impacts including small favorable year-over-year tax items and low corporate G&A due to the timing of development activity increased results by $0.03 versus 2018.","As I mentioned earlier, The Energy Resources Development team had another strong quarter of origination. We added 223 megawatts of wind projects to our backlog, including a 100 megawatt build own transfer project, with a 30-year O&M agreement that will allow the customer to leverage Energy Resources best-in-class operating skills while providing ongoing revenue through the contract term.","We also added 485 megawatts of solar projects and 50 megawatts four hour battery storage projects to our backlog. And 110 megawatt solar plus storage build-own-transfer agreement during the quarter, which is not included in our backlog additions.","Our wind repowering program also continued to progress during the quarter, as we added a 195 megawatts to our backlog and commissioned an additional 55 megawatts of repowered projects. Although we expect to continue to sign projects that will go into service before the end of 2020 in the coming months, we are pleased that we already have nearly 2,700 megawatts in backlog for 2021 and beyond.","Beyond renewables, while we continue to advance MVP toward ultimate completion and we expect to ramp up construction activities in the coming months, the Fourth Circuit's decision not to pursue, an en banc review on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Appalachian trail crossing authorization presents a challenge to both timing and cost. Since the original court decision, we have been working with our project partners on several alternatives to address the issue, and we continue to vigorously pursue these tasks.","At this point our previously announced fourth quarter 2019 target in-service date appears unlikely. We are continuing to work through options with our partners and we'll provide a further update in the near future.","As a reminder, we do not expect any material adjusted earnings impacts, nor any change to NextEra Energy\u2019s financial expectations regardless of the outcome of the ongoing challenges related to MVP.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy; for the first quarter of 2019, GAAP\u2019s net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $680 million or $1.41 per share. NextEra Energy\u2019s 20 19 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.06 billion and $2.20 per share respectively.","Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment decreased $0.14 per share compared to the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher interest expense as a result of the financing related to the Gulf Power acquisition.","Since the last call, we have completed approximately $5.2 billion and longer term financing transactions to replace the bridge loans that were executed prior to Gulf Power closing. These financing are both fixed and floating rate and are for a variety of maturities between one and a half and 60 years, with a weighted average tenure of roughly 12 years, and a weighted average interest rate of 4.4% including the effect of the interest rate swaps we entered into at the time of the acquisition announcement. After closing these transactions, we repaid the bridge loans and settled the interest rate hedges.","During the quarter, NextEra Energy Transmission received FERC approval to acquire Trans Bay Cable, a 53-mile, rate regulated, high-voltage, direct current underwater transmission cable system, which provides approximately 40% of San Francisco's daily electrical power needs.","We continue to expect to close the acquisition later this year, assuming we receive the required approval from the California Public Utilities Commission, which is the last material condition outstanding.","Based on our first quarter performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full year. For 2019, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to be at or near the top end of our previously disclosed 6% to 8% growth rate off a 2018 base of $7.70 per share.","Our longer term expectations through 2021 remain unchanged and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver growth at the at or near the top end of our 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate range off of our $7.70 base realized in 2018 plus the expected deal accretion from the Florida transactions.","From 2018 to 2021, we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. As always, our financial expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.","In summary, after a strong start to the year, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's future prospects. At FPL, we continue to focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition through operational cost effectiveness, productivity, and making smart long term investments.","The Gulf Power integration continues to advance well, and everything we see today leaves us even more confident about our ability to deliver the financial expectations we have previously outlined for Gulf, while improving the customer value proposition.","Energy Resources maintains significant competitive advantages and continues to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to drive long term shareholder value, and we remain intensely focused on executing on these opportunities.","Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners. The NEP portfolio performed well and delivered financial results in line with our expectations after accounting for below normal wind resource. Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $48.25 per common unit or $1.93 per common unit on an annualized basis up 15% from a year earlier.","Inclusive of this increase, NEP has grown its distribution per unit by nearly 160% since IPO. During the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners announced an agreement to acquire a geographically diverse portfolio of six wind and solar projects from NextEra. Energy Resources.","The approximately 600 megawatts of projects, which have a weighted average contract life of 15 years, and a counterparty credit rating of A2 [ph] and A at S&P, further diversify NEP\u2019s existing portfolio.","Upon completion, the acquisition combined with an associated recapitalization of existing NEP assets is expected to enable NEP to complete the growth necessary to achieve our previously outlined year-end 2019 run rate expectations even after excluding the PG&E related projects cash flows.","These transactions are expected to be financed with a $900 million convertible equity portfolio financing, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment, as well as existing NEP debt capacity.","Let me now review the detailed results for NEP. First quarter adjusted EBITDA of $225 million and cash available for distribution of $47 million were generally in line with our expectations after accounting for the weak wind resource. The first quarter of 2018 presents a particularly challenging comparable quarter as both adjusted EBITDA and CAFD benefited from the $30 million acceleration of the note receivable related to the sale of our Jericho asset.","In addition, the adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution contribution from existing assets was reduced by approximately $23 million and $22 million respectively as a result of the weak wind resource, which was 89% of the long term average, versus 105% in the first quarter of 2018.","As noted, during our discussion around Energy Resources results, we have confidence in our long term resource assumptions, and expect to continue to experience both positive and negative quarterly variability.","For the balance of 2019, based on the shape of the contributions from the recently divested and acquired assets, we expect most of an NEP\u2019s growth in adjusted EBITDA and CAFD to be in the second half of the year.","At the end of the first quarter, approximately $38 million of cash distributions for PG&E related projects including Desert Sunlight 250, which is contracted with Southern California Edison were restricted as a result of events of defaults under the financing that arose due to PG&E bankruptcy filing.","PG&E continues to make payments under all of our contracts for post-petition energy deliveries and we continue to pursue all options to protect our interests, including vigorously defending our contracts, and working with key stakeholders of each financing. Additional details of our first quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide.","As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NEP\u2019s portfolio with the acquisition from NextEra Energy Resources that we announced during the quarter. NEP expects to acquire the unlevered portfolio for total consideration of $1.02 billion subject to working capital and other adjustments.","The acquisition is expected to close later this quarter and contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million to $115 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $97 million to $107 million, each on an annual run rate basis as of December 31, 2019.","Following the acquisition, these assets will be combined with 581 megawatts of existing NEP wind assets into a new portfolio. The $220 million of existing project debt on the current NEP assets is expected to be immediately paid down, creating significant benefits for NEP including being net present value, distribution per unit, and credit accretive as well as generating roughly $25 million in incremental CAFD.","To finance the new acquisition and debt recapitalization of the existing assets, NEP will utilize the proceeds from a $900 million convertible equity portfolio financing with KKR as well as existing debt capacity.","The KKR financing will have an initial, effective annual coupon of less than 1% and provide an EP with the flexibility to periodically buy out KKR\u2019s equity interest at a fixed 8.3% pre-tax return inclusive of all prior distributions between the 3.5 year and 6 year anniversaries of the agreement.","NEP will have the right to pay a minimum of 70% of the buyout price in NEP common units, issued at no discount to the then current market price. This transaction further demonstrates NEP\u2019s continued ability to access attractive sources of capital to finance its growth while providing third party confirmation of NEP\u2019s long term outlook and high quality portfolio.","Relative to the initial convertible equity portfolio financing transaction that we executed with BlackRock in 2018, this financing will have several features that further enhance the value for NEP unit holders. With a lower initial coupon, more cash will be available to LP unit holders allowing NEP to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of future distribution growth.","If NEP acquires fewer assets, it will have lower future financing needs. As a result, following the transaction, we believe NEP will be well positioned to meet its long term financial expectations without the need to sell common equity until 2021 at the earliest other than modest sales under the at the market program.","In addition to reduced future equity needs, NEP will retain the flexibility to convert the pending KKR portfolio financing into common units at no discount over a longer period of time. This should be accretive to NEP unit holders who retain all of the unit price upside as NEP executes on its expected distribution growth objectives.","Additionally, NEP will maintain significant option value on the underlying portfolio of assets while also preserving debt capacity and balance sheet flexibility. Upon successfully executing the transaction that we announced last quarter, NextEra Energy Partners expects to achieve its 2019 growth objectives assuming no cash is available from the PG&E related projects.","Excluding all contributions from these projects, NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect a year end 2019 run rate for CAFD in the range of $410 million to $480 million, reflecting the calendar year 2020 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2019.","If PG&E related cash distributions were included, year-end 2019 CAFD expectations would be in the range of $485 million to $555 million. Year-end 2019 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations, which assume for contributions from projects related to PG&E as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized, remain unchanged at $1.2 billion to $1.375 billion.","From a base of our fourth quarter 2018 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.86 per common unit, we see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023 subject to our usual caveats.","Additionally, following the transactions, transaction announced earlier this quarter NEP announced its intention to grow its 2019 distribution at 15% resulting in an annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2019 distribution that is payable in February 2020 to be at least $2.14 per common unit.","Our ability to continue to grow distributions at the top end of our expectations range for 2019 despite the PG&E related headwind is reflective of NEP\u2019s market leading position and our continued focus on delivering value for LP unit holders.","NEP continues to maintain flexibility to grow in three ways; through organic growth, third party acquisitions or through acquisitions from NextEra Energy Resources, providing clear visibility into its future growth prospects.","Energy Resources currently has nearly 21 gigawatts of projects it could sell to NEP including its existing operating renewable assets and its backlog of projects it intends to build over the coming years.","Additionally, despite the recent challenges related to PG&E, during the quarter NEP demonstrated its ability to access extremely low cost financings to support its growth. With continued financing flexibility, a strong base of underlying assets, a favorable tax position, and enhanced governance rights, NEP is well positioned to meet its growth expectations.","We remain focused on continuing to execute and creating value for LP unit holders going forward. In summary, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are benefiting from our history of strong execution that has positioned us well to capitalize on the terrific growth opportunities available to us across our businesses.","We look forward to sharing more detail with you at our investor conference on June 20th. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that we will open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] At this time we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And we will take our first question from Stephen Byrd at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Hi, good morning.","Rebecca Kujawa","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Byrd","Wanted to talk about Resources, you continue to put up impressive growth numbers there. I noticed BOT build-own-transfer continues to show up. Would you mind just talking at a high level in terms of trends, with respect to BOT, do you see a trend in that direction, is this more just what you expected it's going to be a part of the mix, but not a not a growing trend? What are you seeing in terms of the BOT side of the market?","Rebecca Kujawa","Stephen, as you know, we've seen the tremendous growth in our renewables opportunities across the board, and we have historically benefited from sales to IOU customers, munis and co-ops, as well as a growing demand from C&I customers. Two of those groups, the munis and co-ops, as well as the C&I customers, generally are not that interested in build-own-transfers or owning the renewable assets. They are very happy to take advantage of all of the advantages that we bring to the table, including of our cost of capital, our scale, our ability to construct and deliver these projects, and ultimately operate them over the long-term at a low price.","Our IOU customers are increasingly building renewables and wanting to procure and incorporate more into their portfolios. So, as the pie has gotten bigger, there is probably a nominal number of megawatts that are increasing in terms of build-own-transfers, and our team has been able to successfully offer to our customers a multitude of benefits to them of bringing a very -- all of the advantages that we bring to them and sell, part of it is build-own-transfer, and typically part of it is a PPA to them, bringing a total package that is very valuable to our customers. So, it's increasing, but very positive addition to our portfolio. John might add some more.","John Ketchum","Yes, Steven this is John. What I would add to that is the way I look at BOT is it enables more contracts. So the BOT that you saw this quarter was the Portland General transaction, where we had you know a trifecta of wind and solar with battery storage and the BOT was part of the wind facility that we actually ended up building, but we got a contract back for the other piece of it. And that's typically the type of BOT transaction that you'll see us enter into. But it is -- it is a part of the business and it's an enablement for more contracted origination around the renewable portfolio.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. So it's a two on two kit. You earn good returns on an as part of the solution you offered to some customers, so I understood. And wanted to shift over to SolarTogether. This is a really interesting model and Rebecca you mentioned briefly to the savings to customers, would you mind just speaking a little bit to this? It does seem like a like a nice model to offer Solar to your customers. I just want to make sure I understood the, what you had mentioned I think on the $1.8 billion cost. I think you mentioned $139 million of savings. Could you just talk through that a little bit more in terms of the benefits to customers from SolarTogether?","Rebecca Kujawa","Yes. So as you might expect, we've long been excited about deploying more solar in Florida. It is the Sunshine State and as solar has gotten to be more cost effective, we're very excited about bringing it to our -- across our entire portfolio. And there's certain amount of interest from our C&I customers who don't necessarily want to take on the ownership and construction responsibility particularly when it's not at scale and not as cost competitive as what we can build.","And so when we went out and offered up this idea of a community solar program, we got a significant amount of interest from our large C&I customers, which is primarily the group that we went out to talk to you and that was the 1,100 megawatts of initial demand for this pre-registration period that we offered up. And so then we sized our program to be around 1,500 megawatts.","So in the layout of the program, customers that sign up for this, the voluntary participation will pay a certain amount on their bill in the near term and over the long term will receive credits against their bill, but about 25%, 20%, 25% of the savings. The net savings to the overall system are actually going to be retained by the non-participating customers. So FPL\u2019s existing customers will get a benefit from this program as well.","Stephen Byrd","That's helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Yes, hi good morning. Hopefully you can hear me. Okay.","Rebecca Kujawa","We can hear you fine, Steve. Good morning.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, great. So just could you maybe give a little more color on the MVP comments with respect to just more color and also what would be driving an update soon as opposed to like now for the Analyst Day?","Rebecca Kujawa","So as I mentioned in the in the prepared remarks, we along with everybody else were certainly disappointed by the Circuit Court not taking up the en banc review. And as soon as you know the initial adverse decision was made, we started working closely with our partners on a variety of different options whether it's legislative administrative etcetera to resolve the issues so that we can continue to build and ultimately bring online MVP. And we remain confident that you know one of those many options will ultimately come together so that we can put MVP into service, which at this point we think will be even more valuable than what we originally thought just because of the challenges that building pipelines in this area has proven to be. But at this point, looking at what we previously targeted for our in-service date of year-end 2019 that's challenging.","So we're still working on what exactly the path forward is and the timing for COD. We are going to resume construction. As you know we temporarily you know paused construction during kind of tone down construction during the winter period just for the overall conditions, as we're starting to get to the spring, we\u2019ll resume construction where we can. And then as we firm up plans, it's clear which of these options will come to fruition and we'll give you more specifications in terms of timing and ultimate cost.","James Robo","Steve, this is Jim. We certainly have both a date and a cost for you at the listing.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then also could you talk a little bit more about the underground in legislation and just what the investment opportunity and customer benefit is there?","Rebecca Kujawa","Sure. I'll start and I'll probably hand it over to Eric to add some more details. As everyone is well aware after the devastating impacts in our service territory from Irma, and then broader in Florida from Michael and other hurricanes. It became clear to a lot of critical stakeholders about how important it is to have continuous service for our customers.","As you probably know, Florida is now a trillion dollar annual economy. So I think it's something like the 16th largest economy in the world if we were our own economy. So every day that we\u2019re off line is a significant harm to our state. And so there's an appreciation from critical stakeholders in the legislature and other communities about the value of resiliency in our grid. And one of the ways that we can you know improve the resiliency is through some undergrounding.","So there's some legislation going through the current session in Florida for the possibility of setting up a separate clause that ultimately we could recover investments and earn a return on for undergrounding our service territory through a clause mechanism.","Eric Silagy","Hi Steve, this is Eric Silagy. I guess the only thing I\u2019ll add on this is that the legislation has progressed through both the Senate and the House pretty well, it's gone through six different committees, three in the House, three in the Senate, it's passed out of all those committees unanimously. So to date, there hasn't been a single no vote against it, in either body. There are some slight differences in the versions, so those have to be reconciled. It's not really subsidize [ph] and it's more of a verbiage, but we expect it to be taken up by the full House, the full Senate in the coming next week or so two weeks to the most, till the end of the session.","And if it passes, then indications are that the government will be supportive as well. And there is a huge focus on resiliency in the state as Rebecca talked about, and frankly we've worked very hard over the past couple of years, with a couple of pilot programs to look at how do we get costs out of underground. And we've gotten it now to the point where and particularly under a programmatic approach, we'd be able to get the cost to be equal if not even a little better than some of the hardening efforts that we do aboveground. That's a real win for customers, both financially as well as obviously resiliency.","Steve Fleishman","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Shahriar Pourreza at Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey good morning guys.","Rebecca Kujawa","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza","So just let me, just ask a quick question a couple here, but around Santee Cooper. There's obviously a lot of mixed data points we're seeing with lawmakers. The town hall meetings seem to be a little bit noisy and we kind of still have two competing bills. And then on the other hand, the process seems to be much more competitive than we all thought, so maybe a quick status update regarding the process. Are we still expecting some sort of closure in a decision by the June timeframe?","Rebecca Kujawa","So maybe I'll start off with the typical caveats that I think are an appropriate response to the question. And if maybe Jim wants to add something specific, I\u2019ll toss it to him. But as you know, we typically don't comment on M&A activity other than very general comments that we look for opportunities where there's a constructive regulatory environment. It's accretive. And ultimately there's a good fit from our business perspective including opportunity to deploy the Florida Playbook, and being able to improve customer value proposition for our customers. I don\u2019t know Jim if you want add some specific comments.","James Robo","So obviously we've confirmed that we put a bid in for Santee. And there is a process going on. I would expect it to come to conclusion here by June. And we will see how it plays out. I think, I think the state realizes that they know that Santee has upwards of $4 billion to $5 billion of debt for you know on asset there you know the nuclear plant that is never going to generate any income.","And so, it's an issue for the state that they need to address. And I think the vast majority of folks in the state understand that they need to address it. And the key stakeholders are I think working hard to come to a conclusion about how the process is going to move forward. So you know we're cautiously optimistic that they bring you know that the legislature passes something to lay out what the process will be and then then we'll see.","As I said, we did confirm in the last call that we put a bid in, and you can imagine that we'll continue to play in the process. And it's someplace where we think we can, we can add a lot of value and bring value to customers and bring value to economic development in the state.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. Got it. And just a quick update on Gulf Power, you're sort of five months into it. It seems like you're still kind of reiterating the $0.15 to $0.20 of accretion despite Gulf already contributing $0.08 in the quarter. Are you starting to see some incremental near-term opportunities to your prior stated accretion guide or is there something you'll update at the Analyst Day?","Rebecca Kujawa","Well, a couple of comments on Gulf. First, a high level maybe taking more of the second part of your question, first. We obviously closed at the very beginning of this year and we are as enthusiastic as ever about the opportunities with Gulf as we were prior to closing the acquisition. I personally spent time up there I know many of the other folks on the senior team and obviously we have a terrific team at Gulf now executing, and that's both taking cost out of the business as well as identifying the smart capital investments, which will ultimately deliver on the value proposition that we've been targeting with FPL, which is low bills, high reliability, terrific customer services and clean energy.","So very optimistic and excited about it. More specifically to the numbers. Yes, you're correct on the $0.08, but as you know we're going to highlight the Gulf contributions as its own entity, and then for the financing costs, the financing costs to close the acquisition are showing up at CNL. So you might want to think about those two together.","We do have opportunities to further improve the cost position through the balance of the year. We'll also start to ramp up the capital investments. Now as I talked about, we're planning to deploy a total of $700 million for the full year at Gulf and then obviously there's some ROE improvement that I talked about in the prepared remarks as well.","Our guidance expectations remained from the overall company perspective as we talked about of our 6% to 8% growth from our 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70 in 2019. And then we expect to have the incremental accretion on top of that growth rate of $0.15 in 2020 and $0.20 in 2021.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. And then lastly, Rebecca just you mentioned administrative options with MVP. Can you confirm if you're working with the ACP owners around this option? Like what stated -- obviously they are completely different projects, but what how much collaborating are you doing with the ACP owners like Dominion, especially when...","Rebecca Kujawa","I don't want to talk through really the details of that. As we've -- as I talked about a couple of minutes ago, we worked very closely with our partners to develop different options and we do believe there are various options in order to complete it, but we don't really think that it's to our advantage to get through a lot of the details of that out publicly. So, we're working on it very hard. We remain confident in our ability to ultimately construct and bring it into service.","Shahriar Pourreza","Great. Thanks, guys.","Rebecca Kujawa","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?","Rebecca Kujawa","Good morning, Julien. We can hear you fine.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. All right. So at this point, I think perhaps a couple of clarifications. Perhaps starting with the last question, on Gulf, just to go back to what you were saying about your expectations on earned ROEs already pretty healthy, how do you think about the timeline to go back in for a formal rate case?","And then also perhaps the prospects of getting an amortization type mechanism eventually. I mean, certainly that would be one of the multiple priorities, I would imagine in contemplating any kind of rate recovery. But at the same time, given the ability to earn within the band clearly the upper end already, how do you think that timeline?","Rebecca Kujawa","So we're still at the early stages, Julien. We closed it a couple of months ago. And right now the teams head is very much into identifying the cost, saving the opportunities putting the -- dot the I's and crossing the T's on the capital initiatives that we can make, and we're putting those plans together.","For now I'd like to limit it to the comments that we made in the script and the prepared remarks that we expect to be at the upper half of the ROE band, and we expect to target the capital investment opportunities of a total of $700 million in 2019. And then to the extent that we can put more detail around that, particularly around the capital initiatives, we'll highlight more of those at the June Investor Conference.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Totally appreciated. And then secondly, if you can just coming back to you started the Q&A on the backlog here, it seems like another shift in backlog seems to be longer-dated beyond the 2020 period. If you look at what was added, it seems like the bulk of it for this quarter was added and the bulk of it -- that was solar.","Can you comment a little bit about the economics of solar in the backlog as you move through time in 2019 and 2020 versus the 2020 onwards type projects? And then perhaps any other nuances you might see in terms of safe harboring or otherwise in the 2020 onwards type time frame?","Rebecca Kujawa","I think there are a couple of comments in there, Julien. So you'll have to correct me if I don't hit all of them. But in terms of the timing of the backlog, as you know, we set out expectations at our last Investor Conference for the full 2017 through 2020 time frame. We're now healthily in those ranges, which sets us up very well to deliver on the expectations that we've long talked to you all about.","And as we highlighted in the script today, we now have the 2,700 megawatts of projects that are beyond 2020. I mean that's actually building up over time and there is actually one or two projects that moved from the -- before 2021 time frame into 2021.","We're starting to see customers shift, their focus to beyond 2020. I wouldn't say that the team has stopped the efforts to sign contracts for 2020 COD, and in fact, I'm sure John will tell you that he is pushing his team hard and no doubt customers continue to be interested in signing up wind projects before the end of 2020. But of course, with solar still having the technical benefits, tax incentives into the early 2020s, customers are certainly focusing on that as well.","To answer the return question, our returns as we long talked about has generally remained consistent on a levered basis over time. And that hasn't changed materially in recent weeks or months.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right. All right. Excellent. Well, we can leave it there. Thank you very much again.","JamesRobo","Hey, Julien. This is Jim. The only other thing I would add to your -- as you can imagine we are safe harboring for 2021 and beyond. So we're not taking advantage of that opportunity.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right. You should assume everything safe harbored.","James Robo","Correct.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Exactly. All right. Excellent.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys, and thank you.","Rebecca Kujawa","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold","Could I just ask on the -- the subject of BOT and the backlog, and it just seem you've had situations where you are adding BOT to the backlog, and then others where you -- including last quarter where you didn't. What's the trigger to determine whether BOT is shown in backlog or not?","Rebecca Kujawa","Yes, typically if there are some sort of operating agreement, whether it is ongoing economic value to us then we have decided to include it in our backlog, where the transaction is really focused more on a build and to resale and then the operations and all ongoing economics or to the customers benefit, we've excluded it.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And so...","John Ketchum","Yes. So, Jonathan, this is John. So the contracts that's BOT this quarter again is related to Portland General. So 300-megawatt wind facility, 100 megawatts BOT, 200-megawatt is the balance that we will own under a contract.","And so that facility is going to be -- the whole 300 megawatts is going to be operated by us, I'm sorry, got that backwards 200 megawatts is the piece, that's the BOT, and 100 megawatt is piece that we take back.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. So that makes sense. But then, for example, say the 200 megawatts BOT project that you announced on the fourth quarter call, was that something different? And then would that -- is that we shouldn't anticipate that would end up in backlog or should we?","John Ketchum","No, no. That would not be in backlog. And just to clarify, we got 100 megawatts of BOT, and right with Portland General, 200 megawatts under contract.","Jonathan Arnold","Yes, this is all that Wheatridge, correct, to see that in the...","John Ketchum","That's all Wheatridge.","Jonathan Arnold","And then there's the solar piece as well.","John Ketchum","There's the solar piece as well and the battery storage.","Jonathan Arnold","The storage piece. Yeah, Okay, I got it. Thank you for that. And then just on one -- an another topic. And if we -- as we're thinking about what to anticipate at the Analyst Day, and then we talked about at some point you might sort of start talking more around profitability metrics on backlog and as opposed to just megawatts. Is that something that you think might be part of the update or is still work in progress?","Rebecca Kujawa","Jonathan, it is very much a work in progress. I think the general outline should be somewhat consistent with what we've talked about in the past, which is overviews of our -- basically putting meat to the bone, you're helping you understand with the growth opportunities are for each of our businesses. Obviously for the first time at Gulf Power, we detailed plans on how we're looking at the business and what the opportunities are.","At Energy Resources, we certainly -- it's likely we will put together an overview of the renewables marketed as we see it today, to help you see some of the details of why our team continues to be excited about renewable economics, and ultimately demand from our customers that will enable us to continue to grow our business.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions. Just curious, a lot going on in Florida these days, and this maybe one for Eric. How are you guys thinking about a handful of items, one is the outstanding petition or complaint regarding tax reform implementation in the last FP&L kind of rate review?","The other is I think, there's still some litigation outstanding or challenge regarding implementation of the SoBRA mechanism. And then finally, just curious is there anything that has to happen or anything that could happen that could derail the two-year extension of the existing rate agreement you have?","Eric Silagy","Yes. Hey, Michael, it's Eric. So, let me start with the tax reform docket. We've had -- we recently had hearings over it and filed testimony, there's going to be additional hearings that take place in mid-May. Look, we feel very good about our position, and how it fits within our rate agreement. Our arguments are solid and sound. It's a proceeding, we will go through it. But I feel very good about where we stand overall from the tax reform position.","Other areas, obviously as you know we've got -- the Irma docket is still out there too, that's going to be in mid-June. Again feel very good about that. That was a storm that we actually restored more people faster than anybody in history, and we paid for using our tax savings to reserve amortization.","So, I feel very good about our positions in Florida Public Service Commission. I can't predict who's going to oppose what and when they're going to file for hearings. But right now, the arguments have been strong and the hearings have gone well so far.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thanks, Eric.","Rebecca Kujawa","And Michael, I shall add to Eric's comments as you referenced to the -- you're going in for a rate case. As we talked about both in the script, and obviously in prior comments, tax reform enabled us to potentially have a two-year extension of our settlement agreement, and that obviously the benefit of delaying any amount of time is further delaying the time where we'd need a base rate increase from our customers, so hopefully saving the customers some money.","But it's up to two years, and we'll have to go through the thought process as we typically do about when is the best time to go in and looking at all of our costs and our forecast about when do we need some incremental revenues.","Michael Lapides","Got it. But there's nothing mandating you to come in at any point in time. It's up to -- it's kind of an FP&L or NextEra decision on when to come in?","Rebecca Kujawa","Well as you know, under the settlement agreement, we need to notify the commission in March of 2020, if we intend to come in within the next year time frame after that.","Eric Silagy","Right. So Michael, the settlement takes us through 2020, through the end of 2020, we have to notify if we choose to extend, but it is our choice to unilateral decision, and we'll do that by March of 2020, and as Rebecca said, it could be up to two years is what we've been saying.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Eric and Rebecca. Much appreciated.","Operator","This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"15884":["NextEra Energy, Inc.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Finnis. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Amanda Finnis","[Audio Gap] NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company.","Moray will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward- looking statements, if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today\u2019s earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our Web site nexteraenergy.com and.nexteraenergypartners.com.

You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today\u2019s presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.","Moray Dewhurst","Thank you Amanda and good morning everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter capping off an outstanding year overall. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share grew 8.4% while full year adjusted earnings per share growth was 6.6% even including a negative impact of $0.15 per share associated with the launch of NEP. ","Just as important, we made excellent progress on our major capital initiatives and energy resources had one of its best years ever in terms of new project origination, signing contracts for roughly 1,400 megawatts of new renewable projects as well as partnering with EQT to begin development to the Mountain Valley Pipeline. As a result, we\u2019re very well positioned for future growth and can reasonably expect to be able to extend our long-term track record of growing adjusted earnings in the 5% to 7% range at least through 2018.","Cash flow from operations grew 7.8% leading to a slight improvement in our cash flow coverage metrics as expected and we maintained our strong credit position which remains an important competitive advantage in a capital intensive industry.","In addition to all these developments, 2014 saw the very successful launch of NEP the initial assets which delivered operating and financial performance in line with expectations. A favorable development of energy resources contracted renewable portfolio coupled with other factors led us to conclude that it makes sense to accelerate the growth of the NEP portfolio in 2015 and we now expect to reach the so called high slits which implies LP unit distributions at an annualized rate of $1.13 by the end of this year.","Late in December, the growth potential of energy resources and by extension NEP was further supported by the federal government\u2019s action to extend the Wind PTC program another year which we expect will mean that we will be able to offer our customers very attractive pricing on Wind projects with delivery dates through the end of 2016. Longer-term, we continue to believe the growth potential for renewables will be strong, supported by both improving economics and the EPAs Queens power plant. ","All in all, it was an exceptionally strong year with excellent current financial performance balanced with equally positive developments in terms of future growth potential. We\u2019re very pleased with the progress we have made.","Now let\u2019s turn to the results for the quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter of 2014, FPL reported net income of $286 million or $0.65 per share up $0.08 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2014, FPL reported net income of 1.5 billion or 345 per share up $0.29 per share versus 2013.","As a reminder our 2013 results included a negative impact of approximately $0.07 from transition costs associated with project momentum, our enterprise wide productivity initiative. The principle drivers of growth our continued investment in the business and increased wholesale volumes associated with two long-term contracts. FPLs capital expenditures were approximately $832 million in the quarter bringing our full year capital investments to a total of roughly $3.1 billion and driving year-over-year growth and regulatory capital employed of 5.8%.","We achieved significant milestones throughout the year bringing into service the Riviera Beach Clean Energy Center ahead of schedule and slightly below budget, starting construction on our generation modernization project at Port Everglades and continuing to invest in our transmission and distribution network to help us improve our already outstanding system reliability.","Our regulatory ROE for the 12 months ended December 2014 will be approximately 11.5% achieving the 2014 target that we shared with you previously. As a reminder there is no longer an embedded negative impact to transition cost associated with project momentum. Under the current rate agreement you will recall that we record reserve amortization entries to achieve the pre-determined regulatory ROE in this case the 11.5% that I previously mentioned. ","During the fourth quarter, we reduced our accumulative utilization of reserve amortization since 2013 from $155 million to $122 million, a reversal of $33 million leading us a balance of $278 million which can be utilized in 2015 and 2016. Relative to the expectations that we discussed on the last call, the smaller reversal reflects the unfavorable impact of mild weather in the fourth quarter on revenues. However, the $278 million remaining balance is better than we expected when the rate agreement began primarily as a result of our productivity initiatives which have been very successful. Total non-fuel base O&M costs in 2014 were more than $100 million below where we were in 2012. ","Looking ahead, we expect the balance of the reserve amortization coupled with our weather-normalized sales growth forecast at 1.5% to 2% per year and current CapEx and O&M expectations will allow us to support a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5% in 2015 and in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% through the end of our current rate agreement.","We\u2019re continually working hard to find new ways to strengthen the value proposition that we deliver to our customers and I\u2019d like to provide updates on three recent positive developments. ","First, in December, the Florida Public Service Commission approved Woodford project portion of our gas reserves petition and important long-term hedging opportunity against potential volatility in the market price for natural gas. We expect the PSC to decide in March on our proposed guidelines for subsequent investments in natural gas supplies.","Second, 2014 was the second year of FPL\u2019s current rate agreement and the second year for the gas and power optimization program that we proposed as part of that agreement which of course the PSC approved. I\u2019m pleased to report that under this innovative gain sharing program FPL delivered roughly 54 million of incremental value to its customers through optimization activities and once reviewed and approved by the commission we\u2019ll be able to record roughly 13 million of incremental pre-tax income in 2015 under the gain share and provisions. This is an obvious example of a win-win proposition.","Third, we remain optimistic that there is greater potential for additional utility scale solar projects in Florida. Our recent focus has been on improving the economics of three roughly 74 megawatt solar PV projects on which we have already done significant development work and which we expect we\u2019ll be able to enter service in 2016 and qualify for the 30% ITC. I\u2019m pleased to report that yesterday we issued a press release confirming that we believe we can now move forward with these three projects with overall economic benefits to our customers. The total capital investment for these three projects is expected to be approximately $400 million to $420 million. ","Florida\u2019s economy continues to improve in 2014 and again did better than the U.S. average on most major measures. Florida\u2019s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in December was 5.6% down 0.7 percentage points from a year earlier and in line with that with of the nation. However, Florida\u2019s labor force participation rate also increased as more people were attracted to healthier employment market.","Florida added 230,000 jobs over the 12 months period ending December 2014 largely within the private sector. The corresponding growth rates in jobs are 3% outpaced that of the nation by 0.9 percentage points. In fact, Florida\u2019s rate of job creation outpaced the U.S. and the majority of individual private sectors reflecting diversified growth. Florida\u2019s population is also growing at a healthy rate. U.S. Census Bureau reported recently the Florida\u2019s population increased by more than 290,000 people over the 12 month period that ended July 1st of last year reaching 19.9 million and moving Florida ahead of New York as America\u2019s third largest state.","In the housing market, the Case-Shiller index of South Florida shows prices up 9.5% from prior year and building permits appears to be stabilizing at healthy levels. The strengthening economy was reflected improvements in Florida\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index which by the end of the year reached its highest level since February 2007. ","Fourth quarter sales volume was down 3.7% driven by mild weather. FPL\u2019s average number of customers increased by approximately 68,000 or 1.5% compared to the prior year period with a roughly comparable estimated impact to change in sales of 1.4%. As a reminder, the remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by a smart meters was fully deployed by the fourth quarter 2013 consequently none of the fourth quarter 2014 customer growth is attributed to this impact. Usage per customer declined by 5% compared to the prior year with weather accounting for 5.3% of the decrease offset by a 0.3% increase in underlying usage growth.","In the fourth quarter, inactive accounts were roughly 15% below the level of the prior year comparable period and new meter connections continue to show steady improvement by increasing almost 47,000 in 2014 which is over 20% higher than the 2013 additions. For the full year, customer growth in mix increased by 1.2% compared to 2013, year-over-year we have a normalized usage of a customer increased slightly by 0.1%. This metric was somewhat volatile in 2014 but our long-term expectation remains at approximately 0.5% for year net of the impact of efficiency and conservation programs through the period of the rate agreement and flat thereafter. ","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported fourth quarter 2014 GAAP earnings of $614 million or a $39 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $178 million or $0.40 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was flat compared to last year. Strong positive contributions from the new investments as well as improvements in customer supply and trading were offset by reductions in gas infrastructure largely driven by higher depletion rates and by the impact of refueling outages at our Duane Arnold and Point Beach nuclear facilities. ","For the full year 2014, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $985 million or 2.24 per share. Adjusted earnings were $833 million or 1.89 per share. As a reminder adjusted results include the negative impact of $0.15 per share associated with establishing and launching NEP. This in turn includes a $0.10 per share non-cash income tax charge driven by separating our Canadian projects to enable and to fit into the overall NEP structure. ","The growth in Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share of $0.06 for the full year was driven largely by growth in our contract in renewables portfolio which added $0.29 per share. During the year, we installed roughly 1364 megawatts of new wind and 265 megawatts at new solar making 2014 the strongest year ever for new renewable capacity coming into service. We elected CITC for roughly 265 megawatts in solar projects in 2014 compared to approximately 280 megawatts in projects in 2013. We expect to elect CITCs on roughly 365 megawatts in new solar generation in 2050. ","Contributions from our existing business were up $0.06 per share year-over-year. Wind resource for 2014 was slightly above our long-term expectations following a slightly lower resource in 2013. Customer supply and trading overall ended the year-up $0.04 per share, asset sales added $0.01 per share year-over-year. Offsetting these increases were the $0.06 decline in gas infrastructure mainly due to increased depreciation expense primarily related to higher depletion rates. ","Increased interest expense negatively affected the comparison to last year by $0.09 per share due to growth in the business. Contributions from corporate G&A and other decreased $0.04 per share year-over-year primarily driven by share dilution. ","As we did last year, we have included a summary in the Appendix to the presentation that compares Energy Resources realized equivalent EBITDA to the ranges we provided in the third quarter or 2013. In addition, we have updated Energy Resources projected adjusted-EBITDA and cash flow slides and included an additional year forward. The portfolio of financial information for 2015 and 2016 can be found in the Appendix to the presentation. ","Please note that the slides now reflect the impact of the anticipated accelerated growth at NEP. All expectations associated with NEP assume the future training yields roughly comparable to the day\u2019s level. ","Energy Resources financial performance in 2014 was stronger than they appear from the simple calculation of adjusted-EPS growth in part because of the impact of the various costs and accounting charges associated with the establishment of NextEra Energy partners. Growth in the adjusted-EBITDA and cash flow both strong with adjusted-EBITDA growing by 12% and operating cash flow by 29% although the later number is affected by intercompany tax effects and working capital changes. ","The strong growth in Energy Resources cash flow reflects the impact of new contracted renewable projects coming into service. ","As I mentioned earlier Energy Resources had one of our best ever periods of origination activity for new contracted renewable in 2014. On the last quarterly call we discussed a number of strong prospects that the team was pursuing and I am pleased to report that since that time we have added roughly 500 megawatts to our backlog of wind and solar projects. All of these new projects have characteristics that we expect will make them attractive candidates to be made available to NEP over the course of time. ","We are now well ahead of the expectations that we share with you at on March 2013 investor conference with positive implications for earnings and cash flow growth in 2017 and beyond. Contingent upon IRF guidance, we believe that the extension of the wind PTC along with our development activities and efforts to Safe Harbor equipment should be supportive to our U.S. program through 2016. The accompanying chart shows our current estimates of megawatts that can be delivered and their respective period. Over the last two years, we\u2019ve brought into service approximately 2,285 megawatts of new renewable. And in addition, we have signed contract for another roughly 2,115 megawatts which we expect to bring into service by the end of 2016. If our development program goes as expected, we believe energy resources and NEPs combined renewable portfolios will reach at least 14,200 megawatts by the end of 2016 and likely will be significantly higher.","We will provide a more detailed update on our origination and development activities at our March investor conference.","Let me now review the highlights for NEP, as you know the launch of NEP came at the end of the second quarter consequently a discussion of full year results is not meaningful and we will instead simply focus on the fourth quarter. As a reminder NEP consolidates 100% of the assets and operations of NEE operating LP in which both NextEra Energy and NEP LP unit holders hold an ownership interest.","Accordingly the financial values for NEP that we discussed in these prepared remarks or in the attached slides are presented on a 100% basis. At present NextEra Energy owns approximately 80% of the economic interest and NEP LP unit holders own approximately 20%. NEPs initial portfolio delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and CAFD of 54 million and 32 million respectively.","The assets operated well, wind and solar resource were normal and financial results were generally aligned with our expectations. During the quarter, NEP also made its initial distribution payment to unit holders.","Earlier this month, NEP completed the acquisition of Palo Duro the first of two previously announced agreements to expand its portfolio through project acquisitions for NextEra Energy Resources. Palo Duro is an approximately 250 megawatt wind project in Texas. It ended service in December 2014 and sell 100% of its output under a 20 year PPA. NEP paid approximately $228 million in cash consideration excluding post-closing, working capital and other adjustments and assumed a differential membership liability of approximately $248 million.","NEP continues to expect a first quarter 2015 closing of its agreement to acquire Shafter, a 20 megawatt contracted solar project currently under construction in California for an estimated cash consideration of 64 million. As discussed on the third quarter call, these acquisitions are being funded by cash on hand including the 150 million of primary proceeds retained from the IPO and a draw on NEPs existing revolving credit facility. We expect to issue equity in order to support longer-term financing needs at some point in 2015.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy; for the fourth quarter of 2014, GAAP net income attributable both to NextEra Energy was 884 million or $2 per share. NextEra Energy\u2019s 2014 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $458 million and $1.03 respectively. For the full year 2014, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.5 billion or 5.60 per share, adjusted earnings were roughly $2.3 billion or 5.30 per share.","For the quarter corporate and other segment was flat relative to 2013 on an adjusted EPS basis, for the full year the corporate and other segment was down $0.02 per share on an adjusted basis from 2013.","On the development front, 2014 was a successful year for our pipeline projects, the development of both Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast connection continue to progress well through their respective processes and both projects submitted the necessary filings with FERC in 2014 and are on track to receive FERC approval in 2015 in support of a mid-2017 commercial operations date as scheduled.","The Mountain Valley Pipeline joint venture with EQT Corporation continues to progress through the permitting process with the FERC application targeted for the fourth quarter of 2015. The project has secured approximately 2 bcf per day, a 20-year firm capacity commitments with an expected capital opportunity for NextEra of 1.0 billion to 1.3 billion. The project is expected to be operational by year-end 2018.","NextEra Energy\u2019s operating cash flow growth outpaced EPS growth year-over-year and our overall credit metrics improved and are in line with our expectations and consistent with our ratings. In the appendix of today\u2019s presentation we have provided actual performance for 2013 and 2014 as well as our projections for 2015. Additionally you will see the corresponding ranges for the rating agencies indicate for those metrics at our ratings.","Approximately 15 billion of financing transactions were executed in 2014 by our treasury team to support the growth of our business. As usual we employed conventional debt issuances and continued to make use of project level debt and tax equity partnerships at energy resources.","Consistent with our well established strategy of recycling capital, proceeds generated through the inter relationships between NextEra Energy and NEP introduced another source of capital integrated into NextEra\u2019s ongoing financing program.","In light of the progress made against our execution objectives, we continue to be comfortable with the 2015 adjusted EPS expectations we shared with you last quarter 5.40 to 5.70 per share. For 2016, we are updating our expectations to a range of 5.75 to 6.25 and we expect to be able to provide more insight into the drivers of earnings and cash flows for 2016 and beyond at our Investor Conference in March. As always our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.","Turning now to NEP; our expectations taking into account all the asset acquisitions we are now contemplating are unchanged since the last call. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect the NEP portfolio to grow to generate adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $440 million and CAFD of $100 million to $120 million, this would support the distribution level at an annualized rate of approximately $1.13, which corresponds to the upper tier of the IDR splits by the end of 2015 or possibly slightly earlier.","After 2015, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations for at least the next five years. ","Assuming current trading levels, this implies 2016 adjusted EBITDA of 580 million to 620 million and 2016 CAFD of 170 million to 190 million. That concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers ","Thanks for the update. I guess question number one, Jim has been pointing to the idea that your 2016 would be a disappointment if it wasn't at $6. What do you guys, when you saw the guidance increase today, can you just talk about what you saw to give you confidence to move that number higher?","Moray Dewhurst","First of all we\u2019ve had really since the investor conference the prior range of $5.50 to $6 so that was based on the initiatives that we laid out for you at time since then we have enable to push forward and execute successfully on I would say the vast majority of those initiatives and we indicated as we went longer way that we were feeling better about where we might be within that range. Separately, Jim very clearly articulated charge to the organization the challenge to the organization being at the $6 range hence the comment about being disappointed that we didn\u2019t get that. And then in the third quarter we simply indicated that we would try and update now once we got pass the Florida election and had a chance to roll the numbers up again.","So all that is preamble to say that based on the success we\u2019ve had since laying out those capital initiatives in March of 2013, we now think that centering the range around that $6 mark is very consistent with our normal method that\u2019s coming up with our expectation. So always we\u2019re telling you what it is we see today we could be literally anywhere within that band but we think that band is appropriate given all the factors that we can see today.","Dan Eggers ","Okay. And I guess, Moray, just on the wind additions and the warehousing of additional equipment to qualify for the PTC, can you just walk through what you guys are doing to key that up and then how we should think about the ability to sustain beyond what is contracted additional wind growth for 2015 and 2016?","Jim Robo ","I\u2019ll ask Armando to comment on the specifics on the development side but just the general context I\u2019d say on the number of occasions that would see extension which congress now passed, we felt comfortable that that would provide us good opportunities for projects that through the end of 2016 and also said that if they were no further extension of the PTC we might well see a drop off in new development for a while but we would expect even without PTC extension to see development pick up again later in the decade is the influence of improving economics and EPA\u2019s Clean power plant come into play so just with that is general context Armando you want to comment on what we\u2019re doing in specific development activities to make sure that we can get them in by the end of \u201816.","Armando Pimentel","Right. So couple of things, first, we\u2019re on I know we gave you these numbers on a quarterly basis but we\u2019re on what I would consider a pretty decent role with our development activities in the renewable side so over the last couple of years we\u2019ve signed long-term power purchase agreements for wind and solar that are just above 2900 megawatts of that 2900 Morey pointed out in the slides this morning that some of those will build in 2014 but we still at 2115 I believe the number is in megawatts, for contracts that we have in hand that will go COD in 2015 and 2016. That number does not include any potential for wind projects in 2016. We believe that the IRS is going to provide some more guidance on this PTC as they did last time. We hope that will be provided before the Investor Conference in March and at that time we will share with you what our expectations on the wind side, but it clearly would be a giant disappointment if we have zero megawatts in 2016. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. ","On the solar front, really over the last 12 months to 18 months we have done very well in that market. I think it\u2019s still way too early to talk about what\u2019s going to happen with tax credits for solar beyond 2016. And as such we probably have just a couple of more orders here where we and others will be able to signed folks up for long-term agreements on the solar side, but we have got several very promising opportunities on the solar side that I hope will paying out. ","To give you an indication though of what we have been doing 2014 was also our highest ever year in terms of bringing renewal energy megawatts COD. In 2014 we brought 1630 megawatts of COD. So we clearly have the capabilities to do that, and I hope we would do that. I am certainly not committing to that but we will have more information for you in March. ","Dan Eggers ","That's great. And just to clarify one thing, that 980 MW of wind that you have on slide 11, that would be all for 2015 delivery because you do not have clarity on the 2016 from the IRS yet, is that correct? ","Armando Pimentel","Yes. ","Operator","Now we will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","So I wanted to follow up on the solar announcement in Florida and just explore that a little bit further. First, can you expand a little bit on the regulatory process involved? Obviously you have kind of alluded to it and tried it a little bit in the past, but what mechanisms precisely you are looking for, what kind of recovery you are looking for? And then subsequently just in terms of the timing, can you talk about the ability to scale this up, or what total size do you see ultimately in Florida? I know you delineated at least the first batch here, but is there an ability to scale this up similarly as you described gas before in the state? ","Moray Dewhurst ","True. On the first part, the regulatory needs to be recovered through base rates. So we have been working hard to make sure that we can deliver customer value by which I mean make the addition positive to our total system economics in the current environment. I am not surprising that has been working very hard on getting the initial cost down because that\u2019s where so much of the economics part. And so we have now reached that point so since these projects have positive economics for customer we believe it\u2019s appropriate to go forward and in due course we will recover them through basic rates. ","On the second part of the question, there is some special characteristics of these projects that make them particularly attractive right now and we can\u2019t quite yet see general scaling that up to much larger size, we are going to need some further improvements in the economics these are also assisted by the fact that we are going to benefit from the existing 30% ITC. So there is a question always about future projects from that perspective. So the answer to your second part of your question is, yes, we think there is huge potential longer-term, but we think what we need to get a little bit further still on the economics before we can go much beyond three projects that we are talking about here. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Great. Excellent. And then coming to Hawaii, could you give us a little bit of an update on where you stand? Just as I imagine you have had conversations with folks in the state, I mean how do you feel about being able to execute that both from a timeline perspective and also just in terms of anything you might have to provide to get it all executed?","Moray Dewhurst ","Sure, Jim will have a couple of words. ","Jim Robo ","Julien, obviously its early days. The teams are working on the SEC filings as well as the Hawaii PUC filing for regulatory approval, and things are moving a pace. And as I said its early days and I remain optimistic that we are going to be able to finalize things within a 12 months period here by the end of the year. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Great. And just a last detail, any updates on the rate base effort in Florida? Obviously you've got the first gas approval here, but just any issues or any changes in the program as you look towards getting the rest done?","Moray Dewhurst ","Really no change. Obviously pleased that they approved this specific project they will take up a question of the guidelines in March.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon","If we look at the midpoint of your 2016 guidance, are you just kind of using the forward gas curves as they currently sit? ","Moray Dewhurst","Yes, all our expectations are always based on current forward curves both for commodities and for interest rates. And every time as part of our preparation for these quarterly calls we go through an update to that outlook we update all the major driving assumptions in which the commodity curves are won. So yes they recognize those curves bouncing around literally every day.","Paul Ridzon","Right. On play, you have a $0.50 range, I guess?","Moray Dewhurst","We\u2019ll that\u2019s one of the big factors, that causes the need for the range certainly.","Paul Ridzon","And Moray, over the past couple of years, you have kind of expanded your reach across the energy platform be it pipeline, gas reserves. Are there anything else on the back burner we need to look at as far as potential opportunities? ","Moray Dewhurst","I mean certainly we\u2019re always looking to see whether there are logical extensions that flow from the current scale set and current opportunity set. But I think we have articulated to you and to others pretty clearly the ones that we\u2019re active in at the moment, so obviously core is the power that we have extensive knowledge of the gas business build that over time, very capable at doing all kinds of large scale development in construction and infrastructure type projects, transmission development and definitely a focus. The other one that I probably should remind everybody is that we have a small effort going in storage in a variety of different aspects from sort of early stage, following early stage R&D, early stage production companies to actual projects have completed or have in process. So that\u2019s kind of the suite of opportunities at the moment.","Paul Ridzon","You\u2019re talking electricity storage?","Moray Dewhurst","Correct.","Operator","Now we\u2019ll go to next Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","A couple of quick questions. First, if you look at this year, I think you came in around $5.30, and if you added back the $0.15 of one timers of the NEP restructuring, you are almost kind of in your range for 2015 just doing that. Just to kind of round out 2015, is there anything that particularly hits this year -- kind of limits the uptick?","Moray Dewhurst","No I would say it\u2019s the other way around, so let me just talk a little bit about \u201814. Why were we able to exceed our original expectations even while absorbing $0.15 of incremental and unanticipated at the time charges? There are a number of reasons, most of them frankly having to do with the energy resources portfolio, most parts of which ended up doing a little better than we originally expected. First we had just plain weather solar resource was better than long-term averages that was probably about $0.08 worth of goodness from that. Interest rates stayed lower than we - because of the implied responsible earlier we locked them to curve but that curve didn\u2019t manifest itself over the years was probably corporate wide probably about $0.04 of goodness from there.","And then the other big one was really performance in the northeast, so the NEPOOL portfolio was on the order of $0.10 or so better than we expected even more than compensating for the shortfall that we had in the customer supply business in the first quarter in the northeast and that business in turn made up that big short fall over the rest of the course of the year. So you add up all those different things and there was probably somewhere around the order of $0.24 to $0.30 of unanticipated goodness now to be fair there was also some unanticipated badness on smaller factors. But that was kind of the difference, so again when we do the expectations we just go back to sort of base line normal expectations where the commodity curves are right now.","So it\u2019s much more and that\u2019s how \u201915, son it\u2019s much more matter of fact that we got $0.20 in the sense of unanticipated goodness in \u201914 that we can\u2019t automatically expect will carry over into \u201915. We hope it will but we can\u2019t count on it.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And just on 2016 guidance in terms of the renewable backlog, should we assume what you lay out here that is already contracted gets you maybe to the midpoint, and if you are able to do more, that's how you get toward the higher end? ","Moray Dewhurst","No absolutely not, we\u2019ve covered this actually on a number of occasions. The stuff that we\u2019re doing now in new development is not going to have a significant impact until we reach \u201817 \u201818, in fact for the last year pretty the development effort is generating projects but that\u2019s really going to help us in \u201817 \u201818 and beyond. So there maybe some slight timing impacts on \u201816 that\u2019s not really going to be a big driver of where we are in the \u201816 range.","Steven Fleishman","Okay, great. And then finally -- ","Unidentified Company Representative ","Just remember that historically when we build wind we get virtually all of the COD very, very late in the year. So when you\u2019re building we don\u2019t have anything new for \u201816 wind but we certainly hope to build some and I\u2019d love to be able to build them in January, February, March but traditionally we put those in very, very late in the year, so there is just very little EBITDA that goes into the year. And on the solar front we\u2019re getting to the point really at this point where it\u2019s going to be very difficult to sign contracts over the next couple of months and expect that you\u2019ll be have a COD at anything other than very, very late in 2016. So that\u2019s why we just go back and look at history when we go in COD it\u2019s very late in the year and really affects the future year\u2019s earnings.","Steven Fleishman","Great. One last question. Just I think in the beginning of your remarks, you kind of reiterated the 5% to 7% I guess through 2018. But it does seem like your 2016 kind of got you effectively high-end or above that range. So just can you just maybe context the 2016 guidance with the 5% to 7%? ","Moray Dewhurst ","\u201816, the percent of that range 6% is squarely within the 5% to 7% back from 2012. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. ","Michael Lapides","Congrats on a good 2014. I wanted to ask a P&L question. The commentary about staying above the midpoint or towards the higher end of the range in 2016, meeting the authorized ROE band, can you talk a little bit about what headwinds, if any, exist at FPL? You're highlighting really strong expected but weather normalized demand growth, and you have a lot of the regulatory amorts kind of in your back pocket to use over the next few years. Just trying to think about things that could offset those.","Moray Dewhurst ","There is nothing in particular but recognize when we started out with the rate agreement, the beginning of the rate agreement looking forward in general you\u2019re going to need to utilize little more surplus depreciation in the out years to maintain a given level of profitability just given the fundamental growth in the regulatory capital deployed. So there is nothing special we just again doing the same thing we\u2019re taking a best view of the range of possibilities for 2016 revenue including where the variability against that expectations for 2016 cost, CapEx et cetera and the amount of surplus depreciation remaining. And all of those give us comfort that in \u201816 we can be at least above the mid-point of the formal range that somewhere between 10.5 and 11.5. ","Michael Lapides","Got it. And I know we will see this in the K and probably at the analyst day, but any insight you can give us on 2015 and 2016 CapEx expectations at just FP&L?","Moray Dewhurst ","Again I differ on that one because I don\u2019t the specific data in front of me. The K will be out pretty soon.","Jim Robo ","Michael this is Jim the other thing I would say is that we\u2019re going to layout in good detail our capital plans at FPL in the March Investor Conference on both sides of the business.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon ","Armando, I just want to make sure I heard correctly that practically speaking when I look at slide 11 and I look at the backlog for wind in the United States, you said that that doesn't have anything in 2016, so that 980 MW is really just all delivery in 2015. Is that right? ","Armando Pimentel","Yes, that\u2019s correct and let me just clarify the point, that is correct right, and all of those 980 megawatts that you see on there we have committed to with the customer to bring those in before the end of 2015, if for some reason the customer comes back to us and said okay, now that we feel comfortable about 2015 and just slip into \u201816 we\u2019ll obviously do that but what I really meant to say is we have signed no contracts right now none of the numbers that you see on here are based on a contract that we signed for 2016 COD.","Greg Gordon ","That looks really good because your backlog went up from like 1860 MW to 2254 MW since the third quarter, and you still have good option on 2016 if you get the extension.","Armando Pimentel","Yes.","Greg Gordon ","Is based on looking at those slides in the last quarter to today?","Moray Dewhurst ","Yes, absolutely it has been a great period.","Greg Gordon ","Shifting to another question, it has become a smaller and smaller piece of variability in your business, but the Texas market has obviously been under some duress in terms of gas prices coming down but also heat rates contracting in the wake of new supply additions and concern over the economy in Texas with oil prices having come down as much as they have. I know your guidance on 2015 EBITDA and cash flow has moderated a bit. Can you talk about market conditions there and maybe what you have done to hedge out that risk? ","Moray Dewhurst ","Amanda may want to comment as well, but I would say that in general on the commodity front oil, gas and power nothing much great has happened recently and that definitely includes Texas. In the short-term because we do hedge expensively is a relatively modest impact, but I would certainly tell that my personal view of the Texas market is less bullish than it was. Amanda?","Amanda Finnis ","I will add just a couple of more to that. When I look at our Texas assets it\u2019s divided into three sets of assets. You have got Lumber Yard in Forney that 2800 megawatts combined cycle. You have got roughly 1800 megawatts of what we hedged wind and you have us much smaller 400 megawatts or 500 megawatts or so of contracted wind in Texas. The hedged wind really the first time that any significant hedges on the hedge wind start rolling off as 2017 and that\u2019s not very significant portion, you have got hedges after 2020 to start rolling off. So I don\u2019t worry in the near-term that much about the due to hedged portfolio, hedged wind portfolio or contracted wind portfolio. ","As Moray mentioned on the combined cycle gas assets, we have leveraged those assets last year and part of what we did was we went out and hedged a good part of the margin for about 2.5 years and we have been legging into additional hedges when we can. That\u2019s a market that does not have a lot of liquidity really past 2016 and even in 2016 it\u2019s not like you can just hit the bid that you see on the screen. So it\u2019s not something I am concerned about at all in the near-term but longer-term economics as Moray said on the market. I am certainly not as bullish as I was couple of years ago. ","Operator","And we will go next to Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein. ","Hugh Wynne","Moray, you had emphasized in your presentation today the improvement in cash flow from operations and EBITDA, which was stronger even than the growth in earnings. Was wondering if you could drill down into that a little bit and just give us a feel for the primary drivers there and what were the differences with the growth in earnings? ","Moray Dewhurst ","Sure, the Energy Resources level, I think the main observation to make is simply that the strong contributions to cash flow coming from these contracted renewable projects gets a little bit particularly in the early years by some other factors. So, I described two things, first of all simply in 2014 we had a number of non-cash items that affect earnings of which the largest and simply the impact in some of the NEP merge cost which obviously we would not picks back to continue. So that\u2019s one source of difference between the picture that you will get if you look at earnings growth and the picture you get if you look at cash growth. But there is the more fundamental one is that by the nature of these contracted renewable projects you have virtually all of your investment upfront. And so in a sense the faster you grow that business the greater the disparity between your earnings profile, the impact that has on your earnings profile and your underlying cash flow profile. So the growth in the cash flow is coming from the project is kind of must in the early years by the fact that they not has accretive in the early years as they will be in subsequent years. ","So there is just a, it\u2019s almost like an arithmetical, mathematical thing goes on. So we simply wanted to highlight the fact that the cash flow growth of Energy Resources is very strong and just a flag for people that you probably want to look most that its contribution to earnings and its contribution to cash flow. ","Hugh Wynne","Okay. And if I could, just a quick follow-up on the solar initiative at FPL. If I remember correctly, those were three 75 MW projects, and you are estimating a cost of $400 million to $420 million? Is that correct? ","Moray Dewhurst","Correct. ","Hugh Wynne","And then you are saying that the economics would need to improve for the growth in utility scale and solar to continue? Can you amplify on that at all what you think would be sort of an economic cost per watt for utility scale solar? ","Jim Robo ","Well, recognize that those projects are advantaged by couple of things. First of all eligibility for the 30% ITC and secondly I will call it good fighting condition. So development work has been done, access to transmission et cetera. So if you just look at the generic, supposing I wanted to add 200 plus megawatts of solar somewhere in Florida. You got to start from a clean-slate, find a new site, get transmission access all of those things, look at the full cost of the project. That would not be economic today at the 10% ITC level, so answer to the direct question of how much more do cost have to come down, I would have to look more closely at the economics I\u2019m going a little bit off memory, but yes I would think somewhere in the order of 10% to 15%. And we certainly think that that\u2019s likely to occur over the next few years, so again we\u2019re very optimistic about doing more later in the decade.","Jim Robo ","Hugh this is Jim. The only other thing I\u2019d say is we\u2019re very pleased within this historically low price commodity environment that we have some utility scale solar projects in Florida that are cost effective for customers. And so that 10% or 15% improvement going forward to offset the loss of the ITC and some of the special advantages that these projects have, one of the ways to do that is to have commodity prices come up a little bit, right. And we\u2019re seeing this throughout the country now that solar is becoming increasingly cost effective -- utility scale solar is becoming increasingly cost effective compared to avoided cost at utilities around the country and I think that\u2019s a very-very positive thing for our customers here in Florida and also for Armando's renewable business across the rest of the country.","Moray Dewhurst ","And just as a reminder to everyone really, the challenge of making solar work here in Florida is actually quite a bit more than it might appear because of a low cost structure and hence low rate structure which is effectively what we\u2019re competing against.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question today from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski","So first on the growth in your wind power installations, we have heard from other wind developers in the US who seem pretty confident that the projects that will start operations before the end of 2017 will still qualify for the PTC given the extension through the end of 2014. You seem to believe it is only until 2016. So where is the difference? Are you simply conservative in your assumptions or do you think that it is really still unclear given the lack of the IRS interpretation? ","Moray Dewhurst ","Angie assuming that the IRS provides similar guidance to what they did last year on in construction. We think that, that will mean, these are my words Safe Harbor or projects that would get COD before January 01 of 2017. There is always been the question out there that because the IRS or Congress that the IRS is just interpreting, did not provide a what I will call a drop dead bed on COD that if you have continuous construction activities through the period of COD that you could qualify for the production tax credit beyond again what I call my Safe Harbor day. So I some folks are saying look, we can build at some point in 2017 because we believe it will have, we will meet continuing guidance and the IRS has provided some examples of what those activities are, that is I think that\u2019s certainly doable, that\u2019s certainly a more aggressive interpretation than we would take. Now we may have some projects just because of their circumstances that we would feel comfortable building in 2017 to build -- I am sorry to meet that IRS guidance. But I can tell you we will try to minimize those projects because we think they carry more of a risk than those projects to get done by the end of 2016. ","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And then separately on NEP, so I just wanted to clarify one thing. So if you are talking about 12% to 15% growth in distributions per share, you are assuming that you will be able to issue equity for each of the forward years assuming that the yield at the time of the issuance will be close to the 2.8%, 2.9% that we are currently observing using the projections of the distributed cash per share? Is that correct? ","Jim Robo ","Yes, they doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be exactly that, but that\u2019s why we included the comment about the assuming roughly current trading levels. Yes. ","Operator","And at this time, that does conclude today\u2019s presentation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Julie Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Julie Holmes","Thank you, Anne. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, NextEra Energy's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power and Light. Moray will provide an overview of our results, following which, our executive team will be available to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. These statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factor section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com.

You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid financial results in 2012, and both principal businesses executed on the objectives we set for ourselves and shared with you in 2011.","The progress we made across both major businesses this past year reinforces our growth prospects through the middle of the decade. We also began to devote significant effort to projects that will drive our growth in the second half of the decade.","Throughout the year, we indicated that we were focused on execution, and I'm pleased to note that we met all our principal execution objectives. At FPL, we continued to deliver the best customer value in the state, our major capital projects all progressed well and we successfully resolved our base rate case. At Energy Resources, we completed our record backlog of U.S. wind projects and met our milestones for the development of our Canadian wind portfolio and our solar portfolio. We also had good execution in our day-to-day operations with a strong finish to the year. And finally, construction of our Lone Star Transmission line continued, and we remain on track for the start of operations later this quarter. All in all, it was a very strong year that positions us well for the future.","Before discussing the financial results, I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight what we accomplished in 2012.","At FPL, our strategy is founded upon offering the best customer value in the state and on finding ways to improve our value delivery over time. 2012 was an excellent year in this respect. We maintained our position as a service provider offering the lowest typical residential bills among all 55 utilities in Florida and a bill that is 26% below the national average. We had our best year ever in terms of overall transmission and distribution reliability. And for the ninth year in a row, FPL received the prestigious ServiceOne award for outstanding customer service.","FPL also improved its national ranking in the ongoing J.D. Power & Associates Residential Customer Satisfaction Survey and retained its top ranking in Florida.","In terms of reliability, we continued to rank in the top quartile nationally, and our 5-year average for the System Average Interruption Duration Index or SAIDI was the lowest among all Florida investor-owned utilities for the period 2007 to 2011. Looking forward, we believe we can improve our performance further.","In 2012, we continued to improve the electric grid through our Energy Smart Florida program, including the installation of another 1.5 million smart meters throughout the state, bringing the cumulative total today to approximately 4.3 million. The project is now 96% complete and will serve as the platform for future reliability and customer service enhancements.","Through realtime access to data at the meter, FPL can now better detect and prevent outages and restore service faster when outages do occur. Data is also available to customers through an energy dashboard available online and via mobile device, which is designed to help them monitor energy consumption and make more informed decisions about their usage.","Making our service the most affordable in the state depends fundamentally on our cost position. For many years, we have been a top decile performer in terms of non-fuel O&M, and we estimate, based on benchmarking data, that every year, our customers save roughly $1.6 billion as a consequence of our low-cost position compared with typical utility performance. That translates to an annual savings for a typical residential customer of about $200.","While we have been very successful over the last several years in keeping the real escalation rate of O&M down, we have seen some upward pressure on nominal O&M per kilowatt hour, as shown in the upper right chart. With the 4-year horizon of the new rate agreement in place, we will, of course, be very focused on finding ways to improve the cost trend. Consistent with our strategy, we will be searching, not only for additional ways to improve productivity, but also possibilities for deploying capital that lead to cost savings that will benefit our customers and help keep rates low for the long term.","Our focus on cost includes more than just O&M, of course, and for the past several years, we have been making major strides in improving the overall efficiency of our generation fleet. In 2012, FPL's fossil fuel fleet reached a record level of efficiency, bringing our systemwide heat rate down to 7,669 British thermal units per kilowatt hour or roughly 24% better than the industry average of 10,040 BTUs per kilowatt hour for 2011, the most recent year for which data is available.","Since 2001, FPL's heat rate has improved by 20%. And in 2012 alone, that translated into customer savings of more than $400 million in fuel costs, as we generate more power while using less fossil fuel.","In 2012, we invested more than $4 billion at FPL, with more than $830 million of this associated with our 3 modernizations. Our Cape Canaveral project is now 96% complete and is currently on schedule and under our original budget, with an expected in-service date of June 2013. The Riviera Beach modernization is 35% complete and is running on time and on budget, with an expected in-service date of June 2014. We continue to expect to bring the modernized Port Everglades plant into service in June 2016, with demolition of the existing plant currently planned for the second quarter of this year. Together, the 3 modernized plants provide significant customer benefits of more than $1 billion over their operational lifetimes.","Turning to our nuclear portfolio. We have now completed 3 of our 4 plant extended power upgrades, investing roughly $3 billion to date and adding approximately 395 megawatts of clean, emissions-free energy to our fleet. The final uprate at Turkey Point Unit 4 is expected to come online in spring 2013 and add roughly 120 megawatts of capacity.","Our third major execution imperative for 2012 at FPL was to achieve a satisfactory outcome of our base rate case. Following lengthy negotiations between FPL and key intervener groups and an extensive evidentiary process on the resulting settlement, in December, the commission approved a modified version of our proposed base rate settlement agreement that we believe is fair and reasonable for both customers and shareholders. The agreement is effective through December 2016 and provides for a retail base revenue increase of $350 million and an allowed regulatory ROE at 10.5% with 100 basis point band. The agreement also includes the ability to amortize over the 4 year term up to a combined $400 million of the remaining surplus depreciation credit and a portion of the fossil dismantlement reserve.","An important aspect of the agreement provides the base rate increases to recover the capital and operating costs of the modernizations at Cape Canaveral, Riviera Beach and Port Everglades once these plants enter service. This generation base rate adjustment or GBRA mechanism provides an appreciable amount of certainty to both customers and shareholders and removes the expense and risk associated with multiple regulatory proceedings and regulatory lag.","Overall, the agreement is designed to help FPL continue to provide customers with exceptional reliability, award-winning customer service and the lowest electric bills in the state for at least 4 more years.","On January 2, the retail base rate increase went into effect, and yet bills for the typical FPL residential customer decreased $0.37 per month. This is primarily due to a reduction in the customer fuel charge, which is a function, not only of lower fuel prices, but also of our efforts to reduce fuel consumption through improved efficiencies.","The Office of Public Counsel opposed the settlement even with the revisions suggested by the PSC and may appeal their decision. However, we believe the PSC's decision was well reasoned and that the Commission was well within its proper authority to consider and vote to approve the agreement.","Turning now to Energy Resources. As we told you last year, we expected headwinds from above market, hedge roll-offs and PTC roll-offs to negatively impact 2012 results. Yet in spite of these challenges, we grew our adjusted earnings over the prior year and laid the groundwork for more pronounced growth in the years to come.","We set an aggressive goal for additions to our U.S. wind portfolio in 2012, and through the diligence and hard work of the entire wind team, we exceeded it. We commissioned roughly 1,500 megawatts of wind in the U.S., something no other company has ever achieved. In the fourth quarter alone, we brought online 1,263 megawatts of wind projects.","We celebrated the commissioning of Energy Resources' 10,000th megawatt of wind in December, a fleet size which is comparable to the generation capacity at a top 15 utility.","We are on track to add approximately 600 megawatts of new Canadian wind by the end of 2015. The majority of which will come into service in 2014, with a total capital commitment of roughly $1.8 billion. And we continue to expect to add nearly 900 megawatts of contracted solar capacity primarily in the U.S. between now and the end of 2016.","As we look ahead to the balance of this year and next for Energy Resources, we are evaluating the growth prospects for our wind business following the extension of the production tax credit. While we must now wait for the exact rules that will define \"start of construction,\" the shift from the prior in-service by the end of the year requirement is clearly positive.","As we have previously indicated, 2013 will be a down year for new wind compared to 2012 as it will take time for the wind supply chain to gear up, but we are optimistic that we can complete some additional megawatts, and we look forward to a stronger 2014 for new installations. We will continue to work with other supporters on a longer-term approach to the policy framework guiding new renewables development.","Before leaving the highlights for Energy Resources, I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 8, which highlights the shifting mix in the earnings profile of the business. Our focus in recent years has been on expansion of our investment in assets with long-term contracts, and more than 80% of our growth capital in the last 5 years has been allocated to these investments. In addition, we have refocused our portfolio in response to changing market conditions, reducing our merchant and short-term contracted assets. The result is a very substantial shift in mix.","In 2014, we expect 65% of Energy Resources adjusted EBITDA to come from long-term contracted assets, up from 49% in 2009. Over the same time period, the contribution from the merchant segment is expected to decline from 40% to 20%, while the contribution from all our other businesses, which includes all our customer supply and training activities, as well as our gas infrastructure operations, is expected to remain roughly flat as a proportion of the total at about 10% to 15%.","Let me now walk through our results for the quarter and the full year. We will begin with results at FPL, and then discuss Energy Resources in the consolidated numbers.","For the fourth quarter of 2012, FPL reported net income of $256 million or $0.61 per share, up $0.10 per share year-over-year. For the full year, FPL reported net income of $1.2 billion or $2.96 per share, up $0.41 per share versus 2011.","Throughout 2012, we continued to invest heavily in infrastructure projects to improve overall customer value. As I noted earlier, FPL's capital expenditures exceeded $4 billion, the highest level of annual investment ever. As a direct result, our regulatory capital employed grew 16.4% year-over-year, and this translated to net income growth of 16.1%.","During the quarter, we amortized $117 million of surplus depreciation, enabling us to maintain a regulatory return on equity of 11%. For the full year, we amortized $480 million. As a result, at the end of 2012, there remained $224 million of the original $895 million, and we will be able to amortize this over the 4-year term of our base rate settlement agreement. In addition, we will be able to use a maximum of $176 million of the fossil dismantlement reserve during the settlement period.","As you may recall, under the terms of the 2010 settlement, the ability to amortize surplus depreciation was central to our ability to maintain our regulatory ROE at the top of the range over the term of the agreement. As we begin operating under the current settlement agreement, the situation is a bit different. In order to earn above the midpoint under the settlement agreement, we will have to work hard to find ways to improve productivity and efficiency. As we've demonstrated in the past, we are committed to doing this.","Despite some bumps along the way, we saw continued progress in Florida's economic recovery over the year. Florida's seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate in December was down slightly versus the prior month and was 1.9 percentage points lower than December 2011. The gap between the Florida and U.S. unemployment rates has narrowed significantly since this time last year, from 1.4% in December 2011 to 0.2% in December 2012, with Florida adding roughly 55,000 jobs since December 2011.","We also continued to see the housing market in Florida recover some ground lost during the recession. Mortgage delinquency rates have declined substantially from their recession peak, although they remain high by historical standards. And the inventory of existing homes continues to decline.","The number of building permits in Florida continued to increase throughout the year and is well above the prior year's level. The Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 8.5% from the prior year, the largest increase since September 2006.","All in all, the Florida economy is clearly recovering, though it is not yet as strong as we would all hope for.","As we discussed throughout the year, we are seeing most of our customer metrics at FPL gradually improve. Underlying usage per customer decreased 0.5% compared to the same quarter last year. But as we have indicated on previous earnings calls, this metric can be somewhat volatile on a quarterly basis, so we do not attach too much significance to this quarter's slight decline. For the full year, underlying usage per customer grew 1.2% compared to 2011.","During the quarter, the percentage of low usage customers declined to the lowest level in 4 years. The number of inactive accounts also continued to decline.","In December, new service accounts increased year-over-year, and we saw the highest levels of growth since early 2007 in our industrial accounts, which in our service territory are primarily tied to the construction industry. We view this as a strong indication that the rebound in new construction is gaining traction that will lead to further increases in new service accounts in future quarters.","During the fourth quarter, we also saw the largest increase of customer since early 2008, with approximately 34,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2011, representing an increase of 0.8%.","Overall, we are seeing moderate improvement in our customer data and continue to believe that Florida will experience above-average growth over the long term.","As customer demand grows and fleets across the state shift to more natural gas-fired generation, Florida's natural gas needs will increase significantly. We recognize that this means that there will be a corresponding increase in the need for more natural gas infrastructure to support the increased consumption. Since the current infrastructure does not provide the necessary redundancy and reliability to support growing natural gas requirements, in December, we issued an RFP for a third major natural gas pipeline to serve Florida. The RFP requests 400,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas capacity for Florida beginning in 2017 and an additional 200,000 MMBtu per day beginning in May 2020.","The pipeline will consist of 2 segments. The first or upstream portion will run from Western Alabama to a new hub in Central Florida that will interconnect with all major existing Florida pipelines. This portion will access the abundant onshore natural gas resources, helping reduce reliance on offshore resources, which can be disrupted by tropical weather. The second or downstream segment will run from the Central Florida hub to connect with FPL's Martin County plant.","Total capital expenditures have not yet been determined, and the specific routes will be selected and proposed by companies submitting bids. As part of the process, NextEra Energy expects to offer a self-build option for the downstream portion of the project and is prepared to consider investing in support of the selected upstream option to facilitate timely construction. We expect to begin evaluating proposals during the second quarter of this year, with construction expected to be completed in 2017.","Before moving on to our discussion of results at Energy Resources, I'd like to take a moment to review the 2012 hurricane season. Every year, FPL service territory is at risk of damage and severe service interruptions associated with tropical weather, and 2012 was no exception. We experienced the effects of 4 tropical systems this season, Beryl, Debbie, Isaac and Sandy. In each case, we restored power to more than 90% of affected customers within 24 hours. In addition, our crew spent significant time out of state assisting with power restoration in other parts of the country, including along the Eastern seaboard for those affected by Sandy. Roughly 1,000 of our employees and contractors supported the Sandy restoration effort for several weeks.","We are grateful for the support that others have given us over the years, and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this past year.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported fourth quarter 2012 GAAP earnings of $171 million or $0.41 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $175 million or $0.42 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the effect of the mark on non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI, and for 2011, the after-tax loss on the sale of the natural gas-fired generating assets.","For the full year 2012, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $687 million or $1.64 per share. Adjusted earnings were $693 million or $1.66 per share, up $0.04 from the prior year.","We are pleased to see this growth given the difficult environment in 2012. We expect to see more substantial growth in 2013 as some of the headwinds experienced in 2012 begin to subside and our new investments begin to contribute meaningfully to earnings.","Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter improved $0.12 from last year, primarily due to contributions from new investments of $0.06. Gas infrastructure contributed $0.04 from increased investment, and asset sales and restructuring contributed $0.03 over the same period last year. All other effects were minor.","As we've indicated in the past, we continually evaluate our assets and the value each contributes to our portfolio compared with the value the market assigns, and 2012 was no different. We had a few small transactions which contributed $0.03, as I just mentioned.","Late in the year, we announced a more significant transaction, the sale of our main hydro assets, which is expected to close later in the first quarter. These assets were financed in 2007, at which time, we recovered the capital invested in them, with the result of their book base was significantly reduced. We would, therefore, expect to record a significant GAAP gain in net income when the transaction closes. But the transaction is not expected to have a material impact on 2013 and ongoing adjusted earnings.","The sale of these assets is consistent with our focus on shifting the Energy Resources portfolio mix towards more contracted assets.","For the full year 2012, the $0.04 increase in adjusted EPS was driven by several factors. Contributions from our new investments increased $0.22, with $0.04 coming from an increase in CITCs. We elected CITCs for roughly 455 megawatts of wind projects in 2012 compared to approximately 275 megawatts in 2011. The contribution from our customer supply and trading businesses increased $0.11 over the prior year, as both businesses recovered from a difficult 2011. The absence of impairment charges that negatively affected 2011 results added $0.08 to our full year comparisons. And for the full year, gas infrastructure's contribution to adjusted EPS increased $0.06, primarily as a result of additional investment.","These positives were largely offset by lower contributions from existing investment in 2012. More than half is related to above market hedge roll-offs and PTC roll-offs that we first discussed with you back in the third quarter of 2011. We expect the impact from both of these factors to decrease in 2013 and 2014. Wind resource, well below the long term average, negatively affected the comparison to last year by $0.08.","And finally, reflected in the chart here is a negative comparison of $0.03 associated with the assets sold late in 2011. However, I should note that this presentation does not reflect the full impact of the asset sales, which also had an indirect effect through adjustment of our capital structure. Including the full impact, we estimate that the net effect of the asset sales is several cents accretive for 2012 and beyond.","Interest, G&A and all other items totaled a negative $0.12 impact, primarily reflecting continued growth in the business.","Looking forward, we expect to elect CITCs on roughly 300 megawatts of new solar generation in 2013. And as we did last year, we have included a summary in the appendix to the presentation that compares our realized equivalent EBITDA to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2011.","As I mentioned earlier, we achieved an important milestone at our company and across the industry by placing our 10,000th megawatt of wind into service during the fourth quarter of 2012. We also reached production levels of almost 26 million megawatt hours during 2012, the highest level in company history. Although for the year, the wind resource was below normal at 94%, our capacity factor was just slightly below what we reported in 2011 when wind resource was near the long term average.","We continued to use more modern, higher efficiency turbines on our new projects in order to improve our wind fleet's performance over time. In 2013 and 2014, we're expecting the average capacity factor to increase as we see the full year benefits from new 2012 wind turbines enhance fleet performance.","Over the roughly 26 million megawatt hours of production, approximately 61% were eligible for PTCs. The remainder represents our -- primarily from projects on which we elected CITCs or from projects that have passed their 10-year window of eligibility for PTCs.","Approximately 41% of the PTCs generated were allocated to investors under the differential membership interest or tax equity partnerships we have entered into that allow us to monetize the tax benefits from our renewables projects more efficiently. As shown on this slide, the percentage of PTCs allocated to investors grew in 2012, and we expect that proportion to continue to grow to between 45% and 50% in 2013 as we see the full year impact of our 2012 tax equity partnerships flow through.","Before I move to the consolidated results, let me note a couple of disclosure items. In our year end 2012 GAAP financial statements, we've made certain reclassifications of benefits and costs associated with differential membership interests which provide more transparency around the accounting for these transactions. You will see changes in the line items where these types of transactions flow through our financial statements in an updated presentation entitled Accounting for Differential Membership Interests. We will be happy to follow up with anyone who has questions after reviewing. Additionally, we recently began posting monthly updates to our Wind Resource Index. Both documents can be found in the Earnings & Supplements section of our Investor Relations website under Business Updates.","Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the fourth quarter of 2012, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $429 million or $1.02 per share. NextEra Energy's 2012 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $433 million and $1.03, respectively. For the full year 2012, the company's GAAP net income was $1.9 billion or $4.56 per share, adjusted earnings were approximately $1.9 billion or $4.57 per share.","As we noted last year, the corporate and other segment benefited from a gain in consolidated income tax adjustments in 2011, which we did not expect to recur. For the full year 2012, on an adjusted basis, the corporate and other segment was down $0.27 from 2011. Looking ahead, we expect annual contributions to earnings from this segment to improve slightly relative to 2012 as earnings from our Lone Star business increase, but are offset by residual interest and taxes. The Lone Star construction program in Texas is progressing as planned, and we continue to expect to bring the line into full service in the spring of 2013.","2012 marked NextEra Energy's biggest year of capital investment ever for both FPL and Energy Resources, far exceeding our internally generated cash flows. Including amounts needed to meet debt maturities, our treasury team executed on more than $7 billion worth of financing transactions across a wide range of capital sources. These were designed to meet our capital needs while also supporting our balance sheet and credit strength, which are central to our business strategies.","In addition to a variety of conventional debt issuances, we continued to make use of project debt to support growth at Energy Resources, and we also sold additional differential membership interests to efficiently utilize tax credits generated by new wind projects.","We also issued $1.25 billion of equity units to ensure we have the equity support needed during this transitional period of high capital expenditures. These will convert to straight common equity in 2015, at which time they will be integrated into our ongoing financing program.","We have previously indicated that we expected 2012 to be the peak year of strain on our balance sheet and we continued to expect a significant shift in our cash flow profile to commence this year. Depending on our success in finding additional investment opportunities and their associated capital needs, we expect our free cash flow deficit in 2013, net of dividend payments, to be on the order of $1 billion or so compared with approximately $6 billion in 2012. We continue to expect our 2014 operating cash flow position to improve further.","Based on our continuing shift towards a more regulated and contracted portfolio mix, we continue to believe a dividend payout ratio of 55% in 2014 makes sense, which implies an annual growth rate of approximately 10% over the next 2 years. Of course, all dividend decisions are the responsibility of the board.","In light of the results achieved year-to-date and the progress made against our execution objectives, we continue to be comfortable with the 2014 adjusted EPS expectations we shared with you last fall of $5.05 to $5.65 per share.","With FPL's rate case settlement case in place, we are now able to provide initial expectations for 2013. As we discussed last quarter, at Energy Resources, we expect 2013 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $740 million to $780 million. Together with FPL's contribution, we expect NextEra Energy adjusted earnings for the full year to be in the range of $4.70 to $5 per share. While the quarterly profile of our earnings will, of course, vary from year to year, looking back over the last decade, the first and fourth quarters have generally each accounted for 18% to 20% or so of the annual total, with the second and third together generally accounting for 55% to 60%. At this early point in the year, we do not see any obvious driver of an unusual pattern for this year. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.","Before taking your questions, let me conclude with a summary of our key areas of focus for 2013. At FPL, we continue to strive to deliver the best value in the state to our customers. The FPL team had a great year in 2012, and we will focus on ways to make our customer value proposition even better. We will continue to focus on our portfolio of large construction projects, with the last of the 4 nuclear uprates due to complete in the spring and the commercial operations at Cape Canaveral slated for the middle of the year. And third, we have already started the process of seeking to identify additional ways we can invest capital in projects that improve the value we deliver to our customers. We have generated a number of ideas already, and we look forward to sharing with you more of our thoughts at our March investor conference.","At Energy Resources, we must maintain our focus on excellence in day-to-day operations. We must continue the successful development of our Canadian wind and our solar portfolios. And third, with the short-term extension of the PTC program, we will be working hard to develop a strong portfolio of profitable contracted U.S. wind projects for 2013 and 2014. Any incremental investment will be financed in a way that supports our strong credit position.","And finally, at Lone Star Transmission, our focus will be on successfully transitioning from construction to operations.","With that, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Moray, can you just talk a little more about some of the '13 drivers to the point you guys are in a place to talk about them versus at the Analyst Day, just kind of some of the big pieces that will affect things? Obviously, normalization of wind asset performance is a pretty big driver year-on-year, the resource additions, but what else would we be thinking about?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I think we laid out the kind of the details on the Energy Resources side in the third quarter call. So there's a stair step chart in there, and I'd have to try and recall all the specifics. But the -- I guess, the main differences in the dynamics between '12 and '13 are that we do not expect to have the same degree of either hedge roll-off or PTC roll-off, so we don't have that drag. We will see, relatively speaking, more of a contribution from the growth in new assets, obviously, with over 1,200 megawatts of wind going in, in the fourth quarter that didn't have much of an impact on 2012 results, but will -- they'll -- those assets will have a full year for 2013. Certainly, we anticipate, as we always do, a return to kind of normal weather and operating conditions, so those should be net positive relative to this year. And the rest of the pieces on the resources side, I think should be relatively small, there'll be a little bit of an increase from CITC. We've got 300 megawatts of solar that we'll expect to be electing CITC on, but that's not a huge amount. So that's the Energy Resources side. And then on the FPL side, really, it's a continuation of where we have been for the last couple of years. We continued to invest very heavily, albeit, not at the same rate as the $4 billion in 2012. But growth in capital employed, assuming that we can manage our cost structure effectively, which we're certainly committed to doing, should translate into strong growth in earnings.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And you're assuming you're going to earn the midpoint of your ROE at the utility?","Moray P. Dewhurst","We certainly hope we're going to be able to do better than that. But as I indicated in the prepared remarks, that's going to take a lot of work on our part. We are busily gemming up ideas, and I think we'll be in a position to share more of our ideas at the March conference, so I don't have any specific I can share with you. But we're very proud of our long-term cost track record, our O&M cents per kilowatt hour. But again, as I indicated in the prepared remarks, we have seen some upward pressures in nominal terms, so we are definitely going to be taking a fresh look at really all aspects that drive productivity and efficiency. Obviously, the structure of a 4-year agreement, one of the values of these agreements -- this agreement, as in past agreements, that it provides an appropriate set of incentives, so benefits that we can create can be of value to shareholders but also future value to customers. So we're going to be working very hard on that.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I have just one last one, just either for Armando or Jim If one of them could talk about how the process will work for identifying wind for '13\/'14 to get built, and kind of where the customer interest is on moving projects forward. Now it looks like there's another year or 2 of life back in the PTC program.","James L. Robo","Another year to a life, I like that. Dan, the process is actually going to be very similar to what we've done in the past. We've -- the beginning of the year or certainly the beginning of the last couple of years, we go out and we meet with customers. It's -- we need to make sure that there is customer demand, and there's no better indication of that than customers that are willing to sign long-term power purchase agreements. So we're in the process of doing that. We have fielded several inbound calls, so it's not just the -- us or the other developers that -- they're clearly -- are excited about the passage of PTC legislation. We've got a number of customers that were waiting for something to happen, and now it's happened, and they are busily making calls. So I would say, over the next 2 to 3 months, it's a lot of customer visits. It's a lot of additional development on some projects that we put on hold last year. But I think as we said before, as an industry, we certainly expect 2013 to be a down year. This PTC extension, well received by us, but very late in the game. And therefore, a number of customers, our customers and other customers, bought wind last year in anticipation of potentially not having a PTC extension in '13 or '14. But also, there was a bunch of developers, obviously, that brought projects in earlier. So it's going to be a down year. But I think after the first quarter and certainly after the first 4 months of the year, we'll be in a much better position to understand what begin of construction means and what we might be able to do for 2013 and '14.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Dan, again, hopefully we can share more of our thoughts at the investor conference.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On Slide 25, you lay out the performance of resources by business unit relative to the 2011 expectations. One, on the high-end of the performance was the new investment category at $200 million, could you just touch a little bit on what was the driver for the strong performance on new investments?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Stephen, I don't know that there was anything in particular. I think we were at the top end of where we expected to be. Things came in on time, on the early side. I guess I should turn the question over to Armando. He's probably more familiar with it.","Armando Pimentel","Stephen, a couple of things. One of them was we did have an acquisition last year that we weren't -- we certainly don't plan for acquisitions. We are always working on asset acquisitions. But we had a nice 160-, 165-megawatt acquisition, roughly $300 million or so. That was the Cimarron acquisition that we talked about. But in addition, there were some power purchase agreements that came to fruition, a -- very late in 2011, I actually think maybe 1 or 2 in January or February of 2012 that we did not expect when we first put the information together. So that's it really, it's the acquisition, a couple more wind projects, that got us that additional gross margin.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just looking at the performance for 2012, there were some income from gains on disposal of assets. Does that have any relevance going forward? Or can you provide a little more color on that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. Steve, I'm not sure which piece you're referring to, so let me give you the whole story. If you look at the GAAP income statement, you'll see a fairly substantial number. There's really 3 pieces in that number. There's a small amount, which is actually associated with disposal of a couple of small physical assets, that's the $0.03 that we discussed in the drivers. So that's pretty small. Virtually, all the rest is associated with gains on the Energy Resources decommissioning trusts. And that, in turn, is divided into 2 roughly equal parts. Roughly 1\/2 of that, actually slightly more than 1\/2 of it, close to $70 million pretax is simply associated with the reversal of OTTI losses that we previously excluded from adjusted income. So those are -- the gains there are also excluded from adjusted income. So the remainder, which is about $60 million pretax is just the gains associated with the normal management of the Energy Resources decommissioning trusts. So it's important to recognize that those trusts have grown significantly over the years. At the end of the year, they were worth about $1.3 billion. And obviously, 2012 was a good investment performance year. I think the actual return on the portfolio was something in the order of 12%. So as that -- as those investment returns move up or down, we will see some variability in the Energy Resources' income. I think, if I recall correctly, about -- a swing of about 4% in the realized return would correspond to about $0.01 of EPS.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, I understood. So that does have an impact going forward just depending on the level of performance of that fund?","Moray P. Dewhurst","That's correct.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just want to check a few things. One was -- it sounds to me like the wind outlook obviously has improved with the PTC extension, yet the 2014 forecast doesn't seem to have changed yet, although it sounds like there might be some upside there. Do I understand that correctly? Is there upside to the 2014 guidance because of wind but you guys haven't sort of baked it in yet because of the rules and the customer discussions, what have you?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, that's fundamentally correct. We have -- the 2014 range that we shared today is the same as we've had out there. That just reflects our current backlog. So to the extent that we are able to add additional projects, which we certainly hope and expect we will now be able to do, that will be incremental to that. We're just not at a stage yet where we have a good sense of how much that may be.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","You figure the next few months you might?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, as I said, we hope to have more to share with you in the March investor conference, where -- whether we'll be at the stage, then where we can really translate it into specific EPS accretion, I'm not sure. As Armando said, it's going to depend a lot on customer interest. You've got to have a customer who has a need or desire for the renewable energy. And I'm just not sure how far along we'll be at that point.","James L. Robo","And Paul, just -- this is Jim. Just one other point on that. It depends a lot on the start of construction language that -- as it gets finalized. And the other thing I would say is even if we do put in a significant amount of new wind in 2014, that's primarily a 2015 earnings impact, not a 2014 earnings impact just because of timing and in service dates in the year. So I would expect that more to be a driver of post '14 earnings than of '14 earnings.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then just to clarify on Dan's question with the ROE, the midpoint ROE that's in your guidance, is that sort of how we should think about the midpoint of the guidance as being the midpoint of the utility ROE sort of?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think you need to make your own inferences there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then the 2014 -- last quarter, you guys saw yourselves as free cash flow positive. Is that still the case?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, again it comes back to the question of incremental investment. So really, nothing has changed to what I'll call our backlog only outlook that we've been discussing with you for quite some time. So to the extent that we are successful in generating new wind projects that have CapEx needs, obviously that's going to affect our cash flow requirements in 2014. But as I tried to indicate in the prepared remarks, we're going to finance those things in a way that supports our overall credit metrics. And anything that we do will necessarily be EPS accretive over the multiyear period.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally, CO2. Because there's some statements by the President at his Inauguration, there's been some speculation that there might be an EPA push for administratively as opposed to legislatively for a decrease in carbon. Have you guys heard about any specific -- have you heard anything about this? Can you -- I mean, I know you guys are sort of plugged-in there. Any sense as to whether or not there's -- there may be new efforts to reduce existing power plant CO2 emissions administratively from EPA?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I'm not sure whether you call it new or not. But EPA has -- is required to issue rules affecting CO2 for both new units and existing units performance standards, as well as for other sources outside our industry. So I think we, along with everybody else in the industry, has been anticipating that those rules will be coming out at some point. What the timing is in each case is not always clear. So I don't know that there's anything new in that. I mean, obviously, you can draw any conclusions you like about whether they will be more aggressive or less aggressive in that, but I think we've all been expecting that to occur. But as we've always said, implementing carbon controls through rules is going to be a long and slow process and certainly would be inferior to a market-based approach, but that's what the law requires.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","William Appicelli ","It's actually Bill Appicelli. Just -- I had a question about the underlying usage in customer growth. So for 2013 guidance, I mean, what is embedded in that in terms of weather-normal sales growth?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think it's about 0.5%. We're not expecting a lot of growth in usage per customer. We were frankly pleasantly surprised by the strength of the growth this year. As we often said, quarter-to-quarter basis, it can be quite volatile, and it actually declined a little bit in the fourth quarter. So I think it's about 0.5% for the full year for next year.","William Appicelli ","Okay. So then some of the commentary you had about some -- the construction activity improving, you guys are not really embedding any of that into your guidance sort of in the '13, '14 outlook as of right now. Is that -- I would...","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I think on the customer account -- customer count side, we're looking for essentially a little bit stronger continuation of this year, so sort of 0.7% or 0.8% growth in total customer count.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Also on the utility, just 2 questions, one on capital spending. I noticed that in the slide deck, you didn't include an update to CapEx projections. Just wanted a sanity check, do you -- when you think about CapEx at the utility going forward post the rate deal, outside of the big projects, the modernization projects, when you look at load growth and other factors in the state, do you see more kind of upside or downside to those CapEx levels, especially on kind of core distribution projects?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I think relative to the numbers that are embedded in all the forward-looking statements that we've shared so far, we would certainly hope that there would be additional CapEx. As I tried to indicate in the prepared remarks, one of the things that we are, right now, looking very closely at is are there additional ways that we can deploy capital to improve the customer value equation. So we've been very successful in finding ways, essentially to substitute capital for fuel. That's really what those modernization projects are. But we think that there are some other opportunities within the business to substitute capital for other elements of the cost structure. I think that's how we're going to get some of our -- the productivity improvements that we'll be looking for. So again, we don't -- we're not far enough along where we have anything very specific to share with you. But that's really the -- what we're going through right now. So I think relative to the numbers that are already out there, if anything, I think we're going to have more. And then obviously, there are additional major project opportunities, the biggest single one obviously would be if we have any participation in the pipeline.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And on the O&M side, we've had a number of other companies in the sector talk about above inflationary growth rates in nuclear-related O&M. Some of the folks are starting to talk about pension cost impacting O&M labor contracts with the kind of inflationary or even greater than inflation. Can you talk about just high-level headwinds and tailwinds on O&M at the utility?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, let me take some of those in turn. On the nuclear side, we certainly have seen over the past years significant growth in the O&M on the nuclear side. I'm actually optimistic that in our particular case we're going to be heading into a period where those escalation rates start to come down. Obviously, with the completion of the uprates at the 4 Florida nuclear units, we've got a lot of good fresh equipment so that hopefully we'll have implications for ongoing cost. In the other operating units, I don't see at this stage any major adverse drivers. So I think really the challenge for us is can we find ways to improve real productivity to offset just the inflation rate trend. And I think the same is really true on the staff side. Unlike many companies, we don't have issue with the pension fund, so we are very well-funded. So I don't anticipate any major negative comparisons in future years on the pension side. So I think our situation is a little different. But having said that, we are already one of the most efficient performers in the industry. When we do our benchmarks, we see ourselves as a top decile cost position. So the challenge for us is to find real ways to improve the productivity of a very well performing business, and we're committed to try to do that.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. Last item, on Slide 19, that bullet point about expecting to access a diverse array of financing instruments this year. Can you just give a little more detail or granularity on what that -- what you mean by that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","That's shorthand for we will continue with the same basic financing strategy that we've had for a long time, which includes starting with on the Energy Resources side where we have new projects with long-term contracts, against them, we will look first to the project finance and tax equity markets. We think that's a very powerful market test of the quality of our projects and it also produces a good economic result. We will finance the -- let me flip over to the FPL side. We've continued to maintain a balance capital structure consistent with where we've been, at roughly 59% equity ratio. So that will mean additional first mortgage bond issuances. And then the residual at the group capital -- or capital holdings, excuse me, level will be financed with a mixture of products that ensure that we maintain our target credit metrics, particularly for 2014. So this year, 2012, that meant a combination of what we call is hybrids, these deeply subordinated 60-year debentures, as well as the equity units. At this stage, we don't see any need for additional common equity this year. But that, again, would be subject to where we come out in our conclusions about incremental investment.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","My question was on the earnings waterfall at Energy Resources, Page 16. For the year as a whole, you show lower pricing as a $0.14 drag on Energy Resources' earnings, the PTC roll-off is a $0.09 drag. On the prior page, Page 15, where you look at the -- your quarter-over-quarter results, you don't mention either of those 2 items. What accounts for their absence in the fourth quarter? And what does their absence in the fourth quarter imply for the year ahead?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, the main reason for the absence is that -- the fourth quarter is a small quarter, and the bulk of the hedge value, in a sense, was concentrated in the middle of the year, so that's just the way the pattern works out for the year. But in terms of sort of implications for the future, as I indicated, the bulk of the negative impact of the hedge roll-offs was concentrated in 2012, so we don't expect that to be a major drag one way or the -- well, maybe a fact of one way or the other in 2013. I think some assets have a little uptick and some have a little down for 2013. And the PTC roll-off is largely a function of the -- as you can tell, of the pattern of projects that went into service 10 years ago. Those should not be a big negative drag in 2013.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Good. And then one other quick question, referring now to Page 19. How important a contribution to cash from operations in 2012 was bonus depreciation? And do you expect that to continue at a similar level next year?","Moray P. Dewhurst","That's a tough one. I don't have the answer to that one. I don't -- I haven't sorted out the impact on -- in 2012 of bonus depreciation. If you'll let me -- we'll get back to you on that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Maybe if we could have Armando give an update on Spain solar and sort of what's happening there?","Moray P. Dewhurst","[indiscernible]","Armando Pimentel","Well, the Spain solar, the legislation, the proposed legislation that we've been talking about now for I think a couple of quarters was finally signed in early January. The results of that are about a $0.03 to $0.04 negative to the forecast that we had in our plans earlier in the 2012 timeframe. But the $0.03 to $0.04 obviously has been put in our forecast, and the numbers that Moray has given you for 2013 and 2014 incorporate that in it. Right now, we don't see any other attempts to change what was just approved in Spain, to either change the ad valorem tax or to change the way that natural gas prices -- or natural gas can be used in the generation. We're still working through some small issues related to our financing. But we're -- honestly, we're very close to getting those projects COD-ed. Unit 1 is running through all its tests right now. We expect Unit 1 to be COD in March. And Unit 2 is actually pretty close behind Unit 1. So I'm pushing the team pretty aggressively to get Unit 2 in earlier in the second quarter rather than later. So from a construction -- from an operational standpoint, obviously, we've run a lot of test. The plant is working very nicely. From a legislative regulatory point of view, we wished it would've worked out a bit better than what it did, and we're not done trying to figure out whether we can better what was signed into law. But the $0.03 to $0.04 bad guy is in our forecast, and I'm actually looking forward to be getting over there and having a nice ribbon-cutting and thanking all of the employees that have spent the better part of 3 years bringing that project to fruition.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","That's great. That's a super update, Armando. Moray, maybe just turning then to pension impacts for 2013, I think in the prior question, you addressed the utility side of it. Just across the entire organization on a consolidated basis, your outlook for pension cost impact in 2013?","Moray P. Dewhurst","It's the same. It's a single pension fund, and it's well-funded. So historically, we've actually had a slight credit to income through pension accounting, and we expect that to continue, but it's not material. We don't expect any changes.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And then last one for Jim if I can, and I'm sure you'll have more on this at the March Analyst Meeting. But if I recall, you've historically talked about sort of a 5% to 7% growth rate. And as I look out and you're in the unusual position of having 2 years of guidance out here, so thanks for that, but if I look at the midpoint of 2013 and move that the 2014, I've got a rather wide range of 4% to 16% growth. Although I'm not asking for you to comment on or help me find the place in 2014, I would love if you could comment on that longer-term growth rate and sort of how that's fitting in amongst the various possibilities that you're sort of looking at for 2014 and beyond.","James L. Robo","Jay, I think what we've said and we said it last quarter and I think Moray said it in the prepared remarks this quarter is that the drivers of our growth that we've seen through 2014 continue post-2014 as well, and we will have more to say about our future growth prospects in that March investor conference. Frankly, that's a big reason why we are going to have the half-day session is to lay out some thoughts on our future growth drivers.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session, as well as today's conference call.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. [Indiscernible]. Please go ahead, sir.","Unidentified Company Representative","Thank you, Jane. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners.","With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to John.","John Ketchum","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners delivered solid first quarter results and are off to a strong start towards meeting their respective objectives for the year.","NextEra Energy\u2019s first-quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 10.1% against the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting strong performance at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. Over the same period, NextEra Energy Partners grew per unit distributions by roughly 15% versus the prior year comparable period.","Adding to the solid run rate with which NEP entered the year, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of an additional asset from Energy Resources, which I will discuss in more detail later in the call. ","At FPL, earnings per share increased $0.10 from the prior year comparable quarter. Continued investment in the business was the primary driver of growth as regulatory capital employed grew 9.7% year-over-year. With residential build significantly lower than the national and Florida averages, FPL\u2019s focus continues to be on finding smart investments to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.","In addition to the approximately 1750 MW Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, which remains on track and under budget FPL continues to make excellent progress towards its recently announced solar development initiatives. Earlier this month, we filed FPL\u2019s ten-year with the Public Service Commission and announced that we expect to add a total of nearly 2100 MW for solar across Florida over the next several years.","We have already secured sites that will potentially support more than 3 GW of FPL\u2019s continued solar growth. We also remain excited about our 50 MW battery storage pilot program that was approved as part of the 2016 base rate settlement agreement, which is expected to complement our solar development efforts.","In addition to solar, as part of FPL\u2019s 10-year site plan, we announced our intention to modernize one of FPL\u2019s oldest power plant in the Dania Beach Florida, with a new approximately 1200 MW high efficiency natural gas plant, and to pursue the early phase out of an additional coal-fired plant that we co-own with JEA.","FPL was recognized in 2016 for the second consecutive year as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation, as well as for its response to Hurricane Matthew and Hermine. We remain committed to continuously improving our customer value proposition by continuously making investments to harden and automate our existing transmission and distribution system.","Not only does FPL offer what we believe is a total customer value proposition that is second to none, but as a result of these initiatives we also expect to continue to deliver shareholder value as regulatory capital employed is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of roughly 8% per year over the four-year term of January 2017 to December 2020.","At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by $0.10 per share against the comparable prior year quarter as contributions from new investments continued to drive growth. It was another outstanding period for renewables origination with the addition of 413 MW of wind and 208 MW of solar PPAs added to the backlog this quarter.","We also entered into agreements to sell over 1000 MW of wind development rights and new wind projects to one of our largest customers, which we have not previously announced and are not included in our backlog. I will provide more details on our continued origination success later in the call.","During the quarter, Energy Resources successfully commissioned the first 114 MW of its wind repowering program and continues to make solid progress on the remaining sites. As a reminder, we have tax equity financing commitments in place for the approximately 1600 MW of repowering projects that we have previously announced. These projects represent around half of the total $2 million to $2.5 million of capital deployment that we expect for repowering through 2020.","We continue to actively pursue additional repowering opportunities for our existing contracted portfolio, which will largely comprise the balance of the repowering opportunity in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Beyond renewables, we continue to make good progress on development and construction activities related to our three natural gas pipeline projects and our development team continues to seek new pipeline opportunities going forward.","At NextEra Energy Partners, the assets operated well and delivered financial results in line with our expectations. Yesterday the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.365 per common unit or $1.46 per common unit on an annualized basis continuing our distribution growth at the top end of our range. Inclusive of this increase, NEP has grown its distribution per unit by 95% since the IPO in July of 2014.","Further building upon that strength, today we are announcing that NEP has reached an agreement to acquire the approximately 250 MW Golden West Wind Energy Center from Energy Resources. We expect the transaction, which is anticipated to be funded with available debt capacity, to yield a double-digit return to NEP\u2019s unit holders and be accretive to LP distributions.","With its extended growth runway, we believe NEP offers a superior value proposition and is better positioned than ever to deliver upon the expectations that we have outlined for our investors. Before continuing with the discussion of our strong results for the quarter, I would like to say a few words about the Oncor transactions.","Oncor has always been an opportunistic transaction that we believe leverages our core strength in operating rate regulated utilities efficiently to deliver on our customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. We are disappointed by the recent ruling from the Public Utility Commission of Texas that our proposed transactions are not in the public interest.","We expect to file a motion for rehearing with the commission sometime in the next few weeks. However, if we are ultimately unsuccessful with the transactions we continue to believe that we have one of the best growth opportunity sets in our industry and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top-end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8% through 2020 off a 2016 base.","We remain laser focused on continuing our long term track record of delivering outstanding results for our shareholders. As a reminder, through the end of 2016 we outperformed both the S&P 500 and the S&P utility index in terms of total shareholder return on a 1,3,5,7 and 10-year basis, and have outperformed more than 70% of S&P 500 over the last 10 years.","We were once again honored to be named for the 10th time in 11 years number one in the electric and gas utilities industry on Fortune\u2019s 2017 list of world\u2019s most admired companies, and to be ranked among the top 10 companies worldwide across all industries for innovation, social responsibility and wise use of corporate assets.","While third-party acknowledgments are a reflection of our past successes, we remain focused on the future. We expect that the organic growth prospects of both FPL and Energy Resources combined with our continued focus on running our businesses efficiently through initiatives such as our recently announced [project] will allow us to extend our long term track record of delivering value for our customers and providing growth for our shareholders, while we continue to maintain one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry.","Now let us look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL, for the first quarter of 2017 FPL reported net income of $445 million or $0.95 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.10 or approximately 12% year-over-year. The primary driver of FPL\u2019s earnings growth was continued investment in the business. Average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 9.7% over the same quarter last year. FPL\u2019s capital expenditures were approximately $1.7 billion for the quarter, and we expect our full-year capital investments to be between $5 billion to $5.5 billion. I will discuss FPL\u2019s capital initiatives in more detail in a moment.","Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately11.5% for the 12 months ending March 2017. As a reminder, under the new rate agreement we maintain the ability to record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. We began 2017 with a reserve amortization balance of $1.25 billion and used $211 million during the first quarter to achieve the regulatory ROE of 11.5%.","As we previously discussed, we expect to use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year given the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect this year to be no different. As you may recall, in 2016 we entered the year with a reserve amortization balance of $263 million and utilized $176 million in the first quarter, but ended the year with a balance of $250 million.","The Florida economy continues to show healthy results with recent unemployment rates near their lowest level since 2007. Florida\u2019s consumer confidence level is at post-recession highs. The real estate sector continues to grow with average building permits and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida up 1.1% and 6.7% respectively versus the prior year.","During the quarter, FPL\u2019s average number of customers increased by approximately 65,000 or 1.3% from the comparable prior year quarter, which is generally consistent with our long-term expectations for customer growth. Overall usage per customer decreased 1.4% compared to the prior year. As we have previously noted, usage per customer tends to exhibit significant volatility from quarter-to-quarter, which is more pronounced during periods of abnormal weather conditions similar to those experienced during the first quarter.","On a 12 month rolling average, weather normalized customer usage has declined by negative 0.5%, consistent with our long-term expectations averaging between 0% and approximately negative 0.5% per year. However, as a reminder, for the full year 2016 we saw no negative impact from weather normalized customer usage.","We will continue to closely monitor customer usage trends going forward. After accounting for these effects and the impact of a leap year day in 2016, first quarter retail sales decreased 1.2% year-over-year. Looking ahead, for 2017, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by the reserve amortization balance coupled with our weather normalized sales growth forecast and current Capex and O&M expectations to support a regulatory ROE towards the upper end of the allowed band of 9.60% to 11.60% under our new rate agreement. As always, our expectations assume among other things, normal weather and operating conditions.","Before moving on, let me now take a moment to update you on some of our key capital initiatives, during the first quarter FPL selected the sites for the initial projects being developed under the solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of the base rate settlement agreement. The approximately 600 MW of 2017 and 2018 solar is comprised of 874.5 MW sites, which are expected to commence construction this spring with commercial operation expected for half of the sites by year-end 2017 and the remainder in the first quarter of 2018.","As a reminder, under the SoBRA FPL is permitted to petition for recovery of up to 300 MW of cost-effective solar to be placed in service each year through 2020, and if approved immediately begin recovering the cost of these projects through rates upon commercial operation. By selecting optimal sites on FPL\u2019s transmission system and leveraging the company\u2019s industry-leading construction, sourcing and development capabilities these projects are expected to produce millions of dollars of net lifetime savings for customers, and will help to further diversify FPL\u2019s fuel mix.","We continue to develop sites for the approximately 600 MW of solar capacity planned for 2019 and 2020 under the SoBRA and will work to advance the additional 900 MW of solar that is included in our 10-year site plan over the next several years. As part of the new 10-year site plan, FPL also announced its intention to further modernize the Lauderdale plant and Dania Beach, Florida with a new approximately 1200 MW high-efficiency, natural gas plant that will begin operation by mid-2022.","This project, the Dania Beach Clean Energy Center, will help FPL maintain its best in class rank among major US utilities for having the lowest operating to maintenance expenses measured on a cost per kilowatt hour of retail sales. By modernizing a plant that was last updated nearly a quarter century ago with current state of the art technology, FPL customers are expected to save hundreds of millions of dollars in reduce fuel and operating the maintenance cost over its operational life.","FPL plans to initiate the public service commission approval process for the modernization in the second quarter. Additionally, earlier this year together with our joint interest owner, JEA, we announced a preliminary agreement to commission the St. Johns River Power Park, a 1252 MW coal-fired plant, in which FPL has a 20% ownership stake.","Similar to the Cedar Bay and Indiantown transactions the early closure of the St. Johns plant in 2018, which we intend to see commission approval of this spring, is expected to both reduce costs for FPL customers and significantly reduce emissions. All of our ongoing capital initiatives are aimed at enhancing our overall customer value proposition of delivering low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions for Florida customers.","Let me now turn to energy resources, which reported first-quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $476 million or $1.01 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $357 million or $0.76 per share. Energy Resources\u2019 contribution to first quarter adjusted earnings per share increased $0.10 or approximately 15% from the prior year comparable period. New investments added $0.35 per share. ","In 2016, we commissioned roughly 2500 MW of new wind and solar projects in the US, which was a record year for Energy Resources. Contributions from new investments and renewables together with the timing of tax incentives on certain projects added $0.31 per share, reflecting strong contributions from these new project additions.","New investments in natural gas pipelines added $0.04 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets were essentially flat against the prior year comparable period as was company-wide wind resource. Contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities declined by $0.11 per share.","As a result of sustained weak commodity prices, in the first quarter of 2016 we elected not to invest capital in drilling certain wells, which resulted in liquidation of [in the money] hedges and the resulting recognition of income. The absence of these hedge liquidations this quarter combined with increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates were responsible for the year-over-year decline.","Mild weather negatively affected our customers\u2019 supply and trading business, where contributions declined by $0.04 per share. All other impacts reduced results by $0.09 per share including the effects of interest expense, reflecting continued growth from the business and share dilution. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.","At Energy Resources, we continue to believe we are well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in recent history. While state renewable portfolio standards continue to provide strong support for wind and solar growth, customer origination activity continues to be largely driven by economics. Based upon continued equipment efficiency improvements and cost declines, Energy Resources can offer wind PPAs at very competitive prices.","Similarly solar is becoming more competitive on a levelized cost of energy basis across the country. We anticipate that improved wind and solar economics and low natural gas prices will continue to lead to additional retirements of coal, nuclear and less fuel-efficient oil and gas-fired generation units, creating significant opportunities for renewables growth going forward.","Additionally, over the long term as battery costs decline and efficiencies improve we expect batteries to further complement renewable economics, supporting additional demand as the tax credit stays down in the next decade. As a result, we believe the size of the market potential for new renewables is larger than it has ever been helping to drive growth well into the next decade. I am pleased to report that since the last call we have signed contracts for roughly 413 MW of new wind projects, including 368 MW for post-2018 delivery. We have also signed 208 MW of new solar projects, including 177 MW for post-2018 delivery.","These contracts are a reflection of the factors I just mentioned combined with the continued success of our origination efforts as we capitalize on our competitive advantages in both solar and wind. In addition, one of our largest customers is purchasing over 1000 MW of wind projects for self ownership. These projects represent a combination of development asset sales, where our customer finishes development activities and manages construction and build-own transfer opportunities in which Energy Resources turns the project over prior to commercial operation.","With our strong internal origination efforts and large pipeline of development projects, Energy Resources has an ability to recycle capital by sometimes selling developed sites to or building projects for others, who may want to own some renewable assets outright. These efforts allow us to optimize our development portfolio and in most cases are expected to help us secure additional PPAs. More importantly the project sales are expected to generate a significant portion of the after-tax MPV per KW that we would realize over the life of a contracted wind project, roughly 20% to 25% of the MPV for development rights sale, and roughly 40% to 50% of the MPV for a build-own-transfer project.","Our core business will continue to be to provide long-term contracts to customers. We believe the addressable long-term contracted market remains as strong as ever with cooperatives, municipalities, commercial and industrial customers, and most investor-owned utilities benefited from the scale and other competitive advantages that Energy Resources can provide.","The attached chart provides additional details on where our renewables development program now stands for 2017 and beyond. We will give further details on our renewables development program at our investor conference, which we plan to hold on June 22 in New York. The development activities for our natural gas pipeline projects remain on track. Construction on the Florida pipelines is progressing well and we expect an in-service date in the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, NextEra Energy\u2019s investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million respectively. The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process. We continue to expect to be in a position to receive FERC notice to proceed later this year to support commercial operations by year-end 2018. NextEra Energy's expected investment is roughly $1 billion.","Let me now review the highlights for NEP. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $170 million and cash available for distribution was $40 million up $29 million and $2 million respectively against the prior year comparable quarter. Overall, results were consistent with our expectations. Portfolio additions over the last year drove growth and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 21%.","Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from existing projects was roughly flat declining by $2 million against the prior year comparable quarter, primarily as a result of lower wind and solar generation. For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was 99% a long term average versus 100% in the first quarter 2016. Desert Sunlight, which NEP acquired a 24% interest in during the fourth quarter of 2016 provided a minimal contribution to first quarter cash available for distribution growth due to its seasonal generation profile and quarterly debt service payments.","Looking ahead, we expect substantial growth and cash available for distribution in the second and third quarters of this year as Desert Sunlight began to making meaningful contributions. When viewed on a run rate basis, which removes the timing impact of acquisitions and their seasonal generation and debt service profiles, annual cash available for distribution grew 18% over the prior year comparable quarter forwarding the growth in LP distributions.","As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, since we treat these as an operating expense. The impact of other effects, including management fees and outside services are shown on the accompanying slide. We continue to execute on our plan to expand NEP's portfolio and I'm pleased to announce that NEP has reached an agreement with Energy Resources to acquire the Golden West Wind Energy Center.","Golden West is an approximately 250 MW wind project in Colorado that entered service in October 2015 and sells 100% of its output under a 25 year PPA. The transaction which is expected to close in early May represents another step to our growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least 2022.","NEP expects to acquire the Golden West project for total consideration of approximately $238 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments. Plus the assumption of approximately $184 million in liabilities related to tax equity financing. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $53 million to $63 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $22 million to $27 million, each on an annual run rate basis as of December 31, 2017.","The purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded entirely through existing debt capacity and the asset is expected to further enhance the quality and diversity of NEPs existing portfolio while being accretive to LP unit distributions.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2017, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.583 billion or $3.37 per share. NextEra Energy's 2017 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $820 million and a $1.75 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment decrease $0.04 per share compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to the absence of FiberNet and the timing of certain tax items.","The sale of FiberNet at 16.7 times 2016 EBITDA, generated net cash proceeds of over a $1.1 billion and a net after-tax gain on disposition of approximately $685 million, that is excluded from NextEra Energy's first quarter adjusted earnings. NextEra Energy's operating cash flow adjusted for the impacts of certain FPL cost recoveries in the Indiantown acquisition increased by over 10% year-over-year.","Based on our first quarter performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full-year. For 2017, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.85, and at or near the upper end of our previously disclosed 6% to 8% growth rate of 2016 base.","As part of the financing for Oncor, NextEra entered into equity forward transactions for 12 million shares which would provide approximately $1.5 billion in proceeds. Given that we do not have a current need for the equity, we intent to settle the forward contract shortly in an orderly manner. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.80 to $7.30 for 2018, and for NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted EPS to be in the range of 6% to 8% through 2020 off of 2016 base while maintaining our strong credit ratings.","We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year for at least 2018 off of 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations discussed throughout today's call are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited a normal weather and operating conditions.","Turning now to NEP. At NEP, as I mentioned earlier, yesterday the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $36.05 per common unit or $1.46 per common unit on an annualized basis representing a 15% increase over the comparable distribution a year earlier. Our expectations for December 31, 2017 run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD are unchanged at $875 million to $975 million and $310 million to $340 million respectively.","These expectations are subject to our normal caveats and our net of expected IDR fees since we treat these as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2016 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $1.41, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth and LP distributions as be in a reasonable range of expectations for at least 2022, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2017 distribution that is payable in February 2018 to be in the range of a $1.58 to a $1.62 per common unit.","We continue to expect NextEra Energy Partners to achieve its distribution growth targets without issuing common equity for 2017 and potentially 2018.","In summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. FPL energy resources and NEP all have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board, now we are off to a strong start to 2017 as we continue to execute well against all of our strategic and growth initiatives. At FPL, we continue to focus on operational cost effectiveness productivity and making smart long term investments to further improve the quality, reliability, and efficiency of everything we do.","Energy resources maintain significant competitive advantages to capitalize on the expanding market for renewables development and is continuing to make strong progress on its natural gas pipeline development and construction efforts. For NEP, growth in the North American renewables market and the originations success and energy resources continue to expand the pipeline of potential dropdown assets and it's long term growth prospects remain stronger than ever providing benefits for both NEE and NEP.","We remain intensely focused on executing on these opportunities and extending our long term track record of delivering value to shareholders.","With that, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Hi, good morning and congratulations on good results.","John Ketchum","Thank you, Stephen.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to explore the notion for rehearing in Texas and I wondered if you could just speak to what the process might look like and then I guess at the core of it, what I'm thinking about are the conditions that were set out it seem very challenging and probably really don\u2019t set a good press in for our industry. How could those potentially be addressed through this process?","John Ketchum","Steve, I might differ that question to Jim.","Jim Robo","So, Steve, just from a process standpoints and I'll get the days pretty close, I think we have 25 days from when the final order went out to file through rehearing the commission then have 30 days to roll on that. They can extend it for a bit should they choose to. And so, that's the kind of process that you're looking at in terms of timing.","I think in terms of, obviously we were disappointed in the decision we think we would be a terrific owner of Oncor for the state and for its customers. I think we would add enormous value to customers in Texas from how we would operate the utility. So, in terms of anything else, I think I guess the other two things I would say is obviously we can't pay $18.7 billion for utility that we can't run. And we can't control the board and we can't have access to dividends.","And it's just bad business to do anything other than that. And so, you can expect that we will not be accepting any conditions that would not allow us to point the majority of the board or have access to the dividends. I mean, that's just we've been very clear about that from the beginning on this transaction and we continue to be very clear on it. And so, we remain very committed to trying to get it done and as I said we'll be filing for a rehearing here shortly.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. And then if I could shift gears over to wind, we're certainly really encouraged by wind economic improvements. Just looking out a bit further than maybe we typically do. When you think about the changes to wind turbine technology the next generation of blades and turbines, what's the approximate timing for the next generation and how should we think about potential step changes and improvements even further in terms of wind economics and what does to your addressable market?","John Ketchum","Yes. I think from a wind step change standpoint, we had commented on the last call that we expect wind to be about a $0.02 to a $0.03 product without tax credits, early in the next decade. And we get comfortable with that largely because of the step change and the improved economics that we see with wind turbines. First of all, we're expecting even a taller tower design, wider rotor diameters, towers getting to about 90 meters, rotors up close to a 130 meters which could drive the NCF to right around 60%.","You combine now with what we expect to be continued progressive reductions and turbine equipment pricing, which we think we'll get even more aggressive as the PTC phase is down. That's how we really get comfortable with that market. And then when you think about the production tax credit, actually facing down right around 2023, we continue to be optimistic about what we see on batteries. We have 20 people dedicated to our battery development effort, we're investing upwards of a $100 million a year in batteries, we're excited about the 50MV battery storage pilot program that FPL has.","But imagine the game changer that that would be for renewables, not only wind, that blows predominantly during the in the peak shaving economic opportunities around solar. That could really also help to substantially drive renewable economics. Granted battery still have a long way to go, they're still expensive, still inefficient, but with all the investment from the automotive industry, the focus that you're seeing from our sector, we obviously want to be a leader. The Chinese have announced that they plan to take a major role in battery manufacturing which is one of the factors that really help to drive down the cost curve on PV panels.","Those are all things that really make us very optimistic about the prospects for renewables development as we head into the next decade.","Stephen Byrd","That's great color. Thank you, very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Yes, hi. Two questions. First, I guess this was for Jim. Obviously you are pursuing we're hearing on Oncor, but assuming that that doesn't work out and you're kind of in the standalone case which it sounds like you're thinking you could hit the upper end of your growth rate. Kind of how important is looking at other M&A in the future. I have some investors who say you strategically you guys need to do a deal, could you just kind of give your view on that?","Jim Robo","Sure, Steve. So, I think John said on the call, excluding Oncor, we'd be disappointed if we didn\u2019t earn at the top end of the 6% to 8% range through 2020 from an EPS standpoint. And we're very comfortable with that, we're very comfortable with our organic growth prospects. We do not have to do anything. I love our standalone prospects, I love our two businesses, they have tremendous opportunity to deliver growth for shareholders and also tremendous opportunity to do good things for customers. And so, I love our two businesses on a standalone basis.","M&A is hard. I think we've seen in the last month in our industry how hard it is and any -- our perspective of M&A really hasn\u2019t changed for a very long time, which is it's that anything that we would do if we were to do something would have to be really compelling for shareholders. As I said, it's very hard to do. And we're all as always we're going to stay disciplined and let me just reinforce again, we don\u2019t have to do anything on the M&A front because we really do love our standalone organic growth prospects.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, good. And then on the just a question on renewables. So, if you look at the your '17 to '18 development targets, you still have a decent amount to fill in to get to your kind of current expectations. Could you just give color how you're feeling about getting to that?","Armando Pimentel","Hi Steve, I'm Armando. We feel good or we would have obviously changed the numbers. There is I think we said at the last call that there was a lot of activity really through the four years for wind from '17 through '20 and honestly there is a lot of activity in the market right now for solar from '18 to '21. So, we continue to see folks that are interested and bring in renewables and in '18, even if the price maybe a little bit higher for them, they understand that but for their own reasons, whether its commercial and industrial folks that have something internally to get done or whether its folks on the utility broadly define the utility space that have made commitments to regulate us or others, they're interested in '18.","So, I don\u2019t know ultimately how it will work out, but we looked at it again this quarter based on the activity that we have in-house and what we know is coming down the pipe. We continue to feel comfortable with the range.","Steve Fleishman","Great, thank you.","Armando Pimentel","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Thank you, good morning.","Jim Robo","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Turning to the utility business. When you talk about the 8% growth rate and using this as sort of the settlement agreement as a benchmark, what's in the capital plan today and what's not. Refresh my memory but I believe and that was approved by the commission allowed up to 300MV a year of solar. But it sounds like you're opportunity set it a lot higher than that. So, what is what are you planning on doing and then some of the new initiatives you've announced like the proposal to knock down and rebuild that gas plants.","Can you just give us what's in the baseline and what the opportunity set is?","Jim Robo","Yes, I mean, sure. One is the transmission and distribution, continued storm hardening, the automation effort that we have there. We have the Oak Ridge OB clean energy center opportunity as well. We have the 1200MV of solar or the extra 900MV in a minute that are part of the SoBRA adjustment. We have the 50MV in our battery storage. Opportunity although would have to recover in rates during the next rate case on that.","We still have combustion parts improvements that we continue to make to the existing facilities, continue to complete the peak or upgrades that we have talked about previously. And then we have all the opportunities that we laid out in the 10 year side plan which are incremental. First of all, the additional 900MV of solar which we have secured better than 3 gigawatts of sides in Florida for that we like to be able to execute on over the next several years.","Obviously, we are in a good position with our surplus amortization balance, and then the Lauderdale opportunity that we announced as well, which would be more of a 20, 22, I think COD that we would pursue there. And then obviously the St. Johns opportunity that I mentioned earlier, we continue to find smart investment opportunities to clean up the emissions profile in Florida and continue to make NextEra Energy and FPL one of the cleanest emission generators of all top 50 power producers in the country.","And we'll continue to try to identify further opportunities going forward. But those are the things that really drive that 8% regulatory capital employed growth.","Greg Gordon","Forgive me for following-on up on the solar. If you chose to go ahead and because you have the opportunity and the sites to go build more than what is in the current segment plan. What's the recovery mechanism for that?","Eric Silagy","So, Greg, this is Eric Silagy. So, outside of the rate agreement, if we went ahead and did solar, then we would seek to recover that during the next grade preceding. That would be the mechanism that we would do that. So, we are looking at opportunities and identifying sites. And we'll determine whether or not we want to do that before we go to the next rate preceding or afterwards.","Greg Gordon","Okay.","Jim Robo","And hey Greg, this is Jim. Just one last thing on that. We are going to, you could expect that in the June Investor Conference that we will lay that out with some details, yes.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thanks a lot. Two more quick ones. Just to be clear on when you say you're going to settle the forward sale, I mean you're not issuing the equity?","Jim Robo","That is correct.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And then the numbers were great in the quarter, but you had that $0.11 headwind from upstream gas and you described very clearly why. When I look in the appendix of your release and I looked at the expected EBITDA PTC contribution from upstream and midstream which is 190, the 290 and 95 to 195. Those that guidance is a function of your expectation that you were going to behave this way with regard to those investments, or should we expect that low end or below the low end?","Jim Robo","Yes. Remember Greg, we didn\u2019t add any new projects that really impacted Q1 performance because of economics but we continue to through our development efforts look for further upstream opportunities that would satisfy that forecast that we have outlined in our materials.","Greg Gordon","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon","Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.","Jim Robo","Thanks, Paul. Good morning.","Paul Ridzon","As you look at investment opportunity, you really keeping your own roots across the energy platform. Would you ever look at an LDC?","Jim Robo","Well, a couple of things I'll say about LDC is 1) Is they tend to go up at very high premiums, just hard to make the economics fork on an LDC and then you got to get comfortable with the liability profile associate with an LDC as well.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you. And --.","Jim Robo","They tend to be expensive and we're only interested in doing transactions that create a long term shareholder value.","Paul Ridzon","But on your repowering, is the entire capital program capture 100% of the PTC or I think those pace down to 80?","Jim Robo","I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?","Paul Ridzon","Your capital program fully powering the winter then? Where all those projects did a 100% of the PTC or is the timing?","Jim Robo","Yes. They all get a 100% of the production tax, right, that's correct. The test of the 80, it's an 80-20 test in terms of determining whether or not it's a new turbine to get a 100% of the PTC.","Paul Ridzon","Is that M&A, private rating agencies comfortable enough with the contractiveness of energy resources that it's utility like enough that you don\u2019t need to do any entry down to portfolio?","Armando Pimentel","Yes. We just to be clear, we do not need to do an acquisition to meet the growth prospects and maintain the credit ratings that awe have through our guidance period. Yes.","Jim Robo","Just to be very clear, we will have very strong credit matrix in 2020 even with the growth that we expect out of both FPL and energy resources through 2020.","Paul Ridzon","Great, thank you.","Armando Pimentel","No need to do M&A to rebalance the balance sheet. And I know there's been a lot of investor questions about that. Just to put that to bed, hopefully once and for all.","Paul Ridzon","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jerimiah Booream with UBS.","Jerimiah Booream","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to touch on the economics of build on transfer and development rights on the wind side. Obviously you've had a couple of big announcements recently. How does that flow through the income statement and really what's the kind of near term earnings incremental opportunity that we should think about there?","John Ketchum","Yes. I mean, there is two impacts, there is book and cash. We talked a little bit about cash impacts on the call. We said out of these opportunities, they think about them in two ways, one are development right sales which we put the NPV on a kilowatt basis when you compare to a long term contracted new build at about 20% to 25% and then a build on transfer, you get data and an after-tax NPV kilowatt basis, it's probably about 40% to 50% of the NPV of a long term contracted basis.","So, that's cash. On the book side, obviously you're going to generate again off those sales in those gains with we don\u2019t think the material and would be reflected in our income statement.","Jerimiah Booream","Okay. And then also just more specifically on the commercial industrial opportunity. I mean, how many of the PPAs that you're signing are really more focused on the CNI sphere going forward versus traditional PPAs?","Armando Pimentel","It's Armando. Just let me go back to the previous question just a second and I'll get to that one too. So, I just want to put it in context. We haven\u2019t updated numbers on our pipeline for wind and solar in a while. And I just want everybody to understand we got a lot of development out there. And when we talked a couple of years ago about how we would potentially doubling the amount of G&A that we put into both the wind and the solar business through 2018 and we're doing that.","So, today just in terms of what I call inventory, we've got 10 gigawatts to 12 gigawatts of inventory on its way to 20 gigawatts here in the near future on wind. And we've got about 10 gigawatts of solar that's on its way to 20 here in the near future. So, we got a lot of opportunities out there for projects. So, if once in a while someone's interested in doing some development and it makes sense for us then we've got the inventory to be able to do that.","On the CNI side. CNI gets a lot of press and so on. It's still not a giant portion of the market. It's a market that we've looked at, it's a market we played in, it's a market that we've originated. It is a market that we will probably do more of than we've done in the past in certain regions. But it's also a market that doesn't make sense for us in certain regions where folks are looking for very short term contracts in places where we've got to take a significant amount of merchant risk in the term year.","So, my expectation is it could be 20% of what we do on a go-forward basis but I think the traditional stuff that we've been doing with the IOU, the muni, the COOPs and so on will continue to be the bulk of that business for us.","Jerimiah Booream","Okay that's great. And then just one last one from me. On the legislation in Florida right now on gas reserves, can you just talk about any kind of stumbling blocks there and what -- any kind of material changes would be versus the previous program?","Eric Silagy","Yes, this is Eric. So, it's we're right now in the midst of the legislative session. And so, there are a number of hurdles for that legislation to clear. And so, it's by no means certain that gas reserves legislation would actually clear both houses. So, at this point I think it's just speculative to try to predict what's going to happen because there's a lot of areas that we need to cover lot of water and is be covered within legislative process at this point.","Jerimiah Booream","Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Hi, good morning guys.","Jim Robo","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","This one is to make we together a couple of the names you've already talked about. So, the Xcel model of BOT and some development sales is, do you see the utility market shifting in that direction and this might well was that kind of a one off as you're looking at go forward?","Jim Robo","No, we do not see the market shifting in that direction. And I think that's the point Armando was making just a minute ago. I mean, we continue to see a very strong long term contracted market made up of our typical customers whether its muni's and COOP, CNI. Most investor owned utilities, it is with the build on transfer like we're able to do with Xcel or you could see an opportunity to generate an attractive NPV off of a sale and yet get contracts back from customer who's been a one year largest customers.","Those can be attractive situations. But our core business is going to continue to be the long term contracted business. So, when we look out and we'll lay this out at the June Investor Conference. We really see the market continuing the stay at the levels that's been in the past on the long terms contracted opportunity set aside.","Jonathan Arnold","So, your preference is more to stay in that space. I was just curious whether there was sort of a balance sheet angle that with these changing NPV but you have less on sheet tied up, so maybe that would reduce some of the rationale around the Oncor transaction where you certainly portrayed it at the time, is something that will give you the ability that will max your development activities.","Jim Robo","Jonathan. That market and I know it's got a lot of play here recently. But that rate based market, if you go back historically, year-in year-out, I mean, people have been building rate base on the wind side for the last decade. And it's averaged about 15% of the market. Could it go up a little bit, yes, maybe it'll go up a little bit. But it's a small portion of the overall market.","And so, we don\u2019t although there were some transactions here recently, at least our view right now is then even if it goes up a little bit, it's just not a significant part of the market and if there are people that are interested and we can help them help us with our inventory, then we might look at the transaction. Why not.","John mentioned some economics that are attractive. But I wouldn\u2019t spend honestly that much time thinking about whether would happen during the last three months is turn the market around. The rate base market is just not that large.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. Then I just want to clarify one thing, you talked about a 1000MV transaction at the beginning. I wasn\u2019t sure that was something a new one that hasn\u2019t yet been announced or why you're referring to the Xcel deal?","Jim Robo","Yes. No, the 1000MV is with is the large customer transaction. We just had not previously announced it, the customer had made announcements about the deal.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. But we're talking about the one deal, basically this one.","Jim Robo","One deal, that's correct. One deal.","Jonathan Arnold","Alright, thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Yes guys, just curious, Project Accelerate. Is there any way to quantify what whether the EBITDA or EPS benefits from it would be and which of the businesses kind of more or less impacted by it?","John Ketchum","Yes. I mean, first of all Project Accelerate is an initiative that we've seen on last call, in this will generate several $100 million in run rate savings going forward. We will give more details on it at the June Investor Conference, but it effects all of our businesses. I mean, we are reimagining and all the business at NextEra Energy resources at FPL finding smarter ways to leverage technology and other way other approaches to each of our individual lines.","And we will lay that out including EPS impacts from that at the Investor Conference.","Michael Lapides","But when you say several $100 million, meaning on a pretax income run rate eventually or on a discounted cash flow type of view?","John Ketchum","Yes, on a pretax run rate basis going forward.","Michael Lapides","Got it. I mean, that's pretty material on an after-tax basis that would be a pretty material driver of an EPS uptick over time.","John Ketchum","Yes. But remember that Project Accelerate is included in the expectations that we provided.","Michael Lapides","Got it, okay.","Jim Robo","And the other thing Michael, to remember is FPLs roughly 2\/3rds of the company and you cannot take the several 100 million -- that 2\/3rds of that run rate creates surplus, it doesn't create earnings, okay.","Michael Lapides","Understood.","Jim Robo","And there's got to be very careful about how you think about it from an earning standpoint.","Michael Lapides","Understood. That benefit over time would actually accrue to the customer once you hit the 11\/5\/11\/6 range. Unrelated question. Just curious Jim or Armando for your thoughts on the prospects in the economics of offshore wind in the US?","Jim Robo","So, Michael we have looked at offshore winds, we spent -- I personally spent an enormous amount of time looking at it for a very good customer of ours back when I was running energy resources. And we came away from that effort not being a big fan of offshore wind for several reasons. One is it effectively from a construction standpoint, very hard to get comfortable that you can ever.","It strikes me more is a new nuclear than it does of onshore wind in terms of the construction risk you take. It's marine construction, the ONM associated with it is challenged if the seas are high, you can't you have to fly out to fix the turbines as opposed to get in the boat and go up there to do it. There is an enormous number of hurdles that you need to get to.","And then you get to the biggest hurdle which is just its bad economics for customers. I mean, we've been very proud that we've done good economic renewables for customers and we think onshore wind and onshore solar and frankly solar in New England will be probably a third of the cost of offshore wind. It is really not good for customers to be doing offshore winds relative to onshore solar or onshore wind.","So, to say that we're not fans would be an understatement and I don\u2019t think it's good for customers and frankly I think it's I think it's we certainly wouldn\u2019t do it, we think it's too risky.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciate it, guys.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Roskot. Please go ahead.","Matthew Roskot - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Brendan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2018 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation, on our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com.

Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong financial results in the second quarter and remains on track to meet its objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share grew by approximately 13% against the prior-year comparable quarter, reflecting successful performance of both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.20 year over year. Average regulatory capital employed increased by nearly 13% versus the same quarter last year, and all of our major capital initiatives, including the continuation of one of the largest solar expansions ever in the U.S., remain on track.","With residential bills nearly 30% below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida utilities, FPL's focus continues to be on finding smart investments to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.","At Energy Resources, increased contributions from new investments in our repowered wind projects, together with the lower federal income tax rate, helped drive growth of $0.12 per share for the quarter. Building upon the outstanding origination success with which we started the year, since our first quarter call, we added approximately 1,620 megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog, including 535 megawatts of additional wind repowering opportunities and 90 megawatts of battery storage projects. We were pleased to sign two additional solar-plus-storage projects, including the largest solar-plus-storage project announced in the U.S. to date, further signaling the success we're having in the next phase of renewables deployment that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution to provide a nearly firm generation resource.","This quarter's origination success in both new and repowered projects is reflective of Energy Resources' ability to leverage its competitive advantages to capitalize on what we have previously characterized as the best renewables development period in our history. During the quarter, we announced proposed transactions that would expand NextEra Energy's regulated business operations through the acquisition of Gulf Power, Florida City Gas, and ownership stakes in two natural gas power plants from Southern Company. The assets are an excellent complement to our existing operations within the state of Florida and will allow NextEra to extend its best-in-class customer value proposition to additional customers over time. Earlier this month, we filed for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval to acquire Gulf Power and the two natural gas plants. Subject to obtaining FERC approval and satisfaction of other closing conditions, we expect these transactions to close in the first half of 2019.","Meanwhile, we are pleased to announce that the Florida City Gas acquisition is expected to close early next week. Starting in the third quarter, financial results for FCG will be reported as part of our FPL business segment. We expect the approximately $5.1 billion cash purchase price for the transactions to be financed through the issuance of new debt, which we hedged through the execution of interest rate swaps shortly after the acquisition announcement.","At the closing of the Gulf Power acquisition, we anticipate that S&P and Moody's will make further favorable adjustments to our credit metric thresholds as a result of the expansion of the company's regulated operations, allowing NextEra Energy to continue to preserve our $5 billion to $7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity while maintaining our strong balance sheet and current credit ratings.","With another strong quarter behind us, we are well-positioned to meet our full-year financial expectations, while FPL continues to execute against its capital initiatives, and Energy Resources continues to make very strong progress against its long-term development expectations.","Now let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2018, FPL reported net income of $626 million or $1.32 per share, an increase of $100 million and $0.20 per share respectively year over year. Regulatory capital employed growth of 12.9% was a primary driver of FPL's EPS growth of approximately 18% versus the prior-year comparable quarter. As a result of higher-than-expected base revenues and reduced O&M expenses driven by our continued focus on cost management, our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending June 2018.","We expect FPL to achieve its trailing-12-month target regulatory ROE of 11.6% early in the third quarter, subject to the usual caveats, after which time we will begin partially restoring the reserve amortization balance. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years, creating further customer benefits by potentially avoiding a base rate increase in 2021 and 2022.","Turning to our development efforts, all of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.3 billion in the quarter, and we expect our full-year capital investments to be between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion. Construction on the approximately 1,750-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on budget and on schedule to enter service in mid-2019. Additionally, the approximately 300 megawatts of solar projects being built across FPL's service territory under the Solar Base Rate Adjustment, or SOBRA, mechanism of the settlement agreement remain on track to begin providing cost-effective energy to FPL customers in early 2019. These projects, which are expect to generate more than $40 million in total savings for FPL customers during their operating lifetime, are part of FPL's plans for more than 3,200 megawatts of new solar projects across Florida over the coming years.","Beyond solar, the roughly 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center continues to advance through the development process to support its projected commercial operation date in 2022. We continue to expect that FPL's ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate and regulatory capital employed, net of accumulated deferred income taxes of approximately 9% from the start of the settlement agreement in January 2017 through at least December 2021, while further enhancing our customer value proposition.","The Florida economy remains strong. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in June was 3.8%, down 0.3 percentage points from a year earlier and near the lowest levels in a decade. Within the housing sector, the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 5% from the prior year, and new building permits remain strong, increasing nearly 17% year over year. At the same time, the June rating of Florida's consumer sentiment is near the highest levels in a decade. After multiple years of strong economic growth, the GDP of Florida recently passed $1 trillion, which would make it the 17th-largest economy in the world.","FPL's second quarter retail sales decreased 3.3%, and we estimate that approximately that 5.2% of this decline can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 1.9%. Customer growth and an estimated 1% increase in weather-normalized usage per customer, which is a continuation of the positive trend from the first quarter, both contributed favorably. While we are encouraged by the continued growth in underlying usage, we are not yet ready to draw any firm conclusions about long-term trends. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and will update you on future calls.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $274 million or $0.55 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $408 million or $0.86 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted EPS increased by $0.12 or approximately 16% year over year. New investments added $0.07 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets also increased by $0.07 per share, primarily due to the absence of outages at our Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear facilities and increased PTC volume from our repowered wind projects. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business, including existing pipelines, increased by $0.04 year over year. The reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate also contributed favorably, increasing adjusted EPS by $0.13 compared to 2017.","Offsetting these gains were lower contributions from our customer supply and trading businesses, which declined $0.05 versus a particularly strong second quarter last year. All other impacts reduced results by $0.14 per share, primarily as a result of higher interest and corporate expenses, including increased development activity to support the favorable renewables development environment. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.","As I mentioned earlier, this quarter the Energy Resources development team continued the strong origination success with which we started the year. Since our last earnings call, we have added 300 megawatts of new wind projects, 692 megawatts of new solar projects, and 90 megawatts of new battery storage projects to our renewables backlog. Of these 1,082 megawatts added to backlog, 99 megawatts of the wind projects, 21 megawatts of the solar projects, and a 15-megawatt storage-only project are for delivery this year.","The accompanying chart updates information we provided on last quarter's call, but our overall expectations have not changed. We continue to track against our total development forecast for 2017 through 2020. With a backlog of over 7,400 megawatts, our future wind, solar, and storage development program has never been stronger. To put that into perspective, the current backlog is nearly two times larger than at any time prior to the end of 2016. Included in this quarter's backlog additions are 300 megawatts of solar projects for delivery beyond 2020, which brings Energy Resources' total post-2020 solar backlog to nearly 600 megawatts. These projects are supported by the solar ITC start of construction guidance that the IRS provided last month.","Similar to the guidance that was released for wind in 2016, the new IRS guidance extends the ITC for an additional four-year period, subject to beginning significant physical work or meeting certain safe harbor conditions. Therefore, we now expect that a solar facility that commences construction in 2019 by complying with the safe harbor to procure 5% of the total capital to be invested and achieves commercial operation by the end of 2023 will qualify for the full 30% investment tax credit.","In addition to driving increased solar development into the next decade, the guidance further supports the next phase of renewables deployment that includes a low-cost battery storage component. Battery storage projects that are paired with and charged a minimum of 75% by a solar facility qualify for the ITC during this period. As battery cost declines and efficiency gains are realized during the four-year start of construction period, we continue to expect that in the next decade, new nearly firm wind and solar without incentives will be cheaper than the operating cost of traditional inefficient generation resources, creating significant opportunities for renewables growth going forward. Indicative of customer demand for a nearly firm renewable product specifically designed to meet the customers' needs, the 300 megawatts of solar projects added to backlog for post-2020 delivery will be paired with 75 megawatts of battery storage projects.","During the quarter, we were also pleased to have project-financed our first solar-plus-storage system, providing capital that can be recycled into additional growth opportunities at Energy Resources. As I previously mentioned, since our last earnings call, we added 535 megawatts to our repowering backlog. These five repowering opportunities, which are being pursued under new and existing power purchase agreements, bring our total announced repowerings to roughly 2,850 megawatts.","Our development team is in active negotiations with customers under other existing PPAs to facilitate additional repowering opportunities and based on the progress of these discussions, we now expect to be in the upper half of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion in total capital deployment for repowerings that we have previously outlined for 2017 through 2020. During the quarter, Energy Resources successfully commissioned an approximately 100-megawatt repowering project, and we continue to make solid progress on the remaining 2018 sites.","Beyond renewables, the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline has faced some recent challenges. The 4th Circuit Court issued a stay on the stream and wetland crossing permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for approximately 160 miles of the MVP route in West Virginia. MVP was able to work with the Corps to have a modified 404 nationwide permit issued that we believe addresses the court's concerns. We are hopeful that the 4th Circuit will respond favorably to the modified permit and the Army Corps' request for the stay to be lifted. If construction is able to resume in the affected area shortly, we believe that there will only be a slight delay to the in-service date for the pipeline to the first quarter of 2019. At this time, we do not expect any material financial impacts to Energy Resources as a result of the stay.","Despite these issues, development on the MVP Southgate project, which is the proposed expansion pipeline that will deliver gas from the MVP mainline in Virginia to customers in central North Carolina, continues to progress well. We continue to evaluate the open season interest from additional market participants and expect to file the FERC application later this year to support the targeted in-service date of the fourth quarter 2020.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the second quarter of 2018, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $795 million or $1.64 per share. NextEra Energy's 2018 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1 billion and $2.11 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment decreased $0.07 per share, compared to the second quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of an unfavorable tax ruling related to the disposal of spent nuclear fuel. In total, NextEra Energy's second quarter results reflect a one-time charge of $0.06 as a result of this unfavorable tax ruling.","Based on our strong first half performance at NextEra Energy and our continued expectations for an even stronger second half, with more of our growth expected to occur in the fourth quarter, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full year, and we'll continue to target the $7.70 midpoint of our adjusted EPS range. Longer term, we continue to expect NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021, off our 2018 midpoint expectation of $7.70 per share, and assuming the Gulf Power, Florida City Gas, and natural gas plant transactions closed, that they will be $0.15 and $0.20 accretive to our 2020 and 2021 adjusted EPS expectations, respectively.","As a result, subject to closing the transactions, we expect our 2020 adjusted EPS expectations to be in a range of $8.70 to $9.20, and our 2021 adjusted EPS expectations to be in a range of $9.40 to $9.95 per share. We continue to believe that we have one of the best growth opportunity sets in our industry and will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate range off our expected 2018 base of $7.70 per share, plus the expected accretion from these transactions. We also expect that from 2018 to 2021, operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2020, off a 2017 base of dividends per share of $3.93.","As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.","As I previously discussed, at the anticipated rating agency credit metrics thresholds following the Gulf Power transactions closing, we expect to maintain $5 billion to $7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity through 2021. We will look to utilize the remaining balance sheet capacity to either buy back shares or opportunistically execute on accretive, incremental capital investments or accretive acquisition opportunities if it makes sense to do so. As a reminder, the remaining excess balance sheet capacity serves as a cushion, as its utilization is not currently assumed in our financial expectations.","Earlier this month, we were pleased to mitigate potential interest rate volatility on future NextEra Energy debt issuances by entering into a $3 billion interest rate hedge agreement, which is incremental to the interest rate hedge that was executed for Gulf Power, Florida City Gas, and two natural gas plant acquisitions. Under the agreement, on any date until July 12, 2028, NextEra Energy has the flexibility to effectively enter into a 10-year interest rate swap at a fixed rate of 3.1164% in any amount up to the $3 billion in total. Any unutilized balance as of July 12, 2028, will be cash settled, hedging rates at that time through 2038. We expect that the swap will help NextEra Energy maintain its relative cost-of-capital advantage going forward.","In summary, after a strong start to the year, we remain well-positioned to achieve our $7.70 adjusted EPS target for 2018, as well as our long-term financial expectations. At FPL, we continue to focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition through operational cost-effectiveness and making smart long-term capital investments. This focus, combined with the economic tailwind supporting the Florida economy and the constructive regulatory environment, position us well for continued growth going forward.","At Energy Resources, we maintain significant competitive advantages to capitalize on the increasingly strong market for renewables development. By leveraging these strengths, as well as NextEra Energy's operating model and significant balance sheet capacity, we believe NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned in the sector to drive long-term shareholder value, as we have highlighted with the Gulf Power and Florida City Gas transactions. We remain intensely focused on execution and are as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects.","Let me now turn to NEP. NextEra Energy Partners continued the strong start to 2018 with year-over-year growth in both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 29% and 37%, respectively, reflecting new asset additions during 2017 and outstanding underlying performance of the portfolio. Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.4375 per common unit, or $1.75 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from a year earlier.","Late in the second quarter, NEP closed the sale of its Canadian portfolio of wind and solar projects, generating net proceeds of approximately $573 million U.S., subject to post-closing working capital adjustments. This transaction, which was executed at an attractive 10-year CAFD yield of 6.6%, inclusive of the present value of the O&M origination fee, highlights the underlying value of NEP's renewable assets. We expect to accretively redeploy the proceeds into higher-yielding U.S. acquisitions to support NEP's long-term growth. Additionally, by investing the proceeds into U.S. assets that benefit from a lower effective corporate tax rate and a longer tax yield versus Canada, NEP can retain more cash available for distribution in the future for every $1 invested, which in turn is expected to provide a longer runway for LP distribution growth. We are extremely pleased with the execution of this transaction and look forward to redeploying the proceeds later this year to support NEP's growth expectations.","Let me now review the detailed results for NEP, which reflect outstanding financial performance for the quarter. NEP's second quarter adjusted EBITDA of approximately $253 million increased $57 million from a year earlier. Second quarter cash available for distribution was approximately $150 million, an increase of $31 million from the prior-year comparable quarter. Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD growth of 29% and 37%, respectively, was primarily driven by growth in the underlying portfolio. Contributions from new projects were the principal driver of growth, adding $48 million of adjusted EBITDA and $21 million of cash available for distribution.","Existing projects also contributed favorably to the significant growth in adjusted EBITDA and CAFD, primarily as a result of increased contributions from the Texas pipelines. Cash available for distributions also benefited from the timing of debt service payments due to the senior unsecured notes that were issued in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, since we treat these as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.","As we announced last quarter, from the base of our fourth quarter 2017 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.62, we see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2018 distribution that is payable in February 2019 to be in a range of $1.81 to $1.86 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect the December 31, 2018, run rate for adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion to $1.15 billion and CAFD of $360 million to $400 million, reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2018.","We are pleased with NEP's strong start to 2018. The significant growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are supported by the long-term contracted cash flows, backed by strong counterparty credits of the high-quality underlying portfolio. NEP's flexibility to grow in three ways \u2013 acquiring assets from Energy Resources, organically, or acquiring assets from other third parties \u2013 provides clear visibility to support its growth going forward.","With what we view as the best renewables development period in our history, as reflected by the outstanding origination success that Energy Resources continues to have, NEP's already best-in-class distribution growth visibility will further improve over the coming years. Additionally, NEP's cost of capital and access to capital advantages provide substantial flexibility to finance its long-term growth without a need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest, other than modest at-the-market issuances. These strengths, combined with NEP's favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights, help provide a best-in-class investor value proposition and leave NEP well-positioned to meet its long-term financial expectations. For these reasons, NEP is as well-positioned as it's ever been, and we look forward to continued strong performance going forward.","That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, everyone. It's Josephine here. Hope you're all well.","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Hey, Josephine. How are you?","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good. So of course the recent ITC is clearly a huge positive. But could you guys discuss the implications for SoBRA at FPL and the timing on the regulatory filings? And then maybe also on NEER, is there a potential for a shift of demand out of 2019, into the early 2020s given the greater latitude from the safe harboring?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So with respect to the filings for FPL, remember with the SoBRA mechanism, we have the ability to construct up to 300 megawatts a year. And then anything that is under 75 megawatts does not fall under the purview of the siting act. Does that answer your question, Jolene (sic) [Josephine], on that piece?","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah -","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","And I'm sorry, your second question -","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, NEER.","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Go ahead.","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So is there a possibility for some demand shift out of 2019 into the early 2020s?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Well \u2013 you mean with regard to solar? Yeah. So with the ITC extension that we see, obviously that really positions the company well for continued growth, not only this decade but well into the next decade. So we are actively developing our safe harbor plans for 2019, which will continue to support our growth through 2023 on the solar side. But, as you can see from our results on our origination efforts this quarter, we continue to see very strong interest in solar, particularly when we combine it with a storage option. That has been a very attractive product for our customers. So while you may see a bit of a step function like what we've seen in wind as you move well into the next decade, we don't anticipate any material drop-off in demand for solar or solar-plus-storage installations through the end of this decade.","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Great. And then on the Gulf Power acquisition, do you think that there's a possibility to bring Gulf Power closer to the regulatory metrics \u2013 i.e., equity ratio, ROEs, reserve amortization \u2013 enjoyed by FPL?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Our plan is to operate Gulf under the terms and conditions of its current settlement agreement. And that is what is included in our base case and what we said on our last call, with our expectations to be able to grow Gulf, Florida City Gas, and the two gas plants on a combined basis at roughly 16%, which is the high end of our expectations for adjusted EPS growth for NextEra Energy from 2018 through 2021.","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So any such changes would then be incremental to the accretion numbers we're seeing right now?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Any changes would be incremental, but again our base case is to operate under the current settlement agreement that's in place for Gulf.","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then just one last question. Could we get an update on Project Accelerate and how that's tracking and outlook for 2019?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So as we said at the Analyst Day in 2017, that was an opportunity to generate roughly $425 million of run rate savings beginning in 2019. The project continues to progress extremely well. And we continue to look for even further O&M savings opportunities across the business. We're only getting started. There are a number of opportunities for us to continue to drive cost savings across the business by leveraging technologies and applying smarter approaches to how we conduct our business. And so the company is constantly engaged on a mission of continuously improving our cost structure. And so Project Accelerate 1 is only the beginning.","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Great. Well, that's all for me. Thank you very much.","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning and congratulations on the good results.","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Oh, thank you, Stephen.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Wanted to just follow up on storage. You had provided some good commentary in your prepared remarks around storage. But just stepping back, I know you, at your analyst event, laid out your trajectory on where you see costs going. I guess we continue to get surprised just by how cheap storage is becoming, but I'm just curious from what you're seeing out in the marketplace for storage, is the trajectory at all surprising to you in terms of the cost reductions? Where can it head from here? What's your general outlook on where costs may go for storage?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, the way I think about it, Stephen, is how we've been pricing it into our PPAs. I mean, roughly on transactions we've done over the last six to 12 months, you can think of it as roughly $0.015 a kilowatt hour. That is probably going to move, with what we see with the significant investment being made in electric vehicles and the cost declines that we expect to see on the solar side. Early in the next decade, mid-next decade, it's going to probably be about $0.005 a kilowatt hour add, maybe $0.01, but probably closer to about $0.005. And so if we find ourselves in a marketplace where we are selling wind right around $0.02, I mean, a combined wind and solar product probably looks roughly around $0.025. Solar, into the next decade, probably looks more like a $0.03 product, sub-$0.03 in some markets. You add half a penny on that on the high end, you're probably at about $ 0.035 a kilowatt hour. Depends on the market and land costs.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's really helpful.","James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Hey, Stephen. This is Jim. I just wanted to add something to what John said. So we've been doing some work recently on thinking about what is firm. And that's a little bit of an existential question, and it depends on obviously the size of the market and kind of the individual characteristics of the generation in those markets. But our thinking is for the first 5 gigawatts in the country, firm \u2013 a two-hour battery is probably firm for the first five gigawatts of battery penetration, maybe three hours. It depends again on the characteristics of the site. And then, as you get to penetration levels of 15% in the country, we see firm battery storage of four hours is about right to really make it firm and make it look a lot like a peaker. So there's a lot of work that we're doing, kind of pushing the ball forward on how we think about \u2013 because it's not just what the cost is. It's also what the application is, and how you use the storage, and also the streams of value that you can put against it. That's just the capacity value. And obviously there's a bunch of other streams of value that essentially buy down the cost of that battery relative to making it, quote-unquote, \"firm\" in a system context. So a lot of really interesting work that's going on right now, and we're right at the beginning of, I think, a real revolution in this country in terms of how electricity is \u2013 how storage interacts with electricity on the grid, and how we're going to start delivering much different, firm, renewable products to our customers going forward.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, that's really helpful, Jim and John. And maybe, Jim, just adding to that, you've talked in the past about the combination of wind and solar and storage and sort of the \u2013 I guess I'd call it the unique big-data capabilities you have to have and understanding how those three products work together. Is that something you still view as a competitive advantage? Do you see new entrants there? What's the real sort of barriers to entry around being able to master the combination of those three things?","James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.","I think there's an enormous amount of intellectual work that's going on, intellectual content that's going on, around that. And big data is just a part of it. But we have a lot of capabilities in that area. Literally, have now hundreds of data scientists working on several big data applications in our business. I've been talking about how obviously providing firm renewables is one activity where you really need big data to understand how to do that. The other, honestly, is wind O&M and availability, and a third is grid ops. And we have folks working on all three of those things and are generating new ideas and new applications every day. And so it's actually one of the really exciting pieces of what we're doing now with Project Accelerate, and really the second phase of Project Accelerate that we launched this year was a big focus on artificial intelligence and big data.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very good. I'll let others speak. Thanks so much.","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Stephen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, guys. It's actually Durgesh on for Greg. How are you?","James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Good. How are you, Durgesh?","Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC","Good. Just two quick follow-ups. We had a few questions on storage, but you guys have given a very detailed overview, so I'm not going to bog you down for that. On the MVP pipeline, just to clarify, are you saying that with \u2013 given what you're seeing, you still think that you can bring that into service by Q1 2019. Did I hear that correctly?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","You did.","Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then your share of investment in that pipeline is $1 billion, correct?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","$1.1 billion.","Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC","And just one quick 1B and maybe I missed this, the income tax rule, the unfavorable income tax rule that was driving corporate (41:45) unfavorable this quarter. What was that again?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","I'm sorry. Say that again, Durgesh.","Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC","So there was a \u2013 you'd mentioned in your commentary -","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Oh, yeah. The 172(f) court ruling. So we had an adverse court decision under Internal Revenue Code Section 172(f), which basically allows us to carry back net operating losses on decommissioning costs for nuclear plants back to the date when the nuclear plant was first put into service. And we took the position that spent nuclear fuel disposal fees that we have been paying to the DOE would qualify under that unlimited carryback provision. We did not prevail on that position.","Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC","I see. So you've taken that \u2013 basically have trued up that charge. Is that truly one-time?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","That is one-time. It's $0.06. And obviously had that $0.06 not occurred, what was a strong quarter would have been even a stronger quarter.","Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC","Awesome. Thanks again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Apologize. I jumped in a little bit late here. I just want to confirm on sort of the rate proceeding comments. With the reserve amortization, you expect to stay out of a rate case at FP&L through 2022. Is that correct?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yes, the potential is to stay out up to 2022.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then assuming you hit your regulatory ROE by the third quarter, can you just \u2013 what's the reserve balance by year-end?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Shar, we haven't said, but obviously that reserve balance starts to reverse, creating a surplus position. And our view is that we would have sufficient surplus by the end of 2020 to stay out potentially up to one to two years through 2022.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then just on Gulf Power, so you're going to support the settlement that's out there. And then is it fair to assume, following the tenor of the settlement, you'll likely file a GRC to at least true up sort of the regulatory construct and sort of the ROEs that you're afforded at FP&L at Gulf Power?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Our focus right now is closing the transaction and moving forward and applying the FPL operating model to Gulf within the confines of Gulf's current settlement agreement. So no plans right now to revisit any of the terms or conditions in the Gulf settlement agreement.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And then just lastly, on your $7 billion of borrowing capacity, can you just provide maybe a little bit more context on sort of what could be interesting as you sort of think about the opportunity set out there? Has additional midstream opportunities sort of opened up around the Midwest\/Southeast region that could provide some of that source or more electric opportunities, co-ops, or \u2013 I guess what seems to be interesting as you guys are looking out there?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Well, the focus is going to continue to be on regulated M&A, not on midstream opportunities. And so, when we think about regulated M&A, the first thing we think about is constructive regulatory jurisdictions. The second thing we think about is the opportunity to really derive value and apply the FPL playbook through generation modernization, the ability to operate the business efficiently. And when you look at all of those things and you put those things together in particularly regulatory environments, the targets would be in the Midwest and in the Southeast as being the most attractive alternatives for us.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks so much, guys.","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yep. Thanks, Shar.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Pardon me. Michael?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Just curious \u2013 sorry. Where do you see returns being better? Meaning, is there a significant difference at all in the returns for repowered wind projects versus new-builds? And also, when you're doing a repowering, are you usually contracting back to the existing counterparty that had the original contract, or is this a, kind of, open up to market and whoever comes to the table type of environment?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So, first of all, the returns are a little better, right? Because we're typically blending and extending the contract. You're restarting the PTC clock, but you're making half the capital investment that you would typically have to make in a new-build scenario. And in terms of contracting, we're always trying to work with the existing counterparty.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","A follow-up for utility-scale solar development in the U.S. just in general. What states, or what parts of the country, where currently there isn't a lot of utility scale solar kind of on the ground operating are you starting to get more and more customer or client interest in potential new development over the next three to five years? Like where are kind of the new opportunity sets geographically starting to pop up where they haven't really been before?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","I'll turn that over to Armando.","Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Hey, Michael; it's Armando. Honestly, it's popping up everywhere. I know you're looking for something more specific. It's easy to say that there are many more opportunities outside the West and the Southwest U.S. than there were just a couple years ago, but I can't really point you to one specific place. We're seeing a lot of activity in the Southeast. We're seeing actually a lot of activity in the Upper Midwest. And we're seeing a lot of activity up in the Northeast. So all places that that we've been investing in probably for the last couple years in terms of land and interconnects and so on. I mean, places where we feel that we can enter into long-term off-take agreements also.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. This is Maheep on behalf of Michael Weinstein. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on NextEra's $5 billion to $7 billion borrowing capacity, could you talk about if the Moody's recent sector downgrade has affected your view on the borrowing capacity?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","No. it has not.","Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And just as a follow-up, do you expect a breathing period as you integrate Gulf Power and Florida City Gas (49:40) into the core business, or when can we expect more M&A announcements going forwards?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. It's going to be opportunistic. But again, Gulf will be run as a separate business from FPL.","Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And just a question on NextEra Energy Partners. The Canada asset sale closed a month ago. So how far are you along, job done (50:11) to recycle capital into the U.S. assets? Is it kind a Q3 event or Q4 event? How should we think about that?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","I wouldn't want to specify or lock down a quarter, but obviously it's something that we continue to spend a significant amount of time evaluating, and we'll make further announcements coming forward.","Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And just one last question from me. On the solar safe harboring, how should we think about \u2013 to safe harbor, like we have some guidance around wind, where you safe harbor multi-gigawatts of turbines to capture the tax credits. Should we think about sort of in the same line or the same lines for NextEra Energy Resources?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. No, absolutely. I mean, we will engage in an active safe harbor program, just as we did for wind. And I think the fact that we have a strong balance sheet with significant capital resources is just one more competitive advantage as you think about the ability to actively exercise our position in the safe harbor program.","Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. As the focus here recently has clearly shifted to the solar side of the business, I wanted to circle back on your latest thoughts on the wind market origination of non-repowered assets versus repowering itself and kind of how things are maybe trending versus your expectations a year ago on total number of megawatts, returns, capital deployment, et cetera.","James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.","So, you've \u2013 I mean, I think that's right. It seems like analysts and investors want to talk more about solar and storage than wind. But the fact is we're going to build, we're going to originate, and we're going to build a heck of a lot more wind from now through the end of the decade, through the end of 2020, than on the solar side. I think what's happened on the solar side is exciting, especially when you see what prices are doing in 2020 and beyond. And the fact that there's been an extension of the investment tax credit through 2023, I think it's terrific for that market. But the fact is that wind is still much cheaper than solar in many of the states up and down the Midwest, where utilities, munis, co-ops, and even the C&I sector is looking for cheap, long-term power output. And wind remains really our staple product in order to deliver to those folks that are looking for really low energy prices. So my expectation is that we're going to originate and we're going to build a lot of wind through 2020, and even as the PTC starts phasing down that you're going to see us build a lot of wind in the next decade.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Excellent. And then my only other question was a follow-up on the FPL reg amortization and the tax strategy there. I know the tax docket's open. Can you give us a sense of the next steps to expect from you in that process?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Again, I think the fact that we were able to apply our surplus against the Irma storm surcharge was a way to accelerate the return of tax savings back to Florida customers, and I think has been well-received. I think that strategy \u2013 I commend the FPL team for the thinking there. And I think we're very well-positioned heading into hearings, which are going to occur in February 2019.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations on the strong quarter. John, can you provide -","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Abe.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No problem. Can you provide a bit more detail on the base revenue, cost management line item at FPL, and should we expect an uplift of that size in future quarters?","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Yeah, so with regard to base revenues, we have benefited from stronger weather during the period. And from an O&M standpoint, I mean, that really rolls right into Project Accelerate, which we've talked a little bit about. But all the opportunity that we have with Accelerate 1 with the $425 million of run rate savings on O&M, a good part of that being over at FPL, and then the Accelerate 2 initiatives that Jim described and the ability to not only leverage automation and looking at AI, looking at machine learning, looking at better, more cost-efficient ways to continue to run our business. So I would expect to continue to see very strong execution on O&M reductions for FPL going forward.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. My other questions were answered already.","John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks so much. Can you guys talk about lead times for energy storage sales and then also the pass-through of commodities from suppliers on those storage sales and how much exposure you have on that?","James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.","So your first question was lead time for storage sales. The lead time is actually fairly long. So we're responding, we have been responding, and we continue to respond to requests for folks that are looking at \u2013 most of the current requests, it's folks who are looking for storage products in the 2021 and 2022 time periods. So that doesn't surprise us. That is a little longer, but not much longer than the sales time that you're seeing for solar, which has always been longer than wind. And the primary reason for that is the cost curve for storage and solar is dropping a little bit faster \u2013 not much faster but a little bit faster \u2013 than it is for wind. And folks are looking \u2013 they're weighing the opportunity that they need the storage, with the fact that price may be a little cheaper if you just wait another year. So we're having good results right now in the 2021 and 2022 time periods for both solar and storage. And wind has always been a much nearer product, and we're responding primarily on wind with 2019 and 2020 opportunities.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","And then the commodity exposure within the sale pricing?","James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.","I think in the near term \u2013 so there's been certainly a lot of discussion about cobalt in particular, which is obviously in the chemistry of the batteries. And in the near term, there might be some cobalt price pressures and so on. We're taking a little longer look in the next couple years simply because we expect a battery market, energy storage market, in the next couple years, but we really expect it to be something in the next decade. And we continue to believe that all of these little blips \u2013 whether it's cobalt or some other chemistry \u2013 all of these little blips will get taken care of, and battery cost curves will just continue to come down.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just on the solar procurement side, obviously the safe harbor clarification \u2013 it hasn't been too long since that's come about. But how much more procurement are you going to need to do to get your safe harbor volumes to the levels that you want over the next couple of quarters next year? Are you pretty much there at this point, or do you have a fair amount of contracting left to do?","James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.","So we'll have more to say on that as the year pans out and early next year. Obviously we have time to figure out what our strategy is through 2023. So I think it's a little early to determine exactly what our additional resource or CapEx needs are going to be. But as John indicated a couple of minutes ago, we are in a terrific position to be able to take advantage of the safe harboring for solar, and we will take advantage of it. It's just a little early to talk about what that means.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","All right. Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","This concludes our question and answer session.

As John will detail later in the call, 2018 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. By successfully executing on our plans at both FPL and Energy Resources, NextEra Energy was able to achieve our target 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70, an increase of approximately 15% over our 2017 results. ","Dating back to 2005, we\u2019ve now delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of over 8.5% which is the highest among all top ten power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of roughly 3% over the same period. ","We delivered a total shareholder return of over 14% in 2018, outperforming the S&P 500 by nearly 19% and the S&P 500 Utilities Index by more than 10%. Since 2005, we have outperformed 86% of the S&P 500 and 100% of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index while continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one, three, five, seven and ten year basis. ","We are once again honored to be named for the 12th time in 13 years number one in the Electric and Gas Utilities Industry on Fortune\u2019s list of world\u2019s most admired companies and to be among the top 25 of Fortune\u2019s 2018 Change The World list. ","During 2018, FPL successfully executed on its ongoing capital plan including the continuation of one of the largest solar expansions ever in the U.S. and achieved its O&M efficiency targets to further improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition. ","As a result of continued smart investments to benefit our customers, FPL\u2019s typical residential bill is more than 30% below the national average, the lowest of all 54 electric providers in the State of Florida and nearly 10% below the level it was in 2006. ","In addition to low bills, FPL delivered its best ever service reliability performance in 2018 and was recognized for the third time in four years as being the most reliable electric utility of the nation. Throughout the year, we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities across the country in the recovery from natural disasters and we remain grateful for the support that others have given us over the years.","After a nearly ten year process, last month FPL closed on the purchase of the City of Vero Beach's municipal electric system. We look forward to extending FPL\u2019s value proposition to Vero Beach\u2019s approximately 35,000 customers while also generating significant long-term savings for FPL\u2019s existing customers. ","The benefit to both new and existing customers is reflective of FPL\u2019s collaborative efforts with city, local and regional leaders, as well as other state authorities to find the best outcome for all stakeholders. ","Earlier this month, we were pleased to close on the purchase of Gulf Power and excited to welcome our new colleagues to the NextEra Energy family. We\u2019ve now successfully completed all three transactions with Southern Company that we announced in the middle of last year. ","The acquisitions are an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expand NextEra Energy\u2019s regulated business mix through the addition of attractive electric and natural gas franchises. By executing on the same long-term strategy that we deployed at FPL, we expect the acquisitions to benefit customers, shareholders and the Florida economy. ","The Energy Resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2018. The renewable origination success was particularly strong as the team added approximately 6500 megawatts including storage and repowering to our backlog over the past year. This represents the most successful origination year in our history and is nearly twice as many megawatts as we originated in 2017 our prior record year. ","Our ongoing renewable origination success results from operating in what we believe to be the best renewable development environment in our history and our ability to leverage Energy Resource\u2019s competitive advantages. ","These competitive advantages include our best-in-class development skills, strong customer relationships, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, strong access to in cost of capital advantages and the ability to combine wind, solar and battery storage and to integrate its [indiscernible] low cost products. ","During the year, we were pleased to receive the IRS start of construction guidance on the Solar ITC which we believe positions us well for substantial solar and storage growth well into the next decades. In 2018, more than 40% of the solar projects that were added to our backlog included a battery storage component highlighting the beginning of the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution. ","With continued technology improvements and cost declines, we expect that without incentives wind is going to be a $0.02 to $0.025 per kilowatt hour product and solar is going to be a $0.025 to $0.03 per kilowatt hour product early in the next decade. ","Combining these extremely low costs with the one half to three quarter cent adder for a four hour storage system will create a [indiscernible] renewable generation resource that is cheaper than the operating cost of coal, nuclear and [lesser] [ph] fuel-efficient oil and gas-fired generation units. ","We continue to believe that this will be massively disruptive to the nation\u2019s generation fleet and create significant opportunities for renewable growth well into the next decade. Consistent with our focus on growing our rate regulated and long-term contracted business operations, during the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy Transmission announced an agreement to acquire Trans Bay Cable, a 53 mile, high-voltage direct current underwater transmission cable system with utility rates set by FERC which provides approximately 40% of San Francisco\u2019s daily electric power needs. ","Subject to regulatory approval, the approximately $1 billion acquisition including the assumption of debt is expected to close later this year and to be immediately accretive to earnings. The proposed acquisition, combined with the Mid-Continent independent system operator selection of NextEra Energy Transmission to develop the approximately 20 mile, single circuit 500 KV Hartburg-Sabine Junction transmission line in East Texas furthers our goal of creating America\u2019s leading competitive transmission company. ","In addition to successfully growing our regulated operations both organically and through acquisitions during 2018, we further strengthened Energy Resources\u2019 existing portfolio during the year. In December, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection selected approximately 20% of the Seabrook nuclear plant\u2019s generation and 80 megawatts of new solar projects which are not yet included in our backlog for long-term contracts. ","By operating one of the top performing nuclear plants in the nation, Energy Resources expects to provide significant amounts of carbon-free energy at prices generally in line with current forward curves while generating attractive shareholder returns. As a result, Seabrook\u2019s contract pricing is expected to be roughly 50% lower than the cost of offshore wind generating significant savings for Connecticut customers over the eight year contract term. ","The Seabrook award complements Energy Resources\u2019 exit of the merchant business which we began back in 2011 and essentially completed in 2016 with the sale of our Forney, Lamar and Marcus Hook natural gas generation assets. Excluding Seabrook, the remaining merchant generation assets contribute less than 1% of NextEra Energy\u2019s consolidated adjusted EBITDA. ","Going forward, we expect this contribution to decline as the focus remains on regulated and long-term contracted opportunities in renewables, natural gas pipelines and regulated transmission. ","As always, we will continue to opportunistically evaluate recycling capital through sales of non-strategic assets in our portfolio including the remaining fossil generation assets to fund the additional growth of the long-term contracted businesses. ","As a result of increasing the expected adjusted earnings contribution from rate regulated businesses to 70% and the steps that we have taken to further de-risk the Energy Resources portfolio, S&P announced earlier this month that they have revised the reassessment of NextEra Energy\u2019s business-rich profile upward from strong to excellent. ","As a result of this improvement, S&P reduced NextEra Energy\u2019s FFO-to-debt downgrade threshold from 23% to 21%. This follows Moody\u2019s announcement last year that with the expansion of the company\u2019s regulated operations to roughly 70% following the Gulf Power transaction, NextEra Energy\u2019s CFO pre-working capital-to-debt downgrade threshold would be reduced from 20% to 18%. ","At these revised rating agency thresholds and following some utilization of balance sheet capacity for t he Trans Bay Transmission acquisition, we now expect to maintain $4 billion to $6 billion of excess balance sheet capacity through 2021. While we have multiple alternatives for utilization, we expect to use approximately $2 billion of this capacity in the near-term to support additional regulated capital investments at FPL. ","Consistent with the significant incremental smart investment opportunities that exist at FPL, last week, we announced FPL\u2019s groundbreaking 30-by-30 plan to install more than 30 million solar panels by 2030 resulting in an incremental 10,000 megawatts of solar projects versus what is in operation in FPL today. ","We will give further details on these and other potential investments which are mostly expected to help maintain on a long-term adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate beyond 2021 at our investor conference which we plan to hold on June 20 in New York City. ","Following the strong results from 2018, I continue to believe that we have one of the best organic opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry. I remain as enthusiastic as ever about our long-term prospects and based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we were not able to deliver financial results at or near the top-end of our 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate range in 2021, plus the expected deal accretion from the Florida transactions while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. ","Let me now turn to NEP which also had a terrific year of execution in 2018. As John will describe later in the call, NEP successfully delivered on its growth objectives for adjusted EBITDA, CAFD and LP distributions. During the year, we recycled the proceeds from the sale of NEP\u2019s Canadian portfolio into a higher yielding U.S. portfolio that benefits from a more favorable tax position. ","As a result of this accretive transaction, NEP extended its expectations for 12% to 15% per year DPU growth by one additional year to 2023. The 1.4 gigawatt renewable portfolio that was acquired from Energy Resources further enhanced the diversity of NEP\u2019s existing portfolio and was financed through a combination of the Canadian asset sale proceeds and a $750 million convertible equity portfolio financing with Blackrock.","The financing demonstrates NEP\u2019s ability to access additional low-cost sources of capital to finance its growth and with the right to convert a minimum of 70% of the portfolio financing into NEP units issued at no discount, the transaction further reduces NEP\u2019s equity needs going forward. ","NEP grew the LP distribution by 15% year-over-year and delivered a total unitholder return of approximately 4% in 2018 which is on the heels of a total unitholder return of over 75% the year prior. NEP outperformed both the S&P 500 and the other YieldCos by 7% on average and its total unitholder return was more than 15% higher than the Alerian MLP Index. ","I continue to believe that the combination of NEP\u2019s growth visibility along with its flexibility to finance that growth offer unitholders an attractive \u2013 offer unitholders an attractive investor value proposition. For these reasons, NEP is well-positioned to continue executing on its growth objectives and delivering strong performance going forward. ","Before turning the call over to John, I\u2019d like to announce some important organizational changes. Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources and President and a member of the Board of Directors of NextEra Energy Partners will retire from each of his positions on March 1st of this year as part of a planned leadership succession process that began when Armando shared his plans with me more than a year ago. ","John Ketchum currently Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy will replace Armando as President and Chief Executive Officer at NextEra Energy Resources. As part of John\u2019s new responsibilities, he will continue to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of NEP and will be appointed President of NextEra Energy Partners. ","Rebecca Kujawa, currently Vice President Business Management NextEra Energy Resources will succeed John as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy. Rebecca will also become a member of the Board of Directors of NEP. Each of these changes will become effective on March 1st of this year. ","Armando has been an enormous contributor to NextEra Energy\u2019s success during his more than ten years with the company helping to build an industry-leading business during his tenure as CEO of Energy Resources. His leadership, commercial judgment, financial discipline have all guided Energy Resources through a period of truly unprecedented growth in financial success. Armando\u2019s contributions set the company on a path to become what it is today, the world\u2019s leading renewable energy company. He has been a great friend, colleague and a truly valued counselor to me personally and it\u2019s an understatement to say I\u2019ll miss him. But I am also excited for Armando and what will come next for him and his family in retirement. ","With regard to John\u2019s promotion, I have had the chance to work closely with John for more than 16 years as he has successfully progressed through a variety of different roles in our company. We are fortunate to have a person of his capability, vision and experience. ","He is an exceptional leader who has emerged as one of the premier CFOs in our sector and I have tremendous faith that John is the ideal successor to lead the Energy Resources team into the future due to a strong financial acumen, knowledge of the sector and passion for building a world leading-energy company. ","Likewise, Rebecca has distinguished herself as well-rounded executive with a proven track record of execution, outstanding finance and commercial skills and an unparalleled understanding of NextEra Energy enterprise. ","She has been instrumental and helping Armando lead Energy Resources and develop our strategy for NEP over the last several years and her innovative analytical and strategic mindset will serve us well in her new role. I am very happy to have Rebecca as our new Chief Financial Officer. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Armando who would like to make some closing remarks. ","Armando Pimentel","Thank you, Jim. First I want to thank Jim for providing me the opportunity to lead Energy Resources for the last seven-and-a half years and I want to thank those of you on the phone today who I have had the privilege of meeting and interacting with since I began at NextEra Energy in 2008. ","I thank you for the interactive dialogue and the opportunity to continue to tell our story and today there is no doubt that Energy Resources is not only the largest developer, operator and owner of renewable energy in the world, but also it\u2019s most profitable and innovative. And as I tell our employees and customers, I believe we are just getting started. ","I strongly believe that the renewable energy opportunity is actually just beginning. The combination of energy storage with wind and solar is a revolution which will expand the opportunities for renewable and is very exciting. I am profoundly comfortable in the continued success of Energy Resources, NextEra Energy Partners and NextEra Energy. ","I want to thank all of our employees at NextEra Energy for providing me the opportunity to work alongside them. I have learned and lacked much over the years and will miss the innovative, fast-pace environment in which we work. I have no concrete plans as of now, but I am excited about pursuing new adventures and honing old skills. ","At the very least retirement will allow me to pursue one of my great passions, fishing. Thanks again to all of you who have helped guide me and our company successfully over the years. Our company is in terrific shape and I congratulate and applaud John and Rebecca on their new roles, well deserved. I will now turn the call over to John. ","John Ketchum","Thank you, Armando and Jim. Let\u2019s now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2018, FPL reported net income of $407 million or $0.85 per share, up $0.01 per share, compared to FPL\u2019s adjusted earnings in the prior year period. ","For the full year 2018, FPL reported net income of $2.2 billion or $4.55 per share, an increase of $0.46 per share versus FPL\u2019s adjusted earnings in 2017. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 12.4% for 2018 and was a principal driver of FPL's adjusted net income growth of 12.5% for the full year. ","FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter bringing its full year investments to a total of roughly $5.1 billion. FPL\u2019s reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, which is at the upper-end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. ","During the fourth quarter we restored an additional $240 million of reserve amortization leaving FPL with a year-end 2018 balance of $541 million. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years creating further customer benefits by potentially avoiding a base rate increase in 2021 and perhaps 2022. ","Before moving on, let me now take a moment to update you on some of our key capital initiatives at FPL. During 2018, FPL completed construction on schedule and on budget for the first eight 74.5 megawatt solar energy centers developed under the solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement. ","In 2018, we also deployed the first two projects under FPL\u2019s 50 megawatt battery storage pilot program pairing battery systems with existing solar projects and highlighting FPL\u2019s innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of its clean energy solutions for customers. The next 300 megawatts of solar projects being built under the SoBRA mechanism remain on budget and on track to begin providing cost-effective energy to FPL customers in early 2019. ","To support the significant solar expansion that FPL is leading across Florida, we have secured sites that could potentially support more than 7 gigawatts of future projects. Beyond solar, construction on the approximately 1750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on budget and on schedule to enter service in the middle of this year.","Additionally, the roughly 1200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center received Siting Board approval during the quarter to support its projected commercial operation date in 2022. We continue to expect that FPL\u2019s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate and regulatory capital employed, net of accumulated deferred income taxes of approximately 9% from the start of the settlement agreement in January 2017 through at least December 2021, while further enhancing our customer value proposition. ","The economy in Florida remains healthy. The current unemployment rate of 3.3% remains below the national average and at the lowest levels in a decade. Florida\u2019s consumer confidence level remains near ten year highs. The real estate sector also continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at healthy levels and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida home price is up 4.8% from the prior year. ","FPL\u2019s fourth quarter retail sales increased 4% from the prior year comparable period. We estimate that weather-related usage per customer contributed approximately 0.6% to this amount. On a weather-normalized basis, fourth quarter sales increased 3.4% with positive contributions from both weather-normalized usage per customer and ongoing customer growth including the addition of Vero Beach\u2019s customers. ","For 2018, we estimate that FPL\u2019s retail sales on a weather-normalized basis increased by 2.6%. Continued customer growth and an estimated 1.7% increase and weather-normalized usage per customer both contributed favorably. ","While we are encouraged by the growth in underlying usage in 2018, which was a consistent benefit during all four quarters as we have often discussed, this measure can be volatile and we are not yet ready to draw any firm conclusions about long-term trends. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and will update you on future calls. ","Let me now turn to Energy Resources which reported fourth quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $263 million or $0.55 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $317 million or $0.66 per share. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $4.66 billion or $9.75 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.46 billion or $3.05 per share. ","In the fourth quarter, Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.18 from the prior year comparable period. Positive contributions from new investments, customer supply and trading, our gas infrastructure business, including existing pipelines and the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate, all supported the strong year-over-year growth. ","These favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our existing generation assets as a result of particularly poor fleet-wide wind resource which was the lowest fourth quarter on record over the last 30 years and higher interest and corporate expenses due to growth in the business. ","Energy Resources\u2019 full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.45 or approximately 17% versus 2017. For the full year contributions from the new investments declined by $0.04 per share due in part to the expected smaller than usual 2017 renewable build. ","In 2019 and beyond, we expect meaningful growth from new investments as we continue to execute on our renewables development backlog. Increased PTC volume from the approximately 1600 megawatts of repowered wind projects that were commissioned in 2017 helped increase contributions from existing generation assets by $0.10 per share. ","Contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines increased by $0.17 per share year-over-year. As expected, the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate was accretive to Energy Resources increasing adjusted EPS by $0.45 compared to 2017. ","All other impacts reduced results by $0.23 per share, primarily as a result of higher interest and corporate expenses driven largely by increased development activity to support the favorable renewables development environment. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. ","In 2018, Energy Resources continue to advance its position as a leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects commissioning nearly 2700 megawatts of renewable projects in the U.S. including an additional 900 megawatts of repowered wind. ","Since the last call, we have added 1791 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog including 680 megawatts of wind, 797 megawatts of solar and 215 megawatts of battery storage, all of which will be paired with new solar projects. ","Included in the solar megawatts, we added to backlog this quarter is a 150 megawatt solar build own transfer project with a 10 year O&M agreement that will allow the customer to leverage Energy Resources\u2019 best-in-class operating skills while providing meaningful ongoing revenue through the contract term. ","During the quarter, Energy Resources signed an additional 99 megawatts of wind repowering and successfully commissioned approximately 600 megawatts of repowering projects. For 2017 and 2018, this brings the total repowering projects placed in service to roughly 2500 megawatts near the top-end of the previously outlined range for this period. ","We continue to expect to be on the upper half of $2.5 billion to $3 billion in total capital deployment for repowerings for 2017 through 2020. Following the record origination year in 2018, it was nearly two years remaining in the development period, we are now within the previously outlined 2017 to 2020 ranges for U.S. wind, solar and wind repowering. ","For the post-2020 period, our backlog has already nearly 2000 megawatts placing us well ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage. The accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands. ","Beyond renewables we completed construction of approximately 175 miles of the Mountain Valley pipeline during 2018. As planned, MVP is continuing with its scale-back construction efforts for the winter. ","While we continue to target our previously announced full-in service state for the pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2019 and revised overall project cost estimate of $4.6 billion, we also continue to work through the project\u2019s outstanding legal challenges and to closely monitor developments related to the Atlanta Coast pipeline and the current government shutdown as the outcome of any one of these issues could impact MVP\u2019s project schedule and cost estimates. ","We also continue to evaluate mitigation alternatives to address potential adverse outcomes should they arise. MVP\u2019s expected annual contribution to NextEra Energy\u2019s ongoing adjusted EPS is approximately $0.07 to $0.09. We did not expect any material adjusted earnings impacts nor any change in NextEra Energy\u2019s financial expectations as a result of the ongoing challenges. We will provide further updates as those proceedings evolve.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy for the fourth quarter of 2018 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $422 million or $0.88 per share. NextEra Energy\u2019s 2018 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $718 million or $1.49 per share respectively. For the full year 2018, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $6.64 billion or $13.88 per share.","Adjusted earnings were $3.67 billion or $7.70 per share reflecting growth of 15% off our 2017 adjusted EPS including an approximately $0.45 benefit from lower federal income taxes. For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year increased $0.09 per share compared to 2017 primarily due to lower interest and certain favorable tax items. "," We continue to expect NextEra Energy\u2019s adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off our 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70 plus accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the Florida acquisitions. ","For 2019, we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8 to $8.50. From 2018 to 2021, we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. ","We are closely following the recent developments with Pacific Gas and Electric. Projects directly affected by the potential PG&E bankruptcy have an expected annual adjusted EPS contribution of roughly $0.13 to $0.15 for NextEra Energy. ","Regardless of the outcome of PG&E\u2019s anticipated bankruptcy proceedings, we expect to achieve NextEra Energy\u2019s adjusted EPS expectations that I just outlined and we\u2019ll be disappointed if we are not able to deliver growth at or near the top of our 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate range off our 2018 base of $7.70, plus the expected deal accretion from the Florida transactions. ","We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2020 off a 2017 base of dividends per share of $3.93. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. ","Let me now turn to NEP which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2018. Yesterday, the NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $46.50 per common unit or $1.86 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2018. ","For the full year 2018, adjusted EBITDA and CAFD increased 18% and 36% respectively, primarily as a result of portfolio growth. In addition to meeting NEP\u2019s growth objectives with the acquisition from Energy Resources, during 2018, we are also pleased to announce the execution of a long-term contract that enables an expansion investment in the Texas pipelines. ","The opportunity was subject to regulatory approvals is expected to be in service during the fourth quarter of 2020 demonstrates the organic growth potential of NEP\u2019s underlying portfolio. Beyond the attractive low-cost convertible portfolio equity financing with Blackrock, NEP took additional steps to further enhance its financing flexibility during 2018. ","In the fourth quarter, NEP entered into an additional $1 billion interest rate hedge agreement to help mitigate interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. NEP\u2019s hedge agreement has a fixed rate of approximately 3.95% and can be flexibly utilized in any date until December 11, 2028. ","The swap is incremental to the $5 billion hedge agreement that we announced last year providing significant protection against interest rate risks and NEP executes on its long-term growth plans \u2013 as NEP executes on its long-term growth plans. ","Additionally, during 2018, we successfully raised approximately $85 million through the sale of roughly 1.8 million common units under NEP\u2019s ATM program. Going forward, we will continue to flexibly seek opportunities to use the ATM program depending on market conditions and other considerations. ","Now let\u2019s look at the detailed results. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $165 million and cash available for distribution was $44 million, a decrease of $35 million and $33 million from the prior year comparable quarter respectively. The decline was primarily driven by the sale of a Canadian portfolio earlier in the year with those assets not replaced until the late December closing on the 1.4 gigawatt acquisition from Energy Resources.","For the full year 2018, adjusted EBITDA and CAFD were $881 million and $339 million, up 18% and 36% respectively, primarily driven by growth of the underlying portfolio. Existing projects benefited from increased contributions from Texas Pipelines versus the prior year. ","For adjusted EBITDA, this benefit was offset by the year-over-year reduction and the pre-tax value of NEP\u2019s tax credits as a result of a decline in the federal income tax rate. ","This change has no impact on CAFD. Cash available for distribution from existing projects also benefited from reduced debt service which was roughly offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. ","For NEP, absent any impact from a PGE bankruptcy filing, our December 31, 2018 runrate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion to $1.15 billion and CAFD of $350 million to $400 million are unchanged reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the portfolio with which we ended the year. Our previously announced December 31, 2019 runrate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion to $1.375 billion and CAFD of $410 million to $480 million are also unchanged. ","Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2018 distribution per common unit on annualized rate of $1.86, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023. ","We expect the annualized rate in the fourth quarter 2019 distribution that is payable in February 2020 to be in a range of $2.08 to $2.14 per common unit. NEP expects to be able to manage through the impacts of the anticipated PG&E bankruptcy and to achieve the growth expectations that I just outlined. ","As we have previously disclosed, the 420 megawatts of projects that are contracted with PG&E represents 15% to 18% of NEP\u2019s expected year-end 2018 runrate cash available for distribution. ","As a result of the PG&E Board of Directors authorizing the commencement of a bankruptcy filing, we believe an event of default has likely occurred under the Genesis financing. The administrative agent for the Desert Sunlight 300 financing has notified us an event of default has occurred under those agreements which we dispute and they are currently withholding the January distribution. ","For any financing or an event of default is determined to have occurred, cash distributions can be restricted and other remedies could be exercised including acceleration of the debt. Additionally, due to provisions in the financings an event of default under the Desert Sunlight 300 financing can\u2019t prevent distribution from Desert Sunlight 250 which has contracted with SE.","We expect the combination of Desert Sunlight 250 and the PG&E projects to contribute roughly 18% of NEP\u2019s year-end 2019 runrate CAFD. As we execute on NEP\u2019s growth strategy, we expect this to further decline over time and that the PG&E projects and Desert Sunlight 250 will not represent a significant percentage of NEP\u2019s 2023 cash available for distribution.","For projects or cash distributions are restricted, we expect that over time, these funds will go toward paying down the principal on existing financings, which would potentially result in more distributable cash flow to NEP in the future. In each of these projects, we are reviewing our alternatives and we\u2019ll pursue all options to protect our interest including vigorously defending our contracts and working with key stakeholders of each financing. ","Even in a worst case scenario, where we receive no further contributions from projects that are contracted with PG&E or Desert Sunlight 250, we continue to expect that NEP will achieve its annual 12% to 15% growth in distributions per unit through 2023 without the need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest of the modest at the market issuances. ","We are pleased with NEP\u2019s strong performance in 2018 and believe it continues to provide a best-in-class investor value proposition. With the flexibility to grow in three ways, acquiring assets from Energy Resources organically or acquiring assets from other third-parties, NEP has clear visibility to support its growth going forward. ","Following a new record renewables origination year by Energy Resources and the continued strength of the best renewables development environment in our history, NEP\u2019s growth visibility further improved in 2018. Additionally, NEP\u2019s cost to capital and access to capital advantages further improved over the past year providing flexibility to finance its growth over the long-term. ","When NEP\u2019s growth potential and financing flexibility are combined with its favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights, we believe NEP is well-positioned to meet its financial expectations and we look forward to delivering on NEP\u2019s strategic and growth initiatives in 2019 and beyond. ","That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, we will open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. ","Stephen Byrd ","Hi, good morning. ","John Ketchum","Hi, good morning, Stephen. ","Stephen Byrd ","Armando, congratulations on your retirement and John and Rebecca, congratulations on your new role. All very well deserved. ","John Ketchum","Thank you, Stephen.","Stephen Byrd ","I wanted to just talk, as you can imagine about California for a minute. If all of the project that essentially withheld cash to the \u2013 arguably to the extent that they would be permitted I wanted to make sure I was clear, how much CAFD would be restricted? You mentioned 18% related to several projects. But I wanted to check if every single piece of debt relating to PG&E sort of exercise their cash, cash strap right, what amount of CAFD would be impacted?","John Ketchum","Yes, so, again it would comprise roughly 18% of our runrate CAFD for 2019. We have included a page in our investor material that \u2013 Page 41 that details the CAFD from each of these projects totals about $90 million.","Stephen Byrd ","Understood.","John Ketchum","So, let\u2019s go back though, to what I just said, which is that, first of all, even if all of that cash is trapped, we expect to be able to meet our financial expectations 12% to 15% growth in distributions per unit through 2023, we expect we will not have a need to issue common equity until 2020 at the earliest. So our financial expectations are not impacted by any means. The second, the impact of PG&E and SCE cash flows is going to diminish over time. So by the time, we get to the end of the period of our financial expectations, the cash flows from these projects is not going to be significant contributor to the overall CAFD. ","And then, I think you have to take a look too, Stephen at what is happening in California. I mean, obviously we are not going to sit on our heels. We are going to pursue all avenues with our noteholders to try to free up that cash and we will work vigorously to do that as I said in the prepared remarks. ","Stephen Byrd ","That all makes sense. And John, in terms of any exposure to other California utilities, I am thinking of Edison International and Sempra, just wanted to check both at NEP and NextEra would you mind just speaking briefly to your other California exposure?","John Ketchum","Yes. So, on our other California exposure with SE, I mean right now, we don\u2019t have any, because there is, none of those finances are in default other than the SCE contract that I mentioned which is about 250 megawatts on Desert Sunlight because that\u2019s part of a portfolio financing. ","But again, the impacts of that are included in the numbers that I gave you earlier. So, the 250 impact is included in the $0.13 to $0.15 at NextEra Energy, it is also included in the roughly 18% of total CAFD for 2019. ","Stephen Byrd ","Okay. But do you have any CAFD exposure not in default, but does \u2013 where the offtaker is a subsidiary of either Edison International or Sempra?","John Ketchum","No, zero. ","James Robo","At NEP","John Ketchum","At NEP","Stephen Byrd ","Okay, great. Just wanted to check. ","John Ketchum","Zero.","Stephen Byrd ","At NEP, okay. And at NextEra, is that significant or is it relatively small?","John Ketchum","It\u2019s relatively small. I mean, the contributions that we would have from SCE contracts are roughly $0.08 and that includes the Desert Sunlight 250. So, without it it\u2019s about $0.06. So small.","Stephen Byrd ","Understood. Sorry for all the questions on California, maybe just one last one. You filed at FERC to sort of secure your legal rights under the contracts. Would you mind just to kind of briefly talking through your legal arguments around ensuring to protect your rights under your contract?","John Ketchum","Yes, I mean, the bottom-line is, we think the majority of those contracts have Mobile-Sierra provisions and that these contracts are in the public interest and that the federal power act preempts what the bankruptcy court can do and the FERC has the final say assumption or rejection. ","Stephen Byrd ","That\u2019s very good. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will now go to our next question and that will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman ","Yes, good morning. So, just first on the NEP plan. I assume your \u2013 embedded in there you are assuming that you can continue to get financing other than equity, I assume including some of the \u2013 like private financing, converts and such that you gotten in the past. How do you feel about the ability to get those with this California uncertainty? ","John Ketchum","First of all on the financings like the Blackrock financing, still feel good about our ability to be able to execute against those types of financings and again, we also have a lot of debt capacity at NEP that we can always fall back on as well. ","Steve Fleishman ","Okay. And then, just separate question off-topic, could you update your interest in \u2013 thoughts and interest in Santee Cooper? ","James Robo ","Yes, thanks, Steve. This is Jim. We did put a proposal in to acquire Santee Cooper. I think I've been very clear that we have been interested in pursuing Santee Cooper over the last 18 months or so and we did put a proposal in to acquire it and we look forward to the next steps of the process that the committee is going to be going through. ","Steve Fleishman ","Do you have any idea when you will get an answer?","James Robo ","I think this is a process that ultimately have to \u2013 if the legislature decides to sell Santee Cooper, it's going to have to actually pass a law to do so essentially and the legislative session ends at the end of May or June in that time period. So, it\u2019s going to play out over the next several months. That\u2019s the bottom-line, Steve. ","Steve Fleishman ","Okay, Armando, best to you. Thank you.","James Robo ","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And now we will go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Hey good morning. Congrats Armando. Can you hear me?","Armando Pimentel","Yes, thanks, Julien. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Good. Well, just one quick clarification on the FERC strategy on NEP and then move away from it. But, just if there is indeed some kind of stay, how does that impact the [technical faults] [ph] and the possibility of distribution. Just want to clarify that. Or cash from PG&E for that matter.","James Robo ","Yes, from a FERC standpoint, if there were a FERC \u2013 well, first of all, FERC were to ramp the relief that we are seeking by the end of the week. I mean, I think it just would grant FERC the final say and what happens to the contract. So I don\u2019t think it really has any impact on the status of the existing financings. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Got it. Okay, fair enough. Excellent. And then, just want to turn back to FPL real quickly. Specifically, on the last call, you talked about having \u2013 shall we say, adequate reserve amortization. You also talk about usage trends et cetera and the ability to potentially avoid base rate increases in 2021 and 2022. ","Where does that stand now? How if at all is that impacted by some of the latest events? Just curious on how you are positioning FPL into the longer term here?","James Robo ","Yes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impacted by any of the current events. We feel very good about our position in front of the OPC if that was \u2013 Julien, is what you are referring to as other events. We\u2019ve ended the year\u2026","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","More specific, quite a bit, what are you expecting to tell something more formal about a further rate stay out?","John Ketchum","Well, here is where we are right now. We have $540 million of surplus ending the year. We have \u2013 we believe and expect to have enough surplus to potentially stay out of rate case for 2021 and 2022. We will make those strategic rate case decisions later, but we have a lot of flexibility and that flexibility is very good for Florida customers, because the longer we are able to stay out, the longer period of time that build stay where they are, and then I\u2019ll see a bill impact from another rate case.","James Robo ","Julien, this is Jim. I think you can expect us to give you all - some more thoughts on that fronts in the June investor conference. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Excellent. And then, maybe, Jim, this is a quick question, your direction, but as you think kind of conceptually, first you\u2019ve given the commitments from the last Analyst Day around midstream, potentially some of the latest developments you\u2019ve already alluded to around renewable especially some of the RPS expansions that might be coming in the next six months prior to the June Analyst Day. Could you give us a little bit of your latest thought process around your future investment prospects just a little bit more holistically?","James Robo ","Yes, sure. I mean, when you look at our capital investment plans, I think they are over $12 billion this year. When you look at what we are doing at FPL Gulf and Energy Resources combines, something in that range, we are as of the year before last. We don\u2019t have the details yet on last year. We were the fourth largest investor of capital in the United States in any industry, only AT&T, Verizon, and Amazon invested more in this country than we did in terms of capital investment. ","And we are going to continue to do what we have done for more than a decade which is invest smart capital at FPL to improve the value proposition for customers and we are going to \u2013 we are very excited about and we will have more to say about what we are doing at Gulf at our June meeting. But we have hit the ground running. ","Very excited about what we are doing in terms of what investment prospects are on the Gulf front and we are moving aggressively forward on that pretty much on day one. And at Energy Resources, it is the best renewable environment that we have ever seen and we are going to continue to invest in renewable going forward and as we see pipeline opportunities - contracted pipeline opportunities we will continue invest in those as well. ","So, I don\u2019t think you should expect a big change in our thinking in June. I think you will just see us frankly go forward our vision through the amount of investment and the amount of customer improvement that we are going to bring to our customers as well as the amount of what we are going to do in terms of earnings going forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you very much. ","John Ketchum","Thanks, Julien. ","Operator","We will now go to Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. ","Greg Gordon","Yes, congratulations to all three of you, it goes without saying you're all terrific at your jobs. And Armando, someone asked me to ask you, if you could get circle back to people and tell us where you\u2019d like to fish that would be good now that you are going to have lot of time.","Armando Pimentel","That\u2019s common.","Greg Gordon","Couple questions. Can you just go back over what you said about the levelized cost of energy for battery with storage and what I am particularly interested other than just a restatement of that is what delivery year you see that crossover happening on sort of a large enough scale to tip this sort of disruptive transition that you are talking about?","John Ketchum","Yes, so, what we covered in Jim\u2019s remarks, we will start with the wind. So, wind, we are expecting to be right around $20, $25 a megawatt hour. I would kind of put that we have some PTC helping there, this is a no incentive look. So call it, when those incentives expire more towards the middle of the decade that 2024 timeframe. ","So, $20, $25 a megawatt for wind and we think batteries are going to be about $0.05 to 7.5 cent adder. And so, that\u2019s how we were able to \u2013 I am sorry, per megawatt, that\u2019s how we are able to get to the ranges that Jim provided for wind. So just take the 20, 25 add on 5 to 7 for battery storage. For solar, don\u2019t forget, we have the solar ITCs at 30% through the end of 2023. ","And so, when those ITCs go away and they don\u2019t ever go away, right. They go from 30% to 10%, we are expecting that solar given how quickly panel costs are coming down, balance of panel costs are coming down, solar is a product we are going to be selling in the $25 to $30 a megawatt hour range and then the same adders for batteries is how you get to the math that we are in Jim\u2019s remarks and those are the expectations we have. ","And the solar pricing isn\u2019t really all that far off from what we are doing in the day. So that\u2019s not much of a leap per se. ","Greg Gordon","Okay. That makes sense. I appreciate it and last question, you didn\u2019t mention it explicitly anywhere in your comments, but the balance sheet capacity of $5 billion to $7 billion, I mean your credit metrics and the position on the balance sheet seems unchanged from last quarter. So I would assume that you still feel like that balance sheet capacity is in place?","John Ketchum","Yes, and Gordon \u2013 Greg, one of the things that we said there is that, we had 5 to 7, right. We bought Trans Bay, that was $1 billion. So we took that down, call it 4 to 6 and we are earmarking probably another $2 billion of CapEx opportunities for FPL. We\u2019ll update what \u2013 where exactly that will be used at our June conference. But certainly some of that money is going to go the 30-by-30 initiative that we already announced earlier last week. ","Greg Gordon","Got you. Great update. Thank you guys. ","Operator","We now will go to Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs","Michael Lapides","Hey guys. Armando, congrats on your announcement and to the rest of the team to John, Rebecca, as well. Great to see people move around and get new opportunity. One question about Florida ballet initiative that is being pushed right now. Can you just talk about what is actually in that ballet initiative? What it would mean if it would have garnered the votes and what\u2019s the process from here? ","Armando Pimentel ","Yes. I am going to turn that question over to Eric.","Eric Silagy","Hey, Michael. How are you doing today?","Michael Lapides","I am great, Eric. Thanks for taken the question.","Eric Silagy","Yes, no problem. The ballet initiative, it\u2019s being primus about helping Florida customers, but it\u2019s not about it all. When you look at it it\u2019s really about furthering the business interest of the few folks including a retail electric provider that\u2019s located and based out of Gainesville, that markets power currently outside of Florida. ","This is a group, they have tried unsuccessfully to get this proposal in front of voters through the Constitutional Revision Commission and also through the \u2013 unsuccessfully they tried through legislation in Tallahassee. Their efforts have been unsuccessful in the past because, frankly, Florida's regulated electricity market works really well. ","When you look at the state, the power prices are among the lowest in the nation with electricity that\u2019s among the cleanest and most reliable in the country. As an example, Florida Power & Light offers our customers bills that are more than 30% lower than the national average. Lower than bills in 45 states. ","And, as John said earlier, we are just recognized third time in four years as t he most reliable electric provider in the country which is you could appreciate in a state like this is important when our customers need us most particularly during times of storms and hurricanes. ","So playing simply, it\u2019s a proposal that just \u2013 it actually will lead to increases in electric rates across a state, reduced reliability, particularly during periods of storms, hurricanes, things of that nature. And I think it\u2019s going to compromise the clean energy goals that have been announced including the one we just did on FPL\u2019s 30-by-30 initiative as the unregulated star producers would, they\u2019d have no restrictions on the type of generation that would build. ","Also, I think it\u2019s important to understand on these type of things that consumer protections are removed. You no longer have Florida Public Service Commission role in determining what rates are. They would no longer be viewed as being just and reasonable if that\u2019s the standard would go out the window, and that\u2019s going to impact reliability as well. ","The ability of the customers, this language would actually prohibit customers from being able to buy power from the existing utility. So Florida Power & Light customers would not be able to continue to be customers of Florida Power & Light. There is some other areas too that I think just to be a lot of focus on including the fact that franchise fees which we collect and pay to municipalities across the state would be eliminated. ","And that is significant amount of revenue that would no longer be available to pay for things like first responders, fire fighters, police, hospital employees, these municipalities that everybody counts on. Even you look at now attorney generals in a number of other states have called for the end of deregulation due to all the consumer complaints and the deceptive trade practices. ","So, there is a lot of reasons why these proposals have failed across the country since, frankly early 2000s. You look at including even recently in Nevada work failed. There is \u2013 when you look at other states that and look and just say a lot of backed away, particularly after the California crisis and when Enron moved into California to take advantage of their so-called market-based model, which was ultimately the catalyst for that crisis and helped contributed the state having some of the highest power prices in the country. ","So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s by accident that there hasn\u2019t been a state that\u2019s passed deregulation since the California power crisis which occurred now nearly twenty years ago. So, there is a number of hurdles. The answer to your question that have to be cleared for this proposal to go forward to be placed on the ballet. ","We are going to be very actively engaged. We're going to be educating Floridians on the true motives of the special interest groups, and we are going to also spend a lot of time educating folks on the significant negative impacts that this failed idea would have on the state and on their pocket books.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Eric. I appreciate that. I have one other for either, Jim, John or Armando and this is more longer term. When you are watching what's happening in California with PG&E with that is an international or SoCal Ed and put California in the context of being the nation\u2019s largest renewable market and with the most aggressive renewable target. ","How do you think this impacts the broader U.S. development of renewable if one of t he largest markets is going through some turmoil? And how do you think about that kind of longer term? ","James Robo","So, great question, Michael. I think, one of \u2013 the first thing I would say is, California has some very aggressive renewable targets and some very aggressive climate change goals. The turmoil around the credit of the most important counterparties in the state is, to say at least does not conducive to continued capital investment to continue to further those goals. ","And so, I think it\u2019s a very \u2013 from an energy policy standpoint in the State of California, it\u2019s going to be very important for the state to recognize that and to recognize that there has been significant capital investment by companies from around the world to make that happen and to the extent that that investment is somehow diminished by these credit issues. ","I think that's going to have a real impact on their market going forward and I think the state understands that and it\u2019s one of the elements of the things that they are grappling with now as they deal with the fallout from the tragic fires as well as some of the other issues that they have been facing. ","So, the good news from a market standpoint is, California was obviously the biggest market in the country ten years ago in the renewable business. It isn\u2019t any more. It\u2019s an important market, but it\u2019s no longer the most important market in the country and with the cost declines in renewable, nearly every state in the country is in the \u2013 we have an opportunity to do business and I mean, we have \u2013 my last count, we have development going on in 48 states right now. ","We don\u2019t have operating projects in 48 states, but we have development going on in 48 states. So, while I think it\u2019s very important for the state to address these issues from a climate change standpoint going forward, I think the renewable market is going to be robust going forward because it is just gotten so big and the cost declines have expanded the market to such a dramatic fashion. ","Operator","And with that, we'll go now to Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Yes, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. ","James Robo","Hey, good morning, Jonathan. ","Jonathan Arnold","A quick question on \u2013 this is how I think about you talked about managing through the situation at NEP in context of the growth rate. So, as we think about things you might do that would fall under that header, you mentioned pushing to have the cash released. ","And I guess you could drop down other assets more quickly, you could let the dividend, thrift down in the range and still be within 12 to 15. Is there anything else I am missing? And which of those kind of alternatives would you either be planning to use or not use?","John Ketchum","Yes, I think I\u2019d go first of all back to the prior \u2013 one of the prior questions about are there other attractive financing vehicles available? One, yes, we think they are. But, two, even if we had to finance additional drops to meet our financial expectations with existing debt capacity that we have, we can do that. ","We're fine. And so, really the way I would answer that question is that, obviously we\u2019ll vigorously try to put it to negotiate something what the holders that would allow us to end the DOE. Don\u2019t forget the DOE is in these projects that will allow us to free up the cash, we can\u2019t do that. ","We have debt capacity, plenty of debt capacity at NEP. Energy Resources is coming off with a best development year in its history. We have very clear visibility to growth prospects going forward and there are many levers in the vehicle. So, we are comfortable in our ability to manage through even a worst case scenario, which would be where the cash is trapped until a final call is made on the contracts.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. So, John, I think, to be clear, you said that in some of them the cash is trapped just by virtue of PG&E saying that it may file. Is t hat correct? And I am curious.","John Ketchum","Yes. But not to get into the technicalities, but the \u2013 one of the financings has a provision that basically just says that there is corporate action taken in further and so the bankruptcy which are largely the filing of the 8-K to be that would constitute - potentially constitute an event of default.","Jonathan Arnold","So that was just on one of them?","John Ketchum","That\u2019s on the Genesis financing.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And then what would it \u2026","John Ketchum","It\u2019s on some of the other need financing, but the need financings are small. It\u2019s a series of four five projects that don\u2019t have any meaningful contribution earnings.","Jonathan Arnold","So, that would be a sort of a judgment as to what would definitively constitute that not occurring presumably?","John Ketchum","Yes, I mean, it doesn\u2019t happen and I think it\u2019s back to its business as usual. ","Armando Pimentel","Jonathan, let me just add, let me add something. I mean, obviously I think it\u2019s appropriate for the focus on the PG&E assets and the cash flows. But we still have at both at NextEra Energy Resources and at NextEra Energy Partners, we still have a lot of projects that are not PG&E and Southern California Edison projects. ","It have significant cash flows and there are still many parties that are interested in attractive financings, attractive for us and presumably for them that we are talking to. And it's not necessarily about what\u2019s the risk of PG&E and Southern California Edison. It\u2019s about, hey, what other assets are available for us to be able enter into those types of financing. ","So, I think, while it\u2019s appropriate to have some focus on what\u2019s going on with PG&E, we got to remember that NextEra Energy Resources has had its \u2013 we have 6600 megawatts of origination this year which is a record year and that\u2019s twice the amount we had last year which was a record year and I got to tell you, we feel at least internally, very comfortable, as John said, that even if these PG&E cash flows are tied up in these debt financings, that we can meet our current expectations and one of the reasons that we feel that way is because we are talking to the market, and two, origination is going very well in Energy Resources. ","Jonathan Arnold","Great. That\u2019s helpful perspective. Thank you, Armando. And then, could I just one other thing. With the Gulf and Florida acquisitions having closed, sooner, I think than maybe you thought, is there \u2013 but you're not talking of any accretion in 2019. It would just sort of help us sort of understand the bump in 2020, what\u2019s driving that and why nothing this year?","Armando Pimentel","So, Jonathan, obviously, we got to done it little earlier than we thought, but we also always assume that we have some cost to achieve t his year to get there. So, we are being conservative as we always are and we feel very good about our plans at Gulf and you can bet I am pushing the team very hard to get things done even faster than we\u2019ve laid out. ","And so, I am really optimistic about the future for Gulf in this company and in our ability to bring real value to their customers and real value to shareholders. So, very excited about it. We will have more to talk about it in June. But, remember we don\u2019t have any cost to achieve in any of these numbers in 2019, so. ","Jonathan Arnold","Thank you very much.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Roskot. Please go ahead.","Matthew Roskot ","Thank you, Brendan. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy; all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation, on our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to John","John Ketchum","Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks on the third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Florence and Michael. As you know, residents of the Southeastern US were recently impacted by the severe effects of these dangerous and deadly storms. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been impacted by these storms\u2019 widespread destruction. We are grateful for the support that others have given us over the years and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this year. ","As part of our assistance efforts, we sent several 1,000 of our employees and contractors to support the restoration efforts of our neighboring utilities. In addition, FPL was able to quickly resource service to the approximately 70,000 customers who were impacted by Hurricane Michael as the hardening and automation investments at FPL was made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid continue to benefit customers. ","Now, turning to our financial performance. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results. And building upon the solid progress made in the first half of the year, remains well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2018. NextEra Energy\u2019s third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.33 or approximately 18% against the prior year quarter, reflecting strong execution of both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. ","Year-to-date we have grown adjusted earnings per share by approximately 14% compared to the prior year comparable period, as we continue to execute well on our major initiatives. At Florida Power & Light earnings per share increased $0.18 year-over-year. Strong growth was driven by continued investment in the business to maintain our best-in-class customer value preposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. ","Consistent with our expectations, we achieved our target regulatory ROE of 11.6% early in the third quarter. All of our major capital initiatives remain on track including the 1,750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and construction of four 74.5 megawatt solar energy centers that are currently being built under the Solar Base Rate Adjustment or SOBRA mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement. ","During the quarter we completed the acquisition of Florida City Gas, and welcomed its employees and customers to the NextEra Energy family. As a reminder, starting this quarter, financial results for FCG are being reported as part of our FPL business segment. ","The proposed acquisitions of Gulf Power and ownership stakes in two natural gas power plants continue to progress well. In September, the Federal Trade Commission granted Early Termination of the Waiting Period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust requirements. In addition, the change of control proceedings with FERC are currently uncontested. Subject to obtaining the FERC approval and satisfaction of customary closing conditions, we continue to expect the Gulf Power transaction to close in the first half of 2019. Assuming the transactions close, financial results for the natural gas plants will be reported as part of Energy Resources and Gulf Power will be reported as its own business segment. ","At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by roughly 18% year-over-year primarily as a result of the favorable impact of the lower corporate income tax rate. Continuing the success of recent quarters, since the last earnings call we had our most successful quarter of renewable origination in our history adding nearly 2,100 megawatts to our backlog, including approximately 650 megawatts of additional wind repowering opportunities and 120 megawatts of battery storage projects. ","We were pleased to sign our first transaction in which a customer is combining wind and solar energy with the battery storage solution to best match its load profile at the lowest cost. This transaction includes the largest combined solar and storage facility in the United States announced to-date. I will provide more details on our continued origination success later in the call. ","Overall, with three strong quarters complete in 2018, we are pleased with the progress we are making at NextEra Energy and are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed subject to our usual caveats. ","Now, let\u2019s look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2018, FPL reported net income of $654 million or $1.37 per share, an increase of $88 million and $0.18 per share respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 13% over the same quarter last year and was a principal driver of FPL\u2019s net income growth of nearly 16%. FPL\u2019s capital expenditures were approximately $1.1 billion in the third quarter and we expect our full year capital investments to total between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. As I previously mentioned, our reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. ","As a reminder, rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $1.3 billion in Hurricane Irma storm restoration cost, FPL utilized its remaining available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the expense associated with the write-off of the regulatory asset related to Irma cost recovery ending 2017 with a zero dollar reserve amortization balance. ","After achieving FPL\u2019s target regulatory ROE of 11.6% early this quarter, we restored $301 million of FPL\u2019s reserve amortization balance. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years for any further customer benefits by potentially avoiding the base rate increase in 2021 and 2022. ","All of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well. Construction on the approximately 1,750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on budget and on schedule to enter service in mid-2019. ","The four solar sites totaling nearly 300 megawatts of combined capacity that are currently being built across FPL\u2019s service territory are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost effective energy to FPL customers in early 2019. These projects are a continuation of one of the largest solar expansions ever in the US and are part of FPL\u2019s plans for a significant increase in new solar projects across Florida over the coming years. ","We have secured sites that could potentially support more than 6 gigawatts of FPL\u2019s continued solar growth. Beyond solar, the roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center continues to advance through development and is scheduled for siting board approval later this quarter to support its projected commercial operation date in 2022. ","Our continued investments in hardening and automation of our existing transmission and distribution system also continued to progress well. We continue to expect that FPL\u2019s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate and regulatory capital employed net of accumulated deferred income taxes of approximately 9% from the start of the settlement agreement in January 2017 through at least December 2021, while further enhancing our customer value proposition. ","The Florida economy continues to remain strong. Florida seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.5% in September, down 0.3 percentage points from a year earlier, and that's the lowest level in the last decade. As an indicator of new construction, new building permits remain at healthy levels. ","The most recent rating of the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 5.1% from the prior year. Overall, Florida's economy continues to grow with the latest ratings of Florida's consumer confidence remaining near the highest levels of the past decade. ","FPL\u2019s third quarter retail sales increased 2.4% from the prior year comparable period. We estimate that less favorable weather had a negative year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 4.1%, which was partially offset by the absence of the effects of Hurricane Irma. On a weather normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 2.9%, continued customer growth and an estimated 2% increase in weather normalized usage per customer both contributed favorably. ","While we\u2019re encouraged by the growth and underlying usage, which is an acceleration of the positive trend from the first two quarters of the year, as we have often discussed, this measure can be volatile and at quarterly basis we are not yet ready to draw any firm conclusions about long-term trends. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and we\u2019ll update you on future calls. ","We\u2019re pleased with FPL\u2019s year-to-date execution and will continue to maintain our relentless focus on delivering low bills, high reliability, clean energy, and outstanding service to our customers. ","Let me now turn to Energy Resources which reported third quarter of 2018 GAAP earnings of $214 million or $0.44 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $348 million or $0.73 per share. Energy Resources\u2019 contribution to third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.11, roughly 18% from the prior year comparable quarter. Contributions from new investments were flat year-over-year. The contribution from existing generation assets increased $0.01 per share as higher PTC volume from our repowered wind projects and improvement in wind resource was mostly offset by a number of smaller items, none of which is particularly noteworthy. ","Wind resource was 94% of long-term average versus 87% in the third quarter of 2017. Contributions from our Gas Infrastructure business, including existing pipelines increased by $0.04 year-over-year. The reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate contributed favorably increasing adjusted EPS by $0.11 compared to 2017. All other impacts reduced results by $0.05 per share primarily as a result of higher interest and corporate expenses including increased development activity to support the favorable renewables development environment. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. ","The Energy Resources\u2019 development team continues to capitalize in what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history delivering a record quarter of wind and solar origination. Since our last earnings call, we have added 850 megawatts of new wind projects, 447 megawatts of new solar projects and 120 megawatts of new battery storage projects to our renewables backlog. Among these approximately 1,420 megawatts of new build contracts, we were pleased to sign our first combined wind, solar and storage transaction as we continue to advance the next phase of renewables deployment that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution to provide a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a nearly firm generation resource. ","Year-to-date, approximately one-third of our solar projects that have been added to backlog include a battery storage component and we continue to include a storage alternative in all of our RFP responses to help further educate our customers on the disruptive pricing of nearly firm renewables.","As I have previously mentioned, since our last earnings call, we added approximately 650 megawatts to our repowering backlog. During the quarter, Energy Resources also successfully commissioned an approximately 200 megawatt repowering project and we continue to make solid progress on the remaining 2018 sites. In addition to the nearly 2,100 megawatts of projects added to backlog this quarter, we also executed a 200 megawatt build-own-transfer agreement. ","While customer demand for long-term contracted projects remain stronger than ever, we will continue to selectively pursue similar project sale opportunities that may facilitate additional PPA signings while generating a significant portion of the after-tax NPV that we would realize over the life of a contracted wind project. ","Through the first three quarters of 2018, we have added nearly 4,700 megawatts to our renewables backlog which now totals approximately 9,300 megawatts. To put our current backlog in context, it is larger than Energy Resources\u2019 operating portfolio at the end of 2011, which took us more than 10 years to develop. The scale of origination success that we have had this year reflects a rapidly accelerating demand for low cost wind and solar projects and we continue to believe that by leveraging Energy Resources\u2019 competitive advantages we are well positioned to capture a meaningful share in these markets going forward. ","The attached chart provides additional details on where our renewables development program now stands. Based on our current backlog and the ongoing strength of renewables demand, we continue to feel good about the total 2017 to 2020 development ranges that we have previously outlined. ","With over two years in the development period remaining, we are already within the outlined ranges for solar and wind repowering and are close to achieving the expected range for US wind. ","Beyond renewables, we continue to make progress with the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. Despite being unable to work on stream and wetland crossings, MVP continues to advance construction on a significant portion of the overall route as it continues to work towards resolving outstanding legal challenges. Largely due to these challenges, MVP recently announced that it has increased its overall project cost estimate to $4.6 billion and is now targeting a full in-service date for the pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2019. ","As a result of the benefits of tax reform, Energy Resources\u2019 returns for MVP remain attractive despite the recent cost increase. Additionally, the MVP expansion opportunities, including the Southgate project that we continue to advance through development, have strong economics and we believe the overall value of the pipeline will increase through time. ","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2018 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.007 billion or $2.10 per share. NextEra Energy\u2019s 2018 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.039 billion and $2.18 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment increased $0.04 per share compared to the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to certain tax items. ","We continue to advance Project Accelerate, our company-wide productivity initiative, which is expected to yield several $100 million in run rate efficiencies. For the full year, we expect the total transition cost associated with this initiative to be approximately $44 million, of which $27 million will be recorded at FPL and offset with utilization of reserve amortization. The balance will be charged to Energy Resources and is expected to reduce adjusted EPS by $0.02 to $0.03 per share. ","Based on our strong year-to-date performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full year and we'll continue to target the $7.70 midpoint for adjusted EPS range which reflects growth of 8% off of our 2017 adjusted EPS of $6.70 plus approximately $0.45 for the benefit of tax reform. ","Longer term, we continue to expect NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of our 2018 midpoint expectation of $7.70 per share and assuming the Gulf Power and natural gas plants transactions close that the Florida acquisitions will be $0.15 and $0.20 accretive to our 2020 and 2021 adjusted EPS expectations respectively. ","From 2018 to 2021, we also expect that operating cash flow will be roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2020, off of 2017 base of dividends per share of $3.93. As always, our expectations are subject to usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. ","As a reminder, shortly after the announcement of the acquisition of Gulf Power, Florida City Gas and ownership stakes in two natural gas power plants, we had potential interest rate volatility on the $5.1 billion cash purchase price through the execution of interest rate swaps. Earlier this year, we also entered into a $3 billion forward-starting interest rate hedge agreement that allows us to flexibly manage interest rate exposure on NextEra Energy debt issuances over the coming years. ","Following the closing of the Gulf Power transaction, we expect to maintain $5 billion to $7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity through 2021 as a result of anticipated adjustments to rating agency credit metric thresholds. We will look to utilize the remaining balance sheet capacity to either buyback shares or opportunistically execute on accretive incremental capital investments or accretive acquisition opportunities if it makes sense to do so. ","As a reminder, the remaining excess balance sheet capacity serves as a cushion as its utilization is not currently assumed in our financial expectations. ","In summary, NextEra Energy continues to execute on its strong start to 2018 and remains well positioned to meet its 2018 expectations and long-term growth prospects. We continue to believe that NextEra Energy offers the best investor value proposition among the utility sector. ","At FPL, we remain focused on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making smart, long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do. ","At Energy Resources, we continue to make terrific progress on our development program by leveraging our significant competitive advantages to capture a meaningful share of the best renewables development environment in our history. ","During the third quarter, we were honored to be named to the top 25 of the Fortune\u2019s 2018 Change the World list, the only energy company from the Americas and one of only two electric companies in the world to be recognized. This recognition is a testament to NextEra Energy\u2019s best-in-class position in the renewable energy sector and our continued commitment to the customers and communities we serve. ","Combining this advantage with the low cost operating platform that is second to none, one of the strongest credit ratings and balance sheets in the sector, and a strategy that is built to capitalize on ongoing disruption within the industry in the best renewables environment in our history, NextEra Energy is well positioned to drive long-term shareholder value over the coming years. ","Let me now turn to NEP. NextEra Energy Partners also continued its strong start to 2018 with year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 14% and 72%, respectively. CAFD benefited from new project additions and favorable debt service. Yesterday, the NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.45 per common unit, or $1.80 per common unit on an annualized basis continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. ","During the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners announced an agreement to acquire a geographically diverse portfolio of 11 wind and solar projects from Energy Resources as it continues to execute on its long-term growth strategy. The approximately 1.4 gigawatt portfolio should further enhance the already best-in-class quality and diversity of NEP\u2019s existing portfolio with an average 17 year contract life and counterparty credit rating of Baa1 following the acquisition. The acquired asset should also enable NEP to complete the growth necessary to achieve our previously outlined year end 2018 expectations, while also replacing the Canadian portfolio that we divested earlier this year.","The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The $1.275 billion cash purchase price is expected to be financed with the Canadian asset sale proceeds and the $750 million convertible equity portfolio financing that I will discuss in more detail in a moment. ","By redeploying the proceeds from the Canadian portfolio sale, which was executed at an attractive 10 year average CAFD yield of 6.6% inclusive of the present value of the O&M origination fee into a portfolio yielding an approximately 10% CAFD yield that also benefits from a lower effective corporate tax rate and a longer tax shield in the US versus Canada, these transactions are expected to support a longer runway for LP distribution growth. ","Since the last call, we are also pleased to announce the execution of a long-term contract that enables an approximately $115 million investment and additional pipeline compression capacity on the Texas pipelines, which is expected to be initially financed with NEP\u2019s existing debt capacity. The expansion opportunity is expected to deliver attractive returns to LP unitholders and demonstrates the organic growth potential of NEP\u2019s underlying portfolio. ","Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect the project to be in service during the fourth quarter of 2020 and continue to pursue additional expansion opportunities for the pipeline system. ","Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are introducing December 31, 2019 run rate expectations reflecting roughly 20% and 17% growth from the comparable year end 2018 run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD midpoints respectively. ","Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NEP and are well positioned to meet our 2018 and longer term expectations. ","Now, let's look at the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $203 million and cash available for distribution was $81 million, up approximately 14% and 72% from the prior year comparable quarter respectively, primarily due to portfolio growth. New projects added $45 million of adjusted EBITDA and $28 million of cash available for distribution. ","The CAFD contribution from new projects benefited from favorable timing of debt service and tax equity PAYGO payments. ","Offsetting the growth of new projects was the sale of the Canadian portfolio which drove an $18 million decline in adjusted EBITDA. The divestiture had a favorable impact on cash available for distribution this quarter due to the elimination of debt service payments on the Canadian portfolio. ","For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was favorable at 94% of long-term average versus 82% in the third quarter of 2017, which provided a benefit to adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution year-over-year. ","For adjusted EBITDA, this benefit was offset by the year-over-year reduction in the pretax value of NEP\u2019s tax credits as a result of decline in the federal income tax rate. This change has no impact on CAFD. ","As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. ","As I previously mentioned to finance the acquisition that we announced during the quarter, NEP will use a combination of the Canadian asset sale proceeds as well as a $750 million convertible equity portfolio financing with BlackRock. And exchange for BlackRock\u2019s contribution, it will receive an equity interest in the portfolio that NEP is acquiring. NEP will receive an initial 85% share of the cash distributions from the portfolio during the first three years and BlackRock will receive the remaining 15%, which represents an effective annual coupon during that three year period of approximately 2.5%. ","During the fourth year of the agreement, NEP expects to exercise its right to buy out BlackRock\u2019s equity interest for a fix payment equal to $750 million plus a fixed pre-tax return of 7.75% inclusive of all prior distributions with a minimum of 70% of the buyout price paid in NEP common units issued at no discount to the then current market price and the balance paid in cash. ","Following the initial three year period, if NEP has not exercised its buyout right, BlackRock\u2019s allocation of distributable cash flow from the portfolio would increase to 80%. ","The financing is expected to be an additional low cost equity-like product for NextEra Energy Partners and further demonstrates NEP\u2019s ability to access additional attractive source of capital to finance its growth. ","In addition to providing further third-party confirmation of NEP\u2019s growth outlook and high quality portfolio, with the right to convert a minimum of 70% of the portfolio financing into NEP units issued at no discount, the transaction further reduces NEP\u2019s equity needs going forward. NEP also recently reinitiated use of its aftermarket equity issuance program. During the quarter, we successfully completed the sale of approximately 1.7 million in NEP common units raising roughly $81 million under the ATM program. Going forward, we will continue to flexibly seek opportunities to use the aftermarket program depending on market conditions and other considerations. ","For the full year 2018, we expect to achieve growth of roughly 20% for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD even after excluding the benefit from the acceleration of the note receivable related to the Canadian asset sale which was consistent with our expectations at the start of the year. ","Following the acquisition of the announced portfolio from Energy Resources, we expect the NEP assets to support the previously announced December 31, 2018 run rate expectations, reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2018 for adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion to $1.15 billion and cash available for distribution of $360 million to $400 million. ","As I mentioned earlier, consistent with our previously announced long-term growth prospects, today, we are introducing December 31, 2019 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion to $1.375 billion and CAFD of $410 million to $480 million reflecting calendar year 2020 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2019. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. ","From a base of our fourth quarter 2017 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.62, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023. ","We are pleased with the progress NextEra Energy Partners has made over 2018 against its strategic and growth initiatives. The high quality underlying NEP portfolio is supported by the long-term contracted cash flows, backed by strong counterparty credits. ","As we have previously highlighted NEP has the flexibility to grow in three ways: Organically; acquiring assets from third parties; or acquiring assets from Energy Resources portfolio, which continues to rapidly expand given Energy Resources\u2019 competitive advantages and corresponding success in renewables origination. In addition to clear visibility into how it will grow going forward, NEP maintains a cost of capital and access to capital advantage. ","Without a need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest, other than modest aftermarket issuances, NEP has substantial flexibility to finance its long-term growth as was further demonstrated by the financing transaction executed this quarter and the $5 billion forward-starting interest rate hedge that remains in place. ","These strengths together with NEP\u2019s favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights leave NEP well positioned to meet its financial expectations and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about its long-term prospects. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd ","I wanted to talk about, at NEP, the BlackRock financing that you described John. Is this something that you view as a potential ongoing tool, meaning is it replicable? Does it have the sort of features that you're looking for? Is this more do you think sort of a one-off transaction?","John Ketchum ","Yes, it's absolutely replicable. To be able to find money at a 2.5% yield for the first three years, to be able to convert 70% of the position into NEP stock, really provides an attractive source of capital for us going forward and it's certainly something that we can replicate on future transactions.","Stephen Byrd ","Great. And just on the conversion element, you walked through it quite well. I just want to make sure I understood. If you did not convert the security into NEP common, what would the cash coupon yield sort of move up to in that event?","John Ketchum ","It moves up to roughly 8%.","Stephen Byrd ","Got you. Understood. Okay. And then I wanted to step away back on the wind side and just talk longer term about the growth potential for wind. We do hear a lot of debate about the size of the US wind market when the federal subsidy eventually does sunset. And I know that's down the road, but you all obviously see a lot of technology changes on the wind side. So I was just curious, in the long run, how do you see that playing out in terms of the size of the wind market? Do you see a contraction because of loss of subsidy or technology change is sufficiently beneficial that you see growth continuing? How do you see that changing over time?","Armando Pimentel ","Steve, it's Armando. I think longer term, as we've previously pointed out, we think by the mid part of the next decade that the pricing of wind is going to be pretty much on par to where we see it today with a 100% PTC. Now, obviously, we've got to get from a 100% PTC, and 80% and 60% and 40%, down to zero, but we think that the improvements that we are seeing with technology which are essentially taller towers, longer blades, better electronics beyond kind of machine which captures the wind better. We absolutely believe that by mid part of the next decade you're going to have the costs around the same place that you have it today. ","In the meantime, for \u201819, \u201820 and what we are seeing now in 2021, wind is going to remain very, very competitive, pretty much where we see it today or maybe even a little bit lower. So we think it's -- we think there's going to be a lot of wind that gets built over the next three to four years on top of the solar and storage that we are clearly seeing is coming to market.","Stephen Byrd ","Great. Thanks. And if I could, just one last one on the utility side. You\u2019ve spent some time talking about preparing for dealing with storm damage et cetera. Is there more broadly additional work that might be done just to further harden the system beyond? I know you have extensive efforts underway and have had a good track record of storm recovery, but should we be thinking about potential incremental opportunities for preparing for hurricanes or other sort of physical changes to your system?","John Ketchum ","Yes, absolutely, Steve. I'm going to let Eric comment on the details, but we've spoken a little bit about the undergrounding opportunity that we have going forward, the continued automation, the continued hardening that we have in the existing system. I think that certainly applies to Gulf as well, but I'll let Eric expand upon that.","Eric Silagy ","Yes, Stephen, so this is Eric Silagy. We have a number of different opportunities and programs that are underway currently. So about 88% of our transmission is currently steel or concrete and we are on a program to take all wood out of our transmission system across our service territory. We'll be done with that after beginning of the decade. I would say there's a lot of opportunities also with additional technology that we continue to deploy on the smart grid side that also helps during storm response. And then, John touched on it, the undergrounding initiatives that we have piloted right now on ways to get additional costs out to make it more affordable will be something that we are focused on for years to come. We have about 6,700 miles of distribution in our system in Florida. 40% of that roughly is underground now. So there's a lot of work to do on the remaining piece and doing it cost effectively is what we are focused on now.","Stephen Byrd ","Very good. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman ","Yes, good morning. Could you maybe just talk to how we should think about where you stand on your renewables kind of backlog targets now that you\u2019re already in the lower end of the range? Is it likely you might kind of hit the high end of that or how should we just think about the pacing of additional projects within your kind of backlog goals?","John Ketchum ","Well, Steve, we certainly feel very good about where we are. I mean already have 9,300 megawatts added to backlog, adding almost 5,000 already for the year. We are certainly in terrific position given that we still have a couple of more years before the PTC even runs down on us. And so, terrific wind development opportunities, terrific solar opportunities with the four year start of construction, with all of the success that we are having in pairing batteries with solar is enabling a lot more development. So strong progress and potential opportunities across the board. And even when you look at wind, as the PTC expires or starts to phase down from 100% at the end of 2020 to 80% in 2021 and 60% and 40%, with the technology improvements that we are seeing, we think \u201821 is going to look a lot like \u201819. And so you're going to continue to see a lot of progress as you get into the next decade based on the discussions that we've been having with the OEMs and the technology improvements that we know are coming.","Steve Fleishman ","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Hey. So maybe just to pick up where Steve left off. Can you comment a little bit about the cadence of that contracting, given again the range that you have for the 2017 through 2020 period for NEER? I mean obviously tremendous success first half of this year. But when do you have to kind of stitch things up just with respect to the development activities for \u201820, I mean do you expect to have continued success at this current pace through \u201818? I mean, I'm just thinking about kind of hitting the midpoint of that range that you talk about, right, at a minimum, if you will, and what that means for contracting activities kind of in the remaining period of that \u201817 through \u201820?","Armando Pimentel ","Julien, it's Armando. I think my comments will probably reflect closely on what we said last time which is when Jim and John say that it's probably the best renewables environment in history, we are absolutely seeing that on the origination side. We do not believe that this third quarter origination total is a peak. Obviously, we have a view as to what's going to be happening in the next three to four months and the contracting remains very strong. We have signed some 2020 wind deals. But my expectation is that we are going to see a lot more 2020 wind deals that get priced over the next six months or so.","We have priced actually a lot more 2021 and 2022 solar deals than I would have expected at this point. But I also believe that you're going to see some significant 2020 solar origination over the next six months or so. So our origination folks are very busy. There's a lot of RFPs and there's also individual conversations being had with customers. I think customers understand that the PTC is slated to ramp down. So they're anxious on the wind side to get in the queue. They're also anxious on the wind repowering side to get into the queue before the end of 2020 which was one of the reasons why we had strong origination this quarter. So, in my view, we are far from a peak and I think it's going to continue to remain strong for a while.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Got it. Excellent. And then just digging a little bit into the numbers here. Can you reconcile a little bit the difference here in the debt service between -- on the \u201818 projected NEER portfolio? And I suppose what comes out of that just given what seems like a higher number is potentially some interest rate exposure. And how do you think about using the flexibility afforded, right? You've got this option before you\u2019ve given the interest rate hedge product that you entered into. When do you choose to enter into that? How do you think about that option?","John Ketchum ","Yes, Julien. So I think you're referring on the first part of your question to our EBITDA, CAFD walk. You see some debt service coming out that impacts CAFD in 2018. The answer is simple. It was NPV positive as part of our liability management program to pay some of those debt obligations off early on some of our older projects. And then second, for our repowering activity, we always go ahead and just pay the debt off. We know we are going to put new tax equity on them. That's just a matter of course. That's all that's happening in that line.","And then on your second point on when do we look to use the $3 billion interest rate hedge that we have? Remember that product is designed a lot like the NEP $5 billion hedge. We have a tremendous amount of flexibility under both the $3 billion at NextEra Energy and the $5 billion at NEP. Those don't have mandatory forward starts until 2028. So we can essentially decide to bring those in, in whole or in part, at any time we want to over the next 10 years. So if we see interest rates tick up and we want to use debt financing to finance additional capital expenditures, we can always utilize that. But what we like the best about those products is they provide tremendous amount of flexibility as to when we decide to use them.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","And to clarify the earlier point on the walk, you're saying it was NPV positive but the higher debt service is because you're basically layering a new debt preemptively for repowering? I just want to make sure I heard that right.","John Ketchum ","No. Yes, so two things. One is, we have just debt on all projects that it's just NPV positive to go ahead and pay it off. It gives us a refinancing option going forward. And then second, when we repower a project, we want to pay the debt off because we are planning to put tax equity financing in place on those projects going forward and have to be unencumbered in order to put that tax equity financing on those assets.","James Robo ","So, Julien, this is Jim. Said another way, we had not planned at the beginning of the year to pay that $150 million of debt off, but we -- through the liability management program, we made a decision to pay it off as NPV positive, so it's good for shareholders and we did it. We did it. We are going to do it this year and so that's why you're seeing that. It's actually a good guy, not a bad guy.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Got it. Thank you.","John Ketchum ","Yes. You\u2019ve to remember, last year -- and remember, last year, Julien, we did the same thing in the fourth quarter of 2017, $150 million of NPV positive moves on debt repayments around our liability management program. So we are constantly looking for opportunities to save shareholders' money.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Much appreciated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon ","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for clearing that up. That was one of my questions. So there's no material or meaningful floating rate debt exposure at NEER, just to be clear?","John Ketchum ","No. No, not at all. Quite the contrary. I think we are very well positioned to manage interest rate risk going forward, much better than our peers. And I think that we not only do we have an access to capital advantage, but a cost of capital advantage in that $3 billion hedge that we have in place, I think will be instrumental going forward.","Greg Gordon ","Yes. At first it was little bit confusing, but I see that the debt balance at NEER from Q1 to Q3 is actually on an absolute basis down and that syncs with the footnote there that shows that you include debt retirements in that number. So thank you. ","The second question I have is -- was on, there were also some moving parts in the -- on overall EBITDA. So if I look at the story arc from Q1 to Q3, it looks like your assumed EBITDA from renewables is lower. I think is it fair to attribute that to just wind resource over the course of the year? And then, nuclear pipeline is significantly higher. Can you just take us through, generally speaking, how the EBITDA contributions have evolved over the year?","John Ketchum ","Yes. I think when we look at it and you'll get an update on this next quarter on how we did going into the year versus how we finished the year, we expect to be within the range on all the items that we provided to you. So while there\u2019s ups and downs in any one quarter and we always try to give investors a good feel, on the nuclear side, we've had better execution on outages, better execution on E4. And on the wind, it's really just been bad resource. So we've made some adjustments there. But again, for the full year, and you'll see this next quarter, our current expectation is that we should be within the range of what we showed you last year on our EBITDA-to-CAFD walk.","Greg Gordon ","Yes. And do you have any insight as to why the pipeline numbers improved? Is that just better throughput or you've made more conservative assumptions? What changed there? ","Armando Pimentel ","Hey, Greg, it's Armando. I'm not sure. It could be a little better throughput, but it's nothing that's really sticking out at me as to why there's been an improvement.","Greg Gordon ","Okay, great. Final question. Nobody has asked, Jim, but you usually do make a comment around where you -- given the robust outlook you have, where you would expect to be inside the 6% to 8% guidance range and you haven't volunteered that yet. So is there a reason why you haven't volunteered? That is something changed with regard to your earnings aspiration inside the range?","James Robo ","No, not at all, Greg. I think we continue to target the midpoint for this year of 7.70% and -- but in 2021, I'll be very disappointed if we don't hit the high end of the range.","Greg Gordon ","Thank you very much, guys. Take care.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides ","Hey, guys. Just an easy one on Project Accelerate. I think this was probably version three of that. When you talk about several hundred million of run rate efficiencies, are these O&M savings that will drop to the bottom-line, so we'll actually see this in some future EPS or is this just O&M savings that will offset other cost increases that will help, but won't necessarily see them on the bottom-line numbers?","James Robo ","Hey, Michael, this is Jim. So, first of all, FPL, what it does is create surplus, right? And so it gives us headroom to continue to find good projects for customers to invest, to improve our value proposition without having any impact on rates, okay? So that's how you see it on the FPL side. And at the NEER side, it absolutely falls to the bottom-line.","Michael Lapides ","Got it. So safe to assume -- if I were to put a tax rate on the couple of hundred million, let's say, it's $200 million to $250 million to $300 million, some portion of that gets allocated to NEER, I don't know if that's a 50-50 or if this is FP&L weighted and that would almost be something that's already embedded in your EPS guidance for 2020, 2021?","James Robo ","Yes, that's right. That's all right and it would -- the split is roughly equal to the EBITDA split of 65-35.","Michael Lapides ","Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza ","So just a real quick follow-up on the BlackRock deal. Are you actually seeing players step up for a similar structure even though you can replicate it? And then, as you sort of think about the NEP standalone just from a self-sustaining standpoint, your equity needs, have they sort of evolved post the deal? I know you kind of still guide around 2020 at the earliest, but that was obviously provided even before this BlackRock deal. So just curious on that and I've got a follow-up.","John Ketchum ","Yes, we have received an inordinate amount of inbound interest on structure that looks similar to BlackRock. As a matter of fact, the NEP and the treasury team have been busy fielding those calls. So a lot of inbound interest there. And on -- from an equity standpoint, I think what we said is, look, I mean this is a very low cost of capital, very attractive financing which certainly puts us in good position going forward.","Shahriar Pourreza ","Got it. That's helpful. And then just real quick on Gulf Power. You guys have obviously have moved past data rooms and have had more time to sort of digest really what you're buying. So as you sort of think about the accretion guide, you've got an O&M that's almost double the size of yours at FP&L. You have materially higher purchase power cost, no standstill agreements. Like I get the playbook but the math seems to point to somewhat of a conservative guide especially with the inefficiencies you're taking on. One, am I thinking about this correctly? And then just from the timing perspective, the process seems to be moving along relatively quickly. Is there any opportunity to close some time in Q1 versus first half?","James Robo ","So I'll take the second part of that first, Shahriar, this is Jim. Listen, we have -- the team has worked very hard to work through all of the potential issues at FERC. We feel very good that in the change of control part of that docket that there are no outstanding protests right now. And so we feel we still have some work to do where we continue to target the first half. But as I tell the team, there's 182 days in the first half and we could close on any one of those days.","On the first part, I think when we laid out our guidance for the accretion of the transaction, we were pretty much -- I don't think we were conservative and we weren't aggressive. We were what I'd call [P50], pretty down in the middle of the road on what we think we can achieve. The Gulf Power team is in the midst of a very tough hurricane restoration now. They've done just an outstanding job in a very tough situation and we are doing what we can to help everyone in that part of Florida to restore. And so, we are honestly right now focused on that and feel very good about the transaction. Looking forward to welcoming the Gulf team to the NEE family, and we are looking forward to getting the deal done and moving forward with our plan.","Shahriar Pourreza ","Got it. And then, Jim, since no one's asked, any comments you can provide around South Carolina or Santee and then especially with the RFPs expected sometime in the fourth quarter or early Q1?","James Robo ","So I don't -- it's been no secret that if there is an RFP on Santee that we would have an interest. And so I think I'll stop it at that. And we've been watching it closely for 18 months and we'll see how that process plays out.","Shahriar Pourreza ","Terrific. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold ","Good morning, guys. Just on the NEP expansion project, can you just clarify, is that included in the 2019 run rate guidance or would that be incremental?","John Ketchum ","Yes. No, it's included in the 2019 run rate guidance. It doesn't come online until 2020, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold ","Okay. So it's in the 2019 run rate, but it comes in early 2020. Is there incremental -- is there something potentially beyond that, because from memory, there were some bigger opportunities there at one point?","Armando Pimentel ","Hey, Jonathan, it's Armando. Just to clear it up. I mean it's -- the expansion project is both in \u201819 and \u201820, right. You've got to start spending CapEx in \u201819 in order to get it done in \u201820. It's COD I think the third quarter of 2020. So it's in the numbers. There's nothing incremental to add. ","In terms of additional projects, the team continues to work on several projects associated with the pipelines that it has. It's done a decent job so far since we bought those pipelines in 2015 and we continue -- I continue to have expectations that they will be able to find onsies or twosies to add as projects at NEP. I don't foresee anything that significant at this point, but we would all be very disappointed if we don't continue to see small opportunities that they bring to the table.","Jonathan Arnold ","Great. Thank you. And if I may, just to revisit the debt service question just very quickly. Jim mentioned the $150 million increase. I think that's how much it went up between Q2 and Q3, but it was -- there was also a 90 odd million increase in Q2. Is that the same issue as the buyouts of some of the debt associated with repowerings, et cetera?","John Ketchum ","Exact same issue. As we repower our assets, you can always expect the debt to be retired and you'll see an impact in the EBITDA, CAFD walk from that.","Jonathan Arnold ","So, is it safe to assume that \u201819, given the amount of repowering you have in the plan that this will -- we will have a similar dynamic there and at some point that will roll down to that sort of high 800s number it used to be?","John Ketchum ","Yes, that's correct.","Jonathan Arnold ","Okay, great. Thank you.","John Ketchum ","Yes. Hey, Jonathan, real quick, though, understand that's already in our plan.","Jonathan Arnold ","Oh! Yes.","John Ketchum ","In our financial expectations, so.","Jonathan Arnold ","Okay.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as today's conference.

","We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. ","Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid results during the first quarter of 2012 and is off to a good start in meeting the objectives that we have set out for ourselves and discussed with you on our last earnings call. ","At FPL, we maintained a regulatory ROE of appropriately 11%, consistent with the 2010 settlement agreement, and average regulatory capital employed grew $3.2 billion or roughly 15.6% over the same quarter last year, reflecting our continuing commitment of new capital to the business, which is designed to enhance what we believe is already the best customer value proposition in the state. As a consequence, net income grew $34 million or 16.6%. ","At Energy Resources, the adjusted earnings contribution compared to the prior year comparable quarter was close to flat, as contributions from new business roughly offset declines from the existing asset portfolio. Given the headwinds facing this business that we have previously discussed, we are satisfied with this performance. More broadly, we made good progress on the various execution objectives we discussed on our last earnings call, and we remain on track to meet our goals for 2012 and beyond.","In Florida, the economy continued to improve, although it is still weaker than we would all desire. Virtually, every significant indicator that we track is now appreciably improved from the trough of 2009, and this quarter showed a continuation of a general upward trend. While we continue to believe that full recovery depends in part on recovery elsewhere in the U.S., we are optimistic that Florida will, in time, revert to its longer-term pattern of greater strength than the national average. ","Within a slowly improving economic environment, FPL continued to deliver what we firmly believe is the best customer value proposition in the state. Our typical bills remain the lowest of the 55 utilities in the state and about 25% below the national average. Our service reliability ranks in the top quartile on a national basis. We provide our customers with award-winning service, and we have a very clean emissions profile, which reduces risk from a customer perspective. ","We continue to be one of the most efficient utilities in the nation, with our non-fuel O&M per kilowatt hour ranking us among the top 10% in operating efficiency in the nation. Our major projects at FPL, which are aimed at improving on this value proposition, all progressed well during the quarter, and we made our formal filing for rate release.","Outside of Florida, the Energy Resources portfolio generally performed well, with the exception of the continued down power at Seabrook, associated with generated cooling limits, which will continue through the next regularly scheduled outage in the fall of 2012. ","While gas and power markets continued to weaken, our high degree of hedging protected us against significant impacts in the first quarter and should continue to do so for many quarters to come. ","We made excellent progress in developing our record backlog of renewable project and remain on track for all major commitments. ","At Lone Star Transmission, we continue to make good progress with construction, and result in minor issues associated with the rate case in Texas. ","Looking forward, as a result of our progress in the first quarter, we continue to believe we are well positioned to meet the earnings expectations we have previously discussed. For 2012, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65, and for 2014, we see a range of $5.05 to $5.65, subject to all the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. ","Let's now look at our result from the first quarter of 2012. I'll start with the results at FPL before moving onto Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For the first quarter of 2012, FPL reported net income of $239 million or $0.58 per share, up $0.09 per share year-over-year. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth was continued investment in the business. ","During the quarter, we invested roughly $1.3 billion of the approximately $4.1 billion we expect to invest in the business in 2012, and regulatory capital employed, that is capital in which we are able to earn a return, grew 15.6% over the same quarter last year. Given the projects currently approved by the Florida Public Service Commission and our normal pattern of investment in the business, we expect to invest roughly $15 billion over the 5-year period, 2010 through 2014, or approximately $3 billion per year. This is the largest investment wave in the company's history and is, of course, only made possible by the prospect of earning a fair rate of return on that investment. These investments collectively produce significant customer benefits in the form of lower fuel costs, better reliability and cleaner air, and they are key to our ability to keep our customer's electric bills the lowest in the state over the long haul. ","All our major projects continued to make good progress during the quarter. The extended power uprate projects at our St. Lucie and Turkey Point nuclear facilities continue to move ahead. Uprates of 3 of the units are anticipated to be completed in 2012, and the uprate at the remaining unit is expected to be completed in 2013. In total, the nuclear power uprate projects are expected to add an incremental 490 megawatts of generation capacity. ","Construction at the Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach modernizations is well underway and remains on schedule and on budget. In addition, the Florida Public Service Commission approved our petition of need for the modernization of our Port Everglades facility, and we expect that project to come into service in 2016 with a total capital investment of approximately $1.2 billion. ","During the quarter, we amortized $165 million of surplus depreciation, enabling us to maintain a regulatory ROE of approximately 11%. For the full year, we expect to amortize approximately $500 million of surplus depreciation, after which there will remain roughly $200 million to be amortized. Utilization of $190 million of this in 2013 is built into our rate case filing. One of the important issues in the rate case will be the need to increase rates to offset the loss of the temporary surplus depreciation amortization credit. ","As I mentioned earlier, the Florida economy continues to improve. Unemployment in March dropped to 9%, still higher than the national average, but well down from the peak of 11.4% in early 2010 and lower than at any time since January 2009. Perhaps more important, Florida has now experienced positive year-over-year job creation for the last 20 months. The tourism sector has improved markedly since its trough in January of 2010. As of January 2012, the 12-month moving sum of total taxable sales from tourism stands higher than at any point over the last 5 years. At the same time, Florida consumer confidence has improved from its low in the summer of 2008, although it is still well below the levels we experienced in 2005 through 2007. ","The Florida housing market continues to recover, although progress is uneven around the state. The large pipeline of homes in foreclosure remains a drag on the market, and the judicial process used in Florida to process foreclosures is one of the lengthiest in the country. Nevertheless, the backlog of homes in foreclosure is gradually declining, and the rate of mortgage delinquencies has fallen to its lowest level since 2008. Florida has improved from having the second highest mortgage delinquency rate in the country, to having the seventh highest rate. ","As painful as the housing market adjustment has been and continues to be, the significant declines in housing prices have resulted in Florida regaining much of the position it had lost in terms of relative housing affordability. In markets where this adjustment has progressed rapidly, such as Miami-Dade, housing market activity has now recovered significantly and many buildings that we had thought would be unoccupied perhaps for years, are now being occupied. Prices in this market have seen a slight uptick recently. ","On the negative side, construction activity, not surprisingly, continues at a very low level, and we do not expect this to change for many months. Yet even here, there are signs of improvement, and we have seen a slight uptick in permit applications for new construction. ","These generally encouraging developments are reflected in the internal indicators that we follow at FPL. During the first quarter, we had approximately 27,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2011, representing an increase of 0.6%. This growth rate has been fairly consistent with our last 7 quarters. Total retail sales increased 3.8%, driven largely by an extra day of sales due to leap year and an increase in underlying usage. This is the second quarter in a row with a positive year-over-year increase in underlying usage. ","Positive economic factors, including increased employment in Florida and the steady drop in the number of empty homes, seem to be contributing to the increase. The number of inactive meters and low-usage customers, which are indicative of the number of empty homes, continue to improve and have now fallen to levels not seen since 2008. However, as we've often pointed out, changes in usage can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter, and we would not extrapolate from this quarter's strong growth. Over the coming months, we continue to expect modest and gradually improving growth, but there are likely to be more bumps along the way. ","On March 19, we submitted testimony and extensive supporting data for FPL's 2012 base rate case. The overall numbers are substantially consistent with what we had indicated in the test year [ph] letter. We are requesting a base revenue increase of $517 million effective January 2, 2013, with an additional step increase of $174 million when the Canaveral modernization comes into service in June of 2013. ","Included in these amounts is our request to reset the allowed ROE at 11.25%, off the 25 basis-point performance premium designed to recognize FPL's excellent overall customer value, but to be maintained only so long as FPL's typical bill remains the lowest in the state. The Commission has established the definitive schedule for this proceeding, which includes quality of service hearings in June, intervener staff and FPL rebuttal testimony in July, and technical hearings in late August. The staff recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates are expected in the fourth quarter. ","In our March filing with the Commission, we indicated that, if granted in full, our base rate request would result in an increase in the base portion of a typical residential customer's bill of $6.97 per month or roughly $0.23 per day. However, the impact on total bills would be substantially less. Based on February fuel curves at the time of our filing, we estimated that the typical bill would increase by only $2.48 per month or $0.08 per day, and we noted that some commercial customers would likely see their total bills go down. ","We are currently in the process of updating our bill impact analysis, which we expect to result in a further decrease in the total bill impact. We will continue to monitor the changing bill impact throughout the rate case process as fuel prices fluctuate. ","The interrelationship between the base rate request and the customer's total bill is an important one, but it is sometimes misunderstood. While fluctuations in natural gas prices will certainly be reflected in corresponding fluctuations in our customer's total bills, as a consequence of our focus on substituting capital for fuel, our customers stand to benefit whatever the level of fuel prices, and the value of the investments we are making would only increase still further if natural gas prices were to increase again. ","The nearly 10,000 employees of FPL have worked hard and thoughtfully for many years, following a consistent strategy that has led to FPL's current combination of low bills, high reliability and excellent customer service. While we are far from perfect and must continue to seek ways to improve, we look forward to presenting our case to the Florida Public Service Commission. ","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2012 GAAP earnings of $221 million or $0.53 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $182 million or $0.44 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the effect of the mark on non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI.","Overall, Energy Resources' contribution was close to flat with last year, with adjusted EPS decreasing $0.02. While the quarters saw the typical collection of puts and takes, there are only a few items worth drawing your attention to. New wind investments added to the portfolio since the first quarter of last year, contributed $0.07, reflecting both higher convertible investment tax credit or CITC elections, as well as ongoing operating earnings. We continue to expect to elect CITCs on roughly 450 megawatts of new project that are expected to be placed into service in 2012. ","The company's gas infrastructure business also added $0.07 of adjusted EPS, $0.06 of which is from gains associated with closing out hedges on certain planned wells that we no longer intend to pursue. These positive results were offset by lower adjusted EPS from the company's existing assets at $0.11.","Existing wind assets decreased $0.07 relative to last year's comparable quarter, due to a combination of favorable state tax credits recorded last year, as well as lower Federal production tax credits, lower energy prices and higher operating expenses. These items were partially offset by favorable wind energy production. Net wind energy generation increased by 545,000-megawatt hours compared to last year's comparable quarter, and the wind resource was about equal to the long-term average. ","At our Seabrook nuclear facility, lower availability and lower gains from decommissioning funds negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.04. All other remaining items contributed a negative $0.05 and reflect lower contributions from the company's customer supply and proprietary trading business and higher cost associated with the growth of the business. ","Given the challenging market environment for Energy Resources, we were satisfied with the overall performance. Nevertheless, the bulk of the year is still ahead of us and much more work remains to be done. ","We continue to make good progress in developing our record backlog of renewable projects. During the quarter, we brought into service 177 megawatts of wind capacity and completed the acquisition of 40 megawatts of solar capacity in Canada. We currently expect to add approximately 1,300 megawatts of U.S. wind capacity this year, roughly 600 megawatts of contracted wind capacity in Canada in 2012 through 2015, and roughly 900 megawatts of contracted solar capacity between 2012 and 2016. All our major projects are on track to meet their respective commitments. ","Looking at the company on a consolidated basis, for the first quarter of 2012, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $461 million or $1.11 per share. NextEra Energy's 2012 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $422 million and $1.02, respectively. The corporate and other segment was essentially flat with last year. As I noted earlier, we are on track with Lone Star Transmission and continue to expect to bring the line into full service in the spring of 2013. ","As I indicated earlier, with the progress we have made in the first quarter, we continue to be comfortable with the earnings expectations we discussed on our last call. For 2012, we currently expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65, while for 2014, we currently see a range of $5.05 to $5.65. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. ","While we have not looked as deeply at the numbers beyond 2014, we also expect to maintain our growth momentum into 2015 with continued contributions from new assets coming into service at both FPL and Energy Resources. ","From a commodity perspective, we are highly hedged in 2015 as well. As always, our financial expectations take into account current market conditions, and we are not depending on or anticipating any great strengthening in the natural gas market. As a reminder, our expectations assume only the projects that we already have in our backlog. While we continue to be optimistic, the federal policy support for renewable development will be maintained at least to some degree beyond the expiration of the production tax credit at the end of the year, we are not counting on that. We hope to be able to add additional projects to our backlog in due course, but if we do not, we would expect to be in a position to return some cash to investors in 2014. Under any realistic scenario, we currently expect our portfolio mix to continue to shift toward a higher percentage of cash flow and earnings coming from regulated and long-term contracted assets. ","On our last earnings call, we laid out for you a short list of critical success factors for 2012 and told you we were intensely focused on successful execution. That remains true today. At Florida Power & Light, our customer value proposition continues to be strong. Our major capital projects are on track, and we have taken the first necessary steps in seeking rate relief. ","At Energy Resources, our first quarter execution was satisfactory, and we have made good progress with all our renewable projects. However, the environment for the non-contracted portions of the Energy Resources portfolio continues to be very difficult. ","At Lone Star Transmission, our construction program is on track, and we are in the midst of our rate case in Texas. If we continue to execute successfully as we have in the first quarter, we believe we will be well positioned to deliver on our 2012 and 2014 expectations. ","Before closing, I'd like to turn the call over to Lew for a few comments. ","As you are all aware, last month, we announced a plan for transition of the senior leadership of the firm. Lew will be stepping down as CEO as of the middle of the year and assuming the role of Executive Chairman with an expected retirement at the end of 2013. Jim Robo, currently President and Chief Operating Officer, will become CEO as of the middle of this year. While the substance of the transition was widely anticipated, a few of you have expressed some degree of surprise at the timing, and Lew would like to explain the logic behind his decision. Lew?","Lewis Hay","Thanks, Moray, and good morning, everyone. I think it's more appropriately said that Moray would like for me to explain the logic behind my decision, as opposed to me wanting to explain it, but nonetheless, hopefully, this will be the last time I have to discuss this. I've long thought that the transition of the CEO role from one individual to the next is one of the critical events in the evolution of a company. I believe it should be a clear, thoughtful and measured progression, if that's at all possible. And mostly prompted by me, our Board has had numerous discussions over the years covering a range of various possibilities. In the end, however, I think it really should come down to 3 things: first, the right point in a company's development; second, the readiness of a successor; and third, a clear decision on the part of the incumbent. ","For us, I believe this is the right time. Our company is in an excellent position. Jim is clearly ready for the CEO role, and for me, it's really time for me to move on to a new phase of my life. ","From the outset of my tenure as CEO, I have consistently believed, as I think Jim and Moray, and many others can attest, that a decade or so is generally about the right length of tenure for a CEO. Over that period, there's time to have a real impact on a large organization, to move it in new directions and also to mold its culture and values. ","I also believe that during that kind of a time frame, a person can remain fresh and vigorous and not default to the same set of ideas for a want of new ones. Now some leaders can remain fresh and creative for a much longer period, but we've all seen leaders who hang on too long. I'm determined not to be one of those. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished over the last 11 years. I had the good fortune to inherit from Jim Broadhead, a strong, capable organization, but that organization is today, much stronger, more diverse and more capable. I think you'll also agree that we've succeeded in our fundamental objective of creating value for our shareholders. ","I have all the confidence in the world that our organization will continue to improve and create even more value for all of our stakeholders under Jim Robo's leadership. Now for the 1.5 years after I step down as CEO, I'm going to be committed to making sure this transition goes as smoothly as possible. I expect to continue to support and mentor Jim as he grows into his new role. I'm going to maintain a number of executive functions for the transition period in order to leverage Jim's growth and his time. Now beyond that, I have a number of personal goals that really can't be met on the schedule of a CEO. And I'm looking forward to having the time and the flexibility to pursue those interests, that frankly I have had to defer so far. But be assured, my heart will never stray far from the company and its people that I have had the privilege to lead over the past 11 years. ","And now we'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Daniel Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on the hedge unwind on the MP [ph] business and kind of responding to the natural gas market, are you -- can you share a little more thoughts on what else you do and in the businesses as far as responding both the CapEx and investment strategies in a low gas state?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Maybe I should first just explain what the hedge closeout is, because it's a little different than the way some people approach this business. Typically, when we commit to a drilling program, we will hedge the expected output for several years, which reduces the overall risk profile of that project or set of projects. That also creates an option that's somewhat akin to selling forward against the power plants, but if gas prices decline significantly, you always have the option of reversing the hedge position and not drilling the wells, so not committing the capital, and that's what we've done in a few instances. So it depends on the specific economic -- perspective economics of a particular group of wells, and obviously what happens in the marketplace. So in terms of the overall implications of the lower gas environment for that business, clearly, it means that some opportunities become marginal or no longer worth pursuing. At this stage though, because of the very small scale on which we are participating in that business, we're still seeing plenty of attractive opportunities. And recall that a key motivation for us to undertake these activities is to have active participation and hence, visibility into the evolution of the gas market in a variety of different regions around the country. So we're still finding that we can meet that objective and do so with attractive expected profitability. But we will obviously continue to look at individual groups of wells, and if it makes sense to take the money from sweeping the hedges and saving the capital, then we will do so.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I just take this as a little bit of a portfolio reallocation more than anything else?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, I think that's a good way of characterizing it.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and then on commercial demand at the utility, it was -- you were particularly good in the quarter on a year-on-year basis. Can you give a little more color on what you're seeing at the commercial customer class, which has typically been the laggard out of this recession?","Moray P. Dewhurst","It's, like everything else we're saying, seeing it's a little bit up and down, stronger in -- among small commercial customers. We've seen some drop-off among the large, medium and larger commercial customers. I can't say that there's any pattern that we've been able to observe there. It's sort of -- again, different regions around the state are progressing at different rates, but not a lot of color that I can really add. I mean, it's all coming back slowly and a little bit in fits and starts. But definitely, the last few months have been more encouraging.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, so one last one, just on the rate impact that you guys show on Slide 9. The total bill impact, is that effectively marking the entire fuel builds of the forward curve for gas right now? So gas prices that go up, that savings -- that rate of increase will go up a little bit? Or is there still some timing difference between the market and where you guys are inputting fuel in that assumption?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, there's always a little bit of a timing difference. But conceptually, you're correct. It's a little bit more complicated than saying that we're just marking it to the current forward curve because we've got the impact of the existing hedge program, how that rolls through. But directionally, if gas prices come down as they have since we made the formal filing, then we would expect to see a further reduction in the total bill impact. And if subsequently they were to go back up, we would expect to see a slight increase in the total bill impact. So conceptually, you're right.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steven Fleishman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Lew, first, congratulations, and I just remember when you first started 10 years ago, everyone was telling you to sell the wind business because it cost too much CapEx, and I'm happy you decided not to. Moving on to -- I'm sure you remember that.","Lewis Hay","Absolutely.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But moving on to a couple questions. First, on the gross margin and EBITDA slides, Moray, it seems like particularly in '12, the numbers have come up pretty good. Could you maybe go through a little bit what's driving that? Is it mainly better Texas power pricing on the little bit that's open? Any other main drivers?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Okay. Thanks for asking the question, Steve. Actually, the principal driver of the change in the numbers on those 2 charts is what I would call a technical one in the way that we have presented the economics of the tax equity project. To be blunt, the way we had been doing it really was understating our equivalent gross margin and without sort of sitting down with a piece of paper and explaining the -- almost the debits and credits a little difficult to go further than that. But effectively, we have now recast these gross margin charts to be a little closer to the concept that we were trying to get at originally of equivalent gross margin for a wind project that had tax equity against it. So that's the principle reason that the numbers have changed. Substantive changes in the period, both for 2012 and 2013, were pretty minor, some small additional hedges. But because we're so hedged for those 2 years, these numbers don't move around a great deal. The hedging activity that we undertook and executed in this period was mostly related to '14, '15 and '16. So we took advantage of some of the strengthening in the Texas spot spreads in particular to reduce our exposure in some of the outyears. But not a lot changed in 2012 and '13.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I think, Moray, you had talked about potentially doing a convertible or other financings this year. Is there any update on financing plans?","Moray P. Dewhurst","We continue to expect to access the equity markets in one form or another, most likely in the form of an equity unit or units. Timing remains to be seen. It will get worked into our overall financing plan and obviously, will depend on specific market conditions. But it's definitely baked into our expectations for the year and beyond, and it just remains to be seen, when the right time to execute is.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and then just lastly, maybe you can give an update with some of the kind of economic issues in Spain. Any update of any issues we should be worried about there for your project?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, we continue to, obviously, to monitor closely what the new government is thinking about doing on the perspective of energy policy. It's a little difficult for us to tell exactly how that's going to come out. They have clearly been very sensitive to the fact that many parties, including international investors, have committed significant amounts of capital in the expectation of a certain regulatory and contractual and pricing environment, and they clearly don't want to go back on that. At the same time, they've got a number of, kind of conflicting pressures. They have still that commitment to meet their renewable portfolio obligations under Kyoto and its successors. But they also have to worry about retail rate pressure. So not a lot to say substantively about how that will all come out. We're optimistic that the economics of the project will be preserved, but obviously, there can be no guarantee on that.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One or 2 questions on Energy Resources, just want to make sure I understand 1 or 2 items. When you guys think longer-term about the several gigawatts of combined-cycle capacity you still have at Energy Resources, do you view this as core of the business still? And are these -- meaning, do you need, especially of the Texas assets to help in terms of kind of the hedging or providing a backstop for your retail presence? That's kind of question one about the gas plans. Question 2 is, I'm a little surprised there's not a bigger uptick in expected output levels from these plants, both the Texas one and the ones in PGM [ph], just given kind of where gas and coal prices are, and the fact we've seen a lot of other folks with combined-cycle talk about witnessing a significant uptick in output going forward.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Okay. On the first question, it's sort of whether the -- how core the gas plants are. I guess the right way to think about that is we continue to like very much our portfolios in New England and Texas. They, respectively within those geographies, they kind of work well together, along with our other books of business in those regions. So I think those we still see as core. But I would say that nothing in our portfolio is absolute, and we will clearly respond to changes in the marketplace and if it makes sense for us to consider divesting assets, we will consider divesting assets. I think we've demonstrated that over the years. So we still like the pieces that we have, but that's in part a function of where markets are today, and where we expect them to be in the future. So it's not an absolute. Specifically, in terms of Texas, I think it's important to recognize that the gas plants are much more significant, just in terms of the impact to the portfolio than is the competitive retail business. On the second question, the -- I'm not quite sure where you're picking up what our expected output would be. If it's from the hedging slide, just recognize that, that's on a dollar basis, and so we have hedged a very significant portion of all those assets. In general, we would expect to see some advantage from what you're talking about, the market changes, flowing through what we call asset optimization. So generally, as those markets strengthen, prospectively, it would give us more opportunities for optimizing around the hedge positions that we've taken. Just as an add-on to that, I mean, this quarter because the weather was so mild and markets were relatively flat, provided very few opportunities for that kind of asset optimization. So I think that's more where we would see the benefit coming in the future.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one other question. Just -- I want to make sure I have my arms around how much -- or if there's a way you can quantify what the delta between GAAP and cash taxes will likely be over the next couple of years.","Moray P. Dewhurst","The short answer is not off the top of my head. Let me think about that some, Michael, and I will follow up with you.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, I would just -- you can kind of look at the deferred tax balances, the asset liability on the balance sheet and recognize this could be a significant source of cash for both Energy Resources and the parent, obviously depending what happens with bonus D&A. Just trying to get my arms -- trying to quantify that a little bit. Happy to follow up off-line.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, okay, I see where you're going. Yes, at that level, based on current tax law, we would expect to again, be a cash taxpayer in 2014. And once we're back in that mode, then we start to draw down the deferred balances very rapidly. So you're absolutely right, in terms of the direction and the, sort of, the trend there. But that is also, as you point out, dependent on tax law. And the biggest single factor that has caused us to be -- not to be a cash taxpayer for several years, as well as many other people in the industry, is bonus depreciation. So if bonus gets extended at 100%, then that clearly just pushes out the time at which we put back to being a cash taxpayer. But I'll follow up with you off-line to talk about more of the details of that.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and last question, why -- from an accounting perspective, why leave the $0.06 at Energy Resources tied to the unwind of the hedges, why leave that in adjusted EPS?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Basically, because the position has been resolved so that the mark on those hedges that we would otherwise have kept in NQH against an unmarked asset is now sort of out in the open and clean. So one way to think about it is effectively, we have drawn forward in time earnings that we otherwise would have expected to have realized over time.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Chin with Citi.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question on Seabrook. The year-over-year effect of $0.04, is that primarily driven by just simply lower hedged prices and energy sales prices per megawatt hour? Or is there more of a terawatt hour effect from running the plant at a lower capacity level?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, there's 2 effects. There is the hedge prices. There's a lower hedge price impact, but the bigger impact is just lower output from the plant.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And should we assume that, that lower output level will persist until we get to the next outage in October of this year? Is that the right way to think about that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, exactly. We're constrained because of the limits on our ability to cool the parts of a generator to lower output, and that will be resolved once we get to the refueling outage in the fall.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Moray, would love to also talk about the upstream gas. Can you talk about the other side of the equation, which is, what is the current investment in that upstream gas business, and sort of, what prevents you from having to write down some of those investments, sort of while you're realizing the benefit in the hedges from the lower gas prices? And then a tag onto that, just sort of, now with the look forward, where we are in gas prices, sort of, what's your commitment to the upstream gas business?","Moray P. Dewhurst","In terms of the answer to the first, about $600 million is -- has been invested in the business. On the second part of your question, let me make sure that -- I may not have been clear. This is basically closing out hedges against wells that we don't intend to commit capital to. So there's no investment against them. We entered into the hedges against expected output. And now we're not going to pursue them, so we simply close out the hedge, which is in the money. I mean, effectively, you've got an option when you do that. If prices move up or down a little bit, you go ahead with the drilling program and you have your expected margin on the wells. If prices drop significantly at some point, they drop enough that it becomes -- and the money value of the hedges exceeds the margin that you expect to make on the wells. In which case, you don't drill the wells and you just close out the hedges. So that's what we've done in a few instances. So as we were discussing earlier, I think with Dan, it's -- the way to think about that is it's a capital reallocation opportunity. It means the future capital that we thought would go into one set of wells is now potentially available to go into other sets of wells, so that the result is not any issue of impairment. Wells that we have committed to, obviously will be subject to the standard accounting impairment test. But that's really not an issue right now. And then in the course of answering the first 2 parts, I lost track of your third part of your question.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","No, no, absolutely, and I fully understood the accounting here. What I'm trying to get at -- and maybe the best way is the last question, which is you're realizing benefits from closing out hedges in wells you decided not to drill, but it obviously says something about the future prospects of that business, if nothing else, on the wells you've decided not to drill. Talk a little bit about sort of your commitment to that business on an ongoing basis.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Okay. I see where you're going. Yes, I think certain parts of the -- but obviously the weaker, lower expected output dry gas plays are a lot less attractive in a low gas environment. So you see capital moving away from those kinds of plays. At least what we're seeing is there are still plenty of good opportunities out there. But, I guess, I just go back to things that I've just spoken to many folks about over the last few weeks. In the end, natural gases market, like any other, are subject to both supply and demand effects. So as you see strong downward pressure on prices going forward, you're going to see both demand side reactions and supply side reactions. On the supply side, you're clearly going to see a combination of capital moving away from more marginal areas and concentrating on the most productive ones. You will, over time, see a reduction in the aggregate capital being deployed relative to what it would otherwise been. To me, it's just the normal workings of supply and demand. The critical questions are, what time frame -- over what time frame is that all going to work out? And I think what we have seen, really in the last year or so, is a general revision in market expectations that while there will be a reaction, both on the supply and the demand side, it's probably going to take longer than people were thinking a year or so ago. We would certainly concur with that. I would also underline that there are both short-term effects and longer-term effects. And the short term can be very quite different, obviously, because physical constraints on storage, you can get into situations as we've had this year where there's really no place for the gas to go, and that puts a very strong downward pressure on the front end of the curve. We still like a small participation in the business. And I just emphasized again that we have developed a tremendous amount of information value out of participating in this. It has significantly affected our hedging decisions over the last few years. And clearly, our participation there has been responsible for a lot of the in-the-money value that we now have in our existing power and gas hedges.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. On a sort of related question, I was hoping, Moray, you could talk a bit about Gexa and the Texas retail. Obviously a year ago, we were seeing the negative impacts of the Texas freeze and just sort of how that business performed in the first quarter.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Gexa had a good first quarter. I don't know that there's much special to report on there. Obviously, the interest is all focused on the summer months. I'm sure you've been following what's been happening to [indiscernible] Texas over the summer. We have made some changes to the way that we're approaching the management, the execution of the Texas portfolio, that should leave us in a better position for a tight summer. But I will also reemphasize what I've said before, which is a competitive supply business like Gexa is going to be hurt in extreme market conditions. So we look to offset that in the other parts of the portfolio.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","No, that's perfect. And the last question, just sort of if you could give me an idea of the current status of your re-contracting efforts around Duane Arnold. Alliant has been somewhat vocal about sort of not going forward with the re-contracting when the contract expires in February of '14, and just sort of what you view as sort of your side of it and then what your alternatives are.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. We are pursuing a number of different possibilities there. There are lots of customers in that part of the country, and we have had a number of discussions and expressions of interest. I think it's still early in that whole process. So clearly, the market is different from what it was when we entered into the original contract, and we understand that and we have that reflected in our expectations. But I'm confident that we will have an appropriate mix of re-contracting when the time comes.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, to be doing similarly, you don't expect it to be with Alliant as the off-taker?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I'm not going to get into individual names.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just wanted to touch base with you guys on the production tax credit versus the CITCs. Could you just tell us what they were for the quarter?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. Bear with me one second while I find the right sheet. It was 450 megawatts that we expect to take this year, amounts to about $50 million of CITC over the course of the year. The first quarter was heavily loaded. It was about 20 of that because we have one project that went into service in the quarter. So I guess all of it's CITC then.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, and then the production tax credit?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, PTCs would be on the remaining 850 megawatts or so. Whatever that amounts to, I haven't got the -- but recognize that most of those projects come in, in the third and fourth quarters, so they're not going to have a great deal of impact on 2012.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then the O&M, I noticed it increased. Of course, your wind productions increased as well. Is that pretty much the reason why? Or is there anything else we should be thinking about?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No, there was only about $0.01 altogether from O&M and other operating --nothing significant there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, and then just finally on Seabrook, just to understand this, just a follow-up on Brian's question. There's -- the majority of the $0.04 is because of this cooling issue, which should be resolved in the fall. Is that correct? So we should basically be thinking of that not being an issue, I guess, in 2000 -- in the next year, correct?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think it's about $0.02 or $0.03 of that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","A quarter?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Of the $0.04, about $0.02 or $0.03 is associated with the down power.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, so should see that over the next couple quarters, but then that will be gone going forward after the changes that are made?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, I think that's roughly right. I'm trying -- I don't know. Depending on the shape of the pricing of the hedges, I don't know. But roughly that, yes. All right, just a follow up on that, I've just been passed a slipped a paper telling me that the total impact of the down power for the full year is about $25 million. Makes sense.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to clarify your comments about getting your 2014 aspiration regardless of what happens in Congress, can we imply that if Washington can get its act together and we do get a PTC extension, there's upside to that forecast?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, absolutely. If -- we tried to present the expectations on this basis because there was certainly, at one time, a fair amount of confusion about what we had built into the numbers and what we didn't, so what's here is only the projects that we have in backlog. So to the extent that a policy support is continued in some form or another and we are able to translate that into additional projects that can get done in the '13, '14 time frame, that would clearly be upside. So just to repeat, we have no U.S. wind in the expectations at this stage beyond 2012.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And since your forecast assumes no tax credit extension, do you have built into that forecast a share repurchase?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Certainly, in terms of the numbers that we put out there, how we get there is with the expectation of some share repurchase out in 2014. Again, I want emphasize that, that's by no means a commitment and it does depend, as we repeatedly said, on whether or not we're able to find additional good attractive investment opportunity. But if we are not, we would definitely be in a position to contemplate returning cash to shareholders in 2014.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And what's your preferred method of returning cash? Is it -- would it be dividend or actually return of capital to share repurchase?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think it would clearly depend on the circumstances at the time and I guess, 2 scenarios that I would throw out to think about, depending on how we saw the future going forward from 2014. To the extent that we saw the free cash flow positive balance as being sustained over a multi-year period, then I think, other things equal, we'd be more inclined to go the dividend route. To the extent that we saw it as a temporary phenomenon with the investment opportunities coming back a year or 2 later, I think we'd be more inclined to contemplate the repurchase route. But that's just kind of thinking out loud and obviously, it would depend on the actual facts and circumstances at the time. Fortunately, we have time to think about that, and obviously we a lot of work to do to get out to 2014.","Operator","We'll go next to Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.","Ashar Khan","Moray, can I just -- going to Slide 5, which shows the impact of regulated earnings on FPL year-over-year, and if I'm right, you mentioned the $0.07 came from the increase in rate base. And if one was to make the assumption because you mentioned you're going to be adding rate base for the year and 1\/4 is in the first quarter and I guess, can we expect this $0.07 to repeat every quarter because of the spending going forward in the year?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I haven't looked at the exact profile of capital spending. So I could not say for sure that we're going to be at that level consistently. I fact, I kind of doubt we will be. I suspect this is a fairly intensive quarter of growth, just thinking about the overall growth in capital employed. So I wouldn't extrapolate from that.","Ashar Khan","Okay, and then just on the clause, was that clause just -- I guess, the nuclear upgrade expansion is an ongoing thing. Was the solar like -- isn't that also ongoing? Or is that again front-end loaded in the quarter?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Really the entire clause impact is coming from the -- material is coming from the nuclear operate.","Ashar Khan","Okay, so that expenditure, if I'm right, continues on the whole year.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Correct.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo.","Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, so I'm going to go a default question. What has been the generic feedback on the Florida rate case filing? All the -- last time around, you tried to focus on the base rate aspects of it and deemphasize the fuel. Just wondering what the uptake has been sort of to date.","Moray P. Dewhurst","I don't know, but I could say it has been a lot of reaction. I think the basic elements of the rate case were understood when we made the test year [ph] letter in filings, so I'm not sure that there's been a great deal of a reaction so far. I think that, in addition, that the basic drivers of that need for rate relief are well-understood. So we're beginning to get into the process of discovery in which the interveners ask for all kinds of documents and all kinds of responses to questions, and I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary there.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference.

Welcome to the NextEra Energy Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Julie Holmes. Please go ahead.","Julie Holmes","Thank you, Dana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power & Light Company. Moray will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duties to update any forward-looking statements.","Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted earnings which are non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong financial results in 2013 while continuing to execute on the objectives we shared with you at our investor conference in March.","At FPL, we continue to execute on our large construction projects, focused on productivity and cost effectiveness and identified and made substantial progress on our incremental capital investment opportunities. Achieving these objectives will help us to continue to deliver the best customer value in the state and one of the best in the nation.","Also at FPL, the Florida Public Service Commission gave its approval for the natural gas transportation capacity contracts that will provide a commercial basis for a new third pipeline into the state, which ultimately will benefit all Floridians. This is an essential first step to enable Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection pipeline projects to move towards construction.","At Energy Resources, we continue to execute on our backlog in U.S. and Canadian wind projects and met our milestones for the development of our U.S. solar portfolio. We also remain focused on further developing our U.S. wind portfolio and securing incremental solar opportunities.","In our Transmission business, we commissioned the Lone Star Transmission line during the first quarter on time and under budget. As we discussed last quarter, we were awarded development rights by the Ontario Energy Board to develop the East-West Tie Line Transmission Project with our partners Enbridge and Borealis, and we continue to pursue a number of other transmission opportunities in North America. Overall, 2013 was a very strong year that positions us well for 2014 and beyond.","At FPL, our strategy is founded on offering the best customer value in the state and on finding ways to improve our value delivery over time. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to deploy capital that improves productivity and leads to cost savings that will benefit our customers and help keep rates low for the long term. In 2013, we invested approximately $2.9 billion at FPL, with approximately $700 million of this associated with our pre-modernizations. Our Cape Canaveral modernization entered service in April ahead of schedule and more than $100 million under budget. The Riviera Beach modernization is on budget and slightly ahead of schedule, and we expect this new efficient plant to enter service in the second quarter. We continue to expect to bring a modernized Port Everglades plant into service in mid-2016.","As a reminder, FPL settlement agreement provides the base rate increases to recover the capital and operating costs in the modernizations at Cape Canaveral, Riviera Beach and Port Everglades as the plants enter service. Together, we estimate that the 3 modernized plants will provide customer benefits and more than $1 billion over their operational lifetimes.","Early in the year, we successfully completed the extended power upgrades at our 4 nuclear units which added more than 500 megawatts of clean emissions free energy to our fleet. We also completed the installation of approximately 4.5 million smart meters in our service territory, which is part of our Energy Smart Florida program and began to realize benefits from the more reliable and efficient infrastructure that the program helps enable. Our day-to-day system reliability remains in the top quartile nationwide, and our customer satisfaction scores increased in 2013.","At Energy Resources, we continue to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities. As we noted during the fourth quarter earnings call last year, we anticipated 2013 would be a down year for new wind installations compared to our record year in 2012, but we remain encouraged as we move into 2014 and 2015.","In addition to the 1,175 megawatts of new wind projects that we had previously announced, we signed contracts of 250 megawatts of projects since our last earnings call, bringing our total U.S. wind development program for 2013 through 2015 to 1,425 megawatts. Of this total, we commissioned 250 megawatts during 2013 all in the fourth quarter. Based on everything we see at the moment, we believe our total of 2013 to 2015 U.S. wind program could be 2,000 to 2,500 megawatts.","In Canada, we brought roughly 125 megawatts into service during 2013 and expect the remaining 466 megawatts in our backlog to enter service by the end of 2015, with the majority expected to come into service in 2014.","You may recall that as of the March investor conference last year, our backlog of contracted U.S. solar projects consisted of roughly 800 megawatts. Of that backlog, both Genesis and Desert Sunlight were partially commissioned during the fourth quarter with 280 megawatts entering service between the 2 projects. We also completed our 20-megawatt Mountain View project earlier this month. The remaining 245 megawatts in Genesis and Desert Sunlight are expected to enter service in 2014, and our 250 megawatts McCoy project is progressing on schedule and is expected to come into service in 2015 and 2016.","We had a successful year meeting our objectives for new U.S. solar development and signed contracts for 290 megawatts of projects, which are expected to come into service by the end of 2016. The balance of our contracted U.S. solar backlog is now 785 megawatts.","Let me now walk through our results for the quarter and the full year. We will begin with results at FPL and then discuss Energy Resources and the consolidated numbers.","For the fourth quarter of 2013, FPL reported net income of $248 million or $0.57 per share, down $0.04 per share year-over-year. For the full year, FPL reported net income of $1.35 billion or $3.16 per share, up $0.20 per share versus 2012. As a reminder, our results include the transition costs associated with Project Momentum that I spoke about last quarter. This includes the negative impact of roughly $0.03 in the quarter and approximately $0.07 for the full year.","2013 marked another year of continued investment in infrastructure projects, which helped improve our overall customer value proposition and was also the largest driver of our growth in contribution to earnings per share. We saw a decline in clause contribution to earnings per share as the completed nuclear upgrade projects were moved from clause to base rates with only a minor impact on net income. As I noted earlier, FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.9 billion. And as a result, our regulatory capital employed grew 10.4% year-over-year, and this translated to net income growth of 8.8%.","Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 10.96%. This includes the impact of the Project Momentum transition costs. Absent these costs, regulatory ROE for the year would have been 11.25%.","As we noted last quarter, under the current rate agreement, we record reserved amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each period, in this case, the 11.25% that I just mentioned, excluding special charges, such as the Project Momentum transition costs.","During the quarter, we reversed $54 million of reserve amortization recorded earlier in the year in order to achieve this predetermined ROE. For the full year, we amortized $155 million and have roughly $245 million remaining. This leaves us in a slightly better position than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. You will recall that we had always expected 2013 to require the use of more reserve amortization than any of the remaining years of the agreement.","The Florida economy continues to strengthen and most of the indicators we track are improving. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in December was 6.2%, which was down once again versus the prior month, down 1.7 percentage points since December 2012 and down 5.2 percentage points from the all-time high of 11.4% at nearly 4 years ago. This is now the state's lowest unemployment rate since June 2008. The number of jobs in Florida was up 192,000 compared to a year earlier, and December was the 41st consecutive month with positive job growth in Florida following more than 3 years of job losses. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth, and more than 462,000 private sector jobs have been added since December 2010.","The housing market in Florida also continues to show signs of resiliency. Housing permits in Florida jumped 25% over last November versus a U.S. gain of 8%, and mortgage delinquency rates and the inventory of existing homes in Florida continue to decline. The Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 16% from the prior year.","Other data released in 2013 suggest that Florida once again has a very attractive business climate compared to many other states. The U.S. Census Bureau now estimates that Florida's population increased by more than 230,000 people over the 12-month period that ended July 1 of last year, and many analysts now project that Florida will pass New York as America's third largest state sometime in 2014. Overall, Florida's economy is progressing well and is poised for further growth.","As we discussed throughout the year, we continue to see our customer metrics at FPL improve moderately. Underlying usage per customer increased 1.0% compared to the same quarter last year. For the full year, underlying usage per customer grew 0.4% compared to 2012. We expect long-term usage growth of approximately 0.5% net of the impacted efficiency and conservation programs through the period of the rate agreement.","Another encouraging development during the quarter was a decrease in the percentage of low usage customers, the 12-month average of the low-usage percentage has fallen to 8.2%, its lowest level since December 2007. The number of inactive accounts has also continued to decline, reaching its lowest level since 2005.","During the fourth quarter, we also saw the largest increase in customers since late 2007, with approximately 80,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2012, representing an increase of 1.7%. While this is clearly positive, roughly half of the increase can be attributable to the roll out of our remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by our smart meter program that we highlighted on our third quarter call. These new customers, which are disproportionately low-usage and residential, have a lower impact on our sales. We estimate that customer growth accounted for about 0.8% increase in sales in the fourth quarter and 0.6% for the full year.","Overall, we are seeing continued improvement in our customer data, and we continue to believe that Florida will experience above-average growth over the long term.","Turning to our incremental development efforts. We have several updates to share regarding our progress. FPL's storm hardening plan was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in November, and the incremental reliability investments we are making to strengthen the system remain on track. Excluding our major generation capital projects, we plan to invest approximately $7.8 billion to $8.3 billion over the 2013 to 2016 period in our hardening and reliability efforts, as well as all our other infrastructure investments. This also includes fuel for our 4 Florida nuclear units.","During the quarter and following further discussion with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, FPL withdrew its petition for the peaker upgrade project. We are currently working with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to perform additional emissions monitoring to measure our existing peakers impact on local air quality. We expect to file a new petition and supporting testimony once we have a clearer idea of the scope of upgrades that will be required. The monitoring could extend up to 1 year, and while it is too early to comment on the scope or timing of the project, we believe the ultimate solution may require us to deploy less capital than we had originally anticipated.","The Florida pipeline, which includes NextEra Energy's minority interest in the Sabal Trail Transmission joint venture and our wholly owned subsidiary, Florida Southeast Connection, continues to move through the regulatory process. The PSC's approval of the contract is now final. FERC approval is expected sometime in 2015, and construction is anticipated to be completed in mid-2017. Looking forward, financial results from the pipeline projects will be reported as part of our Corporate & Other business segment, and so in future earnings releases, we will discuss developments in the Corporate & Other section.","Let me turn now to Energy Resources, which reported fourth quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of $85 million or $0.20 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $173 million or $0.40 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter decreased $0.02 from last year, with greater contributions from new investments in gas infrastructure being slightly more than offset by corporate G&A and existing assets. All other effects were minor.","For the full year 2013, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $556 million or $1.30 per share. Adjusted earnings were $780 million or $1.83 per share, up $0.17 or 10% from the prior year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter 2012 call, we expected to see growth return in 2013 as some of the headwinds experienced in 2012 subsided and our new investments contributed meaningfully to earnings and so it proved.","For the full year 2013, the $0.17 increase in adjusted EPS was driven by several factors. Contributions from our new investments added $0.31, with $0.04 coming from an increase in CITCs. We elected CITCs for roughly 280 megawatts of solar projects in 2013 compared to approximately 455 megawatts of wind projects in 2012. The greater capital cost of solar projects accounts for the increase from 2012 to 2013.","Contribution from gas infrastructure increased $0.04 over the prior year, primarily as a result of additional production. These positives were offset by increased corporate G&A and other costs of $0.12, of which $0.03 for transition costs associated with Project Momentum. Lower contributions from existing investments in 2013 negatively affected the comparison to last year by $0.03. All other effects were minor.","Looking forward, we expect to elect CITCs on roughly 265 megawatts of new solar generation in 2014. As we did last year, we have included a summary in the appendix of the presentation that compares our realized equivalent EBITDA to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2012. Generally speaking, we came in within the ranges we had anticipated.","During the year, we placed approximately 375 megawatts of wind into service. We also reached production levels of nearly 30 million megawatt hours during 2013, the highest level in company history. We estimate that overall wind resource was a couple of points below the long-term average.","Of the roughly 30 million megawatt hours of production, approximately 60% were eligible for PTCs. The remainder represents output from projects on which we had elected CITCs, projects that have passed their 10-year window of eligibility for PTCs or Canadian projects. Nearly 50% of the PTCs generated were allocated to investors under the differential membership interest of tax equity partnerships we have entered into that allow us to monetize the tax benefits from our renewables projects more efficiently.","As shown on the accompanying slide, the percentage of PTCs allocated to investors grew in 2013, and we expect that proportion to continue to grow to between 55% and 60% in 2014, as we see the full year impact of our 2013 tax equity partnerships flow through.","Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the fourth quarter of 2013, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $327 million or $0.75 per share. NextEra Energy's 2013 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $414 million and $0.95, respectively. For the full year 2013, the company's GAAP net income was $1.9 billion or $4.47 per share. Adjusted earnings were approximately $2.1 billion or $4.97 per share.","The Corporate & Other segment improved slightly relative to 2012, as earnings from our Lone Star business increased, but were offset by residual interest in taxes. For the full year 2013, on an adjusted basis, the Corporate & Other segment was up $0.03 from 2012, driven by growth in the regulated transmission segment. In 2014, we expect annual contribution to earnings from this segment to improve modestly.","2013 marked another year of significant capital investment for both FPL and Energy Resources, exceeding our internally generated cash flows by about $1 billion. Our treasury team executed on approximately $7 billion worth of financing transactions across a wide range of capital sources, including refinancing and various capital optimization opportunities. These were designed to meet our capital needs, while also supporting our balance sheet and credit strength, which are central to our business strategies.","In addition to a variety of conventional debt issuances, we continue to make use of project debt to support growth at Energy Resources and we also sold additional differential membership interests to efficiently utilize tax credits generated by new wind projects. We also issued $500 million of equity units to ensure we have the equity support needed during this transitional period of high capital expenditures. These will convert to straight common equity in 2016, at which time they will be integrated into our ongoing financing program.","As we indicated on our third quarter earnings call, our equity needs are dependent on our success in firming up incremental investment opportunities that we outlined at our March investor conference. We expected to need to issue at least $1 billion in equity before the end of 2014 to achieve our target credit metrics.","During the quarter, we entered into transactions to issue approximately $1 billion in equity. And when considering our current capital expenditure program, our target credit metrics remain on track. As a reminder, our growth in cash flow naturally picks up as our large construction projects enter service, so additional equity needs from hereon will primarily depend on whether or not we see additional incremental capital expenditures that affect 2014 meaningfully.","In light of the progress made against our execution objectives, we continue to be comfortable with the 2014 adjusted EPS expectations we shared with you last spring at $5.05 to $5.45 per share. And for the longer-term outlook, we continue to see adjusted EPS growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off a 2012 base.","As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. In the appendix, we've provided a number of sensitivities around our 2014 expectations.","We expect the majority of the adjusted EPS growth in 2014 to come in the second half of the year and the fourth quarter comparison should be particularly strong, given the impact of Project Momentum transition costs in the fourth quarter of 2013. While we have already begun to see significant benefits from Project Momentum, we expect these to continue to increase as we go through the year, making for stronger growth comparisons in the second half of the year.","In addition, we expect the first quarter for Energy Resources to be challenged by the difficult market conditions we're seeing so far this year in the mid-Atlantic region caused by extremely cold weather and limitations on natural gas supply. This will likely have a negative impact on any business, including our full requirements portfolio in the Northeast with fixed price load obligations. While some elements of our portfolio have benefited from these conditions, we expect the full requirements business in the Northeast to underperform under these extreme conditions.","For the full year 2014 at Energy Resources, we expect somewhat lower growth in adjusted earnings than we enjoyed in 2013. While we expect continued strong contributions from new contracted renewables projects, both solar and wind, we expect the existing portfolio will be down year-over-year as we have 4 nuclear refueling outages scheduled, as well as the ongoing impact of PTC roll-offs. In addition, we expect interest expense to be higher, not only because of a larger capital base but also because of the impact of higher rates.","Finally, at FPL, growth in the wholesale segment should be an important driver of growth overall in 2014, but variability around wholesale load will consequently become a source of variability for FPL earnings as well.","With regard to the longer-term outlook, we continue to see the 5% to 7% range through 2016 translating to an expected adjusted earnings per share range of $5.50 to $6 as reasonable. However, 2016 is still a long way off and many factors could change our expectations.","Since the investor conference last March, we've seen many favorable developments, some of which have clearly moved our 2016 expectations up within the broad range we have outlined. On the other hand, we're also seeing some negative developments, such as rising interest rates, which must temper our expectations. And many of the projects on which we have made progress will drive earnings in 2017 and beyond more than 2016. Overall, we continue to believe the $5.50 to $6 range is reasonable given all the data we have at the moment, and we are working hard to ensure we are as high as possible within that range.","Over the past months, we have continued our evaluation of ways to efficiently recycle capital invested in Energy Resources projects, including so-called yieldco structures. While we are not yet at a point of making a decision, we can share with you a few thoughts. Many of you who have volunteered your thoughts on the impact that forming a yieldco might have on NextEra, and we thank you for your input which we consider seriously. We've also explored further a range of possible private transactions, including structures analogous to a public yieldco. As a result, there are 5 general points which we can emphasize.","First, we are committed to the general policy of recycling capital, both to promote efficient capital utilization and to maintain an appropriate portfolio balance. We expect to concentrate on deploying capital where we believe we have the potential to create value, typically, though not necessarily, in the earliest stages of project development and operations. And we expect to reduce capital investment in areas where we believe we have optimized project structure and operations and\/or where others may have lower capital costs. Typically, though not necessarily, projects that are more mature in their operations and life cycle position.","Second, in executing this policy of recycling capital, we will continue to be opportunistic, trying to find what we believe are the best structure and the best markets for each situation as it emerges. Even if we pursue a more general structure such as a yieldco, we expect there will continue to be individual transactions outside this framework, such as individual or small portfolio sales to specific investors, as well as project financings and tax equity partnerships.","Third, our continuing assessment over the past few weeks suggest to us that the public form of yieldco has some clear advantages over the private forms we have also been considering. In particular, we have come to believe that valuation levels are likely to be lower for the private format, at least in today's economic environment, and that there is less likelihood that those valuation levels will be reflected back on the stock of sponsor, the so-called readthrough effect. Of course, these are our considered judgments for there is no analytical way to be sure and there could be no guarantee that we are right. Based on these and other considerations, however, we think it is unlikely that we will pursue a private version.","Fourth, as we have previously said, our focus is on sustained value creation for our shareholders. The mere fact that public yieldco vehicles may trade well in today's environment is not in itself a sufficient argument to go forward with one. We recognize that the question of value creation is ultimately one of judgment, but we want to be sure that when we reach a judgment, it is based on a best information available.","Fifth, as we have also previously stated, were we to pursue a public yieldco, we would want to be sure that it was structured so it not negatively to impact our corporate credit position, which we continue to view as an important element in our competitive strategy at Energy Resources. Again, however, I need to emphasize that we have made no decision one way or the other. We continue to examine a wide range of practical issues, including structuring, tax, governance, portfolio composition, interaction with existing financing arrangements and ongoing reporting and compliance issues.","Finally, while we will continue to take a deliberate approach to resolving the questions we have and reaching a considered judgment, we hope to be in a position to give you a clearer assessment before the end of the second quarter.","Before taking your questions, let me conclude with a summary of our key areas of focus for 2014. At FPL, our focus will continue to be on excellence in execution. We will strive to deliver the best value in the state to our customers and we will continue with the execution of our major capital initiatives, including the 2 remaining modernizations, our storm hardening program and our system reliability initiatives. We will also seek to finalize our determination of the upgrades that will be needed for our peaking facilities to meet future environmental standards.","Supporting our strategy at FPL, we will be pursuing the successful development of the Florida Southeast Connection and Sabal Trail pipeline projects, with emphasis on being in a position for timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals.","At Energy Resources, we will continue to focus on excellence in day-to-day operations and we will continue to advance the development of our industry-leading portfolio of contracted renewables projects. In particular, we will be looking to extend our strong backlog of projects into 2015 and beyond.","And at NextEra Energy Transmission, we will be focused on reliable operations and successful development of new project opportunities. Across all our businesses, we will have a special focus on implementing the many initiatives that emerged from Project Momentum, a competitively strong cost position continues to be an underpinning of our strategies across all businesses.","At the Corporate level, we will seek to finance our activities in a way that supports our strong credit position and ensures that our credit metrics continue to improve on the part we have laid out for you.","And with that, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Dan Eggers at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Before we get run over on the yieldco conversation, I guess if you could just talk a little bit about the wind portfolio and the difference between expected generation additions and what you have under contract, and when do you think those 2 numbers merge into a final decided number for '14, '15?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, if we go back to the investor conference last year. That time, we were talking about expectations for U.S. wind program for 2013 and 2014 with a range of 500 to 1,500. So what's happened since then really is, in particular with the IRS clarification of some of the language around eligibility for that PTC, we can clearly see a path to extend that program from 2013, 2014 to 2013 through 2015. So based on that and what we're seeing in the marketplace, we've revised upwards our view of the total portfolio opportunities, so that's the 2,000 to 2,500. And as you can see from the numbers, we're close to 1,500 already in the backlog, so that means we see the potential for another 500 to 1,000 of projects that could be contracted from here on. The timing of that will play out over the course of the year since, at this point, we're really thinking of it as a program through 2015. Anything that's going to come in service before the end of 2015, we really are going to have to have the contracting piece wrapped up by close to the end of this year. So we should know a lot more about where we are by the end of this year.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess just kind of on the yieldco, thanks for giving more detail on the thought process. But when you look at some of the decision points you have setting out there, what do you need to get comfortable with the impact on the credit ratings for the corporate? Is that an agency's conversation and a modeling conversation on your side? And then I guess, when you think about sustained value creation in a public equity, what do you need to see to get comfortable whether that's a durable opportunity or not?","Moray P. Dewhurst","All right. Well, I guess, first, I just kind of repeat the list in the prepared remarks. I mean, we're still working through a lot of the practical issues, structuring, tax, governance, composition of portfolio, all of those kinds of things. Certainly, the credit impact is very important to us. That's a function both of modeling and obviously of conversations and feedback with the agencies. I'm sure many of you are aware that Moody's put out a general piece on the subject of yieldco, which essentially says that the impact on credit depends, and so we want to push further to make sure we understand exactly what that dependence looks like, so it's going to be a variety of things like that. On the question of the sustained value creation, again, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, ultimately, that comes down to a judgment call. I think we clearly have some evidence just through the passage of time that helps provide us some input on that. But that's just something that we're going to have to reach a point of comfort with on a judgmental basis, and we're not at that point yet.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess the last one. As you guys think about NextEra as a whole, how comfortable is the board with the idea of perspectively changing the rate of growth for the consolidated company from 5% to 7% to something else if you were to allocate more growth to the yieldco design?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I think that, that really, the answer to that has really subsumed in the overall question of, is there a value creation opportunity for NextEra Energy shareholders if the trade up in growth that you're talking about ultimately run the results in greater value for our shareholders, and I think that's clearly a very positive factor.","Operator","We'll go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wondered if you could just talk broadly about renewable economics that you're seeing in terms of improvements in the technology kind of the PPA levels in general that you're seeing. If you could just talk sort of holistically about the competitive dynamic for renewables as you're seeing, do you see the technology improvements helping to extend that market? How are the competitive dynamics out there?","Moray P. Dewhurst","A couple of general comments, and I'll ask Armando to expand. But just as a reminder for folks, we've seen very substantial improvements in wind economics driven by technology, larger machines, taller towers, longer blades, to the point where, as I think most people know, in a strong wind regime, it's possible to sign a long-term PPA with prices in with a 2 panels on them and still get acceptable returns. So in many parts of the country today, including the impact of the PTC, wind is the most economic form of new energy generation. We've also seen significant improvement on the solar side to PV with panel prices coming down, but solar is a much more limited market focused on primarily the Desert Southwest and a few other areas. So that's been the general trend. Relative to that general trend, I wouldn't say that in the last 6 to 9 months, there's been any major departure. But let me ask Armando now to comment on how that's playing out in market dynamics.","Armando Pimentel","Yes, I'd agree obviously with all of that. The couple points I would add is, interestingly enough, I think we've talked about this before, in some areas of the country, we are seeing where solar is crowding out wind. The economics of solar have clearly improved across the board. It's not just the overall cost of the panel or the balance of the plant, but it's also small changes in efficiency. So although wind economics have clearly improved in some areas of the countries, primarily the west and the southwest, it's clear that solar is a better alternative. That's the first point I'd make. The second point I'd make is, a couple of years ago, we've talked about seeing more RFPs on the solar side, which we thought was a clear positive. We continue to see that. We continue to see that even in states that don't have requirements -- renewable portfolio standards for solar. So we were encouraged by that. We're seeing them all the way up through the Canada border and all the way down to Mexico. So I think that's a real positive for solar that we will continue to see.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Well, that's helpful. Then just as a follow-up on the yieldco. For a public option, I know one of your objectives has been to think about aligning incentives, ensuring that there is an alignment there. When you think about aligning incentives, would -- an approach where there are incentive payments along the lines what we see in the world of MLPs be something that could be a tool to achieve that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Potentially, that's certainly a whole area that we're looking at and we think it's important, that there be as close an alignment of interests as possible.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So incentive payments in general, that's an area that you're focused on and thinking about that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. We're certainly studying how that has worked out in the MLP space, is there a way of incorporating some of those elements into different structures, all of those kinds of things, yes.","Operator","And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first -- hitting the yieldco first off. What is it about end of second quarter? Is there something you're waiting for in particular? I just wanted to get a little bit more of a sense as to data points you might be looking for the market to get -- to make this decision? And when it comes to valuation discrepancy that you commented on of late, is it something that you see in the public market or is it something in the private market that is really driving the discrepancy in the valuations in your mind? Just to make it a little clearer.","Moray P. Dewhurst","The answer to the second question is really based on the market feedback that we've been observing on both sides over the last few months. So again, I want to stress that that's a judgment call because, obviously, unless you went out with a particular structure hypothetically in two parallel universes, 1 public and 1 private, you'll never really know. But that's what we are seeing based on our reading of the market data. On the bigger question of the timing, I appreciate that we are being frustrating to a number of folks out there, there's no one particular thing in the outside world that I can point you to like this is more a function of the ongoing process that we are working through. I think I've mentioned to a number of folks that I've met with over the past 6 months, that it seems like every session we have with our team internally, they answer a series of questions that we have and that turns to [ph] more questions. So we're continuing to work methodically through questions, but I do think that we will be in a position to give you an update by the end of the second quarter.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then looking at the supply business, obviously, you tweaked '14 expectations. How do you think about that in '15 onwards? Is this kind of a one-time impact from the first quarter's event or should we kind of structurally think about revising expectations from that segment?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, we're going to have to see. We'll just have to see how the quarter actually plays out. I mean, there's a big difference between what's happening or what's been happening in NEPOOL versus what's been happening in PJM, obviously. And so, in part, what the future looks like depends upon how rapidly the gas transportation constraints open up in different parts of that region. So clearly, the dynamics of the business and the pricing of that business are going to change going forward, but we'll have to see. We're certainly not going to change our return expectations for that business, so we will definitely expect to see higher pricing in the future.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And then just turning to the utility real quickly. You've talked a little bit in the past about opportunities to add E&P assets potentially within the portfolio to lock in pricing. Where are you with respect to that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I would say that we are still in the very early days. And just as a background for everybody, after we worked through the opportunities to improve the efficiency of the generation fleet that made a huge impact on our fuel consumption and over the long term, reduces our expected fuel bill, which we passed through to the customer very substantially. What remains is still a substantial portion of the bill and it is subject to volatility, although we don't see gas prices going up to -- back up to the 2007 levels, there's clearly volatility in there. So it certainly seems to us that anything that we could do that would help lower long-term costs of that component and in particular, to reduce its volatility, will be highly valuable to our customers. So that's really the motivation for thinking about E&P reserves. So we're still in the very early stages. It's important to recognize that FPL is a very, very large consumer of natural gas. And so to have a meaningful impact that's beneficial, that the customer can really see. You've got to do a lot and we're probably not going to do anything on a large scale initially. So if we do proceed down that part, anything we do, we will start on a small scale, but I don't have any particular time frame in mind on that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just quickly, lastly, in terms of the competitive dynamic with other yieldcos out there now, are you seeing more of a cost of capital compression in some of the PPAs up there? What's the dynamic, if you will?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No, we certainly haven't seen that so far that -- maybe that's a longer-term trend. But it certainly hasn't been the case so far.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Could you give us a data point on what the current PTC-eligible project number ended up coming in at the end of the year in terms of meeting that 5%?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I'm not sure I'm following your question, Steve. Could you...","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The kind of amount of potential assets that will be able to get the PTC that expired meeting that kind of 5% threshold?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Okay, I get where you're going. Yes, it's significantly larger than the upper end of what we believe is reasonable given actual market conditions. So we're not going to be constrained by the safe harboring issue.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. I guess my other question, and I apologize to beat on the yieldco, but in terms of the kind of credit analysis you're doing, could you just give us some sense of what you've heard or what the rating agencies have already said on the structure and potential impact on corporate credit?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think at this stage, Steve, I'm sorry to say, that's been -- really, the only thing I can say is, the answer is, it depends. So we're not far enough along to know what the final structure or mix would be to make sure that it's still not negative to credit.","Operator","Now we'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Guys, two questions. One on the boring side. Just looking at the quarter and even at the year at O&M at both NEER and at the Corporate level, big year-over-year uptick, so I assume NEER is tied to new projects. But just any comments you may have to add onto that.","Moray P. Dewhurst","I'm sorry, on the FPL side, O&M actually was down year-on-year.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right, NEER and Corporate.","Moray P. Dewhurst","I'm sorry, NEER and Corporate, okay. On the NEER side, it's really growth of the business. We did put a little more into development expenditures, particularly late in the year. But there's nothing unusual going on there. It's fundamentally growth in the business. It's actually less than we expected it to be at the beginning of the year because we started to see some early benefits from Project Momentum.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a solar-related question. You made a number of comments about the economics, you and Armando, about the economics of solar relative to the economics of wind. Is there any interest in NextEra in terms of the rooftop solar business? If so, what are the economics like when you look at it? How would you actually enter that business if you were to decide to do so?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, the short answer is yes, there's an interest, but let me be a little more clear when we say rooftop. That covers a wide range of territory. Sometime last year, possibly in 2012, we authorized the team to go ahead and do some basic exploration of the, I'll call it, the distributed solar space. The conclusion they came back with was that we don't see, at least at this time, an economic opportunity in the residential end of that space, which is often what people think of when they say rooftop. We do think there may be some opportunities in the C&I space. As you get towards particularly the largest C&I customers, those projects often tend to look not that different from a small utility scale project. So we are currently exploring that area, we acquired a small company that was already in that business and we have a little backlog of projects. But at this stage, I would say, that's definitely in the category of a toe in the water and we have to see how that goes. There's really -- at least at this stage, there's only useful markets for that in areas where rates are high. In Florida, we have a very low rate structures, so it's not such an economic incentive.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And finally, on the supply, the customer supply business or the retail supply business at NEER, how should we think about the worst-case scenario? I mean, we're expecting another couple of days of crazy weather here in the northeast. We've had heat rates blow out, we've had local gas prices at various northeastern gas hubs completely blow out. You've had, in prior quarters, going back to issues in Texas a year or so ago, and we've seen other companies like Reliant back in 2008 have some issues on the supply side in terms of just being caught short megawatt hours. How should investors think about what kind of the bare case outcome would that be for that business for you?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, first of all, just to say, inherent in that business, it obviously has a left tail, so when you have extreme conditions of high load and high prices, any portfolio like that is always going to underperform. How bad could it be, well, obviously, it depends upon how many days of extreme conditions you build into your anticipation. I think we'd been reasonably conservative in what we've -- what we're looking at so far. I don't think it's going to end up having a material impact on the year overall, but it's clearly going to weigh in on the first quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Shar Pourreza with Citi.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As you think about growing solar and emphasizing that part of the business more, can you maybe comment on any potential impediments or bottlenecks to the tax equity markets? Are you seeing any bottlenecks? Or a little bit of color there would be great.","Moray P. Dewhurst","On the tax equity market, I guess I would say that there is really about the same amount of capacity now than they have been for the last couple of years. Not surprisingly, we think that rates in that market are way too high and they really should come down very substantially. But there hasn't been a great deal of change the last couple of years. We also would certainly like it if there was more depth in the market. But the reality is, there's only a certain number of players. So it's perfectly adequate for the kind of scale of activity that we have and that we anticipate for the future. But like any other capital market, you'd always like that to be more depth and lower prices.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. And just one quick follow-up. As you think about potential public yieldcos, can you maybe just give us a sense on how to think about recapturing of any of kind of an ITC or PTCs for qualified assets that could drop down into a yieldco?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, one of the sort of criteria for thinking about asset suitability for yieldco is really whether they are in the PTC generation phase, because the way the yieldco vehicle would typically be structured, it would not be able to take advantage of PTCs and therefore, you would be better off -- in general, this is a general statement, might not always be true, but in general, retaining those at the sponsor level and utilizing PTCs in another way at that level. So it's really a matter of which project becomes suitable for a yieldco.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then just lastly, as you think about doing a yieldco, how much of your decision-making on whether to move forward or not is predicated on whether you see any movement in the MLP parity act?","Moray P. Dewhurst","That's really an independent issue. The decision-making that we're going through is looking at the vehicle or potential vehicles as they might exist today with today's tax law.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a quick point of clarification. So you signaled that by the end of 2Q, you will have made your decision. Should we interpret that to mean that on the 2Q earnings call is when you'll announce something, or are you retaining the flexibility going out something earlier than that? Just a little bit extra clarification on the timing.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, to be clear, we're not saying we will have necessarily made a decision by the end of the second quarter, but we certainly expect to be in a much better position to give you our overall assessment. So by that, I mean, by the quarterly earnings call, could there be something beforehand if we arrive at a decision? Yes, I suppose that's possible. I just -- I'm certainly not going to commit to anything here.","Operator","We'll go next to Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Moray, I think in your conference on -- your investor conference in March, you forewarned us that NextEra could become a much more robust cash generator in the years ahead depending on the level of capital outlays. And looking at your cash flow statement for the year, that certainly seems have been the case. Now I was hoping I might get you to talk about some of the largest drivers of the changes on the cash flow statement. So for example, I'd say that cash from operations is up by over $1 billion or 25% largely on a $1 billion increase in depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes, both of which were up by 50%. Then on the other hand, your CapEx or cash used in investment is down by almost $3 billion, which is a decline of 30%, with a net effect that your cash used in financing activities has reduced your borrowing requirement by about $3.8 billion or 75%. So those are dramatic changes, and I was just wondering if you might kind of take us through the highlights.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. I guess I'll just go back to some of the things that I'm sure people have forgotten, but we've talked about in the March investor conference last year. On the growth in the operating cash flow, first, let's focus on FPL. We knew that we were entering a new rate agreement in 2013, and one of the key benefits of that was the reduction in the amount of surplus depreciation that we were going to need, really, the completion of noncash earnings into cash. So with the initial base revenue increase and then the subsequent GBRA rate increases, we're now getting real cash returns that are commensurate with the regulatory returns. Not exactly equal but commensurate. So we knew that, that was going to drive significant growth on the FPL side. On the Energy Resources side, we had -- in 2012, we had just completed the 1,500 megawatts of U.S. wind, and so we knew that, that was going to come into service and driving cash flow on that side. So those -- and that continues going forward. As the big new projects at Energy Resources come into service out of that construction phase, they start to contribute to the growth in the operating cash flow. On the CapEx side, we knew that 2012 was going to be a peak year for CapEx. We were right at the peak of the spending on the FPL side with the nuclear upgrades, modernizations and ongoing infrastructure spending. And of course, we had not only 1,500 megawatts of U.S. wind but spending on solar projects, which were not yet anywhere near coming into service, all of that concentrated in 2012. So 2013, so that start to come down to hopefully more normal levels. So those were both the principal dynamics that we have tried to focus people on last year. And I'll just say, they came in very much where we expect it. So we're pretty much about where we expected to be on the operating cash flow, pretty much where we expect it to be on the CapEx with one exception, which is we have ended up accelerating, on the Energy Resources side, some of the capital spending. We had some opportunities to negotiate some improved pricing on some equipment, which led us to accelerating some capital spending and also because the development program has gone well. So those are the main 2 dynamics. And then, as you noted, that produces a huge swing in the free cash flow. Of course, we also did the equity -- both the equity unit, but more importantly, the $1 billion equity transaction, the combination of $400 million of straight common and the $600 million of forward late last year, so that contributed significantly, too. But it's a pretty dramatic swing, and it's reflected obviously in the credit metrics from 2013 and we expect to see, not to the same extent, but a continuation of same general trends in 2014.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Excellent. That was just what I was hoping for. Just one quick follow-up question. Your decision to reverse a portion of the depreciation and amortization that you had taken in '13 and the fourth quarter, does that stem primarily from more rapid than expected growth in volume sales, or what was the driver of that decision?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No. To be clear, just to reiterate, it's directly driven off the policies that's maintaining a target ROE, regulatory ROE. The indirect driver that you're getting at actually was that we made quicker progress on the O&M front coming out of Project Momentum than we had originally anticipated going into the year, so -- and that's why we end up with a little bit more, $245 million leftover at the end of the year. Well, I think, at the end of last year, we're anticipating we'd be somewhere around $200 million or $220 million.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it, great.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, we're feeling very good about where we are on the cost side.","Operator","And we'll take our final question today from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. First, Moray, you talked about the impact of the weather in the Northeast on your load-serving business. When we -- once we get through the season and you assess where you're at, are we going see that show up, if I'm looking at the equivalent EBITDA ranges that you gave for the different buckets in the year, will we see the impact of that show up in customer supply, power and gas trading, or in the spark spread and other line for the 1,000 megawatts or so you have in the Northeast?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, it's going to be spread across those. Obviously, it's a complex situation. The fuel requirements we book is in the customer supply line, so that will be much lower than we had originally anticipated. Some of the physical assets up there, in spark spread and other, will probably look somewhat better. How much better will remain to be seen? We'll have to see how the pure marketing and trading line looks. But there are puts and takes even within that, so there a lot of complex effects. And some parts of the portfolio have done very well, but the full requirements were clearly underperformed, and that's relatively speaking for us quite big in the northeast compared with our asset positions.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then the last question, of course, is on yieldco. When you gave your 5 sort of key issues that you're grappling with, 1 of them was that you wanted to retain the flexibility because you need to be opportunistic to find the best way to monetize each sort of asset in your portfolio. How do you marry that up with or balance that with the necessity for having a certain amount of sort of visible manufactured growth in the yieldco to attract a low enough yield to make it low enough cost of capital to be attractive? In other words, you have to promise people growth, but then you're saying you want to be opportunistic in the way you place your assets?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Right. And that's clearly 1 of, what I call, the pragmatic issues that we have to work through. We've got to make sure that if we were to pursue the yieldco path, we don't end up inadvertently compromising the value of some particular assets, which might have greater value realization that dealt with in a different way.","Operator","And that does conclude today's presentation.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Finnis. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Amanda Finnis","Thank you, Chanel. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2014 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and for NextEra Energy Partners.","With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company.","Moray will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties.","Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factor section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone.","NextEra Energy had an excellent quarter, capped off by the successful launch of NextEra Energy Partners. All parts of the NextEra portfolio performed well, and both NEE and NEP remain on track to deliver the financial expectations, including cash flow and credit metrics, that we have previously disclosed. I will provide more detail on expectations later in the call.","At Florida Power & Light, we have invested roughly $1.6 billion of capital year-to-date, consistent with our strategy of improving the long-term value we offer our customers. Our major capital projects remain on track, and we continue to expect the last of our 3 generation modernization projects at Port Everglades to come online in mid-2016. Our reliability and storm hardening initiatives are also progressing well.","In addition to these efforts to improve our electric delivery system, we are now exploring opportunities to help us deliver lower and more stable natural gas costs for our customers.","Last month, FPL announced an innovative plan to invest in long-term natural gas supplies, which I will talk about more in a moment. And we were particularly pleased to learn that FPL was named the most trusted utility in the nation based on a large nationwide sample of utility customers.","At Energy Resources, our development and construction programs remain on track, and our backlog of contracted renewables projects continues to development, with a PPA for another roughly 100 megawatts of U.S. wind signed since the last call. Earnings growth was driven by new contracted renewals projects, as well as strong results in our customer supply and trading business.","At NextEra Energy Partners, the assets operated well and delivered financial results in line with expectations. In addition, just after the close of the quarter, the last of the projects in the initial portfolio became operational.","Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the second quarter of 2014, FPL reported net income of $423 million or $0.96 per share, up $0.04 per share year-over-year.","The principal drivers of FPL's earnings growth in the quarter were continued investment in the business and an increase in wholesale operations. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $570 million in the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be roughly $3.2 billion. Regulatory capital employed grew 6.2% over the same quarter last year, and net income grew 8.2%.","Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes for the 12 months ended June 2014 will be approximately 11.3%. Similar to last quarter, this includes the impact of transition costs associated with our enterprise-wide productivity initiative, Project Momentum, that we incurred over the 12-month period, all of which were incurred in 2013.","Absent these costs, regulatory ROE would have been 11.5%, which remains our target for the full year 2014. As a reminder, the impact of the 2013 transition costs will roll off our reported regulatory ROE as we move through the year, since the regulatory ROE is measured on a 12-month trailing basis.","We utilized $6 million of reserve amortization during the quarter in order to achieve this predetermined ROE, bringing our year-to-date utilization reserve amortization to $131 million. Under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each 12-month trailing period, in this case, the 11.5% that I previously mentioned, excluding special charges such as the Project Momentum transition costs.","As we've mentioned before, we always expect to use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year than the second half, given the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses.","Over the remainder of the year, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we expect to reverse the reserve amortization taken in the first half of the year and end the year with a balance roughly equal to where we started or possibly even a little better.","Looking beyond 2014, we continue to believe that our reserve balance, when combined with our weather-normalized sales growth forecast of 1.5% to 2% per year and our current O&M expectations, as well as the commitment of a total of roughly $7 billion in infrastructure CapEx for the period 2013 to 2016, will allow us to support regulatory ROEs in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% for the remaining period of the current rate agreement. We expect that we can do so in ways that will further improve our already outstanding customer value proposition and will position us well for 2017 and beyond.","In Florida, most economic indicators we follow continue to show improvement year-over-year, while some appear to have recently stabilized. Most notably, Florida's focus on economic development and an overall improvement in the business climate continue to encourage business expansion and additional hiring, while measures of confidence in the state of the economy have generally improved. As a result, Florida labor force participation rate has increased in recent months, even while the U.S. rate continues to drift downward.","Clearly, the return of previously discouraged workers into the labor force is positive, although it will naturally mean that further reductions in Florida's unemployment rate will come at a slower rate. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in June was 6.2%, down 1.2 percentage points from a year ago. The number of jobs in Florida was up 237,500, an increase of 3.1% compared to a year earlier, and June was the 47th consecutive month with positive job growth in Florida, following more than 3 years of job losses. Nationally, the number of jobs was up 1.8% over the year.","Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since April 2012. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth, and more than 620,000 private sector jobs have been added since December 2010.","Turning to the Florida housing market. Recent data appear to show indicators settling into a steadier and hopefully more sustainable pace. As the accompanying chart shows, new building permits have stabilized and remain at comparatively healthy levels as Florida ranked second-highest in the U.S. in new housing permits. Mortgage delinquency rates continue to decline, and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 14.6% from the prior year. Other positive economic data across the state include continued improvement in retail taxable sales, as well as the consumer confidence index. Overall, Florida's economy continues to progress well.","Our customer and usage metrics at FPL this quarter show mixed results. We saw the largest average increase of customers since the second quarter of 2007, with approximately 91,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2013 representing growth of 2%. Roughly half of the increase can be attributed to the rollout of our remote connect and disconnect capability, enabled by our smart meter program that we highlighted last year.","As a reminder, these new customers, which are disproportionately low usage and residential, have a lower impact on our sales. Taking this into account, we estimate that customer growth accounted for about 1% of the increase in sales during the quarter.","Overall usage grew by 0.6%, driven by favorable weather comparison. Underlying usage per customer, however, decreased 1.3% compared to the same quarter last year.","As you may recall, usage was in line with our long-term expectations during the first quarter, and as we have often pointed out, this metric can be somewhat volatile on a quarterly basis. Our long-term expectation of underlying usage growth continues to be approximately 0.5% per year, net of the impact of efficiency and conservation programs, at least through the period of the rate agreement.","The 12-month average of low-usage customers fell to 8.1%, its lowest level in 7 years, while the average number of inactive accounts for the quarter declined to levels not seen since early 2004.","As I mentioned earlier, FPL has announced a plan to invest in long-term natural gas supplies and has filed a petition with the Florida Public Service Commission seeking approval. As a first step in the plan, FPL will partner with PetroQuest Energy to develop natural gas production wells in the Woodford Shale region in southeastern Oklahoma. While a proposed initial program of up to roughly $200 million of capital investment is modest in size relative to FPL's overall natural gas needs, we view the transaction as an important first step in what we hope will be a larger program that will improve the value we deliver to our customers even further.","Acquiring an interest in natural gas reserves is expected to lower long-term fuel costs and provide a long-term hedge against potential volatility in the market price for natural gas, which is a large component of the price of electricity, and would thereby address a concern that a number of policymakers have raised.","In addition to the initial proposal, FPL has also requested that the PSC approve a set of guidelines for subsequent natural gas production projects to allow the company, and in turn its customers, to take advantage of future beneficial natural gas investment opportunities. FPL expects a PSC decision by the end of 2014 or early 2015.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2014 GAAP earnings of $81 million or $0.18 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $213 million or $0.48 per share. These adjusted results include 2 unusual items, both associated with the launch of NextEra Energy Partners: first, a negative impact of $0.05 per share from restructuring and direct transaction costs associated with the creation of NEP; second, a negative impact of $0.10 per share, which represents an income tax charge driven by separating our Canadian projects to enable them to fit into the overall NEP structure. This is a noncash item, and any real cash tax impact -- if there were to be any -- would occur many years in the future. In fact, there may never be any cash impact as we believe this item may be reversed in future periods pending discussions with Canadian tax authorities.","Together, these 2 items reduced Energy Resources' adjusted results by about $0.15 per share. So the underlying operating results were very strong and, in fact, exceeded our expectations with excellent performance in virtually all parts of the portfolio.","As you know, the launch of NEP came at the end of the quarter and NEP was not operational in the second quarter. As a result, Energy Resources' second quarter results do not reflect any deduction for noncontrolling interest. Going forward, Energy Resources will continue to consolidate NEP for accounting purposes, and you should expect to see a deduction from income representing the NEP LP unitholders' interest in Energy Resources results.","Our investor relations team will be ready to address any questions you may have about the interrelationships between Energy Resources and NEP.","Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted EPS decreased by $0.08 year-over-year. Setting aside the combined negative impact of $0.15 per share from the unusual items associated with establishing and launching NEP that I discussed earlier, the core business delivered great results.","Strong contributions from growth in our contracted renewables portfolio added $0.05 per share, reflecting new wind and solar investments placed into service during or after the second quarter of 2013. Consistent with our commitment to recycling capital, asset sales collectively added $0.06 per share, including $0.03 per share due to a gain on a sale of wells in our gas infrastructure business. We expect to continue to recycle capital from time to time within the gas infrastructure business, keeping our overall commitment of capital to this business to a small fraction of the total.","The customer supply and trading business added $0.07 per share, primarily reflecting structured transactions tailored to meet specific customer needs.","The contributions from existing assets declined by $0.05 per share, driven primarily by the planned refueling outage at Seabrook. However, this was better than we had anticipated as Seabrook's outage was the best ever for the facility at just over 23 days. In addition, wind resource, overall, was strong during the quarter, although the year-over-year impact was small, as the second quarter of 2013 was also well above average.","All other factors reduced results by $0.06 per share, including $0.02 of higher interest expense associated with the growing portfolio and $0.02 of dilution.","For the full year, we continue to expect to elect CITCs on roughly 265 megawatts for our Mountain View Solar project and the portions of Genesis and Desert Sunlight solar projects that are expected to enter service in 2014. This equates to roughly $60 million in adjusted earnings, down from roughly $70 million in 2013 on 280 megawatts of solar projects.","Let me now turn to NEP. As I just noted, NEP was not operational during the second quarter, and therefore, while it has released results and will file a Form 10-Q, the presentation of results follows what is known as predecessor format, which is the same basis as was presented in the S-1. I must caution you that this is likely to be different from what you will see going forward, in particular, because the tax treatment of the NEP assets will be different under the NEP structure.","As a consequence, analysis of NEP second quarter reported results is not particularly meaningful. Moreover, we recognize that most NEP investors will be focused on EBITDA and cash available for distribution, and we expect to provide analysis of these variables for the third quarter and beyond.","During the second quarter, the NEP assets performed in line with our expectations. Consequently, the EBITDA and cash flow of the portfolio were also consistent with our expectations. The second unit at our Genesis project entered commercial operations late in the first quarter and operated well throughout the second quarter, while the last of the initial portfolio assets, our Bluewater wind project in Ontario, started commercial operations just after the end of the quarter.","Overall, we were very pleased with the performance of the NEP portfolio during the second quarter.","Shifting back to the broader Energy Resources portfolio, the team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities. In Canada, we continue to expect the remaining approximately 400 megawatts of wind in our backlog to enter service by the end of 2015, with the majority expected to come into service by the end of this year.","Our solar backlog remains on track and during the quarter we brought 13 megawatts of solar into service with the partial commissioning of Desert Sunlight. We continue to expect to bring the remaining roughly 635 megawatts of our backlog into service by the end of 2016. In addition to our existing contracted backlog, we continue to pursue additional solar opportunities that could come online by the end of 2016.","Turning to our U.S. wind program. The team recently signed a PPA for a roughly 100-megawatt project, which is expected to come into service in 2015, bringing our total contracted U.S. wind development program for 2013 through 2015 to approximately 1,770 megawatts.","Based on everything we see at the moment, we continue to believe our total 2013 to 2015 U.S. wind program could be 2,000 to 2,500 megawatts. In the appendix of our earnings presentation, we have provided a reconciliation of all anticipated megawatts at Energy Resources through the end of 2016, which may be helpful to NEP investors as well.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2014, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $492 million or $1.12 per share. NextEra Energy's 2014 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS was $630 million and $1.43, respectively.","Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased $0.01 per share compared to the second quarter of 2013.","You may recall that when discussing the possible creation of NEP, we indicated that an important factor in our decision-making would be the impact it might have on credit. We are pleased to note that S&P, Moody's and Fitch all affirmed our ratings and stable outlook. Looking forward, as NEP grows, we will continue to focus on ensuring that we sustain our strong credit position, both in terms of our credit metrics, as well as in our focus on portfolio mix and business composition.","The development of both Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection continue to progress well through their respective processes, and we continue to expect to submit necessary filings with FERC later this year.","During the quarter, we also announced a nonbinding open season for a 330-mile natural gas pipeline project called Mountain Valley Pipeline, partnering with EQT Corporation. The project is designed to connect the Marcellus and Utica Shales with markets in the southeast region of the U.S. in order to support growing demand and improvements in reliability.","The results of the open season, the details of which we are currently evaluating, were very strong and confirm our view that the Mountain Valley project is very attractive to a wide range of potential shippers. The next step towards firming up a commercially viable project is to convert these strong expressions of interest into binding economic commitments. We look forward to providing more details at a later date.","Before turning to our expectations for 2014 and beyond, I would like to say a few words about our involvement with the Energy Future Holdings bankruptcy case. While our general policy is not to comment on individual transactions, whether real or potential, obviously, a number of documents have been publicly filed in this case and various parties have commented and speculated on our involvement.","We have, on many occasions, articulated our view that we believe we have the necessary skills to effectively manage large, regulated utility businesses in a fashion that delivers value to both customers and investors.","We have also indicated that we would be open to expanding our portfolio of regulated utility assets through acquisition if we can do so within acceptable financial and risk parameters and if we can see a reasonable path to all necessary regulatory approvals.","With that in mind, it is no secret that we have made a tangible revised proposal to EFH in the bankruptcy court. Our commitment to Texas runs deep, having invested more than $7 billion in transmission, power generation and other operations in the Lone Star state.","We also bring to the table a proven track record in the utilities industry, highlighted by strong performance in the areas of reliability, affordability and customer focus. And I will simply reiterate our belief that our revised proposal would provide substantial value to all stakeholders, including Oncor's customers.","Our performance in the second quarter was stronger than we expected, and our expectations for the second half of the year have not changed significantly. Based on these observations, we now believe it is reasonable to expect our full year results to be somewhere in the range of $5.15 to $5.35 per share, even including the $0.15 of onetime effects from the launch of NEP, which, of course, were not anticipated when we originally shared with you our 2014 view back in the summer of last year.","While we're very pleased with our progress so far this year, it remains to be seen how much of the \"goodness of this year\" will carry over into 2015 and beyond.","Accordingly, at least for now, we are not changing our view of 2016 with an adjusted earnings per share range of $5.50 to $6, or 5% to 7% compound annual growth rate off a 2012 base. However, we do expect to update our view of the 2016 time frame later in the year or early in 2015 when we will have more clarity around a few important uncertainties.","As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.","Last year, we shared with you our expectations for improvements in our credit metrics for both 2013 and 2014, and we continue to be on track in terms of cash flow and leverage to meet those targets, which are fully consistent with our current ratings.","Turning now to expectations for NEP. We remain confident in the forecast we presented in the S-1. We expect the initial portfolio to yield EBITDA of about $250 million and cash available for distribution of about $87 million for the 12 months through the end of June 2015, and these results should support an initial distribution at an annualized rate of $0.75 per unit. Our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.","Looking beyond the first year, we expect unit distributions to grow about 12% to 15% per year for at least 3 years, and we believe this is achievable with the acquisition only of assets from the ROFO portfolio, assuming current market conditions.","On average, we expect the ROFO portfolio to look fairly similar to the initial portfolio on a per-megawatt basis, with annual EBITDA expectations of $250,000 to $260,000 per megawatt and cash available for distribution of about $85,000 to $95,000 per megawatt, once all ROFO assets have entered into commercial operations. The last of the ROFO assets are not expected to enter service until late in 2016.","While NEP has no special contractual rights to support further acquisitions, we believe it is reasonable to expect that Energy Resources will want to make available additional projects from its existing portfolio, as well as some of those currently under development.","As of the end of last year, Energy Resources had another roughly 7,000-or-so megawatts of contracted renewables projects in its operating portfolio. And while not all of these projects would be suitable immediately for NEP, many or all of them could become eligible over time.","In addition, we expect to have a further 1,800 to 2,300 megawatts of additional contracted renewable capacity, entering service prior to the end of 2016. And finally, beyond contracted renewables, Energy Resources has other projects that may perhaps be suitable for NEP over time.","Overall, we continue to believe that NEP offers investors, by far, the largest and highest overall quality portfolio of potential assets that can help drive growth and distributions for many years to come. We expect to be in a position to provide additional ongoing, forward-looking disclosures with our third quarter conference call.","With that, we will now open the line for questions. Since this is our first combined conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners, it will be helpful if you can be clear which entity you are referring to in your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to touch on Mountain Valley. And just to understand -- I understand the feedback you gave on the expressions of interest, could you speak a bit to the timing that we might expect as you assess what you received? And just better help us understand what sort of milestones we should be looking for.","James L. Robo","Sure, let me ask Armando to address that.","Armando Pimentel","Stephen, we're in the middle of going back and looking at all the expressions of interest that we received and having individual discussions to make sure that we can enter into agreements with all of the interested parties. My expectation is that by the end of this year, we will be in a position to understand whether to -- whether we're going to move forward or not with the project.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So we should -- we -- you'd be communicating that back by the end of the year, it sounds like is the general time frame you're thinking? Okay.","Armando Pimentel","Yes. I'd expect it to be no later than then. We might have updates before then, but I think for investors and analysts, they should expect that by the end of the year, we should know whether we're moving forward.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And just over for NextEra, not NEP, but just thinking about equity needs in the future and what's -- as you think about further drop-downs into NEP. Can you talk, at least, broadly about how having NEP impacts your need for equity funding? How you think about that? Does it largely eliminate external equity requirements or -- just a little bit more color on equity needs?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. The way to think about the contributions coming up from NEP from a financing perspective is to expect that they will get rolled into our overall financing plan at Capital Holdings. So obviously, that implies that at the margin, there's some implicit reduction in what are the other -- the equity -- otherwise would be. Having said that, I would just remind you what we've said previously, which is with the equity issuance last year and the forward that comes in this year, unless we see significant additional incremental CapEx, we would not expect to be coming back to the market for incremental equity.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you just give -- maybe a little more commentary on adding the natural gas reserves into rate base, kind of how the process will work with Phase 1 and then how you're thinking about layering in additional reserve additions over time? And what the commission is going to view as a successful implementation in this program?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. It's pretty straightforward. We have a tangible proposition on the table right now, which we are asking the commission to approve. It has good economics for our customers. We think it makes a lot of sense from fundamentals and fundamental policy reasons. But it's just one transaction, and it's obviously very small in the context of FPL's overall gas needs. So what we are also asking for is approval of a set of guidelines, which would allow us to move forward with the potential to execute additional deals on a time frame that's consistent with the commercial realities of doing business in that upstream space. Obviously, the decision-making time frame commercially for the plans in that sector is fairly rapid and we would want to have agreement and essentially the blessing of the PSC that within certain parameters, we would be okay to go ahead with additional deals. Having said that, all deals, even if they're executed, are going to be subject to annual review through the fuel clause filings, so the commission would still maintain oversight over the specifics of each transaction.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And how comfortable do you guys feel about the scaling of those projects? And how much fuel would you like to ultimately have from controlled reserves versus buying in the market?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, we haven't set an ultimate target yet. Obviously, it could be very significant over time. Our main focus is on establishing the framework and getting started on the program, but clearly, we think there are plenty of other potential opportunities over time. They may not come in a smooth, steady stream. Obviously, that's going to depend upon the commercial realities in the upstream space. But it's very clear that from a customer perspective, if we can convert what is today a variable and uncontrolled cost into something that's much more predictable, there's real value to customers in doing that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you kind of just think about your rationale of not stripping out that $0.15 and kind of given that we are incurring that now and guidance is unchanged, where the upside came from to maintain guidance?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, there's a number of areas. As we said, the wind resource was strong, so that was our expectations are always around this average wind resource. We had that. The Seabrook outage was shorter than we'd expected. Some of the customer supply transactions that we closed this quarter pushed us a little bit above where we had otherwise expected to be. We were a little bit better on our interest rates. There was a whole variety of areas, but when you put them all together -- there was also a little bit on the FPL side. The wholesale results were a little bit stronger there, so there was a number of areas that have pushed us up.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in a couple of places in your slide deck, on the one hand, we had 109% of normal wind. But then when you're talking about NEP, you said the wind and solar resources was very slightly above normal. Is this just the different geographies of the assets?","Moray P. Dewhurst","It's probably the different geographies and probably, the solar was actually below expectations.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then -- I'm sorry, just got -- do you have a pro forma of what NextEra Energy Resources would have looked like under the new NEP accounting?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No, we don't.","Operator","We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So kind of a twin question relating to the parent company. Can you talk a little bit about how to minimize dilution from the sell-downs to NEP and the roll-down of the ROFOs. And perhaps, coupled with that, discuss the 2016 outlook. You mentioned that you're looking for clarity on a few caveats later this year to perhaps provide an update. What are those key moving variables that limit you from providing that update today as you think about it?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Okay. On the first -- again, maybe I'm just repeating what I said earlier, but the way to think about the proceeds coming up as they get rolled into the overall financing program. So in the short term, if you have a particular transaction, an acquisition by NEP of Energy Resources' assets, there will be some temporary accounting dilutive aspect until you have moved forward and adjusted your financing structure, so that your credit metrics are back where they would be, but that's going to be a relatively small amount. So it shouldn't meaningfully move the numbers. It will make this year, for example, very -- well, maybe there's $0.01 of effective dilution from that affect, so -- but then going forward, we just integrate it into the overall financing plan. On the 2016 outlook, obviously, by the end of the year, we will know where we are on the election here in Florida. We'll have a much better insight into where we are on completing the portfolio, the backlog portfolio of renewables and projects, we're working on a number of things there that we are pretty optimistic will come to pass, but we'll know a lot more by the end of the year on that front. Of course, the other thing is we'll know a lot more where we are on the PTC.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right, absolutely, and to that point, can you discuss real quickly, what is your -- you didn't change your outlook per se, but I'm curious, is the potential for PTC extension delaying PPA sign-ups? And then coupled with that also, are you -- what is the outlook for third-party acquisitions? And has your view on third-party acquisitions down at the NEP level changed in light of the relative currency that you have in hand?","Armando Pimentel","Julien, it's Armando. I think the uncertainty about the PTC and when it would be extended this year certainly caused a lull, in our view, in","[Audio Gap]","towards the very end of the session this year. I'll let Moray answer the NEP question.","Moray P. Dewhurst","So in terms of outlook for third-party acquisitions, I don't think the existence of NEP has fundamentally changed our view. We've always been very active in the market for third-party acquisitions. We'll continue to be, but we've also historically been disciplined in our pricing there, and we expect to continue to be disciplined. I do think it gives us a different vehicle. So depending upon the nature of the potential acquisition, it might fit better in NEP, or it might fit better in Energy Resources. In general, I think that if we see something that requires what I'll call a fair degree of cleanup, for example, perhaps a project that hypothetically we see having some operational improvement potential or requiring a contract restructuring, something of that nature. Other things equal, it would seem logical that we would start with that at the Energy Resources level, work on making those improvements and then make it available to Energy Partners because the key part of the strategy at NEP is to have clean and derisked projects because those are clearly what the investors in NEP value very highly. So to the extent to which the potential asset was already very clean in that sense, it might be a suitable candidate for direct acquisition by Energy Partners. But those are just kind of a conceptual guidelines obviously that we'd have to see in any practical situation. But I think we'll continue to be very competitive.","Operator","We will take our next question with Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Sort of quickly on Slide 7, the load growth -- I'm sorry if I missed -- what caused the 1.3% nonweather-related decrease?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I guess the bottom line is we're not sure. That's the underlying usage growth and other is essentially a residual from our calculations. So we apply our regular forecasting model which says, okay, given what happened with temperature, given what happened with the economy, given what happened with relative pricing, here is what we should have expect and so this is really measured relative to that, which is one of the reasons that it is often volatile from quarter-to-quarter. Having said that, I think what we're seeing in here, although I can't be sure of the exact reasons, is some reduction in usage or lower-than-expected usage among the higher volume customers because the lower volume customers, the metrics associated with them, all look pretty good. So I think what we're seeing is some -- among higher-volume customers, whether that is deliberate conservation efforts, whether it's the effect of more energy efficiency than we have anticipated, we're not sure. So we're going to be digging into those numbers to figure out what we can about what's going on there. But do recognize that from quarter-to-quarter, just mix impacts within the customer base can have quite an impact, an indirect impact on that residual usage.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on Oncor, looking at the legislation that was 13-64 [ph] last year regarding the sort of standalone tax concept and what-have-you, how should one think about -- or what can you share with us the potential use of leverage in an acquisition such as Oncor? I mean, one might think that it could be substantial. I'm just wondering if...","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. I really can't say anything more than we shared in the prepared remarks.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Fair enough, but I tried though. Okay, so then -- and then finally, on the structured transactions in the trading and marketing of $0.07, could you give us a little bit of flavor for what happened there? What the nature of that is, I guess?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. We've, for a long time, been in the business of tailoring power and gas products to meet particular customers' needs. Commonly, these customers are munis and co-ops in different parts of the country, who don't necessarily have the capability to manage all their varying energy needs directly. And typically, these will be for kind of nonstandard amounts of power varying over the course of the year or varying over years. So they're sort of customized products in that way, but they're still relatively straightforward in that they're power and gas delivered to particular locations. And so we will customize the product to meet that need and then essentially back-to-back it, hedge out the components in the regular market. And there's obviously a spread to be made on that. I would say that with the pullback of some of the major financial services firms from the physical commodity world, we've been seeing perhaps a few more of those kinds of opportunities more recently. So it's good business, it maintains relationships with the folks who are often customers of ours on the wind side. So it provides a nice extra portion of the mix.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Is it sort of like a gain-on-sale, though, when you do these transactions? Or is this sort of an accrual kind of -- how should we think about sort of the ongoing nature of something like this sort of structured transaction, in other words, do you take a gain as you do these transactions or is there more like an annuity stream? How should we think about that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","It's a little bit of both, and it depends on the nature of the transaction. Mostly, they are an accrual transaction; occasionally, they may have an element of mark-to-market upfront. We try and minimize that portion for obvious reasons. It's better to spread them out over time. But depending upon the specific nature of the deal, the accounting may require you to take a day 1 gain, so to speak.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So that $0. 07 just sort of -- the flavor of that would you say is mostly accrual or mostly sort of mark-to-market? Onetime-ish? How should we sort of think about that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I would say it's mostly stuff that continues on.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just a couple of things. First, do you an official schedule for the EMP [ph] approval?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I'm going to turn to Eric. I'm not sure that the PSC has formally scheduled it. We're certainly hoping to have a decision by at least the early part of next year.","Eric E. Silagy","Steve, this is Eric. So we're right now working with the staff of the PSC and other interested parties on schedule. We're hoping for hearings in October, and then we're still hoping for a decision by the PSC sometime by the end of the year, beginning of next year at the latest.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then just a question on NEP. We never really, because of the filing and your kind of inability to comment once you file the S-1. We never really got the kind of story on why this is good for NextEra and how you made the decision and the like. And I don't know, if you could just spend a short bit of time on how this is -- how you see the value of this to NextEra?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. Obviously, there's different ways of looking at it -- and I think different individuals look at it somewhat differently -- for myself, I view it very much as a way to highlight the value of a very attractive portion of the portfolio that arguably wasn't receiving full value in the existing structure. As I had sort of hinted at in the response to an earlier question, a lot of what we are really doing in separating out the assets that are part of NEP is segregating 2 distinct aspects of the business in Energy Resources. There is the development construction early stage operations, getting a project to the point where it is, as I referred to it earlier, clean and derisked. And then there's the long-term ownership of the financial interest in those assets. Those 2 aspects of the business are really quite different. They have different risk profiles, and they can certainly appeal in differing degrees to different sets of investors. And what we've done through creating NEP is we've really created a vehicle that allows us to segregate those activities. And in so doing, I think we've highlighted, begun to highlight the real value of those -- of that long-term financial interest in those projects. So to me, it's mostly about highlighting of the value, but we've done so in a fashion that I believe promotes alignment of interests, and that speaks to obviously the structural characteristics of NEP. Other people are going to see it somewhat differently. So a common way, but certainly a number of investors have expressed it and folks internally just see it as accessing a lower-cost source of capital. So I think there's a number of ways, in a sense, different sides of the same coin, but I see it as really highlighting the value.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One or 2 nuts-or-bolts questions. Florida Power & Light O&M for the quarter and year-to-date, basically flat year-over-year. Just curious, is there anything unusual in kind of the quarters for 2014? Do you still expect kind of flattish O&M in '14? Anything that could make second half of 2014 higher or lower than second half of 2013?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, recall that we undertook this initiative that we call Project Momentum last year. And that produced a great many ideas that, in FPL's case, will deliver O&M savings over time. Not surprisingly, those savings tend to build over time. So we would expect the full year for 2014 O&M at FPL actually to be down relative to 2013. So you should definitely expect the second half to be down. But there's nothing particular that I can point to there because the gains from Project Momentum were very widely shared across different parts of the organization. So it's really progress in all areas. We're very pleased with the way the implementation of those initiatives have been going. We're actually a little bit ahead of where we had expected to be. Recall, of course, that those don't directly affect FPL earnings because of the nature of the settlement agreement. So if we do better than we expect on O&M, that simply gets reflected in the amount of [indiscernible] depreciation that we adjust. But that's really what's going on there.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when thinking about NEP's portfolio over time, and when I say over time, I mean multiple, multiple years, and the risk profile of NEP. Just curious for your thoughts, it's one thing we've got renewable assets in there that honestly have very, very, very low maintenance CapEx or even kind of onetime CapEx requirements and have 25- or 30-year contracts. How do you think about what adding other types of assets whether it's gas fire, power play [ph] typically have shorter-term contracts or whether it's nuclear, where they may have longer-term arrangement, but there's also, I don't know, kind of binary capital spending risks? Meaning, Crystal River 3 or Songs [ph] or Davis Besse-related risks that just kind of don't exist with a lot of other type of power plants. How do you think about the pros and cons of adding to the EBITDA and the cafte [ph] for NextEra Energy Partners by putting nonrenewable assets? Even something like a T&D utility in there versus the potential impact on maybe valuation or multiples or CapEx, given kind of what the CapEx risk looks likes for those other types of assets versus the CapEx risk of a renewable plant?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Okay. Let me try and address that in a number of pieces because I think there's a lot of things in there. I think the short answer is, we are going to evaluate all those issues that you've just talked about over time, and we're going to receive, I suspect, a lot of investor feedback, and that will help us in our evaluation. One of the great things you pointed out, but you're talking many years down the road -- one of the great things about the NEP position is it can look to long-term sustained growth simply through adding contracted renewable projects, which it may hope to acquire from the sponsor, so long before you have to even consider some of the things that you've just raised in your question. Having said that, let me take the [indiscernible] assets, clearly, there are examples in the market where those assets have been added to a yieldco-type portfolio, so it clearly can be done. I think there are a couple of issues that go different ways. On the one hand, you get an extra dimension of diversity, so that should be attractive to an NEP investor. But as you pointed out, they do have different characteristics. So I think we're just going to have to evaluate the relative weight of those -- broadly speaking, those 2 factors and see what investor reactions are. And the same general criteria apply as you start thinking about extending the universe of assets more broadly, although introducing even more complexities. So for example in the nuclear assets, obviously, the binary nature of an event risk that you're implicitly referring to would need to be taken into account. I don't know, but I suspect that, that's not a kind of risk profile that most of the NEP investors would be particularly -- would be pricing into their valuation today. So we need to see what the reaction is. So there might be structures that you would need to put in place to isolate that portion of the risk. In a sense, it goes back to the response of a couple of earlier questions, which is one of the nice things about the NEP platform, is that it enables us to segregate out different types of activities and focus them in the 2 different companies. And in particular, I suspect that means there will be -- we will take on specific types of risks within Energy Resources and NextEra Energy that we would not take on within NextEra Energy Partners.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Last question, any update on transmission investment opportunities -- electric transmission investment opportunities outside of Florida?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Not a lot new to report. As I've said on a number of occasions to many folks, the transmission development business is long-term in nature. The decision-making time frame for a lot of these projects, particularly the ones that go through the regional, the ISOs, the ITOs, tends to be fairly long. And so nothing in particular, the project, the development project in Canada is moving along as we would expect. We continue to have a very healthy portfolio of initiatives that we're working on. But as I've also said many times before, all of these things are long-term in nature. So things that would not begin to contribute before 2018 or 2019 in most cases.","Operator","We will take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So 2 questions. First on the TXU transaction. I know you can't comment specifically on it, but can I ask a broader question with regard to your philosophy on acquiring regulated assets? So when you talk -- when you think about what acceptable financial and risk parameters are, in any, like, acquisitions with any, regulated utility, what are the cornerstones sort of financial pillars of your decision-making? For instance, with the Wisconsin acquisition of TEG, they had never commented explicitly on any transaction but always had said had to be accretive in the first full year, not too dilutive to growth rate, not too dilutive to credit. So can you sort of give a comparable set of characteristics that you look for when you think about the price you're willing to pay and the risk you're willing to take in acquiring an additional regulated asset?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I'm not sure I can give a comprehensive list, but let me just try and provide some color at least around that. Recognize that your ability to add value in these situations depends upon your ability to develop synergies across 2 platforms, to improve operations in a platform that you may acquire or to find other ways of delivering incremental value on which the shareholder may hope to earn a regulated rate of return. So you have to look at what is the realistic potential to create value. And while that can be quite meaningful in this industry, it is typically not as large when expressed as a percentage of the existing market value as you will see in many other industries.","So you've got to make sure that you can retain significant portion of the value that you create for your investors; otherwise, there's no point in doing the transaction. And that obviously, in turn, depends upon the terms on which you can expect to get regulatory approval. We would certainly want to make sure that anything that we do is supportive of our existing credit position. As we said on many occasions, we're very comfortable with our credit position, it's an important, competitive weapon to us. So we certainly would not want it to be dilutive to credit. We have traditionally said that with respect to accretion, dilution, while we don't have any absolute hard-and-fast rules, if a transaction is significantly dilutive in the first couple of years, that's usually a warning sign about its fundamental economics. So there can be some particular accounting reasons why an individual transaction might be dilutive in the first year, but normally, that should be a red flag.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The final question is circling back to the opportunity to create value by hedging out your risk through reverse integrating into natural gas. Someone asked you that question earlier. You indicated that the request that you're making is only to sort of hedge out about 2.9% of your expected 2015 gas burn, and your gas burn is likely to rise in the future by a fair amount. If we want to sort of size up the potential expenditures, if you were to fully hedge, and I understand you'd never do that, is it fair to just take the $70 million to $190 million range and sort of gross that up, so that hypothetically, if the regulator were to say, look, we'd like you to hedge it all, that the range of the potential spending would be sort of $2.4 billion to $6.5 billion? Or is that way over simplifying the math?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. I'm not sure that it's going to scale linearly, certainly as you get up higher and higher, but for the first few percent, it probably is not far off.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

NextEra Energy management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energy's fundamental earnings power. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Moray Dewhurst. Moray?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. 2011 was a mixed year for NextEra Energy. We had a number of disappointments, but we also had at least an equal number of successes. On balance we must consider it a good year, as our successes position us well to deliver on our longer-term value proposition in spite of a very challenging environment for Energy Resources. We have the building blocks of our growth plan in place. Our focus now is on execution. ","Let me first say a few words about the disappointments. Although our final adjusted results were well within the range of expectations we originally set out for you in October 2010, they were not what we had hoped for, yet a couple of caveats are in order. Despite the challenging environment for Energy Resources, we set another all-time high for adjusted earnings per share, and the growth in adjusted earnings per share of 2.1% was roughly in line with the median 10-year earnings per share growth rate for our industry, while our profitability is reflected in adjusted ROE, continues to be better than the long-term industry median. ","But industry average performance is not what we expect of ourselves, and we know you do not expect it of us either. There were 4 principle reasons why we fell short of our expectations in 2011, all associated with Energy Resources. First, our proprietary trading activities fell well short of our hopes. In retrospect, we were overly optimistic about the market environment for these activities and hence, about the results they could achieve. We chose not to increase our risk profile in these areas, but instead, to accept what the market was giving us. Looking forward, we have adjusted our expectations downward for these parts of the business, reflecting our expectation that market conditions will continue to be soft for some time. ","Second, we encountered some challenging issues at our Seabrook nuclear facility, which led to unplanned and extended outages and less availability than we had anticipated. Historically, our Energy Resources nuclear assets have run very well, and we expect to revert historical performance over time. Although we had challenges within the nuclear fleet in 2011, our nonnuclear-generating facilities performed exceptionally well with one of the lowest forced outage rates on record. ","Third, we had hoped to get a few more megawatts of new renewable projects in the ground by the end of 2011. 2 projects will push into the first quarter of this year. This has relatively minor financial impact on the projects' overall economics as the projects are still expected to qualify for the relevant tax incentives. ","Fourth, as we discussed extensively in the third quarter call, we were negatively impacted by the extreme heat in Texas in August. We were likely to see a negative impact on our retail customer supply business under such extreme adverse conditions even with the best execution. Nevertheless, we made a number of operational changes to improve our responsiveness and resilience should such extreme conditions occur again. ","Although we were able partially to offset these 4 challenges in various ways, the net impact was that overall at the enterprise level, we were $0.10 or so short of where we expected to be. ","2 external factors must also count as disappointments. As you all know, the forward curve for natural gas came down significantly. While the effects of those on our results are muted for the next several years by the heavily-hedged position at Energy Resources, over the long haul, lower natural gas prices mean lower power prices for our key merchant assets. ","And finally, and quite separately, we were disappointed that the historically bipartisan issue of Federal support for renewables has, for the moment at least, apparently become one of the casualties of political conflict in Washington prior to a presidential election year. However, this issue is far from closed, and we remain optimistic that we will continue to see Federal support for renewables generally and wind specifically beyond 2012. ","But while these developments were disappointing, we also had many successes in 2011. Chief among these was outstanding progress in the development of Energy Resources' renewable backlog. We continue to build our backlog of contracted renewable assets by entering into contracts for nearly 2,200 megawatts of wind and solar energy already placed in service in 2011 or expected to be placed in service by the end of 2016. ","Project development, of course, is more than just executing contracts. Permitting and other approvals, construction execution and other challenges continue to be present on many projects even after a power purchase agreement is in place. But as a result of the excellent progress we have made in moving our development projects forward in 2011, we now have very high visibility into the evolution of our renewable portfolio for 2012 and beyond, and we know where we are likely to be by the end of 2012. We expect that by the end of this year, we will have nearly 10,000 megawatts of wind capacity in our fleet. ","With the development success we've had this year, we believe that we're also very well-positioned to achieve our longer-term growth goals. Let me emphasize that while we are optimistic that Federal support for renewables will not be eliminated, as I mentioned earlier, the financial expectations that we have previously shared with you and that we are reaffirming today are based solely on projects in our backlog and do not depend upon an extension of the PTC program. ","Turning now to Florida. FPL had a very strong year. Unit 3 at our West County Energy Center came into service on time and under budget, and as a result, our fossil system efficiency reached a new record. ","Construction on the Cape Canaveral modernization made excellent progress, and that project is on schedule and on budget. Local officials and residents from Riviera Beach enjoyed witnessing firsthand the demolition of the old plant there, paving the way for another modernization. And we began to pursue a third modernization project, the Port Everglades, that is expected to save customers hundreds of millions of dollars over and above the cost of the plant. We expect a decision from the PSC regarding Port Everglades by the end of the second quarter. We believe that all these projects have significant direct benefits for our customers in the form of fuel savings, broader benefits for Floridians in form of job creation and lower emissions and long-term benefits in the form of lower electric bills. ","Most important, at FPL, we continue to deliver what we firmly believe is the best customer value proposition in the state and one of the best anywhere in the country. Our customers enjoy our lowest bills in the state, bills that are 25% lower than the national average, top quartile reliability and award-winning customer service. For the eighth in a row, FPL received the prestigious ServiceOne award. This award is given to companies that exhibit exceptional customer service, and FPL is the only utility to have won at 8 consecutive times. Our emissions profile is among the best in the industry, and customers should see little impact from the recently-finalized EPA rules covering mercury, now known as the MACT rules. ","Our strategy at FPL is straightforward. It is to see -- continuing to find ways in which we can economically improve our customer value proposition. In recent years, that is translated in large measure into deploying capital to substitute more efficiently for other parts of our cost structure. In particular, we have been spending heavily to make our generation fleet more efficient, which translates directly into fuel savings for our customers. ","Since 2001, FPL system heat rate has improved by 19%, resulting in more than $5.5 billion in savings for customers, including more than $650 million in 2011 as a result of increased fuel efficiency. However, while the fuel decreases flow through regularly to our customers by the annual fuel clause proceedings, we must periodically seek recovery for the costs associated with the investments that create the efficiencies our customers enjoy. ","For the years 2011 through 2013, we will invest an average of about $3 billion per year in generation and infrastructure projects that benefit our customers, including new clean, efficient power generation. And so in 2012, we will be filing a general base rate case, seeking new base rates to go into effect in 2013 after the conclusion of our current rate settlement agreement. ","We filed a test year letter with the PSC on January 17, indicating our intent to seek rate release starting in 2013. While the details of the numbers may change somewhat as we prepare the required formal filing schedules, we anticipate that the total rate relief requested starting January 1, 2013 will be $525 million, with an additional $170 million at the time the Cape Canaveral modernization comes into service, reflecting the revenue requirements associated with that facility. ","The key drivers of our request are simple. First, we need to address the impact of the accelerated amortization of so-called surplus depreciation ordered by the prior commission and implemented under the rate agreement. As we pointed out at the time, the accelerated amortization provided a short-term means of masking the need for rate relief at the expense of creating a larger incremental need in the future. Roughly half of our rate request is a direct reflection of the need to address the disappearance of surplus depreciation. ","Second, we will seek rate recovery for Cape Canaveral. This modernization will improve system efficiency and reduce our overall fuel consumption, translating into benefits that our customers will see through fuel clause. We estimate that over the 30-year operational life of this plant, Cape Canaveral will produce net savings of approximately $600 million in fuel charges, over and above the $1 billion cost of building the plant. ","Third, we expect to request that FPL's allowed retail regulatory ROE be reset to 11.25%, which is roughly the average of the allowed ROEs granted to the other Florida IOUs. We believe it is poor policy for the utility with the best customer value proposition in the state to have the lowest allowed ROE in the state and to rank in the bottom quartile of allowed ROEs in the nation, which is the current situation. We believe both common sense and sound policy suggest that providing the prospect of higher profitability to customers -- to companies that deliver higher value for their customers offers a strong incentive to improve performance. ","Accordingly, included in our rate request is a 25-basis-point ROE add-on [ph], which we believe reflects FPL's current superior value proposition, but to be applied only if FPL maintains the lowest customer bill in the state. ","In seeking rate release, we are mindful of the fact that there is never a good time for a rate increase, and our state and our customers are still doing with considerable economic uncertainty. Still, even with our requested base rate increase, which amounts to about $0.23 per day on the typical residential bill, we expect that our bills will remain the lowest in the state and about 10% lower than they were in 2006. So we will continue to offer a service that is extremely affordable and exceptionally valuable. Because of the improved efficiency of our system, as well as because of unrelated changes in other factors, including lower natural gas prices, we currently expect the total bill impact to be no more than $0.10 per day on the typical bill and potentially even less. ","I should also note that the typical 1,000 kilowatt-hour bill, which is commonly used as a pricing reference point across the industry, is higher than our typical customer pays. Approximately 53% of our residential customers use less than 1,000 kilowatt hours a month on average. ","The January 17 filing of the test year letter initiates a process that will likely occupy much of this year. We expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data late in the first quarter and expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter, with a final commission decision in the fourth quarter in time for new rates to go into effect January 1, 2013. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. However, we look forward to laying out our case and demonstrating how our proposed rates will help us continue to deliver strong reliability and lower bills for our customers. We are confident that a fair and objective review of our case will lead to a satisfactory outcome for customers and for shareholders. ","Before turning to the details of our results, I would be remiss if I did not say a word or 2 about Armando Olivera, who will be retiring in May after 40 years of dedicated and successful service to our company. Armando has led FPL with extraordinary success since June 2003 and leaves the business one of the strongest and best-performing utilities anywhere in the nation. ","In addition to managing business, however, Armando has always been concerned with developing the next generation of leaders, and we are confident that Eric Silagy, who is named President of FPL in December and who has worked closely with Armando for the last 4 years, will be ready for a seamless transition. We thank Armando for his service, we congratulate him on his great track record and we wish him well in the next phase of his life. ","Let's now look at our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2011. I'll start with the results at FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For the full-year 2011, FPL reported net income of $1.1 billion or $2.55 per share, up $0.26 per share year-over-year. ","Under the terms of the settlement agreement, FPL's earnings are largely a function of capital employed, equity ratio and allowed ROE. FPL's retail regulatory return on equity was largely unchanged in 2011 relative to 2010, and we increased our equity commitment to the business in line with the growth in capital employed. As a result, the primary driver of earnings growth is the 11.8% increase in average capital employed for the year, a consequence of our having invested over $3 billion to maintain and improve our electric system's reliability and efficiency. These investments collectively produce significant customer benefits in the form of lower fuel costs, better reliability and clean air. And they are key to our ability to keep our customers' electric bills the lowest in the state over the long haul. ","For the full year, we recognized $187 million of surplus depreciation and amortization. For 2012, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we expect to amortize between $510 million and $530 million of surplus depreciation. ","During the fourth quarter, we had approximately 25,000 more customers than in the comparable period of 2010, representing an increase of 0.5%. This growth rate has been fairly consistent now for the last 6 quarters. Total retail sales declined 2.7%, driven primarily by relatively less favorable weather, which was partially offset by an increase in underlying usage and other. ","As we've indicated before, underlying customer usage can be somewhat volatile on a quarterly basis, and we do not attach particular significance to this quarter's increase. For the full year, weather normalized sales were slightly positive, and underlying usage was roughly flat compared to 2010. ","The economy in Florida continues to improve, though it remains weaker than we would all desire. In December, the unemployment rate in Florida dropped below 10% for the first time since April 2009. Perhaps more important, an annual increase of 113,000 jobs was reported for December. The first-time annual job growth has exceeded 100,000 jobs since early 2007. ","As part of our commitment to job growth in the state and with the support of the PSC, FPL began offering in 2011 a new economic development rate to help attract more job creators to our state. This new rate provides eligible commercial and industrial businesses, with significant savings above and beyond an electric bill that is already the lowest in the state. ","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported fourth quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $402 million or $0.96 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $128 million or $0.30 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the effect of the mark on non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI. The large difference between GAAP and adjusted results reflects the magnitude of the reduction in forward gas and power prices during the quarter. ","For the full-year 2011, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $774 million or $1.85 per share. Adjusted earnings were $679 million or $1.62 per share. ","In addition to non-qualifying hedges and OTTI, for the full year, adjusted earnings exclude the net charges related to the sale of the 5 natural gas-fired generation assets. ","Energy Resources' fourth quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.04 from last year's comparable quarter. The only noteworthy negative driver was $0.05 related to Seabrook's unplanned outage. Please see the table in the appendix for additional details on the fourth quarter results. ","For the full-year 2011, the $0.31 decline in adjusted EPS was driven by several factors. Contributions from our new investments declined $0.06, primarily due to the lower CITC elections in 2011 relative to 2010. We elected CITCs for roughly 275 megawatts of wind projects in 2011 compared to approximately 600 megawatts in 2010. ","In our existing assets, our wind fleet contributed $0.23, primarily as a result of the greater wind resource. Seabrook's contribution declined by $0.12 as a result of lower hedge prices and an additional $0.11 due to extended and unplanned outages. Our gas infrastructure business contributed $0.06 more than the prior year. Our customer supply and proprietary trading businesses were down $0.22 year-over-year. And lastly, the other category declined $0.15 relative to 2010. This decline was largely the result of the asset impairment charges recognized in the second quarter of 2011, as well as higher interest expense due to growth in the business. ","While we typically review our earnings drivers relative to the prior year, as I have just done, we thought it might be helpful also to give you a quick overview of what drove the difference between the expectations we shared with you prior to the beginning of the year and the results the businesses actually generated. We have included a summary in the appendix to this presentation that compares our realized equivalent EBITDA to the initial 2011 EBITDA ranges we provided in our third quarter 2010 earnings materials for the various components of Energy Resources business. You will see that with few exceptions our expectations were fairly close. ","We have also included our updated hedging disclosures for 2012 and 2013 in the appendix. There were no significant changes for the last quarter. We remain highly hedged in both years. ","Looking at the company on a consolidated basis, for the fourth quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $667 million or $1.59 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $395 million and $0.93, respectively. ","For the full-year 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $1.9 billion or $4.59 per share. NextEra Energy's adjusted 2011 earnings and EPS were $1.8 billion and $4.39, respectively. ","Corporate and other's adjusted earnings increased primarily due to consolidated income tax adjustments related to state tax law changes and Federal tax benefits. ","In 2011, the wind portfolio accounted for very roughly 40% of Energy Resources' adjusted earnings. Because of its importance, we recognized that many of you are interested in additional detail around this business. It was an excellent year for the wind business overall. Every year for the last decade or more, we have set new records for total production as the fleet has grown, and 2011 was no exception. In total, our wind business in 2011 generated nearly 25 million megawatt hours. To put this in perspective, this production is comparable to the retail load of a typical good-sized utility, such as OGE Energy, Alliant Energy or Great Plains Energy. ","In addition, the fleet set a new record for capacity factor, as the wind resource recovered from well below average levels in 2009 and 2010. Looking forward and assuming normal wind resource, we expect the average capacity factor to continue to increase slowly as mix continues to shift towards more modern, higher efficiency turbines. It may also be of interest to note that 2011's capacity factor was significantly higher than the average capacity factor for the nation's natural gas-fired capacity taken as a whole. ","Of the roughly 25 million megawatt hours of production, approximately 70% was eligible for PTCs, the remainder representing output primarily from projects on which we elected to take the CITC or from projects that have passed their 10-year window of eligibility for PTCs. ","Of the PTCs generated, approximately 29% were allocated to investors under the various differential membership structures we have entered into. Looking forward, we expect this fraction to increase as we completed transactions of this type on 483 megawatts of capacity in 2011. We will continue to look for additional economically attractive opportunities to enter into these kinds of structures, commonly known as tax equity. ","2011 was also a successful year for the execution of our financing strategy. Overall, we invested roughly $6.5 billion of capital into our businesses, net of amounts received under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. ","Our cash flow from operations was approximately $4 billion. At FPL, we maintained a consistent capital structure and issued $850 million of long-term debt, while committing approximately $1 billion of new equity to the business. Through Capital Holdings and its subsidiaries, including Energy Resources, we issued more than $700 million of project or limited recourse debt, net of retirements and amortization and a net of $260 million of corporate debt. We also received a little over $350 million from the sale of differential membership interest in certain wind projects. ","As you know, in 2011, we also sold 5 natural gas-fired assets. The impact of these transactions on our GAAP cash flow statement adds a little complexity, so a few words about the impact on our financing activities is warranted. In total, we sold the 5 assets for a gross value of $1.36 billion, leaving us with proceeds of $840 million after the elimination of the associated project debt obligations, a portion of which was assumed by the purchaser and a portion of which was retired. Of this $840 million, conceptually, $465 million was used to retire debt, although this is not evident in the cash flow statements as we simply integrated this effect into our existing financing plans. The remaining $375 million was used to repurchase equity. The net effect of the gas asset sales on our overall capital structure and credit position was essentially neutral. ","Looking forward, we expect to continue to employ a balanced financing plan to support our growth, while maintaining our balance sheet and credit strength. Because we are continuing to invest at a rate in excess of ongoing operating cash flows, we will continue to need to access the capital markets periodically. We expect to use the same broad mix of products, including additional limited recourse project debt and the sale of differential membership interests that we have used in the past. We also need to maintain a balance between incremental debt and equity and expect there will be a need to issue a modest amount of equity in order to support our growth plans for 2012 through 2014. Our strong balance sheet and credit position are important to our strategy, and we expect to maintain them. ","As we decide upon specific transactions, however, we will do so with an eye on where we expect to be in 2014. As we have previously stated, if we were simply to complete the projects that we currently have in backlog and add nothing new, we would expect to flip to become free cash flow positive after dividends in 2014. ","On the other hand, if we are successful in identifying additional new attractive growth opportunities in the interim, we will want to have the balance sheet strength to support them. Consequently, we currently expect that the bulk of incremental equity support will be in the form of equity units, a type of instrument that we have employed in the past which aligns well with the earnings profile of the projects it supports. If we do not add to the current backlog of projects, we expect that the 2014 share count will be slightly lower than it was in 2011. ","Turning now to expectations for 2012 and beyond. In 2012, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. There have been no significant changes to the supporting logic we discussed with you on the third quarter call. Looking beyond 2012, we continue to believe that our adjusted EPS will grow at an average rate of 5% to 7% per year through 2014, which translates to a range of $5.05 to $5.65 in adjusted earnings per share in 2014, subject to all the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. Again, the logic has not changed since our third quarter call, although the excellent progress we have made in the development of Energy Resources' backlog of renewal projects is encouraging. ","In thinking about the growth of NextEra Energy, it is important to recognize the changing nature of our portfolio. The implementation of our strategies for both FPL and Energy Resources, coupled with the changing nature of the external environment, are leading us to a mix that is more heavily oriented towards regulated and long-term contracted assets than in the past. We're in the midst of the largest capital investment program in our history at FPL, which is causing this business to become a larger portion of our portfolio than it has in the recent past. At the same time, the externally-driven reduction in the opportunities available for the merchant elements of Energy Resources portfolio, coupled with our strategy of adding to the portfolio through long-term contracted assets, means that the proportion of Energy Resources portfolio exposed to commodity market volatility is decreasing. The net result is that with our present plans, we expect the proportion of our adjusted earnings coming from rate-regulated businesses, that is Florida Power & Light and Lone Star Transmission, to increase from 58% in 2011 to about 65% in 2014. ","Similarly, we expect the proportion of our adjusted EBITDA coming from regulated businesses and long-term contracted assets to increase from 78% in 2011 to about 84% in 2014. In both cases, this would result in an overall mix comparable to the mix we had back in 2006 when Energy Resources was simply a much smaller business. ","Before opening the phones to your questions, let me simply summarize what all these means for our 2012 priorities. Our focus is on execution across all our businesses. At Florida Power & Light, we must continue to deliver the best value proposition in the state, we must manage the execution of all our major capital projects successfully and we must achieve a satisfactory outcome to the base rate case. ","At Energy Resources, we must have outstanding day-to-day execution across all elements of our broad and diverse portfolio of activities, and we must remain on track for the development of our record renewables backlog, including reaching commercial operations on roughly 1,150 to 1,500 megawatts of U.S. wind projects before the end of the year. ","And at Lone Star transmission, we must continue our construction program to achieve commercial operations by the end of the first quarter in 2013, and we must achieve a satisfactory outcome of the general rate case. ","Of course, these are not our only objectives, but they are the most important immediate ones. If we execute successfully, we will be well-positioned to deliver on our 2014 expectations. ","And with that, I will turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Daniel Eggers from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess first question, with Progress getting the settlement so early in their process, do you guys see an opportunity this time to settle? And maybe share your thoughts on any mechanisms you'd like to get back in place like the GBRA as you file a rate case or put it formal.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Progress' situation is obviously different from our -- I just don't think we're in a position to comment or speculate.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just on the renewable backlog. You guys in the past periods have given kind of a numerical amount of the projects you have in backlog that wasn't in the slides today. Has that changed or is there an update that you could share on that front?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, we're still within -- if you're referring to how it maps to the 1,400 to 2,000 over the 2-year period, we're still well within that range for the wind side. I think the pieces are here. If we haven't made them clear, I'll be happy to follow-up and make sure they are clear. On the last slide, I think it's pretty clear what we're working on right now.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Fleishman from Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you maybe go through some of the key growth projects and just development milestone updates and just what you'll be watching in terms of any issues there, maybe Spain, Genesis, the big ones?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, let me ask Armando. I should specify Armando Pimentel since we are a company with 2 Armandos, managing its principal businesses. Armando Pimentel, would you like to comment?","Armando Pimentel","Steve, brief update. Spain project is going well. We are on track to bring those units, 2 different units, 2 50-megawatt units on track to bring 1 unit in -- earlier in 2013, the second one later in 2013. I'm very happy with the progress that's being made there. The Genesis project, our 250-megawatt project out in California, we're in the midst of construction. We are on schedule to bring unit 1 in, in the latter half of 2013. And the second unit, unit 2, each 125 megawatts, in 2014. Desert Sunlight, which, as you know, is being constructed by First Solar. It's a project that we bought 50% of, and GE Capital bought the other 50%. That's also on schedule, that has not changed. Some of that project will start hitting earnings, regular earnings and convertible investment tax credit earnings in '13. The bulk of that will be in '14, I believe, and then you have some in '15. And on the wind projects, we've got quite a bit that we want to get done this year. And I feel pretty comfortable at this point that virtually all of them are on schedule to get done because we've got potentially a real cliff, a PTC cliff at the end of the year. So obviously, we're very focused on that.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Just one other question. Moray, your comments on -- thoughts on potentially some equity funding. Could you just kind of maybe better clarify what you're trying to say? Are you trying to say that it's only needed to the degree that there's more projects added to the portfolio beyond what's in the plan or you still need to do a little bit based on the current portfolio?","Moray P. Dewhurst","The latter is the case. I mean, if you sort of ask what it's going to be and when it's going to be, the answer is, it depends. And let me try to explain why. In the prepared remarks, I tried to say that we have to focus a little bit on where we're going to be in 2014. So if we project out to 2014 and assume for the moment that we only execute the projects that are in backlog, then we would find ourselves in a situation where, effectively, the level of equity that we have in the business today would be adequate. But there is an interim period to be got through. And so for that interim period, we will most likely need some modest level of incremental support. And hence, that's why we're thinking of doing it primarily in the form of equity units, which obviously I don't have a dilutive impact in the interim. And then depending upon where we are in 2014, we'll be able to decide how to adjust. Does that make it clearer?","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's great.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Dobson from Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you'd give a little more clarity on this corporate and other, which was as large as it was in the quarter and for the year. Just what was going on there and sort of how we should think about that going forward into '12 and I guess through '14? Although maybe that may be a little less clear in your crystal ball.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, the sort of large size in the corporate and other is really -- is driven by tax issues. They are kind of a couple of buckets. In the second quarter we talked about the impact of some tax law changes. And in the fourth quarter, it gets a little complicated, but it's essentially the elimination of a deferred tax liability, which really came about as an outflow of more general settlement of broader issues with the IRS. But in both cases, what we're really talking about is an income effect from the elimination of the deferred tax liability. So from an income statement perspective, they're kind of one-time effects, so they won't roll over into subsequent years. From a cash flow perspective, they are genuinely the improvement of a future cash flow position.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. So if we're looking out to -- I don't want to get too detailed into guidance around this, but for '12, we ought to be going back to corporate and other in the, I don't know, $0.08 just to use what you reported last year?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, I mean, don't quote me -- quote me on the specific number, but the large magnitude that we've seen this year in corporate and other, we would not expect to recur.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then I missed the number. How much surplus depreciation did you book in '11?","Moray P. Dewhurst","$187 million.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","$187 million. And so even with the use of roughly $520 million, I think, you said for this year, you'd have some of that leftover. Is it your anticipation under your filing that you would -- you have the ability to use that in future years?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. Right now, the way we look at the numbers, we would have roughly $190 million leftover at the end of the year. And so we're thinking that, that would be the amount that will go in to the filing.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a detailed question. I know you left this out of the adjusted earnings, but what was the loss you recorded for the RISEC sale, the Rhode Island plant?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Solely for the RISEC?","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, just solely for that one, because the other one occurred in the third quarter.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Okay. For RISEC, it was immaterial. The accounting, the book loss was primarily associated with the other 4.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you guys just said less than $0.01 it was, in fact?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, less than $0.01.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Congratulations to Armando in terms of his retirement. And I just want to touch basically on the long-term growth rate. We have seen a decrease in gas prices. Do you still feel that you can make that growth rate with today's low gas prices because of the hedging and other activity that you're doing? Or is it based on different gas price outlook?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No, we haven't changed in any way the way that we approach sharing with you our expectation. So they always incorporate our view of the current forward. So as you would imagine, we can continue to get there because we have heavily hedged the portfolio. So we continue to feel very good about where we are through the 2014 timeframe.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. That's what I thought. And then just in terms of wind, there was a Fitch downgrade on a specific project, I think about a 500-megawatt project associated with higher O&M than have been projected and lower revenues. And I was just wondering, is that something specific with that project? Is there anything that we should be thinking about? I know that you guys haven't really changed much in terms of your own wind outlook in the slides, but I'm just wondering if you could just give us a little bit more of a flavor in terms of how the wind portfolio is working and just what that was all about.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, sure. Let me first speak to the particular -- it's actually a collection of projects. The downgrade occurred on project debt of a portfolio of projects, one of the early portfolio limited recourse financings that we did back in, I want to say, the '05 timeframe, somewhere around there, maybe earlier. So this is -- Fitch is taking action on the project debt there. Actually behind Moody's and S&P, they have previously reevaluated it. The key drivers there are actually -- the low wind resource that we had in 2009 and 2010 was stressing the coverage ratios of both the portfolio. And in addition, it is true that we've had higher O&M experience. They were some of the earlier turbines that had a higher incidence of gearbox failure than we now see. So I don't attribute anything specific -- or anything, excuse me, anything more general from that particular issue. And I think actually given that the wind resource came back very nicely in 2011, the coverage ratios on those -- on the project debt came back up just fine. I don't see that there's a problem there. But in addition, I certainly don't see that as being anything that we need to think about extrapolating through the rest of the fleet. So the rest of the fleet is running very well and project-specific issues there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally on the renewal of the tax credit for 2012, how should we think about that? I mean, I guess you mentioned in your opening remarks about the political activity in Washington. Any sense as to when you expect that to be renewed or how we should be monitoring that or I don't know, it seems to be sort of -- Washington is hard to monitor, I guess. But what are your thoughts on that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, well, I think the first thing to be said is it's a constantly changing situation. But Lew has spent a fair amount of time in D.C. over the past month, so I think he would like to offer a few thoughts on that.","Lewis Hay","Yes. I'm not sure I can add too much to it, but if I was capable of predicting what was going on in D.C., I would probably be doing something else because I think there's a way to make some money on that. But historically, the PTC has had bipartisan support. We're in a highly politicized period, and clearly, the growing debt load the country has is an issue. So it is hard to say how it stacks up. We've been spending a lot of time in D.C., communicating the virtues of the PTC, and I think we're making some progress, making a lot of progress. And I think you all heard the President the other night recommit his support for clean energy. So it's still hard to say how this is going to sort itself out. We're, I'd say, cautiously optimistic that there's -- that some things can be done. It's probably going to be a rocky road. There's several different points in time over the year that something can happen, hard to predict when anything really will happen. But one thing I'm still very comfortable with is, long-term, there's going to be some form of support for renewable and clean energy. So I can say, stay tuned.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. And just to close that out, let me -- I'll just add, in practical terms, what it means is that we are planning on the assumption that it expires at the end of 2012, but we are preparing ourselves for a variety of other possibilities.","Operator","We'll go next to Raymond Leung from Goldman Sachs.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Question about financing needs. Can you talk a little bit about, under your current plan, what do you expect in terms of debt financing out of the utility and potentially capital resources? And even if you could provide us some ranges or parameters to help us out.","Moray P. Dewhurst","At this stage, I'm really not prepared to get into sort of specific numbers and timing. All I can tell you is that Florida Power & Light, we feel that continue to be in the midst of this very heavy spending phase. We will maintain the capital -- balanced capital structure. So that means that there will be periodic first mortgage bond issuance as the primary vehicle that we use there. On the Capital Holdings side, again, it gets a little more complicated there because we have a wider variety of instruments that we use. As I tried to indicate in the prepared remarks, we will likely be drawing on all of them, but we're still sort of fine-tuning the plan for this year. So as I said, I'm not prepared to come out with specific numbers at this stage.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you maybe help provide us with like financial targets or metric targets and like a cash flow debt on capital side or to help us at least guide us?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I can't right now, but I will certainly -- I have committed to others that we will provide better guidance than we have in the past on that issue. And the reason it gets a little complicated is because there's no one single metric that we use. So we look at a variety of different coverage ratios effectively. And we look at them in a variety of different ways, and we try and optimize the overall plan. So it's difficult for me to give you a specific target. But having said that, I can do a better job than I have in the past of narrowing down the range. I'm committed to doing that.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just last question. In terms of -- I see you have a fairly large backlog, but can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking in terms of what you're seeing in terms of acquisition opportunities in the renewable side? There's been a lot more transactions there, some projects that I think have maybe come under some pressure. And maybe how you're thinking about that relative to your own organic backlog.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. Certainly, there have been some projects and some transactions, frankly, not as many as we would have expected or hoped. We continue to be very optimistic that as some of the political uncertainties that Lew was talking about resolve themselves one way or the other, some folks will be making decisions about assets that they now hold. So we're very optimistic that there will be additional opportunities in that area, but there's nothing specific obviously that I can address at the moment. I would just reemphasize that acquisitions, asset acquisitions are not baked into the numbers that we have shared with you. So anything that we did in that way would have to be considered incremental to what we've shared with you.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","What was the impact of weather in the quarter and year? And in the past, you gave us sensitivity to wind resource in cents per share, and I remember that correlation kind of blew up. Is there any tool we can use along those lines?","Moray P. Dewhurst","On the latter part, I believe the wind sensitivity is in the back, on Slide 23. So 1% change in the wind resource is about $0.02 or $0.03 per share. On the final weather effect for Florida Power & Light, we're trying to get the numbers.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] next question and come back to that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No. But just recognized that under the settlement agreement, weather doesn't have a direct impact on earnings because it's typically offset by an adjustment to the surplus amortization. So we're happy to get you the number.","Operator","We'll go next to Ashar Khan [ph] from Visium Asset Management.","Unknown Analyst","Moray, if I go to Slide 16 that you provided, and if I'm right, I did my FPL, the utility divided by the parent, I come to the exact 58%. Can I use that same thing for 2014, using some kind of a midpoint as to what that 65% would be FPL and the transmission company or just FPL alone, the way you have shown it on this slide?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. Let me be clear what's in the slide. In the last part of the slide, so the percent from adjusted earnings from regulated businesses, that's the sum of FPL and Lone Star Transmission. So Lone Star is immaterial in 2011, but by 2014, we expect will be up and running. So conceptually, what you're talking about is the right way to think of it, but you're going to have the 2 pieces in. The chart -- the part of the -- the right-hand side of the chart, the EBITDA part, includes the whole enterprise, and so includes all of Energy Resources' components and factors in how much of Energy Resources' mix is associated with long-term contracted projects versus everything else. So in the right, in the green part of the bar, you've got FPL, plus Lone Star Transmission, plus the long-term contracted projects within Energy Resources.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So if I do my math, Moray, it seems like as what you've been telling right that from 2011 to '14, right, if I take the midpoint, it's like a $0.97 increase. It seems like $0.92 is coming from the regulated business. That means like nearly like 95% of the growth is just coming from the regulated side to meet some kind of a midpoint of the range.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I can't frankly follow your specific arithmetic right here now, but it is certainly true that the bulk of the growth that we're anticipating over this period is going to be associated with Florida Power & Light.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Dobson from Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Moray, sorry to come back in the queue, but just a quick question. Gas infrastructure, I don't remember what you sort of targeted there. I know it's relatively small numbers. But how does the current gas environment affect your outlook on investments there?","Moray P. Dewhurst","I think relative to a higher gas environment, other things equal, it means it will be, in the future, fewer opportunities. Having said that, at this stage, there are still plenty of deals that we're seeing that seem pretty attractive. We have indicated that we're going to limit the capital commitment to that business. But as to what the market opportunities will be, we'll have to see. Obviously, I'm sure many of you have seen others indicating that they may be moving assets away from gas explorations. So I think we're just going to have to see how that plays out. But clearly, over the long haul, our lower gas environment makes it less attractive for that business.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And remind me what the -- not commitment, but at least what you target to put to work there. Is that sort of $30 million to $50 million a year?","Moray P. Dewhurst","We had talked about a level of total capital commitment of up to maybe $600 million.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Over a period of several years?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, sure, over a period of several years, I think out through 2012, toward 2014. 2014.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. Got you. So more like $200 million a year.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.","Rebecca Kujawa","Thank you, everyone, very much for joining us today. We look forward to catching up with you again soon.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation."],"15390":["NextEra Energy, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Finnis. Please go ahead.","Amanda Finnis - Director Investor Relations","Thank you, Priscilla. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter of 2016 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners.","With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Senior Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factor section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our website, www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to John.","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are off to a strong start to 2016 and they made excellent progress against the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. NextEra Energy's first quarter adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 10% and the company continued to deliver significant growth in cash flow from operations against the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting strong performance of both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources.","NextEra Energy partners grew per unit distributions by 55% versus the prior year comparable period and continued to add to the solid run rate with which it entered the year by successfully acquiring two new wind projects. At Florida Power & Light growth was primarily driven by continued investment in the business to further advance our long term focus on delivering outstanding customer value. Our major capital initiatives remain on track and I am pleased to report that the New Port Everglades Next Generation Clean Energy Center entered service on April 1 on budget and two months ahead of schedule.","In addition, construction began on FPL's three 74.5 megawatt utility scale solar PV projects. As a reminder, these projects leverage existing infrastructure in prior development work that cost effectively add more solar to our system and upon expected delivery by the end of the year will roughly triple FPL's solar capacity. Not only will these projects help to further diversify FPL's fuel mix, but they also demonstrate FPL's commitment to providing customers low cost and reliable clean energy solutions.","Due in part to our efforts to modernize our existing generation at the end of the first quarter, we were pleased to deliver FPL's fourth rate decrease in the past 16 months. On March 15, we filed our formal request for rate relief beginning in January 2017 following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. Our 2017 to 2020 base rate proposal is largely consistent with what we indicated in the test year letter. Under this proposal, combined with current projections for fuel and other costs, FPL estimates its typical residential bill in 2020 will still be lower than it was in 2006 and will remain among the lowest in the state and nation based on current bill comparisons.","At Energy Resources contributions from continued growth in our contracted renewables portfolio and investments in natural gas pipelines grow strong financial results for the quarter. Since the last call, the team signed additional PPAs for additional for approximately 250 megawatts of U.S. wind for post 2016 delivery and closed on an acquisition of a 100 megawatt wind facility located in New Mexico that began operations in 2009. We continue to believe that the fundamentals for the North American renewables business have never been stronger, and I will provide an update on our latest expectations for a long-term contracted renewables development program later in the call.","In addition, earlier this month, we increased our participation in the Sabal Trail natural gas pipeline project through the incremental purchase of a 9.5% equity interest from Spectra Energy, bringing our total ownership share from 33% to 42.5%.","At NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to believe that a strong sponsor with a highly visible runway for future growth is a core driver of the NEP value proposition. During the quarter, NEP completed the acquisition of the Seiling I and II wind projects from Energy Resources, totaling approximately 300 megawatts. Despite challenging capital market conditions, the full block of limited partnership units to be issued in connection with the acquisition was purchased by the underwriter at the time of announcement. The overallotment option was also subsequently exercised in full.","In addition to NEP's success in accessing the equity markets to continue to grow its renewables generation portfolio, first quarter operating performance was excellent, and cash available for distribution was slightly better than our expectations. The NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of 31.875 cents per common unit, or $1.275 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 55% over the prior year. At this early point in the year, we're very pleased with our progress of both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners.","Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the first quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $393 million or $0.85 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.05 or approximately 6% year-over-year. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth was continued investment in the business. Average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 8.6% over the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we invested roughly $1.2 billion of the approximately $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion of capital expenditures that we expect for the full year.","Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending March 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a pre-determined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12 month period. We entered 2016 with a reserve amortization balance of $263 million, and we utilized $176 million during the first quarter, in order to achieve the regulatory ROE of 11.5% that I just mentioned.","This was slightly better than our expectations, leaving us with the balance of $87 million, which can be utilized in the remainder of 2016. Since the start of our current rate agreement in 2013, we have utilized the larger proportion of reserve amortization during the first half of the year due to the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses and we expect this year to be no different.","We continued to expect to utilize the balance of the reserve amortization this year to offset growing revenue requirements due to increased investments. We expect the reserve amortization balance along with our current sales, CapEx and O&M expectations to support regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% in 2016. As always, our expectations assume among other things normal weather and operating conditions.","The Florida economy remained solid. A focus on economic development and an overall improvement in the business climate continued to encourage business expansion and additional hiring. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate drop to an eight-year low of 4.9% in March down 0.7 percentage points from a year earlier and below the national rate of 5.0%. Over the same time period, the number of jobs increased 2.9% and over 1 million jobs have now been added in the state since December 2010.","As an indicator of new construction, new building permits have shown strong growth and the most recent reading of the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 6.0% from the prior year. Overall, Florida's economy continues to grow, and the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remain near post recession highs.","During the first quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 64,000 customers from the comparable prior year quarter, which had a favorable impact on sales of 1.3%. However, customer growth was more than offset by a 1.4% decline in sales due to mild weather during the quarter. Also, compared to the same quarter last year, underlying usage per customer declined 0.4% on a weather-normalized basis.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year. After accounting for these effects and the impact of a leap year day in 2016, first quarter retail sales increased 0.4% year-over-year. The number of inactive accounts reached its lowest levels in more than a decade and stronger growth in new service accounts during the quarter reflected healthy levels of construction.","As I mentioned earlier, on March 15, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for FPL's 2016 base rate proceeding. The overall proposal for our 2017 through 2020 base rate plan is substantially consistent with the test year letter filed in January. We are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $866 million starting January 2017, $262 million starting January 2018 and $209 million upon commissioning of the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center in mid-2019, with no base rate adjustment in 2020.","We are proud to offer customer service that ranks among the cleanest and most reliable in the country with typical residential bills among the lowest in the nation and 15% lower than 2006. The four-year base rate plan has been designed to support continued investments in long-term infrastructure and advanced technology which improves reliability and helps keep customer bills low. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's typical residential bill will grow at about 2.8% per year from January 2016 through the end of 2020, which is about the same as the expected rate of inflation.","The Florida Public Service Commission has established a definitive schedule for this proceeding, beginning with quality of service hearings in June, rebuttal testimony from interveners and staff in July, rebutting testimony from FPL in August, and technical hearings in late August and early September. The proceedings would conclude in the fourth quarter with the staff recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates.","The nearly 9,000 employees of FPL have worked hard and thoughtfully for many years following a consistent strategy that has led to FPL's current combination of low bills, high reliability and excellent customer service. The 2013 settlement agreement has benefited customers by eliminating the need for a general base rate increase for four years, while at the same time providing stability and certainty around the level of customer bills.","We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer and our focus will be to pursue a balanced outcome that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $224 million or $0.48 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $306 million or $0.66 per share, while adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 14% year-over-year. As a reminder, our reporting for Energy Resources now includes the results of our natural gas pipeline projects, formerly reported in the corporate and other segment. While our first quarter 2015 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, the effects are minimal due to the prior immaterial contributions from these projects during early stages of development.","Energy Resources' adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.08 from the prior year comparable quarter. New investments added $0.14 per share, including $0.10 from continued growth in our contractor renewables portfolio. These results reflect approximately 1,840 megawatts of new renewables projects placed into service during or after the first quarter of 2015. New investments in natural gas pipelines added $0.04 per share, reflecting the net addition of the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP, as well as continued development work on the Florida pipelines and Mountain Valley project. Wind resource was 98% of the long-term average, versus 87% in the first quarter of 2015, and this favorable comparison was the principal driver of increased contributions from existing assets of $0.04 per share.","Partially offsetting these results were lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business, increased corporate expenses primarily related to growth in the business, and the impact of share dilution. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.","At Energy Resources, we continue to believe we are well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in recent history. Over the last decade, we have invested roughly $23 billion in wind and solar generation. Last year alone, the team signed contracts for a total of approximately 2,100 megawatts of new renewables projects, making 2015 our second best year ever for renewables origination performance.","With these additions, along with the 100 megawatt acquisition since the last call that I mentioned earlier, our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program is over 4,000 megawatts. This result is roughly 500 megawatts above the midpoint of the range for these years that we discussed at our Investor Conference last March, making 2015 and 2016 the most successful two-year period for renewables development in our history.","Energy Resources continues to benefit from growing demand for renewables and has built what we believe, is the largest and highest quality renewables development pipeline in the space. Driving that growth is a number of favorable trends. First, Congress at the end of last year provided increased certainty of U.S. Federal Tax incentives for renewables through the extension of the 2014 Wind PTC and the 2016 Solar ITC programs over a five-year 'phase-down' period.","This form of policy support has been very important over the last decade, and with the extensions, we believe that renewables are well positioned to support a higher base opportunity set, than would otherwise have been the case, not only through 2018, but into the next decade.","Together with the extension, we expect that the IRS will provide start of construction guidance for both wind and solar. For wind, the guidance is expected to be consistent with and perhaps more constructive than what has previously been in place, which would support an ability to continue to offer very attractive pricing to our customers into the next decade.","The start of construction guidance for wind is likely to be released by the IRS over the next few months, while solar guidance is expected to follow later on, given that the COD deadline for the first step of the phase-down of the solar ITC is not scheduled to occur until January 1, 2020. In turn, we expect the added planning stability provided by tax incentives to serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines and efficiency improvements that will enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with gas-fired technology when tax incentives are phased-down. We have seen significant wind turbine efficiency improvements over the last several years and more are expected over the next few years.","Likewise solar panel costs have fallen steadily, while efficiency has also improved substantially, with even more advances expected over the next few years. Solar balance of system costs are also expected to experience significant reductions during the same period. Both wind and solar are well-positioned to compete head-to-head with gas-fired generation technologies now and as we head into the next decade.","Lower natural gas prices and environmental regulation are expected to continue to pressure existing coal facilities and renewables are well situated as the shift away from coal continues. Not only do wind and solar continue to benefit from cost and efficiency improvements and the economic support of tax incentives, but renewables also help customers meet both state and potential federal environmental compliance obligations.","In addition, state level renewable portfolio standards are now in-place in 29 states and discussions of increase in the renewable requirements under these standards are continuing in certain of these states. Despite the stay of the Clean Power Plan by the United States Supreme Court, we continue to believe that the regulatory trend in North America will continue to be towards supporting more renewable energy.","We expect resource planning activities for increasingly stringent environmental rules and potential carbon emissions regulations, whether at the state or federal level, will help further support demand. For these reasons, we expect some of our potential customers to be motivated not only by the economics in new renewables, but also by the consideration of current or potential future environmental compliance obligations such as the Clean Power Plan.","Due to the combination of these trends favoring the development of new renewables, the U.S. wind and solar market is expected to grow significantly into the next decade. We will continue to leverage our core strengths in solar and wind and invest in related areas such as energy storage in order to offer our customers innovative, low-cost and high quality projects that we expect to further enhance our competitive position.","We believe that the capabilities of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantage places in an excellent strategic position to capture even more opportunities going forward. In addition, we expect our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new, non-traditional customers particularly in the form of commercial and industrial demand as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure power from clean generation resources.","Based on everything we see now, we expect to bring into service roughly 2,400 megawatts to 3,800 megawatts of new U.S. wind projects over the course of the 2017 to 2018 timeframe. The low end of that range matches what we expect to bring into service for 2015 to 2016, one of our most successful origination periods to date, and is roughly three times what we indicated at our March 2015 Investor Conference.","On the U.S. solar side, the ITC extension may cause some customers to wait to sign contracts since the 30% ITC is in place for 2019. As such, we believe that a range of 400 to 1,300 megawatts is reasonable for the 2017 to 2018 timeframe. In part, this range reflects an expectation to continue to build upon our recent successes, as we've been positively surprised by the amount of demand we've seen for 2016 build. As a reminder, our 2015 to 2016 solar development program consists of over 1,300 megawatts, reflecting outstanding origination results for Greenfield and early stage development projects. However, we believe that some of this recent success may reflect the pulling forward of demand from future years. Overall, we expect a greater portion of new demand, particularly for solar to be for projects delivered in 2018 and beyond.","Over the last eight years, we have successfully developed and acquired more than 880 megawatts of new renewables projects in Canada. We continue to pursue development of new Canadian solar, wind and storage projects and see potential for up to 300 megawatts of new Canadian wind development opportunities, over the 2017 to 2018 period.","We are also contemplating repowering certain of our existing wind generation facilities, which would require new investments to be made to upgrade current equipment to the latest technology. On a project level basis, the incremental earnings and cash flow generation potential from these repowering investments could be similar to a new build opportunity, given that we would be targeting projects that are not generating PTCs. However, this effort is still in its early stages, and is contingent on IRS guidance that is expected to be released in the second quarter. We expect to be able to give a further update on where we are regarding this opportunity before the end of the year.","Energy Resources' expectations for capital expenditures to support the 2017 and 2018 renewables development program are $7 billion to $9 billion, reflecting a mid-point of 4,100 megawatts of new projects over this timeframe. These capital expenditure expectations are roughly the same as for our record-breaking 2015 and 2016 program. While there is some uncertainty as to the timing of these new build opportunities, we expect a greater portion of new project demand and, in turn, a greater portion of our investment opportunities to be in 2018.","Although, we are optimistic about the prospects for new renewables growth, it is important to remember that forecasting 2017 and 2018 origination expectations, while only a quarter of the way through 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties, including most importantly, the tenor of IRS start of construction guidance and its related impact on the timing of customer demand.","Similar to previous years, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with a flexible and opportunistic financing plan and a focus on capital recycling opportunities that supports our overall corporate credit position. We currently don't expect our financing plan in 2016 to require equity to support our renewables build.","As we discussed on the last call, our enthusiasm about our renewable growth prospects was a major driver of the increased expectations for NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share to 6% to 8% through 2018 off a 2014 base that we announced in the middle of last year. We continue to expect our renewables development program to support those expectations and our longer-term growth prospects. It is important to keep in mind that the greatest potential contribution to earnings and cash flow growth from these 2017 and 2018 development projects are for 2019 and beyond.","Let me now review the highlights for NEP. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $141 million and cash available for distribution was $38 million, up $71 million and $53 million respectively from the prior year comparable quarter, primarily due to portfolio growth. Before accounting for debt service, cash available for distribution was $112 million. New projects added $78 million of adjusted EBITDA and $55 million of cash available for distribution.","After accounting for the results of new project additions, the existing assets in the NEP portfolio operated well and benefited from a year-over-year improvement in wind resource. For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was roughly 100% of the long term average versus 86% in the first quarter of 2015. Solar resource was also strong during the quarter, but the year-over-year impact was small. Adjusted EBITDA from existing projects increased by $5 million from the prior year comparable quarter. The comparable increase in cash available for distribution was slightly greater due to favorable debt refinancing activities and the timing of tax equity contributions.","As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $6 million from the prior year comparable quarter. The impact of other effects, including higher management fees and outside services are shown on the accompanying slide.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the first quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $636 million or $1.37 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $715 million and $1.55 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment increased 1% per share compared to the first quarter of 2015.","The sale of our Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets located in ERCOT closed just after the end of the first quarter. This transaction generated net cash proceeds of approximately $456 million and a net after-tax gain on disposition of approximately $107 million that will be excluded from NextEra Energy's second quarter adjusted earnings.","We expect continued opportunities to recycle capital through potential additional sale opportunities of merchant and other non-strategic assets in our portfolio. In addition, the strong renewables origination performance at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of low risk, long-term contracted assets potentially available for sale to NextEra Energy Partners. Our continued focus on recycling capital at Energy Resources, whether through third-party asset sales or drop-downs to NEP, together with what we believe is an outstanding regulated opportunity set at FPL, continue to support our ability to balance growth across our two main businesses.","Based on our first quarter performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full year. For 2016, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35. Looking further ahead, we also continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, implying a compound annual growth rate off the 2014 base of 6% to 8%. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.","Turning now to NEP, the acquisition of the Seiling I & II projects during the first quarter has added to what we already considered to be a solid run rate and has further increased NEP's flexibility for the balance of the year. We expect the current portfolio post the acquisition of Seiling I & II to support a CAFD run rate of $210 million to $240 million, which is within the range of our December 31, 2016 portfolio run rate CAFD expectations of $210 million to $290 million.","Due to our ability to raise approximately $287 million in equity to acquire these projects, their contribution to cash available for distribution and the success we've had under the ATM program, we now have more liquidity and debt capacity than we had coming into the year. We continue to evaluate the optimal long-term capital structure for NEP, and our current thinking is that the portfolio can support a holdco leverage ratio of approximately 3.5 times project distributions after debt service. Based on this metric, we expect our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $300 million to $400 million. As a result, we have flexibility as to how we finance our next acquisition and can be opportunistic regarding our approach to further growth opportunities for the balance of the year. We have included a new slide in the appendix to today's presentation with additional details regarding NEP's current incremental holdco debt capacity.","The December 31, 2016 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and CAFD of $210 million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.","From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit, at an annualized rate of a $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of a $1.38 to a $1.41 per common unit, meeting the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2017.","In summary, we continue to believe that NEE and NEP offer some of the best value propositions in the industry. We remain very focused on the execution objectives for the year and we're off to a good start. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning and congratulations.","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Thank you. Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So, perhaps first on the cadence of signing up these contracts that you just discussed. When do you expect to start seeing them come through, obviously there is a lot of work with the chop ahead of you. Is it later this year and or is that really going to be a next year event? And ultimately within that 2017, 2018 window you talk about is this largely weighted towards 2018 in service?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Yeah. Okay. So, for the contracts that we just signed, 250 megawatts, those are for 2017 delivery and then we also announced the 100 megawatt acquisition of the High Lonesome Mesa project and the acquisition has already closed for that one facility. And then for your second question Julien, in terms of how we see the shape of the 2017 and the 2018 build, I think we see more of a pull forward of demand into 2016 on solar, so more the solar activity occurring in 2018. And then with wind you know I think, relatively balanced between 2017 and 2018, but perhaps more activity in 2018.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. And then if you can just clarify a bit your intentions here just 2016 equity needs, and then also interest still in the Oncor process or is that \u2013 is that on the back burner here?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","I'll take the first one and then the second, I'll kick it to Jim. We currently don't see an equity need in 2016. Again, we announced the closing of the Forney and Lamar sale, which netted cash proceeds of approximately $457 million, which puts us in a pretty good position for the year. On the second question, I will ask Jim to answer that.","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Julien, I am not going to comment on any individual acquisition other than to say what we've consistently said about acquisitions, which is first of all there is no imperative for us to do one. Second, that we have a pretty tight screen on what we would be willing to do and it would have to make sense both strategically for us and would have to make sense financially and would have to in our view create significant shareholder value. And I think that's kind of all that I am willing to say at this point on Oncor or any of the rest of the M&A, other than again that we will be very financially disciplined about how we approach it, and the focus is going to be on creating shareholder value.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","But to clarify, perhaps admist the balance sheet implications of the acceleration of the renewal plan, do you see this as expedited data knoll (35:57), can you perhaps comment on that angle?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Right.","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, I think, what I said about there is no imperative for us to do regulated M&A, we don't have to do it. I think is \u2013 is addresses that Julien. Obviously we've been very successful on the renewable front, but we've also been very successful on recycling capital and we're going to continue to recycle capital. We're committed to doing that and we're obviously committed to continuing to have a strong balance sheet and strong credit.","So, we feel good about where we are right now and we continue to have one of the best balance sheets in the industry and I guard it pretty jealously. And we're going to continue to be focused on creating value like we have over the last decade for our shareholders.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for being explicit. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will move next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Congrats on great results. I was interested by the comments that you made in your prepared remarks on repowering of wind and you mentioned needing to get some IRS guidance. Could you speak a little bit further of what specifically you need to see from the IRS to allow you to move forward? And then, can you just speak \u2013 I know, you can't give a sense of the magnitude, but just what kinds of opportunities could then present themselves in terms of repowering, would these be for sort of new RFPs, where you could, in a low cost way compete against the Greenfield or how should we think about this opportunity?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","I'm going to direct that question to Armando.","Armando Pimentel - President and Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC","Hey, Stephen. Good morning.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Armando Pimentel - President and Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC","So a couple of things, like last time when the \u2013 excuse me, the PTC extension was passed by Congress. We're all awaiting guidance on, that started construction, how long out into the future can you build and still get those PTCs. In addition, it looks like \u2013 excuse me, the IRS may provide guidance on something relating to repowerings. There is no, we don't know that that's going to happen yet or not. We've talked about repowerings in the past with investors. We have repowered some of our sites in the past, we've torn turbines down and put up new turbines. What we're actually looking at is the possibility of enhancing some of our older sites and still being able to qualify for new production tax credit.","So, it's difficult at this point to say how big the opportunity is, and it's actually difficult to say exactly what the IRS guidance would have to look like for us to feel comfortable. The IRS has current guidance on what I'll call if you have an old piece of equipment and you refurbished that equipment to some extent there are some cases where that new refurbished equipment could get all of the tax benefits of a new piece of equipment. And so, that guidance is already out there. How and when it might apply to what we're talking about, is something that we're interested in. So at this point, it's an opportunity. It could be a good small opportunity or it could be a significant opportunity. I think we will absolutely have more to say on this if it's a decent opportunity on the next call.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very much, understood. And just shifting gears to, curious about Texas in terms of the renewables market. We've seen pretty significant growth in wind in Texas to very high levels of penetration. When you think about further growth opportunities in Texas, I was curious just first economically, how interesting is that given the next generation of turbines that we've seen? And secondly, do you see significant changes needed to the grid in order to allow more penetration, that is are we getting to levels where the grid really does need to materially change to allow for greater growth in Texas?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","So for us, I think you've noticed that we really haven't had a lot of new Texas wind development over the last couple of years and that's really a result of our concern over the long-term economics of ERCOT and it's one of the reasons why we decided that the assets, the Lamar and Forney assets, were probably worth more to somebody else than they were to us.","Obviously like you, we've seen a lot of folks build in Texas. I mean look it's easy to build in Texas, the permitting is favorable, the interconnections are favorable. I think you are probably right in what you're intimating that at some point in the future, there is going to have to be another wave of significant transmission build in Texas in order to accommodate new wind. But it's the other thing to look at in Texas actually Stephen is solar. We've seen and I'm sure you and others have seen that there appears to be an early wave of solar in Texas at prices that appear very attractive.","And so, it's not just wind, I think Texas is also going to be a market that is going to be very favorable for construction of other renewable, including solar. So I don't want to \u2013 my comments shouldn't seem like we're not interested in Texas. We continue to be interested in development in Texas, but it's not going to be in my view as significant a part of our future investment, as it was during the 2006-2008 timeframe.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go now to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning. Thank you. Can I ask another question about Texas? Just in general given the sort of the destabilization of what is happening there on the regulatory front with regard to uncertainty around how taxes are going to be calculated in the future, as it relates to the Oncor proceeding? Is that a less attractive environment for you in general for investment?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Yeah. I think the only thing I'd say about that is, there is a statute on the books currently in Texas, and other than that I am not going to comment on it.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. But clearly the commissioners who are currently sitting on that PUC are creating a lot of uncertainty around the interpretation of that statute, right?","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey Greg. This is Jim. I think if there was uncertainty it's been driven by the Hunt's application. I think there was some talk of doing a workshop and that workshop has been put off. And so I think depending on what happens, I think it's all going to come down to depending really on what happens with the Hunt's application, and I think that's a very specific case to a very specific situation and a very specific structure. And I'd be very hesitant to draw any conclusions about other utilities in Texas. We're not concerned for example about Lone Star.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. That was really the gist of the question. And then the second question is with regard to the rate case. I know the numbers stand on their own in terms of the modest revenue increases that you're asking for in the context of the request, but you've said before, in multiple occasions, that you think that this case is going to be predominantly an ROE case.","So has there been any \u2013 is it too early or has there been any sort of commentary from the intervener groups, the commission, the staff, around where the data is around your ability to continue to earn returns in the ranges that you currently have. Obviously your performance in the state has been excellent and that's a good reason to grant that?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Yeah, hard to disagree with you Greg on that; look, it's too early. We've \u2013 it's \u2013 we've filed our case and we're doing responses to a variety of questions and this process will take place between now and July when the case is really all filed and then we'll go from there.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So, we really won't start to see the meat of the sort of back and forth, in terms of testimony, until sort of after July?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Yeah. It will typically go into the July process and then obviously if we go into hearings that will be at the end of August, beginning of September.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks, guys. Have a great day.","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","You too.","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Abe Azar from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Do you have any update on the NET expansion pipeline project, and maybe a little bit more broadly what opportunities are you seeing to add pipeline projects, so, besides the Sabal Trail announcement from this morning?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","So a couple of things. NET, we're still \u2013 obviously it hasn't been a year yet since we closed it. And when we did close it, and we announced that one of the things we said is we were excited about all of the opportunities, not only what we thought were identified opportunities, but all of the unidentified opportunities, because it was a vast pipeline system inside of Texas.","Since then, we've seen continued activity from the Mexican front and we are not in Mexico just to clear that point up. But from the Mexican front that they continue to import a lot of gas and have a lot of needs. That's creating opportunities, opportunities that we hope will actually turn into something for NET, because in particular, our pipes are \u2013 NET pipes are well placed in Texas to be able to provide to Mexico.","In terms of the expansion projects, there were a couple of projects; there were some smaller projects that we expected to get completed during the first 12 months or 18 months. I don't know that many of those projects have fallen off the radar. As a matter of fact, there has been more projects that have been added on, what I'll call the small-scale optimization, which is good, which is good for NET. And then, there were a couple of larger expansion projects that we had until \u2013 under the terms of the agreement, until the end of this year, to figure out whether they were going to come in or not. And those appear okay at this point; one of them actually appears quite favorable.","I think we're not going to know the pace of actually signing something up with, particularly with the Mexican Government isn't as quick as we would like to see. So we would like for \u2013 we'll probably see more activity and we'll have more to say towards the end of the year. There is a $200 million incentive payment to the owners \u2013 previous owners of NET, should those expansion projects come online and obviously if they don't, that saves NET $200 million. So, I think the previous owners and us are all well incented to get the expansion projects done, but it's just a little too early to figure out how we're going to do by the end of the year.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go now to Matt Tucker from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on the previous question on NET first. From an NEP perspective, could you just comment on how the performance has been so far relative to your expectations at NET?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Yeah, it's been right on Matt \u2013 right on expectations.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then keeping with NEP, would you be willing to give any color on your drop down plans for the balance of the year and how you would finance drop downs? Both if you were hypothetically to do something today or in current market conditions and how you would finance in kind of an ideal scenario, if there is a difference there?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Yeah, I mean, we feel really good about where we are with NEP. As we said in the prepared remarks, a lot of flexibility for the balance of the year with the equity raise, $287 million for the Seiling I & II acquisitions, and now what we feel is available debt capacity around $300 million to $400 million, it gives us a chance to be very opportunistic about growth for the balance of the year.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And then just last one from me could you comment on what you're seeing in terms of the third-party M&A market from an NEP perspective right now? And what's NEP's appetite like right now for third-party M&A?","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","So there is, we've talked about the M&A market both the asset acquisition market and the small renewable developer market before, and there is quite a bit of activity in what I'll call the asset M&A market out there and we're \u2013 we look at all of those opportunities but it's really a very small percentage of opportunity that come to fruition for us.","On the other larger development M&A market, I think Jim has commented before that there is very few players that we would be interested in, only because the way that they put deals together and the way they manage their projects is a little different than us. And so, I wouldn't really expect, at least in the near-term, for us to be doing any significant acquisitions at NEP.","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The only thing I would add is, that we have such a massive pipeline of projects at NEER that can be dropped down into NEP, that there is not a huge need for us to be looking at third-party acquisitions. And frankly, our focus remains at NEER on great renewable development work and on creating an even more massive pipeline of things that we can drop down into NEP this year and going forward.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, guys.","John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Just adding on also to what Jim said about the portfolio available at Energy Resources, if you exclude the 2015-2016, we got about 12 gigawatts. We have another 4 gigawatts on for 2015-2016, and then for 2017-2018 if we're successful in hitting the midpoint of the 4,100 megawatts I mentioned before, by the end of 2018, you are right around 20 gigawatts. So puts us in great shape from a NEP perspective.","Operator","Thank you, and this does conclude our question-and-answer session and our conference today. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us.

And at this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Julie Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Julie Holmes","Thank you, Josh. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power & Light Company. Moray will provide an overview of our results, following which our executive team will be available to answer your questions.","We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements, if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-financial GAAP -- which are non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure.","With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy had a very successful second quarter. Our financial results were good, driven by new contracted renewable assets at Energy Resources and strong operating performance across the portfolio, and put us a little ahead of where we had expected to be at this point in the year. All of our major existing capital projects progressed satisfactorily, most notably with the Cape Canaveral modernization coming into service ahead of schedule and under budget.","In addition, we made excellent progress in firming up some of the additional investment opportunities we have previously discussed and in developing initiatives, which we expect will allow us to maintain our strong competitive cost position. As a consequence, our expectations for this year have improved slightly, while our longer term financial expectations now have additional support. All in all, it was a very good quarter.","At FPL, we maintained a regulatory ROE of 11%, while continuing to invest capital in ways that improve the value that we deliver to our customer. Average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 11.5% over the same quarter last year, and was the main driver of our net income growth of about 11%.","The FPL team continues to execute well on our major capital projects. The new units at Cape Canaveral ended service in April, under budget and more than a month ahead of schedule. Their fuel efficiency is roughly 30% better than the old units they replaced, and our customers began benefiting from their fuel savings earlier than anticipated. The roughly $1.3 billion Riviera Beach modernization project remains on schedule to enter service in June of 2014, and our third modernization project at Port Everglades reached a major milestone earlier this month, with the demolition of the old 1960s-era plant. Construction of the new plant is slated to begin next spring.","FPL also made good progress in pursuing additional initiatives that we have previously mentioned. During the quarter, we filed petitions with the Florida Public Service Commission to accelerate our storm hardening program and upgrade our peaking capacity systems. And we concluded our analysis on the most cost-effective alternative for additional natural gas transportation capacity into Florida. We will discuss these initiatives in greater detail later in the call.","At Energy Resources, contribution to adjusted earnings per share was up $0.15 or 37% over the prior year comparable quarter, primarily as a result of new contracted assets added to the portfolio, as well as strong operating performance from our existing assets. We continue to make good progress on our backlog of contracted renewables projects, our Canadian wind program is progressing satisfactorily with approximately 125 megawatts expected to enter service this year, while the remaining roughly 475 megawatts are targeted to come online in 2014 and 2015. We continue to expect roughly 300 megawatts of new contracted solar capacity to enter service in the U.S. this year. The remaining approximately 500 megawatts of the solar backlog, with which we started the year, are expected to come online by the end of 2016. In addition, we will have at least another 40 megawatts, as I will detail later.","Turning to the U.S. wind business. Since our last quarterly call, Energy Resources signed contracts for nearly 650 megawatts of new capacity, bringing the total to date for the 2013 to '14 program to roughly 975 megawatts, of which 250 megawatts are expected to enter service this year. This places us firmly in the middle of the range of 500 to 1,500 megawatts that we discussed at our Investor Conference in March, and we are currently in discussions with customers that could bring the total higher.","The progress we made during the second quarter continues to support our long-term expectations for EPS growth, and we continue to see a range of growth in adjusted earnings per share of 5% to 7% off the 2012 base. While the baseline capital deployment program we discussed in March continues to support the lower end of this range and while we are pleased with the developments of the last 3 months, we should also note that 2016 is a long way in the future, and there are still many sources of uncertainty that could push us towards either the higher or the lower end of the range.","Let me now walk through our results for the second quarter of 2013. I will begin with the results at FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers.","For the second quarter of 2013, FPL reported net income of $391 million or $0.92 per share, up $0.07 per share year-over-year. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth in the quarter was continued investment in the business. We invested roughly $700 million in the quarter and expect to invest approximately $2.9 billion for the full year. Regulatory capital employed growth of roughly 11.5% over the same quarter last year was the main driver of growth in net income of approximately 11%. We utilized $82 million of reserve amortization during the quarter, enabling us to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11%, and we remain comfortable with the balance, which we expect to be roughly $180 million at the end of the year, will be adequate through 2016. Recall that over the past 2 years, we have utilized a larger proportion of reserve amortization during the first half of the year, and we do not expect this year to be any different. We also had expected 2013 to require a higher reserve amortization than in subsequent years, and this remains true. For 2013, we believe that achieving an 11% to 11.25% ROE is reasonable.","Economic indicators in Florida continued trending positively during the second quarter, particularly those associated with the recovery of the housing market. Housing inventory levels continue to decline, spurring new construction and price increases across the state. Housing starts in Florida are up 67% year-to-date compared to 28% nationally. Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, are now at levels not seen since 2007 and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth by 41%. South Florida home prices are up nearly 13% for the year, which is the highest annual growth we have seen since 2006 and above the Case-Shiller Composite Index.","The broader economic outlook in Florida also remains positive. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in June dropped 1.7 percentage points from the prior year to 7.1%, outpacing the improvement in the national unemployment rate of 0.6% over the same period. Other positive economic data across the state include improvement in taxable sales, which recently surpassed the prerecession peak, as well as the consumer confidence index, which has also recovered to prerecession levels.","As Florida's economy continues to recover, it also continues to diversify. According to a recent IT industry report, Florida ranked third in the number of high-tech establishments and fifth in high-tech employment in the U.S. International trade is growing as well, as Florida now ranks second in the number of exporting companies behind only California. Encouraging economic data in Florida continues to be generally reflected in the internal indicators that we follow at FPL.","During the second quarter, we averaged approximately 35,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter in 2012, representing an increase of 0.8%. This general level of increase has now been consistent for more than 2 years, and we are optimistic that it will increase modestly in the years ahead. Total retail sales increased 1.0% during the quarter, as customer growth and increased underlying usage offset much cooler than normal temperatures we experienced in May.","The number of inactive meters declined 8.5% year-over-year in June, the strongest annual decline in over a decade. We have typically seen seasonal increases in inactive meters between May and June, as many retirees leave for the summer. This year was unusual, as we saw inactive meters actually fall 2.8% between May and June, indicating either less seasonality or a true tightening of the housing market. On the other hand, the proportion of low usage accounts has remained relatively static and appears to reflect a semipermanent increase in the proportion of investor-owned and internationally owned properties.","New service accounts are on track to total between 35,000 and 40,000 for the year, and as was the case last quarter, we continued to see growth in our industrial accounts, which are generally tied to the construction industry in our service territory. Overall, we remain encouraged by the positive economic trends and customer metrics in our service territory.","As many of you will recall, FPL issued a request for proposal in December 2012 for new natural gas transportation capacity that will help ensure Florida's continued access to clean, affordable U.S.-produced fuel necessary to meet the state's growing needs. Only 2 major pipeline system serve Central and Southern Florida today. A third new pipeline system will increase the diversity and reliability of gas supply for Florida's residents and will bring substantial direct and indirect economic benefits to the state.","During the quarter, we completed an extensive analysis of all bids and determined that the best solution for meeting customers' needs economically is a combination of the Sabal Trail Transmission proposal advanced by Spectra Energy for a new northern pipeline originating in Southwestern Alabama and terminating at the new Central Florida hub; and the proposal submitted by Florida Southeast Connection, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, for a second southern pipeline to connect the Central Florida hub to FPL's Martin plant. This combination was substantially more economical than any other combination of bids and promises to deliver excellent value to FPL's customers decades to come.","Late last week, FPL filed with the PSC for prudence review of the necessary contractual arrangements for both Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection, and we are seeking regulatory approval by the end of 2013.","Consistent with what we have stated previously about NextEra Energy's willingness to invest in the northern pipeline to ensure that FPL has the necessary natural gas transportation capacity when it is needed, we have agreed to invest approximately 1\/3 of the capital needed to complete the Sabal Trail pipeline, which is expected to total roughly $3 billion. The NextEra Energy investment in Florida Southeast Connection is expected to total approximately $550 million.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of $229 million or $0.54 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $238 million or $0.56 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges, which beginning in the second quarter 2013, include interest rate hedges related to the Spain solar project, as well as the net effect of other than temporary impairments, or OTTI, on certain investments.","Energy Resources had a strong quarter, with contributions to adjusted EPS increasing $0.15 year-over-year. Contributions from new investments placed into service since the second quarter of 2012 increased $0.12. We are targeting approximately 300 megawatts of solar this year for CITC election, equating to roughly $75 million in full year adjusted earnings. Adjusted earnings per share from our existing assets increased $0.04 over the second quarter last year due to favorable wind generation, the absence of a power derated Seabrook and the absence of outages at our 2 Texas combined cycle plants. Our gas infrastructure business increased $0.02 from additional production, while the customer supply and trading businesses were down $0.03. All other effects were minor.","Energy Resources had a successful quarter in the capital markets. We completed $170 million differential membership interest or tax equity transaction on approximately 160 megawatts of contracted wind projects. We continue to expect the proportion of PTCs allocated to investors to grow to nearly 50% in 2013, up from approximately 41% in 2012.","We also completed the company's largest project financing in our history, a $1.15 billion term loan on our natural gas plants in Texas, which significantly exceeds the book value of the assets. The success of this financing positions our Texas portfolio well, and is indicative of our continued ability to access different segments of the capital markets at attractive rates. We will continue to pursue suitable tax equity and project finance structures to support our overall corporate credit position, and our cash flow growth year-to-date is consistent with our projections for credit metric improvement that we discussed at our Investor Conference in March.","I want to take a moment to address a number of recent inquiries from investors about our interest in forming a so-called Yield Co. for a segment of Energy Resources contracted assets. While we have made no decisions yet and do not feel any great urgency to undertake a major structural change that might prove difficult or costly to reverse, we are actively examining this and other alternatives that might highlight the value of our contracted renewable asset portfolio or might enable us to access a pool of capital with different risk return requirements. As we examine these alternatives, we are very focused on the question of whether and how they might create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. And we are sensitive to the fact that our situation is unique and therefore, blindly copying a solution that is suitable for another company may not be the best for our shareholders.","Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the second quarter of 2013, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $610 million or $1.44 per share. NextEra Energy's 2013 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS was $620 million and $1.46, respectively. The Corporate & Other segment was down slightly from the same quarter last year, but we continue to expect the full year contributions from this segment to improve modestly relative to 2012.","Before taking your questions, let me turn the call over to Jim Robo for some closing remarks.","James L. Robo","Thanks, Moray. At our Investor Conference in March, we laid out a series of potential incremental investment opportunities at both our major businesses that we indicated could take us beyond the growth profile implied by the backlog of projects that we enjoyed at that time. I would like to take a moment to summarize where we stand on those opportunities.","Starting with FPL, we indicated that we saw the potential for investing additional dollars in storm hardening and reliability programs, depending upon progress in improving our already strong O&M performance. We've now filed with the PSC a proposed storm hardening plan that will effectively accelerate roughly $400 million of capital spending into the 2013 through '16 time period, and we've also increased our expectations for general infrastructure capital expenditures for the same period by roughly $700 million. All these initiatives are designed to improve our T&D service reliability or to otherwise improve customer service. We are confident our cost position will allow us to absorb these expenditures under the rate agreement, while still earning an adequate return for our shareholders.","In June, we completed our analysis on the most economical way to upgrade our peaking capacity, and on June 28, we filed with the PSC a plan for upgrade that will cost approximately $820 million and will be completed by the end of 2016. We believe this proposed program should be eligible for recovery under the environmental cost recovery clause. A hearing is scheduled to be held in November, and a decision is expected later that month.","As Moray mentioned earlier, our capital commitment to support the development and construction of the new third gas pipeline could total roughly $1.6 billion, and we hope to have a PSC decision on this project by the end of the year. We continue to look for opportunities to bring more solar generation to Florida and have 500 megawatts of sites more or less ready to move forward. However, we think the most likely timeframe for this initiative will be in 2015 or '16.","And finally, we continue to pursue opportunities to serve others within the state, either at retail or through wholesale contracts, and we hope to close the Vero Beach acquisition in 2014.","At Energy Resources, our U.S. wind program for 2013 and '14 now stands at close to 1,000 megawatts or roughly $1.7 billion worth of capital expenditures, with potential to grow up to 1,500 megawatts. We are making progress on our initiative to add up to 300 megawatts of incremental U.S. solar by pursuing both greenfield development and acquisition opportunities. We have already signed contracts on 40 megawatts of U.S. solar earlier this year, and we see the possibility of 1 additional large-scale project being finalized within the next few months","Underpinning all of our new investment and growth initiatives is our continued commitment to enhancing our already strong, competitive cost position. We have undertaken a company-wide initiative aimed at rethinking our approach to all aspects of how we do business, and I'm very pleased with the many thoughtful and creative ideas that our employees have put forth. While we are only just beginning to move into the implementation, we believe that the entire portfolio of ideas will enable us to attain our goal of keeping total, non-fuel O&M flat and nominal terms at FPL through 2016, and at the same time, support Energy Resources' growth objectives. This company-wide initiative has also helped identify a number of areas where we expect to improve margins and grow revenue at Energy Resources.","At our March Conference, we indicated that the capital associated with all of our incremental opportunities might total as much as $9 billion. To date, we have firmed up roughly $5 billion of incremental growth capital that we expect to deploy through 2016. While we still have a long way to go to bring the project shown on this slide to fruition, I'm pleased with the progress we have made.","Although the exact proportions will vary, at this point, we continue to see roughly 60% of our capital expenditures going towards FPL and other rate-regulated opportunities, while nearly all our growth capital and energy resources is going into long-term contracted assets. Consequently, we continue to expect our portfolio mix and earnings profile to shift towards a more regulated and long-term contracted business. Adjusted EBITDA coming from our regulated and long-term contracted operations is expected to reach roughly 84% of the total in 2016.","Turning to the financial outlook. We are not anticipating that the second half of the year will be quite as strong as the first half. But based on our performance year-to-date, we think it is reasonable to expect our full year adjusted EPS to be in the upper half of the $4.70 to $5 range that we had previously communicated. For the longer-term outlook, we continue to see adjusted EPS growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off a 2012 base. The positive developments of this quarter clearly provide additional support for this growth range. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.","As we continue to invest to build and grow our businesses, we expect to maintain our strong credit position. Our cash flow profile is improving, which by itself, will help our credit metrics return to historical levels. In addition, as we've discussed at the Investor Conference in March, we currently expect to issue incremental equity to the extent our capital program requires it.","There has been no major change in our thinking here, with the potential for up to $1.5 billion of incremental equity if we were to be at the top end of our range of capital investment. Given the likely timelines for various regulatory proceedings, we expect we will have a firmer sense of our requirements early in 2014.","Before turning the call back to Moray for questions, let me close by, again, summarizing our focus for the remainder of 2013. First, as always, we must maintain our focus on excellence in day-to-day operations. We can never afford to lose sight of the fact that our long-term success is built on delivering outstanding value for our customers at FPL and on operating efficiently and reliably across the portfolio. Second, we will be very focused on moving the large portfolio of ideas we have developed for improving productivity and day-to-day operations from the idea stage to practical reality. We have much implementation planning and, of course, execution ahead of us to ensure that customers and shareholders ultimately realize the value of the good work that has been done so far.","At FPL, we have 2 modernization projects underway that we are committed to bringing into service on schedule and on budget. We will also be working on a larger portfolio of reliability investments, primarily in the T&D system, which we are committed to completing as soon as we practically can. And third, we have some important new initiatives, particularly the peaker upgrades and the new gas pipeline that will require development, regulatory and, ultimately, large-scale construction activities to bring to fruition. The FPL team will have much on their plate.","At Energy Resources, in addition to a focus on excellence in daily operations, we must continue to push forward with development and construction on the large backlog of contracted renewable projects that we have, which today totals more than 2,400 megawatts, while also seeking additional opportunities to add to that backlog the Energy Resources team will have much on their plate as well.","Of course, this is not the sum total of our challenges, but if we are successful with these, we will have a strong future ahead of us. With that, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will first go to the side of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just kind of on this Yield Co. conversation. I know you guys are still on the evaluation mode, but a number of years ago when the wind IPO was a very popular idea, I know you guys took a look at that also. Can you just maybe share your thoughts on what you guys learned looking into the process of separation, and what kind of bearing that can have as you think about the institutional impact of if you guys were to go forward or something at this point?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure, I'll give that a try. Just reflecting back on where we were back in 2006, 2007, one of the things that we observed then, and it would certainly apply in the current case, is that there are some incremental costs associated with setting up a separate structure. So we should -- they're not massive, but we shouldn't underestimate them either. So for us, that suggests that we really need to try and understand whether there is a reasonably long-term sustainable opportunity here, or whether we're just seeing a sort of transient divergence in capital market prices. So I think if you reflect on the renewable spin-off phase, at least a couple of those looked very strong initially, but the performance was not sustained. And I think reflecting on where we are now, we wouldn't want to be in a situation where we've incurred all the incremental costs and only a short time later, we find ourselves effectively looking for a way to reverse that. So having said that, to the extent that there's really a pool of capital here that prices certain risk characteristics differently than the main capital markets, that is something that we would certainly want to try and take advantage of. I should point out, however, that it isn't necessarily simply a public pool of capital, there may be other ways of accessing investors who have the same sort of risk return profile. So one of the other things that I've talked about with at least some of you before that we have in the mix is also whether there are individual large investors who would be interested in a portion -- taking a position in a portion of the portfolio. So there's a variety of structural ways that we might go about accessing that sort of capital. So those are some of the things we're looking at right now.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess just on the wind additions were quite strong in the quarter and interesting. For the Colorado projects, they were done because the economics were good, not because they were trying to meet renewable standards. I didn't know if Armando or Mike or somebody want to talk about kind of the bigger landscape for projects that you guys are looking at for customers and what is the prospects? And how long is the timetable do you think to sign contracts between now and year end to qualify for PTCs?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. Let me ask Armando to address that. But first, just generally, I don't think there's been a great deal of change in what we're seeing. Obviously, customers, as well as we, are aware of what the situation is with the PTC program right now. So there's a strong incentive to the extent that you either have a renewable portfolio obligation in the near term, or to the extent that the economics in your particular area look attractive to negotiate and sign if you can. But Armando, you want to comment further?","Armando Pimentel","Dan, what we're seeing right now is there was certainly a good slew of RFP opportunities, I'd say starting late first quarter, really progressing through the second quarter this year. As Moray just indicated though, everyone is keenly aware of the PTC expiration. Once again, the words are a bit different this time around than they have been in the past. What we're seeing right now is a slew of additional RFP opportunities out there, whether all of those opportunities, whether all of those RFPs come to fruition in real projects remains to be seen. I'd say that the majority of the opportunities that we're seeing are still RPS-related, but there's a good portion of the opportunities that were either the states or the individual customers have met their RPS requirements and are really looking to buy what we call economic wind. So I'd say there's another 2 to 3 months probably this year where we will -- we and others will have the opportunity to sign up projects for 2013 and 2014. And I think after that, it will slow down a bit.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. I think, if we're -- as I've said before, if we're not kind of buttoned down by the fall, then it's probably not going to happen, unless there's some change in the PTC program. So there is a clear sense of urgency.","Operator","Our next question comes from the side of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Moray, I wanted to go to the point you mentioned about thinking about long-term sustainable value of the Yield Co. as the pros and cons. One of the dynamics that I looked at a lot is the earnings profile for the business relative to free cash flow, and currently resources has very good earnings, but the free cash flow is far greater than the earnings, and that's often a profile you see for renewables assets. Is that a dynamic that you all think about in the context of the Yield Co.?","Moray P. Dewhurst","It's certainly in the mix. I wouldn't say that it's, at least at this stage, one of the principal drivers that we're seeing. And by that, I mean that the cash flow to earnings profile will naturally change over time. And as we've discussed at the Investor Conference, in the next couple of years, we're going to see that strong cash flow generation at Energy Resources much more manifest in the overall corporate numbers, just the way the dynamics of the portfolio are moving. So I think that's going to become more obvious anyway. I think on the fundamentals of the Yield Co., it seems to me, more around whether there's a systematic difference in the way certain investors value different combinations of essentially risk and growth. I mean, obviously, what you're doing in a Yield Co. format is you're creating something that has very visible yield, very visible income and also the potential for essentially a certain degree of controllable growth or pre-specified growth, I guess a better way of putting it. Well, that kind of structure, it seems to me in today's environment, should be very attractive to investors. So that's not in question. The question is whether the valuation of that cash flow stream in a separate format did in fact any higher than is implicit in the overall corporate format, and that's a question that is a little tougher to sort out. So one of the things that we certainly want to do is take advantage of the fact that we're not under any time pressure here to see how some of the existing vehicles that are now out there trade. I think that's going to give us a lot more insight.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up. If you think about the M&A environment for renewables assets, I know in the past, you've been targeting double-digit unlevered returns, and that would put the levered equity returns, in our view at least, above 20%. These days, from what we see at least, the target return levels continue to come down. It's a competitive environment, more into the sort of low double-digit equity returns. As you think about a Yield Co. as a currency relative to, say, NextEra, which is many investors think on a sort of EPS accretion basis, how do you see a Yield Co. as a -- in the context of M&A and growth?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I guess, to me, it comes back to the point that I was discussing earlier, which is whether there's fundamentally a different pool of investors with different -- that place different value on certain risk and growth combinations. To the extent there is, then it seems to me you want to take advantage of that source of capital regardless. To the extent that it's not, then I think a Yield Co. -- so-called Yield Co. currency could end up simply misleading you as to the appropriate prices. In other words, I would hate for to be in a situation where having such a vehicle puts pressure on you to lower the underlying returns that you're targeting in the things that you're going after, because those things really should be based on the investors' risk-adjusted opportunity costs. So I'm a little bit leery of it in that respect. But again, I want to emphasize that to me, it really comes down to the question of whether there's a distinct pool of investors who fundamentally value different cash flow streams with different risk and growth characteristics differently.","Operator","Our next question comes from the side of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess we've beat the Yield Co. question to death, so I won't go there. Can you just -- what was the wind resource last quarter? I know you revamped your algorithm.","Moray P. Dewhurst","It's -- there's a new chart in the back of the release, which we've recalibrated and frankly simplified our calculation of the wind resource, so we have reintroduced it. I just want to caution people that these new numbers are not comparable to the old numbers that we had. Off-line, we can talk all about the gory details of that. But the bottom line is that, in the first quarter, it was slightly below. I think it was like 97%.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, let me clarify my question. What was it in the second quarter of 2012?","Moray P. Dewhurst","The short answer is, I don't know on the current basis exactly because we haven't gone back and redone everything in history, but it was certainly below average. So there's no question that the average wind resource shifted around from the low long-term averages to above long-term averages.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 short questions. You talked about second half might be a little more challenging. Could you outline some of those challenges, and then just an update on where things are in Spain?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. On the second half -- I guess 2 points on the second half. First of all, the comment was meant to say that some of the things that have been good in the first half are just things that were good in the first half, and we have no necessary reason to believe that they're going to perpetuate into the second half. And then secondly and separately, there are some things that we see ahead in the second half, primarily for Energy Resources, that we expect to be a little more of a challenge. The main one, 2 principal ones, certain sort of timing matters on the O&M front, so I think we're just a little bit ahead of where we expect it to be in the first half. Some of that will reverse. But the bigger thing is the -- so far, at least, we haven't had much summer weather in Texas. So I think the opportunity is open for what we call asset optimization activities in the Texas portfolio again to be a little less than we would either expect for a normal year or relative to last year. And the second question on Spain, forgive me, I've talked to so many people about different developments in Spain and so many things have happened over the course of the past few months. So relative to where we were last quarter, the principal thing that has happened is the Spanish government has come out with yet another round of changes to the tariff regime for renewables. The current -- what they're talking about is a regime that in general terms would offer investors, at least as they've stated it, a set margin, pretax margin over Spanish government bond yields. However, there's a lot of details that need to be worked out before anybody could understand what that would actually mean for economics. As a practical matter, if it's as they stated it, a 300 basis point pretax spread over Spanish government bond yields, that clearly doesn't help project economics even compared with the confiscatory changes they had made before. So as a practical matter, we continue to believe that we are in the same situation, which is that our economic exposure is limited to the remaining equity contribution, which is not material now. And operationally, the plants are up and running very well. So a disappointing irony here is on the operation side doing better than we expected, but as a practical matter, economically there doesn't appear to be much future for us in it. So again, just to remind everybody, we have taken out from our financial expectations all earnings and cash flow contributions from the Spanish assets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the side of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I wanted to just -- and I'm sorry if I missed this, the Sabal pipeline and the gas pipeline, in terms of the earnings, how should we think of the -- is there any impact before it comes on? Yes, I know there's some variability in what you guys might actually invest. But is there any earnings before the pipeline actually comes online that like an AFUDC kind of thing that might happen, or can you just elaborate a little bit on that?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes. Both portions, both the upstream and the downstream portion would receive AFUDC accounting because they're both regulated pipelines, so it'll be a contribution that way. The Sabal Trail portion, the upstream portion, would be accounted for by us on the equity method, so we would just carry up a portion of whatever Spectra is recording there. But yes, there will be an earnings impact -- a cash earnings impact through the construction period. After that, after it goes into service, I think folks should recognize that the long-term economic prospects of the upstream portion look very good, but they are fundamentally tied to the continued growth and development of the state. Initially, the pipeline will not be fully subscribed, as you would expect. You clearly build these things with room for growth. And so the short-term economics will not be representative of the long-term economics. The reality is that FPL customers are getting a great deal in here, and the economics -- the long-term economics of the upstream portion of the pipeline are fundamentally dependent upon incremental volume and growth in the FPL volumes in future years. So we are obviously very optimistic about that, but that piece, the growth piece remains to be seen.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Sounds like a great project. Let me just ask you, in terms of the solar opportunities in Florida that Jim was mentioning, is there any legislation that's contemplated or needed? Or can you do it right now with what you have in place in Florida?","Moray P. Dewhurst","There's no guiding legislation either in place or currently contemplated, so that's the first part. As to the second part, could we do it right now? I think that the best way to answer that is to say not really. The reality is that the commission fundamentally is required to look at the lowest cost -- look at and approve the lowest cost resource part. Now they do have some flexibility within that to consider what may happen down the road. But I think at this stage, given -- particularly given all the other things we've got going on, it would be a little bit of a challenge to add that on top. So that's why in the prepared remarks, Jim made the comment. I think the realistic time to moving forward on that is probably 2015, 2016.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just in terms of the Yield Co. and all that stuff, it sounds like you guys are taking, obviously, very cautious approach in terms of anything you may do. Should we think of this as probably something that we probably won't hear anything before the end of the year, or -- I hate to put you on the spot on that, but I mean, just sort of in terms of timing and stuff, that sounds like it's going to be some time before you make a decision. Does that make sense? And also does the incremental, the tax equity stuff, does that have any impact on the any of this? The potential of you doing it, do you follow me?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Okay, let me hold the second part of that question. But first, on the timing, I can't say exactly end of year, but I think certainly several months is realistic. We'll certainly give you an update on where we are. I'm sure somebody will ask a question on the third quarter, so we'll certainly give you an update. But yes, I would certainly hope to be in a position to understand a lot more where we might want to be by the end of the year. We won't necessarily be in a position to execute even if we do have something that we ultimately want to execute. On the question, the tax equity transactions, in a sense, yes, there is an interaction here. And since it goes back to the fundamentals that we were talking about earlier, which is different investors' appetite for different combinations of current income and future cash flow growth and risk. In a sense, things like tax equity and project finance even are already examples for slightly different forms of vehicle that the Yield Co. represent. So you can sort of put them on a spectrum, if you like, with project finance being at one end of the spectrum, where you are carving off a discrete portion of the cash flow stream of, in this case, the renewable portfolio and packaging it in a particular way that's appealing to certain class of investors. Tax equity transactions do exactly the same thing. Now they don't do it quite the same way that the Yield Co. format does. It's a different combination of current income, cash flow growth and risk. But in my mind, you can place them all on a spectrum. So that's a long-winded way of saying yes, they are -- they do relate. And specifically, when you put these assets into a tax equity transaction, you are effectively precluding them from being in a Yield Co. vehicle in the short term. However, that's not a problem because the Yield Co. format is not well-adapted to accepting assets that are currently in their PTC earning phase. So as a practical matter, it doesn't have a great deal with interaction. But conceptually, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the side of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just first on the Florida pipeline, the intrastate piece. Would that have a more timely return relative to the interstate piece that you mentioned before? i.e. is it fully running from the get-go?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No. It will have a -- as I think about it, a slightly more favorable, because fundamentally, as I've said many times to many folks, FPL is the principal customer for the downstream portion, whereas the upstream portion has the potential to serve many other customers over time and it's that growth to serve the other volumes that ultimately should provide the economic leverage that will ensure that the lifetime returns of the upstream portion are attractive. So because the downstream portion is much more heavily likely to be dedicated to FPL, the profile is a little better. But it still has the same thing because what FPL required was a step-up, specified growth in volumes and options on future volumes. So obviously, everybody who competed for the downstream portion had to size the thing for the long term, and so the upfront returns will not be as strong as the lifetime returns.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And one other question, just back to the hot topic. Back 3 or 4 years ago, when we had the pure-play renewables storage, you never went through a process like this of evaluating options and the like. So this does seem to be somewhat different than then and seems to be more serious review than 3 or 4 years ago. So is that fair to read that there is more validity to either this structure or something like it than necessarily what you saw when we went through this with the pure-play renewables?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No. I don't think that's a total -- fair, Steve. We may not have been so transparent about it at the time, but we spent an awful lot of time back in 2006, 2007, on various structures at that time, so there was a great deal of work. The key thing then at that time was we could not get ourselves convinced that there really was a -- I'll call it a capital market mispricing opportunity. We thought that there was an unsustainable bubble, if you like. And our conclusion at that time -- again, this is now ancient history, but our conclusion at that time was it didn't justify going through all the distraction and the incremental costs of the establishment of the structure for something that wasn't going to allow us long term to access a different pool of capital. So it's the same fundamental reading we did spend a lot of time on. We may not have been as explicit as we have on this one.","Operator","Next, we will go to the side of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the pipeline, really more of a longer-term strategic question. How should we think about your decision to invest over $1.5 billion of capital into a pipeline? Is this the -- is this a one-off because of the opportunity into the FP&L service territory and into the state of Florida? Or is this more of a strategic move where you could see other incremental pipeline investments down the road, whether stand-alone or via joint ventures with other companies. That's the first part. The second is once the pipeline is online and in service, how do you think about the corporate structuring, meaning the potential for either other JVs or potential master limited partnership opportunities? We're now talking about a sizable investment in midstream assets. So just trying to think through how you're envisioning kind of the 5 to 10-year path?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, Michael, I think you're perhaps a little ahead of us here. A fundamental motivation here, this is a Florida project. We are interested in figuring out, as we always have been, how we continue to improve value delivery to our FPL customers here in Florida, and this, we think, is an absolutely critical project, it's a great project, as I said earlier, I think FPL customers are getting a great deal off this, and we want to make sure that we are a part of seeing that, that things happen. That's our fundamental motivation. We are certainly comfortable committing a large amount of capital to this project with these kinds of economics given the overall regulatory environment, but it's fundamentally about serving our FPL customers. Having said that, there is no question that assuming that we are successful in bringing this project to completion, it will provide us with other possibilities. And where that may take us, we're going to have to see. But all of that is off in the future. We're talking right now about -- just as a reminder, a pipeline is going to come into service in 2017 and there's a lot of work to be done to get it to that point, and obviously, the whole set of projects is subject to regulatory approval. So again, it's all about serving our customers in Florida better.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess just a quick follow-up. How do you -- how should investors think about the targeted return on capital for the new pipeline project, and will it differ much from the northern leg to the southern leg?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I'm not going to get into the numerical details because obviously, I think my remarks earlier should have suggested there's uncertainty about what certainly the short-term economics are going to be. I think the best way to think about this is you can look at other major pipeline projects across the country and get an idea of the range of economics that are reasonable. As I've said, the long-term economics here, particularly for the upstream portion, are based on continued growth in Florida and the need for natural gas transportation capacity by folks other than just FPL. So we are fundamentally making a positive statement about our belief in the long-term growth of Florida here.","Operator","Next, we will go to the side of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","My first question is about the dividend growth. Given that you have already locked about $5 billion of the additional CapEx, and that will require some additional equity funding, how should we think about growth in dividends? Is there an expectation that some of that growth -- significant pickup in dividends will be delayed because of additional CapEx?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, first of all, although it's perhaps an admission against interest, I can't -- I have to dispute your characterization as having things locked in. There are lots of steps that have to be gone through before any of these incremental projects are really in service, so including regulatory approvals for the development steps. So let's not get ahead of ourselves here. Having said that, on the dividend growth front, I'd just go back to what we, I believe, talked about in the March Investor Conference and certainly have talked about subsequently, which is the current target is 55% payout ratio in 2014. Where we go beyond that will clearly depend upon the CapEx profile, and where I'd characterized it before is to suggest that beyond '14, we will hope to see dividend growth at least in line with earnings growth. And by that, I mean that if we're at the higher end of the earnings growth, we will need all the cash flow and we will be in the market for incremental equity as we've discussed, and therefore, we'll probably more likely see dividend growth in line with EPS growth. If we were at the lower end of the CapEx range, then we would clearly have free cash flow available, and that might suggest increasing the payout ratio further, which obviously would imply dividend growth slightly higher than earnings growth. So I still think that framework for thinking about it is reasonable. If we were at the upper end of the CapEx range, the upper end of the EPS growth, then I think dividend growth in line with EPS growth is a reasonable expectation.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And completely separately on the new wind projects, we're seeing those prices of wind power in low $20s. Could you briefly talk through what actually offsets the reduction of pricing of electricity versus the returns that you can realize on those projects? I mean, is this that the net capacity factor went up so much? And if so, what is the average Mcf that you are realizing on those new projects? Or is it the cost of new build that has dropped significantly? Basically, I cannot somehow make the numbers work.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Sure. Well, the single biggest driver of the improvement in the economics of the wind projects has clearly been the increase in capacity factors. So to get a PPA in the $20 range and still yield acceptable returns, you have to be in a part of the country that has very strong wind resource and with modern technology turbines, you can expect to see capacity factors as high as 50%, where a decade ago in the same area, we might have been looking at 33%. So that change, when you run it through the numbers, is huge. Secondly, but much lower in importance, it is true that we've seen some relief on the cost side of the turbines, but that I think was more a function of a retreat from very high prices at a time when the turbine supply market was very tight. So I think that is more a cyclical thing. But the long term, the biggest single trend is improvement in technology and improving the capacity factors.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","But the cost of new build is roughly -- is it roughly $1,000 per kilowatt, or is it just slightly above that level?","Moray P. Dewhurst","No, I think if you look at the numbers that we've discussed in the script, I think the average we're looking at is about $1,700 a kW. Obviously, it varies depending upon where you are.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And you are still accepting similar levels of returns as you did a couple of years ago?","Moray P. Dewhurst","Yes, the -- over a long period of time, we really haven't seen we've been able to maintain decent, modest spreads over risk-adjusted cost of capital. So obviously, the overall cost of capital has come down over the course of last decade just because real interest rates have come down. But the spreads have been generally in the same kind of range.","I think we have time for one more.","Operator","Our last question will come from the side of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","My question goes to the reserve amortization and its impact on regulatory ROEs. My recollection was that you had the option to reverse about $400 million over the '13 to '16 time frame. Did I hear you correctly in saying that of that, $180 million would be left at year end '13?","Moray P. Dewhurst","That's correct.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, okay. Implying $220 million to be amortized in '13.","Moray P. Dewhurst","Correct, yes. We had always -- just the way that the dynamics of the business work, we have always been aware that 2013 was going to require a lot more surplus amortization to maintain a given level of ROE. In 2014, among other things, we have a significant pickup on the wholesale side, which we were obviously aware of, so that, that was baked into our thinking about the spread of the $400 million over the course of the period. So I just -- that may perhaps be worth emphasizing that with $180 million leftover at the end of this year, we still feel very comfortable based on where we see our cost structure going, that we are going to be able to maintain healthy ROEs for shareholders for the remainder of the rate agreement period out through 2016. So we feel good about where we are on that.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But basically, the ability to maintain, let's say, an 11% ROE is contingent on, one, the growth of the wholesale sales; and then two, your flat O&M cost forecast? Is that what I heard you just say, or...","Moray P. Dewhurst","Well, I think going forward, it's -- we -- clearly, not so much the wholesale growth because at least the piece I'm talking about is a contract that we've signed some years ago, so we know we're going to be on that. If you look at areas of uncertainty, it would be on retail growth, so customer growth and usage growth, for which our expectations are continued growth on the customer side in the 35,000 to 40,000 a year; and on the usage side of maybe a half to a little bit more percent per year; and then the cost control, which you referred to. So to the extent that there's uncertainty or risk about those 2 elements, and that's reflected in our thinking about where we can be over the course of the rate period. But again, as I said, we feel pretty good about it based on what we see right now.","Thank you, everybody.","Julie Holmes","Thank you.

Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance","Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid third quarter results driven by new investments at both FPL and Energy Resources.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 3%, or $0.05 per share, against the prior-year quarter. Along with our strong performance in the first and second quarters and excellent progress against our objectives for the full year, NextEra Energy is well-positioned to close out 2015 in the upper half of our $5.40 to $5.70 range of adjusted EPS expectations, subject to our usual caveats.","At Florida Power & Light, earnings per share increased $0.02 from the prior year comparable quarter. It was a warm summer season with above-normal weather-related usage, increasing both retail base revenues and our reserve amortization balance, while allowing us to continue to earn at the upper end of our approved ROE range. We remain focused on delivering customer value through best-in-class daily operations and execution against our initiatives to drive down costs, reduce fuel expenses, and improve reliability.","During the quarter, FPL filed to lower electric rates again by about $2.50 a month on average in 2016, compared with current rates. We are very pleased to be able to deliver award-winning customer service with monthly bills for a typical residential customer lower than $100, and lower than they were a decade ago. We continue to have an outstanding opportunity set ahead of us and all of our major capital projects are on track. At Energy Resources, our results were in line with our financial expectations for the quarter and Energy Resources is well-positioned to attain its full-year expectations.","Adjusted EPS at Energy Resources declined by $0.04 against the comparable prior-year quarter. The core Energy Resources story is unchanged as we continue to benefit from growth in our contracted renewables portfolio. In addition, our renewables origination results remain very strong. The team signed contracts for approximately 725 megawatts of new wind and solar projects since the last call, including approximately 600 megawatts of wind for 2016 delivery.","Based on everything we see now, we are on track to exceed the high end of our previously announced 2015 to 2016 wind-build range. We continue to believe that the fundamentals for the renewable business have never been stronger. NEP remains on track to meet its distribution per unit expectations of $1.23 on an annualized basis by year-end, subject to our usual caveats.","Since the last call, the financing and acquisitions of NET Midstream and the Jericho wind project were completed. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and CAFD, which did not include contributions from either of these acquisitions, were slightly below our expectations due to wind resource. Wind resource was 93% of the long-term average for the NEP portfolio, while the long-term average for the Energy Resources portfolio was slightly higher at 97% for the quarter.","The NEP board declared an increased quarterly distribution of $0.27 per common unit, or $1.08 per common unit on an annualized basis. Not only do we expect to deliver on our financial expectations for 2015, but we also are well-positioned against our 2016 financial plan. At FPL, we expect to earn in the upper half of the allowed ROE band and, as we have done this year, we expect continued strong execution against our capital deployment program for the benefit of Florida customers. For Energy Resources, we expect increased contributions from new renewables to drive adjusted earnings growth. Overall, we remain very comfortable with the 2016 adjusted EPS expectations we communicated in the second quarter earnings call.","Let me now take you through the details of our third quarter results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2015, FPL reported net income of $489 million, or $1.07 per share, up $0.02 per share year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by 7.8% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth. This rate of growth in regulatory capital employed was higher than comparable measures in the first and second quarters this year and we expect another increase in the fourth quarter. As we discussed in the last call, we continue to expect the bulk of this year's earnings growth for FPL to be in the fourth quarter.","Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended September 2015, and this remains our target for the full year. For 2016, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5%. As always, our expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period.","During the third quarter, due to higher retail based revenues driven by weather-related usage and customer growth, we reversed $115 million of reserve amortization. As part of the Cedar Bay settlement agreement with the Office of Public Counsel, we agreed to reduce the total available reserve amortization balance by $30 million, leaving us with an available reserve amortization balance of approximately $330 million at the end of the third quarter, which could be utilized in the remainder of 2015 and 2016.","We continue to execute on our overall customer value proposition by delivering clean energy, low bills, and high reliability for Florida customers. Each of our capital deployment initiatives to provide low-cost, clean energy continues to progress in accordance with our development plans. Our generation modernization project at Port Everglades is on schedule to come online in mid-2016 and remains on track to meet its budget. Development of our three new large-scale solar projects remains on schedule, with each of these roughly 74 megawatt projects expected to be completed in 2016. These projects, once complete, will roughly triple the solar capacity on our system and add to the overall fuel diversity of our fleet, which is important for FPL and its customers.","As a reminder, consistent with our focus on delivering cost-effective renewables for our customers, these projects reflect specific opportunities that take advantage of the remaining 30% ITC window, while leveraging existing infrastructure and prior development work. Aside from these specific projects, utility-scale solar, which is by far the most cost-efficient form of providing renewable energy in our service territory, particularly as compared to residential roof-top applications, is becoming more cost-effective across our entire service territory. We continue to expect that there will be additional opportunities for utility-scale solar on FPL's system by the end of the decade.","During the quarter, the Florida Public Service Commission issued its final order on its approval of modified natural gas reserve guidelines for up to $500 million per year in potential additional investments, which we continue to view as an important step in what we hope will be a larger program. The development team is actively evaluating new investment opportunities to lock in historically low natural gas prices for the benefit of Florida customers.","Also during the quarter, we closed on our acquisition of Cedar Bay, and filed a determination of need for the approximately 1600 megawatts, $1.2 billion Okeechobee Clean Energy Center to be placed into service in mid-2019.","FPL also continues to execute on its investments to improve reliability for Florida customers by upgrading its transmission and distribution network. We expect to invest approximately $3 billion to $4 billion in infrastructure improvements through 2018, with roughly $900 million of this amount being deployed this year. I am pleased to report that on a year-to-date basis, FPL has achieved its best-ever period of system reliability and is on track to deliver its best-ever reliability performance on a full-year basis.","Last week, FPL won multiple national awards, including being recognized as the most reliable electric utility in the nation. Looking ahead, in 2016 we expect to deploy approximately 28,000 smart grid devices across our system as we continue to execute on our program to further improve system reliability. All of these initiatives are focused on delivering superior customer value. Our residential bills are 30% below the national average, the lowest among reporting utilities in the state, and lower than bills paid by FPL customers 10 years ago. Overall, we are extremely pleased with the execution at FPL and our relentless focus to deliver low bills, high reliability, clean emissions, and excellent customer service.","The Florida economy continues to improve. The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in September was 5.2%, down 0.6 percentage points from a year ago and the lowest since early 2008. Over the same time period, Florida's job growth was 3%, a continuation of a five-year trend in positive job growth with close to 1 million jobs gained since the low in December 2009.","Along with the strong growth in jobs, retail activity has increased markedly since the trough in mid-2009, and July retail activity grew 8.6% since last year. At the same time, the September reading of Florida's consumer sentiment remained close to the pre-recession highs. With the Florida housing sector, the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 7.5% from the prior year, and mortgage delinquency rates continued to decline. As an indicator of new construction, new building permits remain at healthy levels.","Third quarter retail sales were up 2.6% from the prior-year comparable quarter, and we estimate that approximately 1.4% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. Our weather-related retail sales increased 1.2%, comprised of continued customer growth of approximately 1.6%, reflecting the growing population of our service territory, offset by a decline in weather-normalized usage per customer of approximately 0.4%.","This measurement reflects a residual from our estimation of the impact of weather. This is particularly challenging in periods with relatively strong weather comparisons such as we have had in the first three quarters of the year. However, based on the average of negative 0.3% for this reading over the last 12 months, we have reduced our outlook for weather-normalized usage per customer.","Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year, primarily reflecting the impact of efficiency and conservation programs. As we had discussed last quarter, we do not expect modest changes in usage per customer to have a material effect on our earnings. For this year and next, any effects of weather-normalized usage are expected to be offset by the utilization of our reserve amortization and, after the expiration of our current settlement agreement, will be taken into account in our regulatory planning.","The average number of inactive accounts in September declined 16% from the prior year and the 12-month average of low-usage customers fell to 7.8%, down from 8% in September of 2014. We remain encouraged by the positive economic trends in Florida and continue to expect above-average growth in our service territory.","Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $375 million, or $0.82 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $221 million, or $0.48 per share. Energy Resources' third quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.04 per share from last year's comparable quarter.","NextEra Energy benefited from continued growth in our contract to renewables' portfolio reflecting the addition of more than 1,900 megawatts of wind and solar projects during or after the third quarter of 2014, as well as positive contributions from the customer supply and trading business in the existing generation portfolio.","Wind resources were roughly 97% of the long-term average versus 95% in the third quarter of last year. Offsetting the positives, among other things, were higher interest expense due to growth in the business and higher corporate expenses due largely to timing differences and increased renewables development activity in light of what we consider to be a very positive landscape for the renewables business.","Results also were impacted by share dilution and lower state and federal tax incentives versus the prior-year comparable quarter. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA increased 9% and operating cash flow was strong. We continue to expect full-year cash flow from operations to grow 20% to 25% subject to our usual caveats.","As I mentioned earlier, the Energy Resources' development team had another very successful quarter of origination activity, adding approximately 725 megawatts to our contracted renewables backlog since the last call.","Let me spend a bit of time now on where each program stands. Since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 600 megawatts to our wind backlog, reflecting projects for 2016 delivery. Based on the strength of our wind development pipeline, we now expect to exceed the high end of our previously announced 2015 to 2016 wind-build range.","The origination of new solar projects has also been strong. The team signed a 125 megawatt power purchase agreement for another new solar project for post-2016 delivery since last quarter's call, demonstrating once again continued demand for solar projects even after the anticipated expiration of the 30% ITC support.","The accompanied slide updates information that we provided at our investor conference in March, showing our excellent progress against our objectives for the 2015 to 2016 development program. As we discussed last quarter, we are encouraged that the Senate Finance Committee passed the tax extenders package in July that includes a two-year extension of the production tax credit. Although this is just one step in the process, we are pleased with signs of bipartisan support for a potential extension. We expect to update our 2017 and 2018 wind-build estimates by our first quarter earnings call next year.","Overall, we believe that the strong fundamentals for the renewables business will continue to strengthen with continued equipment cost declines, improved efficiency advancements, a potential PTC extension, and the expected demand created by the EPA's new renewables targets under the clean power plan.","Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $99 million, and cash available for distribution was $15 million. These results were slightly below our expectations for the quarter, primarily due to weak wind resource, but the portfolio remains on track to achieve the distribution per unit expectations that we have shared for the fourth quarter distribution, payable in February.","Since the last call, NEP completed the financing and acquisitions of NET Midstream and the 149-megawatt Jericho Wind project. The NEP Board declared an increased quarterly distribution of $0.27 per common unit, or $1.08 per common unit on an annualized basis.","Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $879 million, or $1.93 per share. NextEra Energy's 2015 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $730 million and $1.60 per share, respectively, with adjusted EPS up 3% over the prior-year comparable quarter.","As we have discussed on the prior two quarterly calls, our earnings per share account for dilution associated with the settlement of our forward agreement of 6.6 million shares that occurred in December of 2014 and the June settlement of approximately 7.9 million shares associated with the equity units that were issued in May 2012.","In the third quarter, the settlement occurred for approximately 8.2 million shares associated with the forward contract component of the equity units that were issued in September 2012. The impact of dilution in the third quarter was approximately $0.05 per share.","Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment increased $0.07 per share compared to the third quarter of 2014, due to consolidating tax adjustments, earnings that are in pipeline and transmission business and other miscellaneous corporate items, none of which were individually notable. The development of both the Sabal Trail Transmission pipeline and the Florida Southeast Connection pipeline continue to progress well through their respective processes.","We continue to expect to be in a position to receive FERC approval in early 2016 to support commercial operation by mid-2017. The Mountain Valley pipeline project concluded the scoping process as part of the pre-filing procedure and filed its application with the FERC this month. The project also added Roanoke Gas as a shipper and its affiliate as an equity partner. Mountain Valley is an approximately 2 Bcf per day project with 20-year firm transportation agreements, providing NextEra Energy a capital investment of $1 billion to $1.3 billion. The project schedule continues to support commercial operations by year-end 2018.","We are very pleased with our progress so far this year at NextEra Energy. As we discussed on the last call, we are in a strong El Ni\u00f1o cycle that tends to be correlated with below average continental wind resource. And we also know that meteorological expectations are for the El Ni\u00f1o phase to potentially continue through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2016. Nonetheless, based on the overall strength and diversity of the NextEra Energy portfolio, we expect to end the year in the upper half of the $5.40 to $5.70 range of adjusted EPS expectations that we shared with you previously.","We continue to expect NextEra Energy's operating cash flow adjusted for the potential impacts of certain FPL clause recoveries and the Cedar Bay acquisition to grow by 10% to 15% in 2015.","For 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 and in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, implying a compound annual growth rate off a 2014 base of 6% to 8%. For the reasons I mentioned earlier, we feel particularly good about the opportunity set at both FPL and Energy Resources and are well positioned going into 2016.","We expect to grow our dividend per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018 off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.","Let me now turn to NEP. We continue to expect the NEP portfolio to grow to support a distribution and the annualized rate of $1.23 by the end of the year, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2016. After 2015, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats.","Our expectations for 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $440 million and CAFD of $100 million to $120 million are also unchanged, subject to our usual caveats. In addition, last month, we introduced run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD. The December 31, 2015, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $540 million to $580 million and CAFD of $190 million to $220 million reflect calendar year 2016 expectations for the portfolio at year-end December 31, 2015.","The December 31, 2016, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and CAFD of $210 million to $290 million reflect calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016. These expectations are subject to our normal caveats in our net of expected IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. It's been a very strong first three quarters. At both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners, we've executed well both financially and operationally, and we've had strong execution of our growth plans all across the board. At FPL, the team continues to make excellent progress against our core strategy of investing to further improve our customer value proposition.","FPL has typical residential bills 30% below the national average, one of the cleanest emission profiles in America, and was recently recognized as the most reliable electric utility in the nation. As we prepare to file a rate case at FPL in 2016, I've never felt better about the quality of FPL's customer value proposition.","Ultimately, as I've said before, our goal at FPL is nothing less than to be the cleanest, lowest-cost, and most reliable utility in the nation, and we're well on our way to achieving that.","At Energy Resources, we've made terrific progress against our core strategy of being the world's largest generator of wind and solar energy. The fundamentals of the renewable business have never been stronger and Energy Resources continues to build what I believe is the largest and highest-quality renewables development pipeline in the space.","John mentioned that Energy Resources now expects to exceed the high end of its range for 2015 to 2016 U.S. wind development that we shared with you in March. Based on the future demand we expect from the EPA's Clean Power Plan and the potential extension of the PTC, we now see opportunities to increase even further the scale of our wind and solar development capabilities in order to seize an even larger share of the growing North American renewable market. We are significantly increasing our internal resource commitment to renewables development and we expect to as much as double the development resources committed to these activities over the next few years.","I'm also very pleased with our natural gas pipeline and competitive transmission development efforts. Total expected capital deployment in our pipeline business, including pipelines underdevelopment and recent acquisitions, is now approaching $5 billion.","In our competitive transmission business, we expect to invest more than $1 billion by the end of the decade. Although competition is fierce for both of these businesses, customers value our development capabilities, our engineering construction expertise, and our stakeholder relationships across North America.","As with renewable energy, we expect the markets for new pipelines and new transmission will continue to grow, driven in part by the emissions targets under the Clean Power Plan. As with renewable energy, we believe NextEra Energy is well-positioned to capitalize on these new opportunities.","Across the board, NextEra Energy is ahead of the goals we shared with you in March. Our announcement last quarter of increased earnings per share and dividends per share expectations for NextEra Energy was a reflection of this performance and we're well-positioned to achieve these expectations.","Notwithstanding recent volatility in capital markets, we continue to have confidence that the yieldco model can work and work well for a partnership like NEP that has the right structure and the support of a world class sponsor like Energy Resources, giving it access to the largest and strongest portfolio of potential future acquisition opportunities.","While we need to position ourselves to work through a period of potential uncertainty and settling out, which we have done with our modified 2015 financing plan now successfully executed, in the long run, we think the capital markets' reevaluation of the yieldco space can play to our competitive advantage both at NEP and at Energy Resources. Times of challenge are often also times of opportunity.","I continue to believe that the NEP value proposition is the best in the space. NEP offers investors average annual growth expectations and LP unit distributions of 12% to 15% through the end of the decade. NEP's existing cash flows are backed by long-term contracts, which at the end of the third quarter, had an average contract life of approximately 19 years and strong counterparty credits.","NEP also has a portfolio that is largely insulated from commodity risk and a well-aligned incentive structure, with the sponsor owning incentive distribution rights in a significant limited partnership position in the vehicle.","We're also pursuing several options to minimize NEP's need for significant amounts of public equity through 2016 to ensure that we have plenty of time for markets to settle down. We continue to evaluate the optimal capital structure for NEP as it has some additional debt capacity that can help finance future transactions, being mindful, of course, that we don't want to over-lever the vehicle. And, of course, in the long run, in order for NEP to serve its intended purpose, we need to be able to access the equity markets at reasonable prices.","We plan to issue a modest amount of NEP public equity to finance the growth included in our December 31, 2016, annual run rate. However, we will be smart, flexible, and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets. And to that end, I'm pleased to announce that the board of directors of our general partner has approved putting in place an up to $150 million at-the-market equity issuance or dribble program. At the same time, NextEra Energy has also authorized a program to purchase from time to time, based on market conditions and other considerations, up to $150 million of NEP's outstanding common units.","The ATM program gives the partnership the flexibility to issue new units when the price supports new unit issuance, while the unit purchase program gives NextEra Energy the ability to demonstrate its commitment to the partnership by purchasing units at times when they're undervalued. We will be patient with NEP and have taken the necessary steps to provide plenty of time for recovery of the equity markets. We remain optimistic that the NEP financing model can and will work going forward.","In summary, I am as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. FPL, Energy Resources, and NEP all have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board and we continue to execute well against all of our strategic and growth initiatives. FPL continues to have an excellent story with a growing service territory and a strong customer value offering, while Energy Resources is strategically positioned to capitalize on what is expected to be one of the best environments for renewables development in recent memory. Overall, we are well-positioned to leverage these great businesses to continue to build growth platforms to drive our growth in the future.","With that, we'll now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Dan Eggers. Your line is open.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, good morning, guys. I guess just kind of the first question, Jim, following up on a couple of things you made comments on today \u2013 the doubling of development resources into renewables is a lot given where your baseline is already. Are you talking about operating expenses to try and find more projects or are you thinking about the idea of actually doubling the amount of renewables you're doing on an annual basis?","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Dan, we would expect that for an increase in development expenses that we would get a pro-rata increase in the amount of megawatts that we will be able to develop. And so I said, up to double; we're going to be obviously smart and opportunistic about it. I think all of the things that we've said about the renewable markets \u2013 the economics are getting better; the Clean Power Plan is coming; there continues to be good federal support and the potential extension of the wind production tax credit.","And, frankly, the chaos in the yieldco space creates an opportunity for us, with some of our competitors not being as well-positioned as they were four months ago, for us to be able to continue to gain share in a market \u2013 you know, last year, we gained share in the wind business. We were the number one player \u2013 we've been the number one player for many, many years, and last year we gained share. And that's \u2013 my goal for the team is to continue to build to gain share and to build profitable projects that make sense for our shareholders and for our customers.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So I guess maybe extending that conversation, when you talk about the targets for NEP's CAFD run rate for next year, does the $150 million dribble equity, is that enough to get you within that band or is there an assumption that NEE is going to put more equity capital into NEP to help get into that guidance range?","John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance","Dan, this is John. We need a minimal amount of equity for NEP next year. Obviously, the ATM dribble program would be a good start to be able to build on an equity position heading into what our growth plans are for next year. But we have a lot of levers around NEP as well. You've seen the guidance, so we have some flexibility around the capital structure. But the ATM program would allow us to get off to a start on what we see as a minimal equity need for NEP next year.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And you guys feel good about hitting the increased growth rates from last year, even if NEP's at the lower end of their growth range or the equity capital markets are still stayed tight for them?","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We do.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Byrd. Your line is open.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to at a high level talk about usage of your balance sheet. You've positioned the company with quite strong credit stats and at the high end of the range for many of your ratings targets. When you think about opportunities to deploy that balance sheet at the corporate level, we saw just very recently a big utility buy a small LDC, so there are corporate opportunities versus M&A for assets versus more organic growth, and obviously it sounds like you're very bullish on more organic growth at Resources. But at a high level, when you think about all of the opportunities for deploying your balance sheet, what do you think is likely to create the most economic value for shareholders?","John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance","Well, one, there have been a couple of deals that have gone off at pretty high multiples, and leverage has been used to finance those transactions. From our standpoint, having a strong balance sheet is key to reaching our growth objectives and we have no intention of compromising our current credit metrics. That being said, there are opportunities perhaps to optimize our existing balance sheet, and so we always look at particularly projects that may not have debt financing on them and other opportunities within the portfolio where we could optimize our current position without compromising our credit metrics.","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So Steven, this is Jim, just to add to what John said. I think to use your balance sheet to lever up to acquire assets at massive premiums and transfer much of the value from that leveraging up over to someone else's shareholders, I have a hard time \u2013 I scratch my head, honestly, and I have a hard time understanding how that makes sense for the acquirer's shareholders. And so, that's not something that we would be running up and down, jumping up and down, in terms of trying to do something like that.","The other thing from an acquisition standpoint, that I would say, just overall from an M&A standpoint, I would say is we have great organic growth prospects. I feel really good about our organic growth prospects. We do not have to do anything other than execute on our organic growth prospects to deliver the expectations that we've laid out to you here, and anything that we would ever do on M&A would have to be accretive to what we're telling you in terms of our expectations going forward.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very much understood. That's very, very helpful. When you think about wind growth potential, obviously, we may not know the PTC outcome till very late in the year. In your dialogue with states and utilities that may go out and procure more wind, how should we likely see this unfold? Is this likely to involve very quick action by states and utilities to start to \u2013 I'm assuming that the PTC does get extended \u2013 do you think it's going to be a fairly rapid movement by states to try to take advantage of the PTC, just given that it's always uncertain how long subsidies do last, or do you think it's more of a gradual evolution throughout 2016 and 2017? How should we think about how this might actually unfold?","Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC","Stephen, it's Armando. I think the first thing, let me just talk about what we're seeing right now. What we're seeing right now is really a significant amount of interest in the wind space to get projects signed up for next year. Some of the customers that we're signing up are very clearly telling us that they don't necessarily know where the Clean Power Plan is going to end up, but they are taking steps today in order to address what they see as potential issues that they have under the Clean Power Plan. Others are telling us that, look, we would like to take advantage now while the PTC is here because with the PTC the prices that are being offered in the market are very economic to us on a very long-term basis.","When we are having discussions with customers about 2017 and 2018, there is obviously some concern as to whether the production tax credit gets extended or not in the near term. But what's encouraging is that, once you kind of get past that, it looks like that wind has a lot of opportunities, I would say, through 2020 at least, whether it's early action credits under the Clean Power Plan or whether it's, with or without PTCs, what customers are seeing as a trend to go more renewables is very positive for us. So I'd say where we sit on wind 2017 and 2018, I would expect on a combined basis to be pretty good for us.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So let me actually start by following up on the last question a little bit. When it comes to CPP, I'd be curious, you have this dynamic around 2020 to 2021 of early action. To what extent is that creating kind of another boom\/bust in the cycle? Obviously, you got a PTC extension here, but are folks holding off to get projects qualifying for their early action program?","Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC","Yeah, Julien, it's Armando again. Just to follow up on what I said before, in the near-term here there is obviously some discussion with our customers about the Clean Power Plan, and they're taking advantage because they don't know whether the Clean Power Plan is going to work out, but they see that it's a huge benefit while there is a production tax credit to sign up cheaper wind.","The 2017 and 2018 discussions that we've been having on wind \u2013 a lot of folks are obviously concerned about whether there's going to a production tax credit or not, but in my view, whether there is a production tax credit or not, the combined 2017 and 2018 years I think will be pretty good for us.","If there is no production tax credit, my expectation would be that the amount of wind that you see get built in 2017 would be below what we would otherwise have seen and what we have seen in the last couple of years, but I think that's only a temporary blip before 2018 starts coming back.","The economics for wind and, honestly, the economics for solar from the customer standpoint are very attractive today with the PTC and with the ITC for solar. They're very attractive without the 30% ITC when you get out to the 2018, 2019 timeframe, and we believe that for wind, they will be very attractive, even without the PTC by the end of the decade.","So customers are aware of that. There is obviously some uncertainty about the Clean Power Plan, but I think that uncertainty is actually playing in our favor. People want to take action early.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Two further quick clarifications. Your credit expectations here for S&P and Moody's, what are your expectations for financing in 2016 here? You obviously are well within the range on both. Just to be very clear about this?","John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance","Yeah, Julien for financing activity in 2016, we continue to evaluate where we are from a CapEx standpoint. We still have another quarter of wind origination to go. We've had strong cash flow growth as well. We've got some other levers within the portfolio that we're looking at, a couple of balance sheet optimization opportunities. Kind of a long way of saying that we're still working on framing up exactly what that's going to look like. But....","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Perhaps to be more specific, the projections of 26%, for instance, for SMP, that does not contemplate incremental equity, or just I know it's a moving target given the size of the CapEx budget, but...","John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance","Yeah. We don't know yet. There are factors at play, again, having the strong quarter of origination on wind at 725 megawatts, looking to see how we come in on the fourth quarter, looking to see how we finish up from a cash flow perspective, and then looking at 2016, what the CapEx need might be and then looking at the other levers within the existing portfolio and some of the optimization things that are on our list. Obviously, the goal is to keep any equity issuance down as low as possible if we have to do something.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","And last quick one. Where do you stand on merchant divestment, specifically Texas. Just curious what your thoughts are broadly about it because you seem to have commodity sensitivity, be it from wind projects or combined cycles in Texas.","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so Julien, I'll start out with the general comment that you guys will ho-hum to. But I mean it's true. I mean we look at that portfolio, our entire merchant portfolio every year and try to determine whether it still makes sense for us from a shareholder perspective to retain those merchant assets based on our view, which is not necessarily the market view, based on our view of what we think those markets are.","We're going through a process in Texas on Lamar and Forney. I warn folks all the time, we've gone through processes before on our merchant assets. And that doesn't necessarily mean at the end of the day that we divest those assets. We sometimes go through the process and we retain those assets, but we believe that there may be folks that are very interested in those assets; they've been great assets for us. We believe that there might be a shareholder base or other bases out there that believe those assets are worth more to them than they would be to our shareholders.","So we're going to take it, look at that very seriously here over the next couple of months. And if we decide that it make sense, then we will likely make the decision to divest. But those should not be the \u2013 I know there has been a focus on those assets; those should not be the only assets that investors and analysts believe that we're looking at. I mean, we look at all of our assets every year, and determine whether it makes sense for us to continue to hold them. Those are just, honestly, the ones that are public at this point.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Fleishman. Your line is open.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. Just on the \u2013 curious kind of the latest updates on the gas reserve additions in Florida and just with the environment continuing to maybe get more attractive to buy reserves, how you're thinking about that potential?","Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company","Yeah. Hi Steve, this is Eric Silagy. So we are \u2013 you know, with gas prices coming down, we'll see how the market plays out, but we think there's going to be opportunities. We're going to be very judicious in how we approach this and making sure that we're locking in long-term positive deals for customers. So we have a program that's underway right now at \u2013 in one play in Oklahoma and that's going well. And we've got origination teams that are talking to multiple counterparties on opportunities. So I think we'll see how everything plays out in the market from a gas perspective, but right now we see this as presenting actually some potential opportunities.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, separate question. Just on NEP, maybe, Jim, is there any way to give some color on your intentions with this buyback in terms of just, you know, is this something where you'd want to be in right now doing; is this something that's kind of there if there's another kind of attack on yieldco, so to speak, or just how should we think about the buyback?","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I think I probably should limit what I said to what I said in my remarks, Steve, but I am certainly not going to lay out prices at which we're buying or the prices at which we're interested in doing the ATM. You know that's \u2013 part of the thinking behind this is to give us the flexibility to issue units when we think the price supports new issuance and the buyback gives us the opportunity to show our commitment to the partnership by buying units when we think they're undervalued, and...","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's as simple as that, honestly.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","So it's kind of a buy low, sell high \u2013 kind of a new concept. Okay. Makes sense.","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You said it, not me, Steve.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And then, lastly, just could you maybe give us any color or latest thoughts on the Hawaiian Electric deal?","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So we continue to work hard to get the final hurdle, which is state regulatory approval in Hawaii. We have recently gotten a couple intervenors to either fall away or announce their support, and I was very pleased that the IBEW announced their support for the transaction last week. And we continue to work it. I think my expectation, based on timing right now, is that we're not going to get any kind of decision from the PSC until next year, and so we're going to continue to work it and continue to talk to the parties to try to get it across the finish line.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon. Your line is open.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","One of the drivers you discussed on the reduction in years earnings was a drop-off of state tax incentives. How does that unfold over the next several quarters? And was that just a concentration risk of your adding some assets in a particular region?","John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance","Yeah. A couple things there, Paul. One was just pushing part of a CITC project out into the next year. And then the second was, when you look back at our Q3 results for 2014, I think we had about 500 megawatts of projects that we had built in Oklahoma. Only had about 100 megawatts this quarter, and so, you know, Oklahoma has that state ITC, so it was really a combination of those two factors.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then at FP&L, it looks as though we're actually seeing some modest demand destruction. As you think about your rate case, I mean, decoupling \u2013 is that on the table? Or maybe an annual look for a true-up, and how are you thinking about that strategically?","Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company","Yeah, Paul, this is Eric Silagy. No, we're not looking at any decoupling. Again, I think you go look overall at both our performance as well as the fact that the state continues to grow, we feel very good about our prospects going forward.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Is that something you'll try to put into your regulatory strategy?","Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company","How we look at moving forward \u2013 our base \u2013 our rates are set on a projection of test year. And so, it will take into account that we have strong customer growth coming in as well as more modest growth from the standpoint of usage or potentially negative usage. So both of those factors get factored into looking at what our revenue requirements are.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then lastly, there was a large swing at corporate \u2013 was that just a timing issue or could you delve a little bit deeper into what drove that?","John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance","Yeah. Some of that, as we mentioned in \u2013 or I mentioned in the script was the consolidating tax adjustment, and with PMI or the customer supply and trading business having a good year, the apportionment factors that are used by many states are revenue based, and so that can kind of skew results in the more favorable tax jurisdictions, and that's really one of the main drivers there.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So none of these is a marked shift, and look for improvement going forward?","John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance","That's something that's really dependent on the business mix and kind of where our revenues are coming from, what states. So it's not something you can necessarily count on quarter to quarter.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you for your help.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold. Your line is open.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Quick one. So, Jim, you mentioned a couple of times, I think you called it chaos in the yieldco space, and I think you stressed that you see that helping you from a competitive positioning standpoint in the development business. My question, I guess is, do you see some M&A opportunities falling out of that situation? Or is that really less your focus here; it's more about winning new projects yourself?","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Jonathan, we have always felt that organic development creates more value than project acquisitions do or, frankly, even overall company acquisitions unless it's a pretty unique situation. So our focus is going to be on organic growth.","We have always had project acquisitions as a part of our mix, and we will continue \u2013 I do think there will be some opportunities here. I think there's a real question about whether folks are going to realize that when they're selling projects that they're not going to get the same kind of value that they perhaps would have gotten four months ago, and there is also \u2013 we're very picky about the quality of the project, when we're looking at it from a project acquisition standpoint. So I would expect there to be more opportunities there than there would have been a few months ago, but, honestly, our focus is really on \u2013 and I think the most high-value added opportunity for our shareholders is to be focused on growing our organic capabilities.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","It sounds like priorities are organic, then possibly projects and last on the list sort of whole portfolio company type things?","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's a fair prioritization, Jon.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then just one other thing on Canadian Wind; anything to report on the recent Ontario RFP? And if you \u2013 what are your \u2013 line of sight on some success there, and when would we hear about it in the backlog?","Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC","Jonathan, it's Armando. I think the first \u2013 realistically, the first that we would hear about it would be very late this year. I \u2013 and that's the very earliest. My expectations are actually that we would hear some time first quarter of next year. We feel good about the bids that we put in. I always want to put things in context, though, right, I mean Canada or Ontario was looking for, roughly, I think it's 500 megawatts or 600 megawatts in total of renewables, right. So I mean we wouldn't think that it \u2013 nobody should think it's a 5,000-megawatt bid or something. I mean it's still reasonable; it's still chunky, but it was 500 megawatts. We have several projects that we think are very competitive in the process the way it's laid out. And so we're hopeful that we're going to get some of that 500 megawatts or 600 megawatts.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Armando.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lapides. Your line is open.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey Jim, coming back to M&A a little bit, but maybe a different angle. How are you looking at \u2013 you've grown your midstream business, meaning you've got Mountain Valley and Sabal Trail in the development process. You did the NET Midstream deal down at NEP. How has the share price reaction in the midstream market and valuations for privately held midstream assets \u2013 how has that impacted the opportunity set that may be available for either NEE or NEP to add via M&A more midstream, and how do you think about how you would structure that, whether you would want it up at the NEE level or down at the NEP level?","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Michael I think, when I think about what we're doing in the pipeline space, it's really focused on very long-term contracted pipeline assets. And things that we think look a lot like our renewable business in terms of the quality of the counterparty, the consistency of the cash flows, and the ability for us to deploy our development expertise against those things. And so we have no interest in adding any midstream assets that would have any kind of commodity risk to the portfolio. We would be focused, again, first and foremost on organic development of long-term contracted pipeline opportunities, and that's really what the team is focused on.","I think the NET deal was a very unique deal in that it was a very long-term contracted set of assets. There are very few of those, really, out in the marketplace. If there was one that will become available, we would look at it. And I think, honestly, it would depend on the capital markets and where we think the most efficient financing would be, where we would put it, whether we would put it at NEE or NEP, but just again, our focus there in the pipeline space is first and foremost on organic development.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, Jim. Much appreciated.","Operator","Our next question is with Brian Chin. Your line is open.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance","Good morning, Brian.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I think when you guys talked about others using the balance sheets and levering up to buy other companies and then you put that in the context of buying shares of NEP and continuing to execute on your wind resources, and your regulated opportunities, I mean you guys have made a pretty strong and consistent statement about where you think your capital deployment ought to be. I guess within that context, what I'm curious about is how close are you with regards to looking at NEP versus, say, NextEra shares as a good place to deploy capital and execute on buybacks.","Can you give us a little bit of color of how you frame it and are the two relatively close in your opinion? I mean, obviously, you think NEP is the more interesting place at the moment. But can you give us a sense of how you frame that discussion and under what conditions you might consider deploying capital towards NEE buybacks as opposed to NEP?","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I said this last month, I think, Brian that I \u2013 relative to NEE, I think NEP is extremely undervalued right now. So...","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Any...","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think our announcements today are pretty consistent with that.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I agree. But just any sense of color as to how you frame it, Jim, that would be great?","James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We look at a variety of metrics and kind of the classic metrics. And we think about it in terms of \u2013 fundamentally in terms of future cash flows.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners 2015 third quarter earnings conference call. You may all now disconnect your lines. Thank you, and everyone have a great day."]}}
